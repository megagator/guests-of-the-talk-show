[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  Serenity Caldwell, welcome to the show. Welcome back to the show. Good to see you last week.
[00:04.400 --> 00:08.320]  Good to see you too. It's always fun to see people in person after
[00:08.320 --> 00:11.040]  talking to them on the internet for six months at a time.
[00:11.040 --> 00:18.160]  Totally true. I feel like we have like a thousand things to talk about. Right?
[00:18.880 --> 00:22.640]  Yeah, I mean, there are only a few things that happened last week. So you know,
[00:23.200 --> 00:26.800]  it wasn't really last week. It feels like a month ago.
[00:26.800 --> 00:31.360]  All right. So you were there. I was there. And everybody, you know, it's, you know,
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.680]  it's how you make small talk. You're like, Hey, what'd you think of the keynote?
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.960]  And most people were like, Hey, that was great. And, and there are, I ran into like,
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.680]  I would say like 20% of the people I ran into were like, it was, I give it like a B minus.
[00:43.680 --> 00:49.280]  And I'm like, what the hell are you thinking? Yeah, I don't get that. I don't understand
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.720]  how you could, I don't get it. No, no, I'm, I'm in complete agreement with you. I mean,
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.200]  we were sitting next to each other at the keynote and I'm pretty sure on multiple occasions,
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.440]  either I turned to you or you turned to me and it just, it felt overwhelming. It felt like a
[01:05.440 --> 01:11.920]  tidal wave of all of these things to the point where like, I couldn't recover. It took me 48
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.840]  hours to be in a normal state of mind because I just felt like we were constantly being
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.360]  overwashed with, Oh, and we've been working on AR. Oh, and we've been working on VR. Oh,
[01:21.360 --> 01:27.120]  and there's a new iMac pro. Oh, and of course new operating systems. Oh, and your iPad. Here's a new
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.920]  iPad. Oh, and promotion. None of you are going to know what that means, but you're going to like it.
[01:31.920 --> 01:36.560]  It's just, I don't understand how you... Here's a totally new multitasking interface for iPad pro
[01:36.560 --> 01:44.400]  users. Here are brand new MacBook pros, a new MacBook. Here's brand new iMacs. Like you said,
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.880]  here's the upcoming iMac pro. And then in addition to all these things, which are like actual
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.480]  products that you can either like buy right now today, or you will be able to buy later this year,
[01:56.480 --> 02:04.240]  then they were like, here's our AR kit. I really don't. I mean, and I understand that maybe,
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.800]  you know, people have like a pet feature or thing that maybe didn't get addressed, but you have to
[02:10.800 --> 02:16.080]  to me, you have to admit that like, that was a pretty good keynote. And even if it didn't get
[02:16.080 --> 02:22.960]  your pet feature or product, it's like, you have to admit they knocked down a lot of pins in the
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.600]  bowling alley on that keynote. They absolutely did. And I mean, I don't understand how they're
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.760]  how at least one of your pet features did not get answered during that keynote because there were so
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.920]  many little fixes. Like drag and drop is a big I'm like, how is drag and drop not on everybody's
[02:41.920 --> 02:47.760]  list, at least in some minor form or automatic translation on Siri? That's something I've been
[02:47.760 --> 02:55.040]  wanting it to do for, I don't know, four years. God, the fact that drag and drop also fixes the
[02:55.040 --> 03:02.960]  home screen issue. So you can move multiple icons at once or yeah, there's just it. I often stammer
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.720]  when people are like, what was your favorite new feature? What was your like, I haven't even
[03:06.720 --> 03:11.920]  gotten to make my like little features that I liked that you didn't hear about. Because quite
[03:11.920 --> 03:18.400]  honestly, there are so many that it feels God, it's just like every time I try and think of them,
[03:18.400 --> 03:21.520]  I get I think of seven at once and then my brain just shuts down.
[03:23.280 --> 03:30.240]  I said this during the live show with Craig and Phil. And I apologize that you've got
[03:30.240 --> 03:36.160]  a you're following up on Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller. It's either the best or worst
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.440]  slot of the year on the talk show. But I said this and I did say this, but I'll say it again,
[03:41.440 --> 03:49.840]  because you'll you I know you can back me up on this is that it's just sort of a trope in the
[03:49.840 --> 03:56.640]  press area, where when those catch all slides go up, you know, like, oh, and here's the 29 things
[03:56.640 --> 04:03.760]  that are new in Mac OS that we didn't get to talk about here. The way it goes in the keynote is
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.240]  slowly but surely everybody in the press area sort of raises their phone or their standalone camera,
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.400]  and they quick snap a photo of that slide. And they're like, well, I'll take a look at that
[04:12.400 --> 04:17.600]  after the keynote over and and look to see if there's anything really interesting that just
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.400]  sort of snuck into that slide. And over and over and over again, in that keynote, they'd put that
[04:22.400 --> 04:27.680]  slide up the catch all slide. And by the time people got their cameras up, it was gone. And
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.840]  everybody's like, Oh, my God, did you get a picture? It went so fast. It went so fast.
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.560]  Here's a fun thing. There are something like 75 features on that slide. And they're not like
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.320]  little things like there. I mean, there are a couple little things, right? Like flashlight
[04:44.320 --> 04:50.240]  support for iPad Pro is probably a little thing. But they also have like these big giant features
[04:50.240 --> 04:56.160]  that they just kind of snuck in there like type to Siri, which is currently an accessibility feature.
[04:56.160 --> 05:01.600]  But I know quite a few people who have been like, man, you know, Siri would be really nice if I
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.640]  could just type to it the same way that I typed to Google Assistant. And guess what? In iOS 11,
[05:06.640 --> 05:13.840]  that's going to be there. The fact that they completely redid iCloud, not only iCloud family
[05:13.840 --> 05:19.840]  plans, which were a big pain point for a lot of people. But file sharing is now going to be a
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.240]  thing in iOS 11 and file sharing with what it looks like. And again, it's still a beta. So
[05:24.240 --> 05:28.800]  obviously, things can change. But based on Apple's documentation, it looks like it's going to be
[05:28.800 --> 05:34.720]  almost as full featured as Dropbox, where you can just drop people links, and not just from Apple
[05:34.720 --> 05:40.160]  apps, but for anything for a photo or a video or a document. And you might even be able to use
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.760]  collaboration if the apps support it. And again, not just Apple apps, but like, we could be getting
[05:45.760 --> 05:50.320]  to a point where you can collaborate on like a procreate document, and it's not there yet. But
[05:51.200 --> 05:55.040]  the screenshot markup thing, which I guess most people aren't really going to care about,
[05:55.040 --> 05:59.520]  but like you and me, and on quite a few other people, I think pretty much any writer on the
[05:59.520 --> 06:04.160]  face of this earth that writes about technology, marking up screenshots is a is a pretty big deal.
[06:04.880 --> 06:11.120]  I, you know what, that's one of my very favorite features that they've added, because some of
[06:11.120 --> 06:18.160]  these are like ones that are like, hey, when are we going to be able to have like Dropbox integration
[06:18.160 --> 06:25.680]  at a system level, right? So that's what the files app does. And there is a to, you know,
[06:25.680 --> 06:31.760]  belabor the term, finally, right? It's like, we have every everybody who's who, who uses
[06:31.760 --> 06:38.320]  Dropbox or has like a team based system that uses Dropbox has been sort of hoping for this
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.800]  every single year. And so there's a finally aspect to that. The screenshot thing, though,
[06:42.800 --> 06:48.960]  to me is one of my favorite features, because it's like the way screenshots worked up until
[06:48.960 --> 06:53.680]  iOS 11. It's not like anybody was really complaining about it. It's like, okay, you hit
[06:53.680 --> 06:58.720]  these two buttons, and you get a, you get an image of the screen in your photo roll, and then
[06:58.720 --> 07:05.360]  you can do what you want to with it. But the way that this works is, it's really fantastic. And
[07:05.360 --> 07:11.040]  it's very, very obvious that internally to Apple, they obviously take a lot of screenshots for like
[07:11.040 --> 07:21.520]  bug reports, or, you know, UI type things. And it's so great. It's, it's super, I don't know,
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.400]  it's like nothing that people were asking for. But it's obviously very, very thoughtful.
[07:26.400 --> 07:31.040]  It reminds me of speaking of Craig and Phil, what Craig and Phil were talking about with
[07:31.040 --> 07:36.400]  High Sierra and the focus on, you know, oh, we need to, you know, we need to, we need to release
[07:36.400 --> 07:40.480]  something that's not just about snazzy new features, but also that makes the operating system
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.840]  better. And there's a lot of that stuff in iOS 11, too, where they're just these a lot of little
[07:45.840 --> 07:52.400]  tiny, very smart changes that maybe people weren't clamoring for. But it was always like a back of
[07:52.400 --> 07:57.280]  your mind sort of thing, right? The fact that here's a, here's a good one that I haven't really
[07:57.280 --> 08:03.360]  seen a lot of people pick up on yet. Portrait mode is better, which is, you know, obviously a good
[08:03.360 --> 08:07.440]  thing. It's been in beta for the last year. And obviously, it would get better software wise as
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.960]  Apple figured that out. But in addition to that, the way that they've made portrait mode better
[08:12.960 --> 08:19.760]  with the depth map API is really smart, in that not only can third party apps now take advantage
[08:19.760 --> 08:24.800]  of depth data, and use it not just to, you know, blur out the backgrounds of their images, but they
[08:24.800 --> 08:30.160]  can use it to color isolate and do other really, really smart and interesting things. But portrait
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.000]  mode now because of that API, and because of the new image codec, which by the way, is a whole
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.120]  nother cool thing that just kind of popped out of nowhere. With the image codec, portrait mode is no
[08:41.120 --> 08:45.600]  longer, there's no longer the option where you like you either have to save the portrait mode
[08:45.600 --> 08:52.000]  photo, or you have to save the no portrait mode photo. It's just one photo with metadata. And so
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.960]  you can toggle it on or off at will. So you can have the portrait mode photo or you cannot have
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.480]  the portrait mode photo. And what that tells me is not only you know, do they have that, but it
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.920]  looks like they might be building in implementation. So in the future, you might be able to alter
[09:07.920 --> 09:15.520]  portrait mode photos. You know, what was the was it the luma kit, not the the luma luma, the the
[09:15.520 --> 09:21.200]  camera that allowed you to Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, that that camera that has vanished from my
[09:21.200 --> 09:25.680]  brain because it's no longer important. Well, apparently, it looks like you might be able to do,
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.920]  you know, something like that with portrait mode photos change what's in focus and change how the
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.240]  how the things look. And again, that stuff that's not there yet. But all of these sort of baseline
[09:36.240 --> 09:42.640]  features have been built that it really, it gets me really excited for the future of iOS in a way
[09:42.640 --> 09:48.880]  that I have not been excited in quite a long time. It shows me that they're thinking not just, you
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.720]  know, what's the next feature that we have to do in six months? But what is our operating system
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.560]  and our feature set going to look like five years down the road? What are our photos going to look
[09:58.560 --> 10:00.720]  like five years down the road? It's really exciting.
[10:01.440 --> 10:08.080]  Yeah, very much so. For anybody who isn't as reckless as we are and already has the iOS 11
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.560]  beta. But what happens when you take a screenshot on iOS 11 is it as soon as you take the screenshot,
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.040]  instead of like going back to where you are, you get like a little floating thing in the lower left
[10:19.040 --> 10:27.760]  corner. That is the screenshot. And it's sort of like a temporary doc type thing. And you can tap
[10:27.760 --> 10:34.240]  it and you can immediately annotate it with like the arrow arrow tool and the other what they call
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.920]  markup tools. So you can like circle the thing that you want to point to, or if you just want
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.480]  the whole screen, and then you can immediately send it to somebody. And then after you send it
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.840]  you can just be like, now throw it away. So that your photo, your photo roll isn't necessarily
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.320]  filled up with all of these screenshots. That all you wanted to do is take the screenshot,
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.160]  send it to, you know, like the developer of the app, like if you're testing a beta or something
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.240]  like that. And then you don't want it forever. There's no longer like a I have to go back and
[11:06.240 --> 11:11.600]  remember to delete a bunch of screenshots step. Yeah, or if you want to just save it to your,
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.120]  you know, your photo roll, you can do that too. Yeah. What I love about this, again, it's a
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.480]  really smart feature. And I appreciate that they're kind of like, yeah, we recognize that
[11:22.480 --> 11:30.880]  people tend to have legions of screenshots cluttering up their photos library. What I find
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.640]  really awesome as somebody who takes a lot of screenshots is that often I will take, you know,
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.520]  20, 30, 40 screenshots in a 10-minute period because I'm marking up a how-to, right? I want
[11:41.520 --> 11:47.040]  to show the steps. I want to show how that all works. And usually my workflow is take all the
[11:47.040 --> 11:53.360]  screenshots, write the article, and then like four hours after I've taken the screenshot,
[11:53.360 --> 11:58.720]  go back and try and remember which screenshot went with which step and pull it open in napkin
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.160]  or another third-party annotation app and put the like arrows and the big, the loops that focus.
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.640]  And now with the markup tools, there's a loop built right in there. So all I have to do,
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.600]  you know, when I take the screenshot is tap this and then immediately airdrop it to my phone
[12:13.600 --> 12:18.240]  or airdrop it to my, to my computer. And then I never have to, and then I'm just like, all right,
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.240]  that's the screenshot I want. And I've already cropped it to the appropriate information,
[12:22.240 --> 12:25.760]  so I don't have to worry about that. And then I don't have to save it on my phone because
[12:25.760 --> 12:30.800]  it's immediately on my computer where I can upload it to iMore. You know, everything's fantastic.
[12:30.800 --> 12:35.360]  And that's, that's pretty awesome. And then the other thing that I really wanted to mention really
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.560]  quickly about screenshots is that you don't have to go through the annotation process if you really
[12:40.560 --> 12:44.240]  just want to take a lot of screenshots, like for whatever reason, if you're taking a bunch of
[12:44.240 --> 12:51.120]  things. If you take three or four in succession, it'll pile up on your screen for a limited amount
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.840]  of time, something like two minutes, I think. And then if you don't do anything with them,
[12:55.840 --> 13:00.320]  they'll automatically, it'll go away from your screen and they'll automatically be saved to
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.640]  photos. But you can also like, if you don't want it hovering on your screen while you're doing
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.680]  other things, you can immediately swipe left to swipe them off the screen, just like you swipe
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.960]  the slide over panel away in iOS 11 on the iPad, and they just get auto saved. And it's just like,
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.760]  you can deal with those later. So it's just, it's all these like little smart gestures and features
[13:19.760 --> 13:26.240]  for, again, a feature that probably only 10% of the install base is going to use. But it's great.
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.600]  It's such a helpful feature for the 10% to do. Right. It's, it's so much better than having them
[13:33.600 --> 13:41.280]  just be dumb images that are in your photo. Yep, it really is. And it's exactly the sort of thing.
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.960]  It to me, is a very appley feature where it's like, hey, we're taking a lot of photos, but it's
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.320]  a appley feature where it's like, hey, we're taking a lot of screenshots. We know that, you know,
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.720]  like you said, probably like 10%, it's like the power users, you know, the beta tester type
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.640]  audience, but they take a lot of them. And they're obviously not photos, you know, they're, they're
[14:02.640 --> 14:09.760]  very different. They're very different thing than the photos you take when you're out, out and about
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.160]  in your daily life. And you're like, oh, here's an interesting thing. In my real life, a screenshot
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.240]  is a different thing. It should be treated as a different thing. And now the system treats it as
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.360]  a different thing. And it's, it's really, really nice. Yeah, you know, I think this is a, this was
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.840]  their compromise from all the people filing radars asking for a screenshots album, which,
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.640]  by the way, we also have now. So, you know, you know what the gist of the entirety of this
[14:36.640 --> 14:44.800]  podcast is going to be. No, temptation to install iOS 11 on all of your devices, even though I,
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.400]  even though I refuse to, I have so far refused to install it on my actual like day to day carry
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.720]  iPhone. It's very, it's tempting. It's very tempting. I never installed, never installed
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.760]  beta one on your phone. No, that's my rule. Unless you're me, but really don't. Yeah, I only, I only
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.640]  did it because I did not bring a second iPhone with me because I was a stupid person. Yeah,
[15:09.200 --> 15:14.320]  I was, I came straight from a roller derby tournament. So I had limited packing space
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.840]  and I'm like, do I really want like $10,000 worth of electronics sitting in our locker room? You
[15:19.840 --> 15:31.920]  know, there's like, so I have, I use an app called ITA and it's like a little to do list app. And the
[15:31.920 --> 15:37.360]  only thing I really use the app for is I have a list called packing list for when I go on a trip
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.600]  and it's everything I want to take every time I travel. And then once I leave the house,
[15:43.600 --> 15:47.760]  I can reset the list and say, uncheck all the items. And then the next time I open the list,
[15:47.760 --> 15:53.120]  they're all unchecked. And some of the items are only applicable on certain trips. Like
[15:53.120 --> 15:58.160]  it'll say like, do you have your passport? Well, obviously if I'm going to California,
[15:58.160 --> 16:03.200]  I don't need my passport. So it doesn't matter. But if I am going overseas, you know,
[16:03.760 --> 16:09.280]  want to have it. So I have an item on that list, which is extra iPhone for iOS beta,
[16:09.280 --> 16:17.600]  which is really only for WWDC. Yep. Yep. It's the it's the break, break glass in case of iPhone.
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.640]  Right. But if you if you just take an extra old iPhone, it doesn't really weigh you down. It's
[16:22.640 --> 16:29.440]  not like you're weighed down with pounds and pounds of extra material. No, exactly. And with
[16:29.440 --> 16:34.800]  the iPad, it was, you know, I'm not going to bring two iPads, but it's fine. That's, that's why I
[16:34.800 --> 16:41.280]  have a MacBook Pro now. So I don't have to worry about my iPad being completely bricked. So,
[16:42.480 --> 16:45.440]  all right, let me take a break. I'll take a break and thank our first sponsor. And I'll ask you
[16:46.160 --> 16:49.760]  whether or not you have a new iPad yet. That's that'll be my topic when I get back. But first,
[16:49.760 --> 16:54.560]  I want to tell you about our good friends at fracture. fracture is the photo decor company,
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.760]  you send fracture your photos, you take them with your iPhone or your iPad, or whatever camera you
[16:59.760 --> 17:06.240]  want, send them to fracture, they print them directly on glass. I don't know how they do it.
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.680]  But it's not like a piece of paper glued to glass. Somehow they print photos directly on glass,
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.640]  and then they mail it to you. And the thing that they mailed to you is ready to hang on a wall,
[17:16.640 --> 17:21.760]  or prop on your desk, whatever you want. It's it's very clever packaging and backing,
[17:21.760 --> 17:27.760]  where it's all ready to go. One of my favorite things about this, and these guys have been
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.640]  sponsoring the show for a long time. But recently, people have started when they get their fractures,
[17:32.640 --> 17:37.440]  they start tweeting me, they're like at group or me on Twitter with a picture of their fracture.
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.480]  And they're some of the most amazing pictures I've ever seen. There was somebody I forget who
[17:42.480 --> 17:47.120]  it was somebody who, you know, obviously, whoever you are, I love you. Thank you for listening to
[17:47.120 --> 17:51.760]  the show. But somebody was like at Yosemite National Park, and took an amazing picture,
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.800]  got it printed on a huge fracture, like the big like 27 inch type thing. And they took a picture
[17:58.800 --> 18:02.480]  of it on their wall. And it's beautiful. And I'm like, did you take that with your iPhone? And
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.760]  they're like, yeah. And I'm like, a, that is amazing that you took that picture with a phone.
[18:07.760 --> 18:16.800]  And it looks so good and be wow, the fracture print looks amazing. It's such a great thing to
[18:16.800 --> 18:25.120]  do with your photos. It is I'm telling you right now. Digital photography has it. Nobody wants to
[18:25.120 --> 18:29.760]  go back to film. It is so much better because everybody takes so many more pictures and more
[18:29.760 --> 18:36.560]  pictures are better than fewer pictures. But the one thing we've lost is that having all of your
[18:36.560 --> 18:43.120]  pictures just on a little four inch phone is nowhere near as cool as having your best photos
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.240]  printed really big and hang them on a wall for everybody to see. So take your best pictures,
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.240]  get them printed on a fracture, you will not regret it. Here's where you go to find out more
[18:52.240 --> 19:00.640]  go to their website, it's fractureme.com fractureme.com slash podcast. And then at the
[19:00.640 --> 19:05.360]  end of the whole process, when you order your prints, they will ask you where you heard of
[19:05.360 --> 19:10.160]  them. And then it's a one question survey. Just tell me I heard about it on the talk show. And
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.920]  they'll know you came from the show. But anyway, you will never regret getting as many pictures
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.760]  as you like printed at fracture. It's such a great service. So my thanks to them.
[19:22.080 --> 19:29.440]  All right, iPad Pro, do you have one yet? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Which size? The 10.5. I'm holding
[19:29.440 --> 19:36.480]  it in my hands right now. Actually, what color? I space gray this time. I love the space gray.
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.960]  You know, I would I would have ordered to we're actually traveling soon we've got like a family
[19:40.960 --> 19:45.280]  wedding and we've got a vacation coming up. And it's like by the time we got back from WWDC that
[19:45.280 --> 19:51.040]  goddamn things were backordered. No, no, they really are. They're like, they're they're like,
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.120]  delivery date was actually like, we're not even going to be home. So it's like, ah, shit, what
[19:55.120 --> 20:01.440]  are we going to do? It's but I think it's it's not surprising to me that they're backordered
[20:01.440 --> 20:07.360]  already, because these are terrific. So I do have a review unit from Apple. So it's not like I'm
[20:07.360 --> 20:15.040]  iPad Pro less, but you're not bereft. Yeah. I cannot believe how good a device this is.
[20:15.040 --> 20:22.000]  And I'm, I'm, you know, I say this as somebody who is the, you know, if you said to me,
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.920]  hey, iPhone, iPad, Mac, we're going to take one of them away from you forever. Which one do you
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.960]  want? You'll never use again, I would immediately say iPad, like just take away, you know, leave me
[20:32.960 --> 20:41.360]  my phone and leave me my Mac, and I'll be fine. Like I'm not an iPad person. But that said, I
[20:41.360 --> 20:46.240]  think this might be the greatest device Apple's ever made. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, I'm
[20:46.240 --> 20:53.600]  not the biggest fan of the iPad as a platform. But in terms of Apple doing appley things that the new
[20:53.600 --> 21:02.160]  iPad Pro is absolutely positively amazing. I 100% agree. So I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated,
[21:02.160 --> 21:09.600]  though, to hear your perspective as an avid illustrator. And with the pencil already, in my
[21:09.600 --> 21:17.440]  opinion, being the best stylus in the consumer space that you could buy it, the difference on
[21:17.440 --> 21:25.200]  the new iPad Pro with this ProMotion 120 hertz refresh rate, it's it's astounding. It almost
[21:25.200 --> 21:33.360]  feels that like with the with the first iPad Pro, and when the pencil first came out, it was like,
[21:33.360 --> 21:39.120]  wow, this is the best stylus I've ever used with the new iPad Pro and the exact same pencil. There
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.720]  is like this moment of like, wait, am I actually screwing up and like marking the screen with a
[21:44.720 --> 21:54.240]  real marker? Yeah, yeah. There really was like this. And it's funny because I take better care
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.640]  of like a review unit from Apple than I do my own hardware. You know what I mean? Like if I own it
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.200]  and I screw it up, it's like, well, that's my own thing. Whereas like, I want to make sure that when
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.440]  I mailed these review units back to Apple, they're pristine. And I don't even know why because I
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.280]  don't even think they would care. You know what I mean? Like, what are they doing with the return?
[22:12.080 --> 22:18.720]  I really do feel though that with a new pencil, it's like if you just took a Sharpie and started
[22:18.720 --> 22:24.480]  like writing on the screen, it would look exactly the same and have the same response rate. It is
[22:26.240 --> 22:34.240]  it's wacky. It's wacky. The way I was debating drawing a drawing a comic for ProMotion the same
[22:34.240 --> 22:39.440]  way that I did for the pencil review. And I decided against it in part because of time.
[22:39.440 --> 22:45.600]  But one of the first panels I was doing is I'm like, all right, everybody take into their minds,
[22:45.600 --> 22:52.240]  remember the first time that you as a person got to use like a really nice pen as opposed to like
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.800]  the cruddy Bic pens, you know, where you have to press down to get the ink to and sometimes the
[22:56.800 --> 23:02.480]  ink doesn't work. And then you get a hold of like a space pen or a really high end ink pen. And when
[23:02.480 --> 23:08.880]  you put the pen to paper, the ink flows out so fast that it startles you a bit at first, like
[23:08.880 --> 23:14.480]  you're you you mess up and you don't like your letters aren't quite as well formed or you blot
[23:14.480 --> 23:18.720]  because you're just not used to that kind of performance. You're not used to that, like,
[23:19.360 --> 23:25.840]  oh, all this ink is now right here. That's how drawing with ProMotion feels to me, where it's
[23:25.840 --> 23:34.720]  like suddenly the ink is almost there faster than I have the capacity, the brain power or the
[23:34.720 --> 23:42.080]  training to draw with it. And you adjust with it. But it's it's a very, very unnerving experience
[23:42.080 --> 23:46.160]  at first because you've, you know, especially I mean, I felt a little bit that way when I got
[23:46.160 --> 23:52.400]  the original pencil. But I'd been using Wacom's for years, right, where you kind of know what
[23:52.400 --> 23:59.040]  good drawing on screens feels like versus like bad iPad drawing on screens. And this just doesn't
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.720]  you're right. It doesn't feel it doesn't mentally feel like drawing on a screen. Obviously, it's
[24:04.720 --> 24:08.800]  still a screen and they haven't figured out the magical wizardry yet to make the tip feel like
[24:08.800 --> 24:14.400]  it's drawing on paper. Although I am convinced that there's some kind of slight magic, you know,
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.640]  voodoo going on because I do think the screens a little bit tackier than the previous version of
[24:18.640 --> 24:19.360]  iPad Pro.
[24:19.360 --> 24:22.960]  Yeah, maybe. Yeah, there is something.
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.320]  Apple says no. But I but I swear it does feel a little bit I don't know. Maybe it's just
[24:28.320 --> 24:33.760]  promotion tricking my brain. But it definitely it feels like there's a slight tackier thing. But
[24:33.760 --> 24:40.720]  regardless of that, it's a much, much better drawing experience than at this point anything
[24:40.720 --> 24:45.280]  and I haven't tried the new Surface Pro yet, which I know has 21 milliseconds of latency as
[24:45.280 --> 24:51.200]  opposed to the Apple pencils 20. I'm gonna try and try that out next next week. But I'm I don't
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.040]  know I think this might best any digital drawing tool I've used including a Cintiq.
[24:57.040 --> 25:04.240]  I think I don't get is I don't get the people who want the pencil to be able to navigate
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.400]  the UI. And it does still work. Like if you use the pencil and you're in mail, you can like
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.360]  tap the upper left corner to go back to your list of mailboxes. I don't think that should do anything.
[25:15.360 --> 25:22.480]  I think that touch should be touch and the pencil should suggest be for drawing. And if if you tap
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.480]  the pencil to the screen in a context where drawing doesn't make any sense, it shouldn't do
[25:26.480 --> 25:32.320]  anything. Because I feel like what they should do is just keep adding more contexts where if you
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.480]  tap the pencil to the screen, you're immediately marking up the thing that you're looking at.
[25:36.480 --> 25:41.920]  Like I just want to draw on the screen with the pencil. I don't understand why people insisted
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.280]  on having it so you can tap buttons and stuff with the pencil. I don't get it.
[25:46.240 --> 25:52.640]  So I'm I'm of two minds here because on one hand, yeah, especially when you look at the iOS 11's
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.760]  new Instant Markup feature, where you know, as soon as you go into screenshot mode, you can draw
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.880]  with it or if you tap the the pencil to the home screen, it'll automatically launch you in a notes
[26:02.880 --> 26:10.320]  drawing, which is pretty cool. But at the same point, I know people with RSI who have like,
[26:10.320 --> 26:17.680]  yeah, who are who are 100% like the pencil is the best tool I've used for for combating my RSI.
[26:17.680 --> 26:23.360]  And it's really nice to be able to use with a pen. And so allow me to revise my remarks. And it
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.400]  should be available as an option. But it should be something you have to turn on as like an
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.680]  accessibility type thing. You know, okay with that. Yeah, I just don't think by default, it
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.000]  should work as a touch. I really don't. And if you want it to, sure, go into settings and have an
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.880]  have an option so that you can do it. And if it helps with your RSI, you know, I've had my own
[26:44.880 --> 26:51.200]  RSI issues. So, you know, anything that lets you get through that is, you know, God bless, you
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.640]  know, but I don't think it should be on by default. Yeah, my my other argument for it. And again,
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.200]  I think I would be fine with an accessibility settings is, as somebody who draws a lot,
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.160]  drawing just like anything else is a is an experience where you're multitasking,
[27:06.720 --> 27:11.520]  you might be drawing on a canvas, but you might want to like bring in some photos for reference
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.720]  or something like that. And I really do enjoy in that instance, working with the pencil,
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.360]  for instance, in in Procreate, right, you can you can drop colors from a from a palette into your
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.520]  your drawing or you can now you can use drag and drop right to drag your photo into the the
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.080]  drawing. And if I already have the pencil in my hand, sometimes it's a pain to like,
[27:34.080 --> 27:40.400]  go from the pencil to flipping to touch to going back to the pencil. So like I get I get the
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.440]  reasoning behind it. But I'm also okay with a with a switch. I could I could deal with that. As long
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.240]  as it's there somewhere. I'll tell you what the most telling thing to me was a couple of days ago,
[27:50.240 --> 27:56.720]  I think it was like two days ago, I went on a mini Twitter rant about the on screen, like,
[27:57.680 --> 28:04.000]  get the app button on that medium shows up on like, and when everybody when you post like a
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.120]  blog post to medium now, there's like this stupid toolbar at the bottom that I hate. But now they
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.320]  put a button above the toolbar that's like open this in the media map. And I don't want to open
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.360]  it in the fucking media map. I want to read it in a web browser where it's already open right now.
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.480]  The article is right here. I'm reading it. So why are you telling me to open it in the app? And I
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.520]  know I know it's all about engagement. Fuck you engagement. I hate engagement. But I went on this
[28:29.520 --> 28:35.520]  Twitter rant. But I was on my phone. And I was so angry about this. But I wanted to take a screenshot.
[28:35.520 --> 28:43.920]  And I was totally it was it was pure rage that made me want to tweet this. So I wasn't even
[28:43.920 --> 28:49.680]  thinking logically, but the easiest way to do it in my mind, I was on my phone at the time,
[28:49.680 --> 28:57.120]  the easiest way to do it was switch to the iPad Pro, open the same thing in the iPad Pro from
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.800]  from AirPlay, right, AirPlay it to to my to the air, you know, which was great, and is one of
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.280]  those features that I feel like people are sort of taking for granted at this point, but it's kind of
[29:07.280 --> 29:11.680]  awesome. If you have more than one Apple device where it's like, you're looking at a website on
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.080]  your phone, and you want to look at on this other device, I want to get it on this iPad Pro. And I
[29:16.080 --> 29:21.520]  want to take a screenshot and immediately just circle this and make a big angry red arrow with
[29:21.520 --> 29:28.400]  the pencil. And it was so easy, like, the easiest way to do it was to switch to the iPad Pro,
[29:29.040 --> 29:35.360]  open it there, take a screenshot, and it's right there ready to be marked up. And I just tap it
[29:35.360 --> 29:42.320]  and I can immediately make my angry arrows and say, Fuck you, medium, I hate this. What is going on?
[29:42.960 --> 29:48.720]  And, you know, and then I'm one sharing sheet away from posting it to Twitter and embarrassing myself.
[29:48.720 --> 29:52.880]  But I and then I thought afterwards, I was like, you know what, that is a real selling point for
[29:52.880 --> 29:59.120]  the iPad Pro and the pencil, which is that it actually felt like easier to switch devices to
[29:59.120 --> 30:06.080]  this thing with the pencil than to do it on the phone itself or, you know, any other way. Yep.
[30:06.080 --> 30:13.040]  And now you have ventured into the mindset of the people who are like, I want a pencil for the iPhone
[30:13.040 --> 30:21.360]  Plus. Again, I could see it. Yeah. If, you know, obviously, if it didn't make it any thicker
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.200]  or heavier, if the pencil happened to work on the iPhone, it, you know, it wouldn't be worse,
[30:27.200 --> 30:33.040]  I can kind of see it. Oh, yeah, no, I could I can absolutely see it. And God knows,
[30:33.040 --> 30:38.480]  I've picked up my pencil before trying to draw on the iPhone and gotten cranky when it didn't.
[30:39.200 --> 30:44.400]  I understand why it hasn't happened yet. But I could also see it happening. Anyway,
[30:44.400 --> 30:49.120]  I agree with you. I used to be a big pencil. And I mean, this will shock you. I used to really
[30:49.120 --> 30:53.600]  when I was when I was in high school and junior high, I really cared about which brand of pencil I
[30:53.600 --> 31:03.280]  had. No shocking you. I was a big fan of the Dixon Ticonderoga number two, which is not I don't know
[31:03.280 --> 31:08.560]  if you know anything about pencils. But Dixon Ticonderoga is used to be made in the United States.
[31:08.560 --> 31:12.320]  And now they're not and they're nowhere near as good as they used to be. They're sort of like a
[31:12.320 --> 31:17.600]  some kind of cheap Chinese lumber or something. But the old school ones from when I was in high
[31:17.600 --> 31:23.360]  school in the 80s and 90s were aces like this was a pencil that you could like if you
[31:23.360 --> 31:26.720]  whack somebody in the head with it, it would it would leave a mark. It was it was a real
[31:27.440 --> 31:33.120]  pencil pencil. But I used to think when I when I when I was in high school, and I used pencils a
[31:33.120 --> 31:40.640]  lot, I liked a pencil when it was about two thirds of the way done. Like it was a better size to me
[31:40.640 --> 31:47.040]  when when you know, you got the pencil, you know, somewhere around two thirds to a half of the of
[31:47.040 --> 31:55.040]  the, you know, out of the box site size. And I can't help but think that I if they ever added
[31:55.040 --> 31:58.480]  pencil support for the phone, I'd kind of want the pencil to be smaller.
[31:59.360 --> 32:04.560]  Yeah, I don't think that it needs to be the size of a of an HP pencil, which is the size of the
[32:04.560 --> 32:10.320]  current the current Apple pencil. But it doesn't also need to be the size of like a teeny tiny
[32:10.320 --> 32:17.040]  stylus. I think the the the right feeling to me, I'm holding a relay FM a few years ago got all of
[32:17.040 --> 32:22.160]  its its hosts this beautiful space pen. And it's you know, it's a it's a pen that's designed to
[32:22.160 --> 32:27.120]  write in both directions. And it's probably I don't know, holding it in front of myself like,
[32:27.120 --> 32:32.960]  I don't know, four inches, five inches long, like it's just enough to fit comfortably in a hand.
[32:33.920 --> 32:38.000]  And and I feel like that's the right length, right? Because and then you could like,
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.640]  put it in your like, like your butt pocket, you know, in your jeans, you know, I mean,
[32:42.640 --> 32:50.960]  and it wouldn't stick up. It's exactly. I don't know. I don't know. I'm sold on the pencil. I do.
[32:50.960 --> 32:56.000]  I really do like it. And I'm not even an illustrator. But I could kind of see it
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.360]  happening for the phone at some point. Oh, yeah, no question. It's as I said,
[33:01.360 --> 33:05.760]  it's inevitable. It's an inevitability. It just depends. They need to figure out the right way
[33:05.760 --> 33:13.680]  to sell it. Because the last thing, the last thing you need is Apple getting the, you know,
[33:13.680 --> 33:19.600]  the headline, oh, Apple's trying to compete with the note, the phone that exploded. And then we
[33:19.600 --> 33:25.440]  just run into issues. You know, what is it? There's so many things to talk about. But it's like they
[33:25.440 --> 33:37.200]  totally glossed over this with but the note app and iOS 11 now has it's it's a new it's a little
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.880]  confusing because they kept and I think they did exactly right. And obviously, I'm the, you know,
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.800]  co designer of iOS note app that was abandoned Vesper. So I have very strong opinions on the
[33:48.800 --> 33:57.200]  design of a note app. I really, really love the way that iOS 11 note app has evolved. In
[33:57.200 --> 34:07.280]  particular, this new data type of a on the fly pencil illustration in the note. Now,
[34:08.320 --> 34:14.240]  prior to iOS 11, what you could do is you could say add, add like a picture to my note, and you
[34:14.240 --> 34:20.880]  have to like hit the plus button, and then you'd get like a full screen. What would you call a
[34:20.880 --> 34:24.560]  canvas where you could draw and you could draw whatever you wanted to and you could, you know,
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.640]  there were a couple of tools, you know, you could have like a marker or a pencil or a watercolor
[34:30.640 --> 34:37.680]  brush or whatever you want. And just wasn't good. It was a good demo of of the pencil support in
[34:37.680 --> 34:45.040]  terms of like the latency and seeing how you draw. But the actual interface with notes wasn't that
[34:45.040 --> 34:50.960]  great because it was so modal. It was like, had to go in there or out of there. And it just wasn't
[34:50.960 --> 34:57.280]  great, right? Whereas now in iOS 11, you you're in notes, you just make a note or you're in a
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.440]  note already and you're typing and you whatever you're typing, it's just like a regular note.
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.560]  And then you just take your pencil and start drawing it. You don't do you don't have to add
[35:06.560 --> 35:13.520]  to hit a button or go into mode. You just start writing on the screen and it makes a
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.920]  little thing. And then if you want to adjust the size, it's all you can do is make it taller,
[35:19.920 --> 35:25.120]  which is perfect because the thing that I think is so genius is that it has the width is always
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.880]  the full width of the screen. It's always just adjusting the height. And so it doesn't like
[35:30.880 --> 35:37.600]  try to flow around it like a like a half width image in a word processing program where the
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.920]  text is supposed to flow around the side. No, it's just full size in the in the note,
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.480]  full width, I should say, in the note. And you just make it taller or shorter if you want and
[35:48.480 --> 35:55.840]  you just draw. But the thing that is amazing to me is that it it indexes if it's handwritten
[35:55.840 --> 36:03.600]  words, it indexes those words and it works really well. No egg freckles. My handwriting
[36:03.600 --> 36:09.200]  is atrocious. I mean, like seriously atrocious. I don't know that there's anybody on the planet
[36:09.200 --> 36:15.760]  who can read it other than me. I can read it. I don't know if anybody else can. And I wrote
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.040]  some stuff and I wasn't trying to I was writing in my just not trying to be particularly neat,
[36:21.040 --> 36:26.320]  just writing the way I write. And then I searched for it. And it all, every single word that I wrote
[36:26.320 --> 36:32.000]  came up. It was amazing. Well, and on top of that, the fact that it's so quick, it's almost
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.960]  instantaneous OCR, optical character recognition for people for Yeah, but it's it's really
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.600]  impressive. And the fact that it's searchable, not just notes wide, but system wide. Yes. So
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.080]  if you write something down from six months ago, you can theoretically find it which is pretty
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.880]  fence off. Yeah. Right. spotlight. Yeah. What's the egg freckles joke again? I know it comes from
[36:52.880 --> 37:00.080]  Dunesbury. It's a it's a Dunesbury Newton joke. So way back. What was what was it that the person
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.600]  originally wrote though? What what? Everybody just remembers the egg freckles and nobody remembers
[37:05.600 --> 37:11.440]  what they actually reckless is just so weird. And then the other one everybody remembers is the
[37:11.440 --> 37:21.520]  the Simpsons joke, which was the bully wanted to write beat up Nelson or no, not a Nelson,
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.840]  what's the kid's name? Whatever it is, but instead of beat up whatever the kid's name was, it said,
[37:26.880 --> 37:36.960]  eat up Martha. Yeah. Oh, it was catching catching on was the original thing that quote unquote,
[37:36.960 --> 37:43.520]  egg freckles turned into. Right. Oh, boy. Yeah, no, this it's it's quite impressive.
[37:44.400 --> 37:51.200]  Especially considering that OCR, you know, I reviewed a couple of OCR apps, handwriting OCR
[37:51.200 --> 38:00.000]  apps last year. And there's really only one that doesn't suck. And the like three of them are made
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.840]  by the same company. So I don't know why it's only the one that works. But I've been kind of
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.040]  clamoring for Apple to integrate that for for ages. So I'm really happy to see that. The other
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.840]  big thing in notes, which again, it's one of these things that kind of slid under the radar, because
[38:15.840 --> 38:23.200]  there was just so much was the fact that screenshot or screenshot that that scanning is built in OCR
[38:23.200 --> 38:29.200]  scanning is, is built into the to the iPad. And it's and it's easy because it uses AR.
[38:29.200 --> 38:36.320]  Yeah, because right, so it's funny. I've been talking about it on and off on the podcast,
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.400]  but we just bought a new house a couple months ago. And most of the paperwork and everybody
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.080]  always says when you buy a house, there's like 1000s of sheets of paperwork, and they're not
[38:46.080 --> 38:53.120]  kidding. Like, there really is. But most of it we did online. And it was like e documents. And Amy
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.120]  and I were like, Oh my god, can you even imagine what this was like before e documents because
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.440]  you're like, just click to sign, click to sign, click to sign, click to sign, okay, you're good
[39:01.440 --> 39:06.720]  with this, send it and and you know, you click a button that says I authorized it by clicking this
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.480]  button. It counts as my signature. And it's going to the mortgage company or whatever the hell,
[39:12.480 --> 39:16.880]  you know, wherever the hell these things go. And in the old days, you had to like physically sign
[39:16.880 --> 39:23.760]  it and like, send a courier or fax it. But they're still even today, there still were a number of
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.760]  documents that had to be like physically signed and do it. And I mean, I don't have a fucking
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.400]  fax machine. I mean, who the hell has a fax machine anymore? Yeah, exactly. But so what I
[39:34.400 --> 39:40.720]  would do is I would I would put my phone over this piece of paper on a table and try to get the light
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.160]  right and make sure that the phone isn't casting a shadow over the thing, but have it perfectly
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.760]  square over the thing. So it didn't I didn't want it to look like I took a picture of a photo. I
[39:51.760 --> 39:57.200]  wanted it to look like I scanned the the document, you know, I wanted to look good. And it would
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.600]  I'm sure that if I just took it off center, and it didn't matter, it would still count,
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.800]  but I wanted it to look good. But now the built in feature does the right thing automatically
[40:08.800 --> 40:16.240]  from any angle. It's crazy. Absolutely. While we're talking, while we were talking, I literally just
[40:16.240 --> 40:22.560]  picked up my iPad and open the screenshot thing. And sitting from the desk, just snapped a picture
[40:22.560 --> 40:29.200]  of a of an invitation for for our wedding, sitting over on the side of the desk propped up at an
[40:29.200 --> 40:36.160]  angle. So I'm not even at like, I'm at a I'm at a two thirds view here, it was able to instantly
[40:36.160 --> 40:43.600]  get it within like, I don't know, half a second. I mean, it's it's ridiculous. I'm like, I don't
[40:43.600 --> 40:51.520]  understand. The ARKit team really they have to they have to be given like, a huge round of
[40:51.520 --> 40:57.760]  applause. And it's the really sad thing is like, no one's going to appreciate the the genius of
[40:57.760 --> 41:04.400]  what ARKit has has put together. And and the startup from which that Apple bought from which
[41:04.400 --> 41:09.440]  it's based, like, no one's going to appreciate it for another year or two until we actually see
[41:09.440 --> 41:16.400]  like, the stuff paying off. But screenshots is a really good early example of it, you know, a real
[41:16.400 --> 41:23.680]  world one. The scanned documents are amazing. It really looks as good as a photocopy, like, like,
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.200]  from a terrific photocopy, you know, like a high end photocopier. It's like, as good or better.
[41:29.200 --> 41:35.120]  And you don't have to aim it at all. In fact, it looks better if you don't put the camera over it,
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.920]  because you're less likely to get a shadow over the document. Yeah. Absolutely crazy. Like, of all
[41:41.920 --> 41:49.120]  the things, you know, the that the narrative of that these devices are replacing all of consumer
[41:49.120 --> 41:54.880]  electronics, like, you know, they've replaced standalone cameras, they've replaced tape
[41:54.880 --> 42:02.160]  recorders, you name it, but the fact that they've replaced fax machines now is kind of amazing.
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.200]  Well, think about how big and bulky those things used to be, right? Where it's just, I mean, you
[42:07.200 --> 42:12.960]  had to have what a built in modem and a scanner in one and now that's all that's Yeah, in a tiny
[42:12.960 --> 42:23.040]  little piece of technology. Um, yeah, I it's, it, it's crazy. It really is. I just, my my words are
[42:23.040 --> 42:30.320]  failing me because I'm still staring at the screenshot. So have you installed iOS 11 on your
[42:30.320 --> 42:37.760]  iPad yet? I have. I did that almost immediately after getting it. So I'm a stupid, stupid human
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.200]  being. No, I was so torn. I wrote it in my review. I was very honest. I'm I never lie on Daring
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.440]  Fireball. I never lie period, to tell you the truth. Like, honest, honest, john, just like our
[42:49.440 --> 42:55.440]  president. Oh, well, but saying that I never lie. It sounds like wow, that's something that people
[42:55.440 --> 43:02.400]  who lie a lot say. I actually don't like that's like, you know, in my adult life, I've actually
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.160]  like a great way to live your life is just never lie. And it's kind of liberating. You just never
[43:08.160 --> 43:12.960]  say anything that's not true. And we'll get back to that when we talk about Tony Fidel,
[43:13.840 --> 43:20.080]  Phil Schiller at the end of the show. Oh, yeah. But I, I got the review unit and and they give
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.000]  you like a little thing you have to sign. And you know, there's like a, you know, Monday is
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.760]  the embargo. And, you know, technically, you're not, you're not supposed to do something like
[43:29.760 --> 43:34.800]  install a developer beta on a review unit. And you're certainly not supposed to review
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.720]  the thing. They don't tell you that they don't say like, whatever you do, don't install iOS 11 on
[43:40.720 --> 43:47.440]  this. But it's kind of understood, you know, and I also feel like there's a certain
[43:47.440 --> 43:53.760]  fairness, you know, like, if you go to the Apple Store today and buy the new iPad Pro,
[43:53.760 --> 44:00.640]  you get it, and it's running iOS 10.3. And therefore, that is what I as somebody reviewing
[44:00.640 --> 44:11.040]  the product should be telling you about. But that said, after seeing iOS 11 last week, it was
[44:11.040 --> 44:17.840]  after seeing iOS 11 last week, it was killing me like I was, you know, Amy and I were flying
[44:17.840 --> 44:26.000]  back east from from San Francisco last Friday. And I have I my device for the plane for the
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  for the transcontinental flight was the review unit iPad Pro. And I kept swiping up from the
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.080]  I was already in the habit just from being in the hands on area I was already trying to use.
[44:38.080 --> 44:47.520]  I'm like, Oh, my God, this is insane. I cannot I have to install iOS 11. I haven't owned a device
[44:47.520 --> 44:52.560]  with this operating system yet. And I already have the habit of trying to use it to get like
[44:52.560 --> 45:00.800]  iMessages up. So I yeah, and once I did, it's like, Oh, my God, and I wrote my it's one of my
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.720]  favorite lines I've written in a long time where I just feel like one of my hands has been
[45:06.720 --> 45:11.760]  untied from behind my back. I feel like for the last couple of years, every time I've used an
[45:11.760 --> 45:17.760]  iPad in a in any context, whether I'm reviewing a new one, or just using my own personal iPad,
[45:18.960 --> 45:25.200]  I have felt like I've had a hand tied behind my back like this device can obviously do more
[45:25.200 --> 45:30.320]  than I'm doing with it. You know, in terms of, hey, I'm watching a baseball game, but I'm getting
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.920]  text messages from my friend. Why isn't it easier to do both of these, you know, keep the
[45:35.920 --> 45:42.320]  video up and and have iMessages on screen for a moment or, you know, and show me my tweets, too.
[45:42.320 --> 45:48.720]  Why can't I look at all three? You know, it has felt like I've been hamstrung. And all of a
[45:48.720 --> 45:57.440]  sudden, once I have the beta on it, it I've never felt like that before, like we're putting the iOS
[45:57.440 --> 46:04.800]  11 beta as buggy as it is. And it is as buggy as the first developer beta betas should be. Right.
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.640]  Right. It still feels like I'm 10 times more productive.
[46:09.600 --> 46:16.480]  Yeah, I completely agree. And it's why that I, you know, normally, I do not install developer
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.280]  heart or developer betas on brand new hardware, because you have that like little bit when the
[46:21.280 --> 46:26.720]  brand new hardware is so fast and so delightful, because you haven't put all your crud on it yet.
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.800]  But no, I immediately went to it because I spent the entire week last week switching between our
[46:32.800 --> 46:39.360]  review unit of the 10.5 and my 9.7, which of course, had iOS 11 on it the second that I was
[46:39.360 --> 46:45.040]  able to install it. And just switching between the two of those. Again, like you said, I kept on
[46:45.040 --> 46:50.800]  going to the 10.5 and trying to do things that I had gotten instantly comfortable with on the 9.7
[46:51.680 --> 46:56.800]  and being unable to and being very, very disappointed by it. And on top of that,
[46:56.800 --> 47:05.120]  I really wanted to see just like the multitasking features work pretty well on the 9.7. Again,
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.640]  even as a developer beta, they work, you know, with decent speed, but I really wanted to see
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.920]  the way that the animations looked and everything else with the promotion technology, because that
[47:15.920 --> 47:19.920]  like, we haven't even really talked about that. And, yeah.
[47:19.920 --> 47:28.320]  Yeah. I also feel that, and I, you know, I kind of knew that it wasn't coming, or at least I
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.680]  really didn't think it was coming. But like a week before WWDC, I wrote, hey, why not put a trackpad
[47:33.680 --> 47:38.800]  on a smart keyboard cover? And I kind of, I didn't write it, you know, and again, if anybody thought
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.120]  I was writing it because I wink, wink, nudge, nudge knew that it was coming, it was the opposite.
[47:43.120 --> 47:47.280]  I kind of knew that it wasn't coming. But I still kind of wish that it had a trackpad
[47:47.280 --> 47:53.600]  for text editing. But I will say this, that along the lines of that, where the logic of it is, hey,
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.720]  if you have the iPad on the smart keyboard cover and your hands are in that, you know, on the
[47:58.720 --> 48:04.320]  home rows key, your hands are already in this position. Reaching up and touching the screen
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.640]  is sort of breaking that thing. But doing the thing where you just go to the bottom of the
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.920]  screen and swipe up to get the multitasking doc, your fingers are right there. You're
[48:15.920 --> 48:24.560]  fingers are right there already. It is super convenient. And so in terms of that whole argument
[48:24.560 --> 48:31.040]  of, hey, if you're in laptop mode, poking at the screen is sort of ergonomically problematic.
[48:32.800 --> 48:41.920]  The doc in iPad iOS is actually like the least problematic motion you can make because your
[48:41.920 --> 48:46.160]  finger, it's like the quickest thing you could possibly do on the screen when you're on the
[48:46.160 --> 48:55.280]  keyboard. Yeah, well, and the beauty of it, again, speaking of teams to give hats off to,
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.720]  the Springboard team and the multitasking team really did a number and a way of figuring out a
[49:02.720 --> 49:10.560]  way to integrate all of this while still, you know, making all of it feel like a natural
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.120]  progression from what has come before. We've already gotten comfortable with the idea of
[49:15.120 --> 49:20.560]  swiping up for control center, right? So now it's just the difference between a little swipe enters
[49:20.560 --> 49:25.200]  the doc. And then if you continue swiping, this is the beautiful thing, right? If you continue
[49:25.200 --> 49:29.840]  that swiping, you get the new app switcher, which is basically control center on steroids,
[49:31.120 --> 49:34.960]  which with custom control center is something that I know a lot of people have been asking for
[49:34.960 --> 49:42.400]  for a while. And it really comes into its own here. But it just it feels so natural to be like,
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.320]  yeah, I'm typing, oh, I want to pull up an app, all I have to do is, as you said, move like half
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.440]  an inch, tap and hold the app, wait until it starts, you know, it pulls forward the same way
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.400]  that like tvOS has, has the parallax, you know, shimmer to it. And then you literally just have to
[50:00.400 --> 50:04.080]  like toss it right, right up on the left or the right side of the screen, you don't even have to
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.920]  like, move it all the way to the top of the screen and then position it like it becomes a very quick,
[50:09.920 --> 50:14.240]  quick flick and switch more quickly than than you'd anticipate.
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.760]  Right, you can you just kind of vaguely gesture in the direction you want it to go,
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.520]  and it just goes there. And it's Yeah, it just obeys your commands.
[50:26.480 --> 50:33.840]  Yeah, yeah. I think it's a really, really clever design. I really like it. And and it's funny to
[50:33.840 --> 50:45.440]  me how visually it it pays homage to the Mac OS dock. But to me, it interaction wise, it's very
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.720]  different because the the Mac OS dock doesn't really, you either have it on screen all the
[50:50.720 --> 50:56.000]  time, or you don't, but it doesn't. It's not like, I don't know, it's not reactive. Yes,
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.840]  in the same way. Yeah, and and the way that you drag apps out of it is and you were saying that
[51:03.840 --> 51:12.160]  we didn't talk about promotion yet, but it it's uncanny. The way that you just tap the icon for
[51:12.160 --> 51:18.160]  messages and quick flick it out and the way that that the icon turns into the window that you're
[51:18.160 --> 51:29.760]  going to have on the side at 100% fidelity as you flick your finger. Ah, it feels so you remember
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.640]  the the initial when when Steve Jobs is talking about how everything just feels. I'm not sure if
[51:36.640 --> 51:41.680]  you use the word likable. But when when he was talking about like, just the reaction of of
[51:41.680 --> 51:47.520]  touching the screen and being excited about being able to manipulate objects. I get the same kind of
[51:47.520 --> 51:52.560]  giddiness that I got from initially playing with iOS playing with the multitasking, like just,
[51:52.560 --> 51:58.000]  I will sometimes when I'm bored, I've found myself or not even bored, but like waiting for something
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.040]  to render, I find myself just like flicking apps around and going from slide over and pulling it
[52:03.040 --> 52:08.960]  down. Just it's a it's a comfortable movement. It's really enjoyable. And as you said on promotion
[52:08.960 --> 52:15.280]  or on the on the 10 five and the 12 nine with promotion, it just it flies. It doesn't it there
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.640]  feels like there it feels like there is no latency whatsoever. Because there isn't between your touch
[52:20.640 --> 52:27.280]  interface and and what the screen is rendering. They're inputting touch from the user at 120 hertz,
[52:27.280 --> 52:32.080]  and then they're exporting it and showing it to you at 120 hertz. So whatever you're doing,
[52:32.080 --> 52:39.120]  it is it's literally what the screen is doing. Yeah, I remember when when Mac OS 10 was in beta,
[52:39.120 --> 52:47.520]  or even when like 10.00 officially shipped back in 2002. And I worked at bare bones software. And
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.880]  my friend Jim Korea was one of the engineers there and how he works at the Omni group.
[52:53.680 --> 52:58.560]  But when the betas came out, and it was so slow, you know, it looked so good. And I think that's
[52:58.560 --> 53:04.320]  where job said it's likable. It was describing that initial aqua interface, but it was so slow.
[53:04.320 --> 53:10.160]  And I remember Jim, we'd get like a beta and we'd put it on a like a high end Mac. And we'd have
[53:10.160 --> 53:15.280]  like a lot of icons in a finder view. And Jim would just sort of drag the scroll bar up and
[53:15.280 --> 53:21.120]  down real fast, like just go up, down, up, down, up down. And you could see the shearing on screen.
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.680]  And Jim would just be like, that's garbage. Because you can just see it. But and but you'd go
[53:27.680 --> 53:31.840]  real fast. And it's like, well, of course, at this fidelity with this, you know, the super, you know,
[53:31.840 --> 53:39.040]  you know, 1000 eye color icons, you know, of course, it's not going to be able to scroll in
[53:39.040 --> 53:45.200]  real time. Whereas now, it's not even the indirect motion of like scrolling a mousebar up and down,
[53:45.200 --> 53:49.680]  but literally your finger going up and down and just sitting there flicking the screen
[53:49.680 --> 53:55.120]  up and down, up and down, up and down and having a track your finger 100% just like you're dragging
[53:55.120 --> 54:01.680]  a piece of paper on a desk is kind of amazing. It's such a nice feeling. It's it's such a
[54:01.680 --> 54:09.440]  it is confusing your brain in a way that's kind of wonderful. Because your brain like it feels
[54:09.440 --> 54:14.560]  like you're tactilely moving something despite the fact that it's just glass. You know, I'm not
[54:14.560 --> 54:21.120]  I'm not moving a damn thing except for pixels on a screen. But dragging like I'm just swiping my
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.680]  home screens back and forth with four fingers right now. And it just it feels like I'm moving
[54:25.680 --> 54:32.240]  things. My brain is thoroughly convinced. It's, it's nice. I overuse that word, I think when I
[54:32.240 --> 54:38.160]  review recent Apple products, but I don't know what other words use that they're making things
[54:38.160 --> 54:47.120]  nicer. You know, and and it's not really a tech thing. You know, I mean, like there is no serious
[54:47.120 --> 54:52.320]  engineering that goes into it and the integration between the you know, the hardware to have the
[54:52.320 --> 54:59.120]  screen physically technically be able to be driven at 120 hertz, and to have the software in the OS
[54:59.120 --> 55:06.240]  to actually do it. And to do the the the really cool thing, which is dynamically adjust the
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.280]  refresh rate so that if you're watching a 24 frame per second video, it'll actually only update at
[55:11.280 --> 55:16.960]  24 hertz, because you don't need the other one. And it actually, in fact, in addition to saving
[55:16.960 --> 55:21.200]  battery, it actually makes the video look better because you're not doing like a pull down and
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.720]  getting interstitial frames that are interpolated.
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.920]  Yeah, I gotta I'm gonna pause you there because there's some really, really cool tech in that
[55:29.920 --> 55:35.440]  regard. Have you ever Have you done the demo yet where you put a movie side by side with scrolling?
[55:36.240 --> 55:37.200]  No, I haven't really.
[55:37.840 --> 55:43.520]  So this is where it gets really cool, right? So the way that you like you normally watch a movie
[55:43.520 --> 55:47.840]  when you're watching at a at a screen that doesn't do a three to two pull down when it when it
[55:47.840 --> 55:53.840]  divides equally, you normally watch a movie at somewhere between 48 hertz and I think 72.
[55:55.040 --> 56:01.280]  And it or maybe 96. And it divides equally down to 24 frames a second because your eyes
[56:01.280 --> 56:09.680]  get like kind of messed up. If you just look at 24 screen refreshes. So what promotion does when
[56:09.680 --> 56:17.040]  you have video next to something that's 120 hertz, unlike the televisions, right, where if you show
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.240]  slow mo mode, right, you show sports mode, it just makes the video look really super high speed,
[56:22.240 --> 56:28.000]  unless you manually change it. Promotion when you have two things side by side, it
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.240]  intelligently down samples the video, it knows that it's video that you're watching. And it says,
[56:34.240 --> 56:39.600]  okay, this, we're going to down sample to two sets of 24. Essentially, we're going to show you,
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.520]  you know, an image five times in a second so that your brain thinks it's 24 frames a second,
[56:45.520 --> 56:50.640]  even though we're refreshing the screen 120 times. And but on the right side where you're drawing,
[56:50.640 --> 56:57.120]  we're going to give you the full 120 screen refreshes. So you can watch a movie or like use
[56:57.120 --> 57:03.040]  it as reference and it looks like a movie. But on the right side, whether you're scrolling or
[57:03.040 --> 57:09.920]  drawing, it says fast as the screen can allow for so you have no latency and it's it's mind boggling.
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.920]  It's crazy. It's like I said, 20 minutes ago, it it's the best. I think it's the best device
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.960]  Apple's ever made. I really do hands down. And it's not my favorite. It's not my favorite Apple
[57:20.960 --> 57:28.240]  device ever made. I but I do think it's the best. And I feel like that's sort of, you know, putting
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.520]  on your your big boy pants it to be a reviewer is to be able to separate what you personally
[57:33.520 --> 57:39.760]  prefer versus appreciating that this is the best thing Apple. This is the most appley thing Apple
[57:39.760 --> 57:46.000]  Apple's ever made. Yeah, it's Well, exactly. Even if you're not an iPad person, even if you are a
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.000]  MacBook Pro person, that's me iPhone person. Yeah. And that's okay. But what this should like,
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.880]  the reason why the iPad, the 10 five excites me and the 12 nine excite me as much as they do is,
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.320]  yeah, I'm an artist. And I really love the iPad form factor. I love, you know, a lot of things
[58:02.320 --> 58:07.440]  about it. But I also, you know, I care about my MacBook Pro very much. I really enjoy using it on
[58:07.440 --> 58:13.040]  a day to day. And there are things that make more sense on a Mac. But what what excites me is that
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.400]  if Apple is developing all of this technology, the same, I mean, you look back to what happened with
[58:18.400 --> 58:22.960]  retina, right? Where, when the when the iPhone was it the five that came out with retina?
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  No, the four, four, four, four, four, four, that's right. The iPhone four came out with retina.
[58:30.000 --> 58:36.240]  And retina is is something when it first came out, there was one person in my life who was really
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.120]  excited about retina. And that was my boyfriend at the time who was a comics artist. And he's like,
[58:41.120 --> 58:45.680]  I have been asking for this for two years. And I'm looking at him and I'm like, I don't really
[58:45.680 --> 58:51.680]  get why it's better until you see it. And then you're like, Oh, this is amazing. That's how I
[58:51.680 --> 58:58.400]  feel about all of this tech is that it's all going to filter down into the Mac into the iPhone into
[58:58.400 --> 59:04.320]  whatever Apple decides to make in the future, whether that be AR goggles, or a car or a car
[59:04.320 --> 59:10.720]  interface, or is something we can't even think of the fact that Apple is working on technology that
[59:10.720 --> 59:16.800]  ostensibly, just like that screenshots feature, you know, consumers, consumers, we're not asking
[59:16.800 --> 59:20.800]  Apple, you need to make a screen with a higher refresh rate, because most people aren't going
[59:20.800 --> 59:28.320]  to know what that means. But Apple is is very focused on making devices that just feel better,
[59:28.320 --> 59:34.720]  they feel less like screens in front of our hands and more like physically tangible devices
[59:34.720 --> 59:40.160]  that are part of our lives. And that that is that's something that we can take advantage of
[59:40.960 --> 59:45.120]  across the line, no matter whether you're a Mac person, or an iPhone person, or an iPad person,
[59:45.120 --> 59:50.720]  or a home pod person, like, this is better for you. This is this is a this is a good direction for the
[59:50.720 --> 59:56.320]  company to be going in caring about its users and actually seeing all of those years of work pay off.
[59:58.160 --> 01:00:04.080]  Very much so I was very excited for retina years before it came out. I remember, I've told this
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.280]  story before, but it's worth telling again, where there was like a WWDC. It was like, I don't know,
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:15.680]  maybe like 2005 2006. But it was before the iPhone even existed. But there was a WWDC, it was probably
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.080]  like 2006, where Apple made a big push on the Mac for what they called that the time high DPI.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.840]  And the gist was like, hey, stop drawing pixel for pixel icons, make them like a PDF so that
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.960]  they can scale because, and you know, it's as close as they ever come to like saying what
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.320]  they're going to do, because like, eventually, we're going to make screens that have higher
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.560]  resolution. And I remember, it was me and cable Sasser from panic, and we both got it instantly.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.160]  And people were like, Well, what the hell are you talking about the mat? You know, the max already
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.240]  beautiful and cable and I were like, Well, have you ever seen like, like a laser printer out
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.880]  output how the, you know, fonts when you print on the laser printer, they look better than they do
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.840]  on screen. And they're like, Yeah, because you know, on the screen there, you could see the
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.800]  anti aliasing. And we're like, exactly. Like, imagine a screen that's like a laser printer.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.360]  And they're like, Well, that's never gonna happen. And we're like, No, no, that's what
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.560]  Apple's telling us is going to happen. And they're like, No, that's too in there.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.360]  That's not gonna happen.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.200]  And they quick like do the math. And they're like, Well, that would be like,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.120]  you know, 4 million pixels on a screen. And we're like, Yeah, that's what they're going to do.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.000]  That's what and we thought it was coming like next year. We were like,
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.360]  we were like, and famously, I swear, this is true. Like cable got like panic to do like,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:40.080]  like all of their apps were retina ready, like in 2007. Like six years before the Mac had a retina
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.880]  screen because it's probably half my fault. Right? Because we got so excited because there was like
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:54.000]  one session at WWDC 2006. That was like get ready for high DPI. All right, let me take a break.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.320]  Let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. It is our good friends at Warby Parker,
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.560]  Warby Parker thinks glasses, like eyeglasses should not cost as much as your iPhone. Instead,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.800]  their prescription eyeglasses start at just 95 bucks. And when you got a pair of Warby Parker
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:17.760]  glasses for 95 bucks, it's not like Oh, but then you have to buy the anti glare coating and you
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.040]  have to get the scratch coating and next thing you know, it's 300 bucks. No, the $95 glasses you
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.240]  get from Warby Parker are like good to go. Like you get the anti glare. They're scratch proof.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:35.520]  There is no upsell. There's no hard sell. There's no upsell. You just get good glasses. It's amazing.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.600]  I'm I couldn't even be reading this ad to you right now without the Warby Parker glasses that
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:48.080]  I'm wearing as I read this. I just got a new pair a couple weeks ago. And they're fantastic. It's
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.080]  a great company. They have great selection of glasses to choose from. What you do is you go
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.840]  to their website, and they have tons and tons of glasses to choose from all sorts of styles. You
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:06.160]  pick five up to five that you like. And they'll mail them to you at your house. Just like with
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.960]  dummy lenses, you know, like just see through, you know, clear lenses so you can try them on
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:17.040]  in your house. Look in the mirror, get your opinion from whoever you live with, or your
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.360]  friends or whatever. Like, Hey, do these look better? Do these look better? And then you just
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.400]  mail those back to them. And if there's one of them or two of them or more that you want,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.680]  you just say, Hey, here's the ones I want. You send them a picture of your prescription. And
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.520]  next thing you know, like a week later, you've got glasses for 95 bucks. It could not be easier.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:45.760]  And the try on process could not be easier as well, including the fact that they,
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.000]  when they mailed them to you, it already comes with a box with the label on it for mailing the
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.120]  try on glasses back to them. Like it, it literally could not be easier. There's nothing you have to
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:05.520]  do. No work. So if you're a total lazy person like I am, this is the best way to get glasses.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.560]  Where do you go to find out more? Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show,
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.280]  and then they'll know you came from the show. And every time you buy glasses from them,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.080]  this is the other thing that's really cool. They also, each pair you buy from Warby Parker,
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.520]  they, they make a pair of glasses to give to charity for people around the globe who
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.600]  need glasses, which is absolutely fantastic because imagine living your life and not being
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.240]  able to see stuff clearly. It would be horrible. So Warby Parker is helping to make that, helping
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.440]  to solve that problem. Every time you buy a pair of glasses, they, they send a pair to people around
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.560]  the world that, that need glasses. So if you need glass, next time you need glasses, go to Warby
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.080]  Parker. I don't know what else to tell you. All right. What else do we want to talk about?
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:04.560]  Just so much. Yeah. So actually, you mentioned, you know, figuring out retina based on WWDC sessions
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:13.760]  from a few years back before I could have, yeah, many, many years. I kind of feel like there are
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:22.240]  a lot of breadcrumbs in this year's WWDC about where VR and AR are going with, with Apple. And
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:30.160]  I think so too. Yeah. I just, I don't know if I have that much more to say about that other than
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:36.320]  I'm really fascinated with all of the technology that they, they dropped in the dev sessions this
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:42.960]  year, because I think quite a lot of it is again, setting groundwork. I mean, APFS is another good
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:48.000]  example of something. Obviously it came to iOS last year and you talked a bit about it with,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.400]  with Phil and Craig last week. And now it's coming to the Mac, but like, there's, there's a lot in
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:00.480]  here. ARKit, I mean, I mentioned ARKit already, but like VR is another really, really interesting
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:06.720]  thing that comes along the, you know, just side by side with Apple, essentially saying,
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.440]  hey, external GPUs, the thing that we've kind of naysayed for years and years, because it just
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:19.200]  wouldn't work well, we're going to be shipping developers a kit that allows them to develop with
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:25.040]  an external GPU, with the goal of, you know, people being able to buy external GPU kits next
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:31.760]  year to use in VR. And here are all of these tools if you want to develop VR games on the Mac,
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.800]  which heretofore not possible. And even though, you know, consumers, I mean, the earliest a
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.320]  consumer is really going to be able to play any sort of VR game on the Vive. I mean, technically,
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:50.320]  I guess you can, you can hook up a Vive to the highest end iMac that's out right now. But really,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.440]  I mean, I think you're going to see more of a push and steam and everything, the game's coming,
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.440]  starting in December and next year. So it's just, I don't know, it's really interesting to see Apple,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:08.320]  Apple getting on the bandwagon in this way, and positioning it from, not from a, hey,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.480]  consumers, we know you love VR. So here are some machines to let you play VR. But from a like,
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.760]  developers, do you want to work on, you know, the tools that you really like working on to develop
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.120]  VR content and VR movies, we're going to give you those tools, which you can do.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.400]  I've said this, I think, with Ben Thompson, I think it was on the show, but I've said it
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:38.880]  numerous times. But the way to be right all the time is not to pretend like you can be correct
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.240]  all the time with every decision you make and every statement you make, because the
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.720]  nature of being a human being is you're going to be wrong. Sometimes you're going to make mistakes.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.760]  The way to be right all the time is to have an open mind and recognize your mistakes and then
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:57.360]  just say, oh, I screwed that one up. You know, that was, you know, so if it's as simple as just
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.160]  me writing during Fireball, if I post something and it's wrong, the way to be right all the time
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.480]  is to as soon as I find out that a post is wrong, post an update and say, oh, this is wrong. I
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:16.160]  screwed up. Here's the correct thing. And I'm, I feel like what Apple's done with the GPU stuff
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:22.480]  on the Mac is exactly what you want to see. It's a sign of a healthy Apple, which is clearly they
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:29.760]  had their eye off the ball for the last two years or so on Mac hardware. And I feel like a little
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.160]  bit, you know, maybe it was because they were at a high level focused on the iPad and the iPhone,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.960]  especially, and maybe a little bit they were taking for granted the Mac market and maybe a
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.760]  little bit, they, you know, quote unquote, painted themselves in a thermal corner with the Mac Pro.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:56.960]  Uh, but they did, but the fact that they can, you know, like, I don't feel like it's worth raking
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:03.840]  them over the coals for the mistake, given that they've clearly come back and said, okay, here's,
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.520]  you know, we're going to go all in on this. And like you said, with the EGP use, it's like,
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.840]  here's where the industry's gone. And we clearly in 2013, when we came out with that Mac Pro design,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.920]  totally did not anticipate that like that 2013 Mac Pro for all the pros and cons you can say about
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:27.680]  it. The one thing about it that clearly is not true is that that architecture did not anticipate
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:36.560]  the rise of the GPU as, uh, as, as effectively the new CPU, right. And, and the way that like
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:44.000]  all of this machine learning goes through the GPU, even though it's not actually graphical at all,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.520]  like that's the thing that it's, it's hard for me to really get why that's the case, you know,
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.360]  like I don't really understand it, but I know that it's true that this, uh, massively parallel
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.000]  processing, when you go through the machine learning, like go through all of my photos
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.480]  and try to find every one, that's a picture of sneakers or something like that. It's more
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.440]  efficient on a GPU than a CPU because it's, it's meant to be parallel lies. They just didn't foresee
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.800]  it. And now they're like, well, we get it now though, and we're coming back in a big way.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.640]  Yeah. And not just, not just here's technology that we kind of screwed up on and we're coming
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.440]  back on it, but I think your point as to, you know, taking the Mac market for granted and maybe
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.000]  taking pros for granted and thinking, well, professionals aren't, you know, as big of a
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.080]  market anymore. So do we really need to put that much emphasis on it? It feels to me a lot like the,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.480]  the early final cut pro 10 days where they, you know, release this new thing and they're like,
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.600]  right, okay, we're listening to you. And let's show you how much we're listening to you and,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:56.560]  and where that's going. And that the interesting thing about this WWDC for me in terms of like the
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:04.080]  overall story, the where Apple's going story is the refocus very much so on pros and developers
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.560]  without necessarily abandoning what makes its consumer hardware so great. They have,
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.840]  they have managed to find like a really nice line straddle where they can give all of this,
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.040]  again, this amazing tech that's going to help your average user, but it's really designed for,
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.240]  for professionals.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.720]  Yeah. It is a great example of that, right? Because it, it, it, I don't think that they
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:32.080]  really announced anything Apple. Well, the only thing I can think of that they announced that is
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.440]  like Apple made that consumers will use is the feature you, we were just talking about a while
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.640]  ago about the, uh, scanning doc, which is AR kit to get this, you know, the, the angle squared up.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.920]  Uh, other than that though, the AR kit is really just more, here's the great,
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.880]  framework and we're giving it to you, the developers and you guys come up with the ideas,
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:03.520]  you know, like, uh, better Pokemon go, you know, which is obviously silly, but it clearly looks
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.720]  powerful. It looks so much better. It really does. It's nice to have, you know, the Pokemon
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.480]  sized properly in regards to the backgrounds, like as silly and little as that is, or, um,
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.000]  the, one of the great ridiculous demos that I saw floating around the internet this week, uh,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.560]  someone built a 3d model of the Titanic and was able to map it to water. And there's just this
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:34.400]  nine second clip of someone panning at moving the camera up and down and side to side, and
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.840]  basically seeing a virtual 3d model of the Titanic. Right. That's amazing. Uh, somebody
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.640]  was talking last week. I don't even know. It might already be shipping. I don't know if it's
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.560]  an idea or not, but, uh, but clearly this is going to happen and it's going to be on our phone soon
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.360]  with the AR kit is like, if you're at like Ikea and you have a photo of your living room,
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.280]  you'll be able to like live, you know, like what would this table look like if it was our dining
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.280]  room table? And you'll be able to see exactly what it'll look like. Like that's super useful.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:17.040]  Mm hmm. Or, um, you know, uh, walk through tours, essentially being able to, you know,
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.120]  virtually walk through a home while you're, instead of having to visit, you know,
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:27.680]  20 different places or, um, here's a, here's a crazy one, you know, 360 cameras are one of
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:34.320]  these things where I'm just kind of like, eh, you know, I'm not, I, I, I, as of yet, um, until very
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:41.600]  recently, I'm like, okay, this is cool and all, but is this really useful? Um, and, uh, my pal
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.640]  and yours, Andy Anatko, uh, came to a roller derby game recently and shot the game, uh, shot like 10
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.000]  minutes of the game in 360 from the center of the, the oval. And for people who don't know roller
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.480]  derby, it's a game that's played on an oval track. Um, and it's basically a combination of like
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.640]  sprinting and rugby where you have players like hitting each other and then you're trying to race
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.520]  around a track. So the action, there's lots of action happening at one time. There's simultaneous
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.720]  offense and defense. And the 360 camera was like seeing that footage. Um, and I just had to like
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.080]  pan through it on Facebook, right? Because I didn't have an applicable AR, you know, way of,
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:27.200]  of holding it up. Um, but the 360 footage was fascinating because I could see what was happening
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.440]  at the back of the action versus the front of the action, what was happening between the point
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.800]  scores and what was happening between the point score of the opposing team without having to
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.520]  rely on the person who was filming to like zoom in or zoom out. Right. It's not, it's a sport
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:49.360]  that's not really amenable to TV style, you know, one 16 to nine rectangle frame of action. No,
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.600]  you're exactly right though. It's a perfect example because there's stuff going 360 degrees
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.520]  around the track at all times. Exactly. Exactly. And, and the, the beauty of that, right? And,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:06.320]  and I'm thinking about, you know, all, all of this, um, the beauty of it is that like right now
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.400]  we can, we'll be able to look at those kinds of things in AR with, uh, with a compatible app,
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.440]  you know, on an iPad, right. Or on an iPhone, or you look at Apple's even own demo of, of Peter
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.960]  Jackson's new software with the, the 12 nine iPad, you know, holding up, watching the town get,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.880]  you know, destroyed. Um, that's really cool. And it's a cool proof of concept demo. But again,
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.800]  this is what Apple cares about is not that you're making apps for somebody to hold up their iPad for
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.680]  three hours and play a game in AR, like Apple's thinking five years down the line, Apple's
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.200]  thinking, all right, well, forget about iPhones and iPads. How do we incorporate this technology
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.240]  into whatever's next, right? You're, you're not going to want to hold a 12.9 inches screen. So
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.520]  what are we going to do? And that that's, that's Apple's deal, but for Apple to be able to launch
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.680]  that kind of thing, and you know, three or five, 10 years, whatever the timeline ends up being,
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.720]  they need the software, they need the bright ideas and the brilliant ideas that are going to get the,
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.000]  you know, your average Pokemon Go loving user to hop on. Because otherwise, they're just making
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.040]  Google Glass, right? They're making a fun group proof concept that has no reason or rhyme.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.200]  Uh, what do you what do you make of the fact that they've already updated the MacBook Pros?
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:34.960]  Um, I think that that's a gosh, I think primarily, it's a Oh, well, thankfully,
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.880]  Kaby Lake is finally here. So we're going to shove some Kaby Lakes into the new MacBook Pros.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.840]  And if we could have launched the new MacBook Pros with Kaby Lake last year, we would have done it.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:50.000]  But we couldn't, but we couldn't because Intel, right? Here's what I think. I know it's it's,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.120]  it seems to me like the sort of typical, like, damned if you do damned if you don't wear.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.400]  And I get it. Like if you just bought a new MacBook Pro, like four months ago,
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.040]  it kind of sucks that there's new ones now. But that's the way the computer industry used to work
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.440]  all the time, right? Like there were always new machines nine months after you bought it. And so
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:15.360]  there was no way to win. Like, you were lucky if you got six months with a top of the line machine
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.640]  that was still top of the line. And and so updating October released machines in June is
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.920]  sort of like a return to that. But the way I feel is that is was unique situation where the MacBook
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:33.520]  Pros were overdue last year. Everybody wanted new MacBook Pros last year. Oh, yeah, they were
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.320]  overdue. And they made the best ones that they could make given what was available from Intel
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.280]  and ship them. And now that they can make them a little bit better with Kaby Lake and get a little
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.640]  bit better battery life. And, you know, it's obviously not radically better. Like if you bought
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.800]  one of the ones that was released last October, you're not like screwed. It's not like you're
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.160]  not as well. But I think it was worth not waiting until now to do it.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:05.280]  Yeah, absolutely. Well, again, you look at the the overall picture of Apple doesn't like pros,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.520]  or Apple is abandoning pros without Apple just basically being like, Hey, guys, okay, we're
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.960]  we're going to give you this concession, we're going to show you the MacBook Pro that we've been
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.360]  working on. And no, it's not the Mac, you know, I think honestly, Apple would have liked to release
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:26.640]  those last WWDC. But the Kaby Lake chips just weren't ready with the low power stuff that they
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:31.200]  wanted. So they had to wait. And finally, they're like, all right, well, we can't release these with
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.160]  Kaby Lake. But, you know, we want to we want to make sure that people understand that we're not
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.200]  you know, we're not sitting on our laurels and twiddling our thumbs, we actually are working on
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.760]  great hardware. It's just maybe not as great as we would like it to be. I don't know I have a
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.400]  as somebody who cares more about the Mac than any other product that they make. I thought that this
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.880]  is great WWDC even if it means that people who bought a MacBook Pro last October, kind of,
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.320]  you know, only got like seven or eight months of top of the line life out of the thing. It's like,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.840]  well, so it goes. Yeah, it's and honestly, it's not, as you said, it's not like it's such a
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:14.240]  big jump in performance, that now all of a sudden I'm looking at my 13 inch, it's not the the
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.760]  original MacBook Air versus the 2010 MacBook Airs, right, where it's all of a sudden you go from a
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.440]  barely usable computer to a very usable computer. My 13 inch that I bought in October is still a
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.320]  very usable computer. It's still a great a great laptop, and I probably wasn't pushing it to the
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.720]  extent that I could anyway. And the fact that it has Thunderbolt 3 and everything else, you know,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.720]  that's that's the really important stuff for kind of the future proofing down the line. You talk
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.400]  about like, using the eGPU, I'll be able to use an eGPU on my machine from October, I don't have
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.640]  to buy a machine from June to be able to do that. So that's that's the important stuff, I think.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.880]  But the really interesting thing, I think this is the this is the thing that's that's caught my
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:02.240]  my eye on my memory is, well, Kaby Lake is all well and good. But jumping back to iPad for a
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.000]  second here. One of the things we didn't talk about with the new iPad pros is the ridiculousness
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.840]  of the a 10x. And the fact that I basically have a computer here that's more powerful than,
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.800]  you know, my my laptop from four years ago. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.200]  It's absolutely crazy. And I kind of hinted at it in my review, but I actually feel that Apple has
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:33.600]  the combination of of the incredible achievements of Apple's in house chip team and how good the a
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:45.200]  10x is combined with I don't want to say the word ineptitude. But the hiccups that Intel has had in
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:52.000]  recent years innovation from Intel, but I actually feel that from a product marketing standpoint,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.520]  it's actually put Apple in a very hard position because they really are totally committed to the
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.560]  Mac. And and I feel like they've shown it. And they've really it's not just words anymore,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.640]  like with the product announcements with the MacBook Pros and the new MacBook,
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:15.600]  and especially the new iMacs and super especially the iMac Pro and super super,
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.720]  especially the fact that they've said that the iMac Pro is not the Mac Pro that they talked about.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.440]  Two months ago that that's still coming. Like, they're as committed to the Mac as they could
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.440]  possibly be. And I feel like the high Sierra story is exactly what I wanted them to do. Just
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:39.360]  don't work on new stuff, just sort of make it better. All of that said, I really feel like
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.760]  the a 10x is so good that they're they're in a hard position because they don't want to denigrate
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.200]  Intel, because Intel is an important partner for them. And they don't want to denigrate their own
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:56.640]  products, which the entire Mac line is based on the Intel chips. But the a 10x embarrasses Intel,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.600]  in my opinion, I feel like the new iPad Pro is absolutely a slap in the Intel should be ashamed
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.160]  of themselves that this device is can't be made using Intel devices. It and it's not just the
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.400]  performance because obviously there are Intel chips that can outperform the a 10x. It's the
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:21.280]  the a 10x. It's the fact that it's a fanless, heatless, it never gets hot, right? So even warm,
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:28.240]  right, never gets warm. So given those constraints and how light it is, and the battery life it gets,
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.360]  there's no way to make a machine like that with an Intel chip and and the the MacBook with the core
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:40.080]  M three is it's behind the iPad Pro in terms just in terms of sheer performance. Like if you Yeah,
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.520]  the only reason to choose it would be if you, you know, for the reason that I would is that I
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:50.960]  prefer working on a Mac and I like Mac software, and I like the form factor. But as a computer,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.240]  just judging it as a computing device, it is so far behind the iPad Pro. It's embarrassing to
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:03.760]  Intel. Yeah, it doesn't. And what is interesting to me about that is, you know, Intel currently
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.920]  has the edge on Apple for high end chips, right? Apple's not going to be able to make an A series
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:16.240]  processor that's going to power an iMac Pro or even a Mac Pro, right? Yes. Yet. That's the trick,
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.840]  right? Like, I mean, maybe maybe that's that's their announcement for the Mac Pro is they're
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:26.400]  like, Yeah, no, it doesn't run Intel. It just runs the a like 20 or something like that has like
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.360]  six, eight, 10 actions or something. Exactly. That would be my problem. And I wouldn't be surprised
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:37.200]  if that's the story. But yeah, well, because they've they've just done Suruji and his entire
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.200]  team has just done such incredible work on silicon. I mean, there's there's always the story
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.440]  to be said about, you know, Apple, Apple being able to make everything in house means that they're
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:54.880]  able to customize and really focus their their CPU on on what it needs to do as opposed to,
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.800]  you know, meeting the hardware specifications of 20 different computers. But it's really
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:08.640]  it is really staggering to me again, as somebody who maybe pushes the iPad, I have pushed my iPads
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:16.640]  in the past to 100% capacity. And I have tried just about everything that I can think of on the
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:23.040]  new 10.5 iPad to try and push it to capacity, including running, you know, 3d intensive games
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.320]  and doing crazy stuff in Affinity Photo, which by the way, people who have been looking for a
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.160]  Photoshop replacement since the dawn of the iPad, Affinity Photo is the Photoshop replacement. And
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.600]  in fact, once you once you learn it a little bit, I would argue that Affinity Photo is in some ways
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.840]  stronger than Photoshop, which is a frightening thing to say. But that's that's the thing, right?
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:53.360]  It's like the iPad Pro for for many years has been hamstrung by the fact by like the double whammy
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:59.040]  of like, the processors kept on getting more powerful in the iPad, but they weren't still,
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.600]  you know, as powerful as they needed to be to do certain things. And the operating system was not,
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:11.840]  you know, not necessarily what pro users wanted to use, because there were the hand tied behind
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:18.640]  your back thing, right, where it's just not quite what I want. This, this series of iPad, this this
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:26.240]  this series of the A10X and the the design and iOS 11 in the fall, like this is Apple basically
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.160]  being like pro developers, people who want to do pro creative software that takes incredibly
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:38.880]  intense rendering. And you want to you know, you want to be able to work fast. The iPad is now
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:46.160]  capable of doing this. So why hamstring yourself with a Mac, which in some cases is subpar for
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.720]  your work. Unlike, you know, in other professions where I feel like the Mac is superior. In some in
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:59.520]  some professions, now the iPad is the superior device. And that's a that's a really interesting
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:05.680]  story for Apple to be able to tell. Not that the iPad makes do for where a Mac could but like,
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.440]  you need an iPad to be able to be the leader in your field. That's that's the thing that's
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.360]  making me like that's what the A10X and and Suruji Silicon team has basically opened us up to.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.960]  And and again, a promotion is in hand with that, right? Or it's, you know,
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.080]  the the graphics throughput on this device is insane. It's absolutely insane.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.120]  Yeah, the fact that I'm well, it's it's constantly pushing, you know, the screen
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.240]  and and doing it without any latency, right? When when doing a high intense products,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.640]  projects like the demo on stage of the guy making a movie poster and doing seamless, you know,
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.360]  wave rendering without any time. That's that's impressive. And that's cool and stuff. But it
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.880]  really doesn't show what the processor is truly capable of. The one the one where he did the the
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.520]  hair recognition around Johnny Depp for the poster, though, that was yeah, that's and that's
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:08.160]  the one where I even wrote about I, I actually think that Apple strategically had a third party
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.840]  do it. And he said it was four times faster than on a desktop PC, doing it on the iPad. They had
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.560]  a third party say that because they themselves didn't want to say this thing is actually faster
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:26.080]  than a Mac. And doing graphics intensive things like like this, that sort of, you know, select
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:34.960]  the outline of a very complex, you know, Johnny Depp with dread dreadlocks. Captain Jack Sparrow
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.400]  movie poster thing. Yeah, no, absolutely. Because they don't, again, they don't want to insult
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.080]  Intel, they don't want to get in trouble with any of their partners. But if a third party is like,
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:49.360]  yeah, we we use this. And it's, you know, it's no no slouch. Like, it's it's second basically
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  to having like, you know, john from procreate or Adobe come up and say the same thing. But Adobe
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.960]  can't, you know, piss off its own, its own partners. But it's kind of fascinating in
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.720]  conjunction with this whole 10th 10th anniversary of the iPhone and iOS, you know, and we'll touch
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.960]  on that, you know, in the next segment of the show with the book that came out. But everybody's
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:20.720]  looking back at it and and the whole story of the origin of iOS with the creation of the iPhone
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:28.080]  was this. Hey, what should it be? Should it just be an iPod that can make cell phone calls? It
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:40.800]  should it be a new OS, like based on a very like light embedded version of Linux? Or can Apple
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:50.160]  strip down Mac OS 10 to the point where it could run on a on a pocket sized device in 2007. And,
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:58.000]  you know, the the great achievement of that team is that even people on the team thought that
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.840]  that's probably impossible if we can't get Mac OS 10 to be at that level. And they did it. And
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:16.320]  that's what made the original iPhone such a mind blowing once in our lifetime. You know, epic
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:25.520]  moment in the industry. But it was at that origin, it was like, I can't believe that they got this to
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.800]  the point where it's actually usable and boots in a reasonable amount of time and a performance is
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.720]  good. But it was clearly slower than the Mac. It was amazing that it ran at all. And here we are
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:44.720]  10 years later. And they've gotten the iPad to the point where it's actually more performant
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:52.720]  than a consumer MacBook. It's absolutely my laptop, right? It has nothing like the original
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:58.240]  when when the iPad came out in 2010. You didn't buy it because it was faster. You bought it because
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:06.720]  the you wanted it right. It was all about the UI and the Hey, I just love this style of computing
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:14.880]  and I don't care if it's slower. It I don't need fast. I just need I like this lightweight mental
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.600]  model of interaction with with direct manipulation of stuff on screen. But here we are today in 2017.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.720]  And it's actually the faster computer, which is mind blowing to me.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.960]  Yeah, I'm looking at Geekbench scores right now. And I just ran it on my 10 five. And it's fun to
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:37.280]  look at the compute section of Geekbench where it compares like your device versus older devices.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.400]  And I'm looking at like this is their metal score, their GPU score, the iPhone five s,
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:49.120]  which really wasn't that long ago, the iPhone five s had a compute score of 546. And the 10.5
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:57.920]  inch iPad Pro has a score of 29,445. It's crazy, right? Or just look at the graphics performance,
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:02.320]  like where you take a web page and just scroll up and down real fast, just up down, up down,
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:08.160]  up down on the iPad Pro. It looks like you can read it as it moves up and down the screen. And
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:13.600]  on even like a high end Mac, it's you know, it's blurry because it just doesn't have that sort of
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.720]  refresh rate. It's Yeah, absolutely crazy. It's the difference between wearing glasses or not.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:26.240]  The the biggest, the processor wow for me, was not running all those high end tests. But actually,
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.200]  I don't know if you've ever used Procreate, but Procreate has a feature where after you do it,
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:36.320]  after you do a drawing, you can go to export and you can export the drawing. But you can also
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.920]  export a video that basically calculates every single stroke you've made. So you can kind of
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:48.080]  see like a fun little time lapse of what you've drawn. And those video exports, when I do like
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:52.240]  a long piece, for instance, like I did the incomparable holiday card a few years back,
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.440]  and it took like three, four, five minutes to export it to, you know, and it's, you know,
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.960]  the display resolution. I've been exporting some of my Procreate projects, including a project that
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:07.920]  I worked on probably for seven, eight hours. And the export happens in less than 15 seconds.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.400]  That's crazy.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.520]  It's just, it's, that's the thing where like, the first time I did it when I was with Renee,
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:17.280]  Renee's like, did you just export a photo? And I'm like, No, I exported a video.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.920]  Did you suspect that it didn't work? Right? Like it was a bug?
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.240]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was like, Okay, Procreate is broken. And then I went and like, Nope,
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.080]  nope, it's there. That's, wow.
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:34.480]  It's absolutely astounding to me that the at this, it to me so quickly in just a handful of years,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:41.040]  it's gone from, look, use this device, if you prefer the mental model of this conceptually
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:47.200]  simpler direct manipulation operating system at the expense of performance, because obviously,
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.240]  a, you know, real Intel PC is going to be faster to this point where it's like, actually,
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.160]  the only reason to use a Mac is if, you know, the Mac is the one that has to make the excuse
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:04.720]  for the software, right? Like, it's like, you have to really prefer the full PC operating system,
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.840]  because the performance is not the reason to use that device. It's crazy.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.560]  But I think that's, that's the, that's the best thing. I mean, it's a long time coming.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.880]  But that's the position Apple wants to be in, because then they get to actually go back to the
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:24.160]  philosophy from a few years ago, which is the right device for the right the right task. And
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:28.960]  it's like some some tasks make more sense with the Mac. And that's okay. And some tasks make more
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:34.400]  sense with an iPad. And that's okay, too. There can be room for both devices. It's just pick the
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.480]  one that makes more sense for your for your work. Absolutely. All right. Let me take a break here
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.920]  and thank our third sponsor. It's our good friends at Squarespace. Look, you guys know
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.920]  Squarespace, it's where you go to make a website, you can pick your domain name,
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.960]  you can host your website there. They have templates to choose from. Long story short,
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.720]  I'm not going to I don't know what else to tell you about Squarespace. But next time you need
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.720]  a website, just go there and try to build it at Squarespace first, just spend 30 minutes at
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:08.560]  Squarespace, building a new website. And I can almost guarantee you that you'll, you'll just
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:15.760]  parlay that into Oh, this is great. This is exactly what I wanted. And boom, you just roll
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.640]  that in and sign up. And there you go, you've got a website already. Stop, don't don't start by
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.800]  making a new HTML document and and doing it that way. Go to Squarespace and do it that way. I told
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:34.000]  you a couple weeks of weeks or months ago about a local restaurant here in Philly that I just
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.720]  curiously I went and viewed source and lo and behold, their website was a Squarespace size.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.960]  Another one just around the corner from me here. There's a new pizza place that opened up and they
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:48.560]  have wonderful pizza. It's it's called reown r i o n e. So if you're here local in Philly, go go to
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:54.640]  this place. They have the most amazing pizza. They also have an adorable website. It's super cool.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.360]  And I thought I wonder and I went and viewed source and guess what, it's a it's a Squarespace
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:08.400]  site. So rather than wasting their time paying somebody to build a fancy website or whatever,
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.600]  all they do, they're just making the pizza and then they have a very cool, very stylish,
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:20.720]  totally branded for the restaurant website built with Squarespace. Don't waste your time
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.640]  building it on your own. Just go to Squarespace and it all you have to do is design it.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.880]  It's so great. So my thanks to Squarespace. Go to squarespace.com and when you sign up,

[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:53.360]  that code Gruber and you'll save you'll save 10%. I got two other things I wanted to talk about
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.840]  Serenity. I wanted to talk about this book that's coming out, Brian Merchant's The One Device and
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:08.160]  the excerpt that ran in The Verge. And then I want to talk about WWDC being in San Jose and what we
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:13.520]  think about that. So let's talk about the book first. It's not coming out till next week. So
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.800]  this podcast will come out before the book comes out. But The Verge ran an excerpt a couple of days
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:29.200]  ago and it made some waves. Just a few. Particularly, it was funny. So I'm reading this
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.560]  excerpt the day that it came out and I'm reading it and I'm into it. And it's like, wow, there's
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.480]  some stuff in here that I didn't know before. This is great. And I knew I was going to link to it
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:46.240]  from during Fireball. And there was this great little story from Greg Christie who I think he
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:51.840]  left Apple about two or three years ago. He used to head up their human interface design team.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:59.280]  And his team came up with, you know, more or less came up with the original iPhone, the entire UI
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:08.480]  design. And he had a great story about how they had what he called like tapas, like little things,
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.880]  like there was like, oh, well, here's how you would we think on it on a little three and a
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:20.960]  half inch touch screen. Here's how you would do contacts. And an idea for, you know, here's how
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.440]  we think, you know, we would do like a web view for the web browser or whatever. But they didn't
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.880]  really have the whole start to finish. Here's exactly what you'll see when the phone turns on.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.400]  Here's what happens when you tap this. Here's what, you know, and more or less Steve Jobs
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.160]  came to him. It's like these ideas are fine, but I want the whole story. You have two weeks. Give me
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:47.760]  the whole story or I'm putting another team on this. And they went into this, as Greg Christie
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.040]  calls it, death march. But his team spent like two weeks living in this lab. And, you know,
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.200]  the place got like all smelly and he had people sleeping at his house because he didn't want them
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.920]  driving home because they were so exhausted. But in two weeks, they more or less came up with a
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.800]  Greg Christie said, like, if I could reproduce the demo we had at the end of that two weeks,
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:13.120]  you would recognize it today as an iPhone. And I had this ready to go as my Daring Fireball post.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:17.360]  Like I'm going to block quote this little section of this and say, go read this. And then I went
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.240]  down a little further and read the bit about Schiller. And I was like, delete, delete,
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:30.080]  delete, select all, delete. Like it was like, this is why I read the whole story before I post.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:41.600]  Yeah. Yeah. So the bit that got all the publicity was Tony Fidel, former Apple executive,
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:50.240]  who was in charge of the iPod hardware and was in charge of iPhone hardware in the original iPhone,
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:59.440]  was quoted extensively saying that Phil Schiller was the lone person at the executive level who
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.400]  was insistent that the original iPhone should have a hardware keyboard like a Blackberry.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.480]  And that it got to the point where there was like a screaming
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:17.120]  match and that Steve Jobs said something to the effect of, I'm sick of this shit. Get on board
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.200]  or get the fuck out and kicked him out of a meeting. And then it was immediately followed
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:30.720]  by a story by a guy named Brett Bilbray who, who, uh, who's, it wasn't quoted extensively.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.960]  He was quoted in little snippets saying something to the effect of that Phil Schiller, uh,
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:43.600]  isn't a tech guy and understands things like a grandma and grandpa from middle America.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.840]  Um, I think, so I think here's what I think happened. I think,
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.560]  I think Tony Fidel shot his mouth off and regrets it because it's since come out. Uh,
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:05.040]  the author of the book, Brian Merchant was on the verge catch with Neil, I Patel and says he has,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:12.480]  he has the entire interview with Fidel on tape and went back and double checked and everything
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.240]  he quoted him saying was Alan Tate. So the whole, what, what Schiller did though, I think it's kind
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.600]  of genius is Schiller just said, uh, not true. Don't believe everything you read in response
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.920]  to some random person saying, Hey, Phil, is it true that you pushed this hard for a hardware
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:37.040]  keyboard? And in response to that tweet, Fidel tweeted, Hey, this, this whole story isn't true.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:44.480]  I really value my friendship with Phil Schiller and my time working with them. Uh, and this
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:48.480]  merchant has said, you know, responded to that and was like, well, I have you on tape saying this.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:57.360]  Uh, so I, I feel like, uh, it's pretty clear what happened. I think Tony Fidel was quoted
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:04.080]  accurately. He said what he's quoted as saying, whether it's actually true, what he said is
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.280]  up for debate, debatable. Yeah. Right. Like long story short, that's the, the,
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:15.120]  that's where we stand is, is it true or not that this happened? Who knows? Tony Fidel says one
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:22.480]  thing, but I think it's, I think it's so funny that Phil Schiller baited, you know, he, uh,
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.600]  Fidel tells this story that is seemingly tries to make Phil Schiller look a little foolish in
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:34.080]  hindsight at least. And in just 44 in a one 44 character tweet, Phil Schiller baited him into
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:43.680]  Phil Schiller baited him into publicly making a shit out of himself. Well, what is it? Uh, dish,
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:53.520]  uh, grandma and grandpa, my ass. I mean, Phil Schiller is many things. Uh,
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.880]  not intelligent is not one of them or technically savvy is absolutely positively not true. And I
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.400]  realized I'm coming at it from the perspective of somebody who just had him on my show last week.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.280]  And so you can say, well, of course you're going to defend him because he's a friend of the show
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:19.120]  and he comes on your show, you know, last three years. Uh, put that aside. I'm telling you that
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.240]  I don't know anybody in the press. I mean, Walt Mossberg came out, I mean, and Walt's got no
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:30.960]  fucks left to give because he's, he's retired. Right. And Walt is like, if you, you know, I've
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.360]  talked to, he's probably talked to Phil Schiller more times than anybody in the press combined.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.800]  In fact, I would bet on it because I don't see how anybody else could have talked with Phil Schiller
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.440]  more times than Walt Mossberg. And Walt is like, if you don't think Phil Schiller knows his stuff,
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.760]  you're an idiot. Yeah. There's, there's no question. I mean, you don't get to where you are
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:56.560]  by being an empty head or an empty suit. So I know it's, you know, I don't want to
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.040]  go too far in this book cause it's not out yet. So I haven't read it. I'm greatly looking forward
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:09.360]  to it. But in particular, this anecdote about the hardware keyboard to me, I, and I really do mean
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.320]  this, like Phil Schiller doesn't mean need me to defend him, but I'm just saying, even if it is
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:21.040]  true, particularly depending on the timeline of when this argument happened, I don't really think
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:27.680]  it was even so much about, uh, whether you needed a hardware keyboard, but more about whether the
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:34.160]  iPhone needed the software, it needed a keyboard period. Like, cause, cause it's clear that at,
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.760]  at this point they were kicking around the notion and Steve jobs himself even, you know,
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:46.320]  was clearly of half a mind that it should be more like an iPod, like a consumer electronics thing
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:53.520]  that ran, they even called them widgets, right? And they even had the guy who invented dashboard
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:01.920]  for macro S 10 port, like the calculator and the stocks widget to, uh, a non MacOS 10 based
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:08.400]  iPhone prototype, right? That it would be like the sort of thing where there'd be an iPod.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.440]  So you can play music. There'd be a phone where you could dial numbers and select people
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.280]  and maybe like a calculator and a stock widget and, you know, something for text messaging.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.680]  And that's it. But even like the text messaging thing wouldn't necessarily have like a keyboard.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.800]  Maybe it would have like a, you know, like the way we texted before where you type them on a
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:35.360]  number pad or something. Right. Like I, I think it's entirely possible, even if this anecdote
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:41.120]  is true, that what Schiller was saying was we need to, we've got the ability to make this a
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.320]  little tiny personal computer and therefore it needs the ability to actually type on a real
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.400]  keyboard. Whereas there might've been other people who were like, nah, we don't need that,
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.800]  which should be more like a simple phone that just happens to have some things like a stock
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:03.600]  widget and a calculator widget. Yeah, I could, I mean, I can see it as, I think more, more likely
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.160]  the, the conversation comes on the heels of, well, can we even make a software keyboard,
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.960]  software keyboard work to the extent where it's actually functional? Because I could very much
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:20.160]  see, you know, Schiller putting his foot down if, you know, it's been six months and the software
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.920]  keyboard still looks shitty, looks terrible, right? Can't, you know, the, the button response
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:30.400]  is not right or you're constantly button mashing or you just like, there, there are many reasons
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.880]  why a software keyboard would not have been successful at that point. And I could, I could
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.320]  see making that point, but the way that this, the way that the story is structured, it just makes it
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:48.160]  sound like, I don't know, I feel like it is, it is bad narration on Merchant's part because I just,
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.680]  there, it feels like there's more to this story, whether the quote is complete fabrication or not,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.560]  but if the, if the quote is true, like the fact that it's just like, oh yeah, Schiller was against
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.280]  it. Like not when Schiller was against it, not why Schiller was against it, just Schiller was
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:12.400]  against it. Right. And, and, you know, when this argument took place in what state was the software
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.520]  keyboard that we know for the iPhone, did it even exist? Cause if it didn't even exist yet, it, it,
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:24.320]  it's actually the most logical argument to make. It's actually, you know, correct in hindsight
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:29.360]  that we, we got to have a keyboard. It's, it's kind of funny how it blew out of control, but
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:36.240]  yeah. And I, and again, I, I've never met the guy, but I, and, and I would love to, cause he
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:42.240]  seems like he's a lot of fun, but it seems to me like Tony Fidell needs a better, he needs a
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:49.680]  better press handler. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe gone off as a, yeah. I, one interesting thing.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:58.080]  I just want to reiterate that Tony Fidell, as we record this, his public stances, this thing that
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:08.320]  I was quoted accurately saying is not true. He hasn't walked it back yet. No. All he said is
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:14.240]  that it's not true, but he hasn't denied that the quote is accurate, which is, and merchant says he
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:19.680]  has tape. So it's, it must be accurate. But in other words, Tony Fidell is saying the story that
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.600]  I've told is not accurate. And, and on the Vergecast merchant says that he, he, he, Fidell
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.760]  emailed him and said, some of the stories I told you, I didn't mean for you to take literally.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:41.280]  Oh my God. And what is extra funny to me is that of course, what, two days after this story comes
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:47.200]  out, the computer history museum announces that they're going to, you know, have a bunch of the
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:53.920]  iPhone engineers for a round table, including Scott Forstall, who did not get interviewed for this
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.800]  book and who no one has really talked to about creating the iPhone period up to this point,
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.240]  because he's been under NDA.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.920]  Yeah. Well, we don't know that. We don't know that that's why.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.920]  That's true. That's true. It couldn't, it could be that he just didn't feel like talking about
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:11.280]  it. It's fair. He put a lot of his life into it.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.440]  I honestly have no idea. I mean, I, you know, I've, the last time I talked to Scott Forstall,
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.200]  he was an Apple employee. So it's been a long time since I've talked to Scott Forstall. I don't,
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.520]  I don't, I would, I would highly doubt that his non-disclosure agreement for the,
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.760]  you know, termination package he got, I would highly doubt that it lasted five years.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:40.000]  I would guess it was probably like two or three years. And I think that his continuing silence
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.560]  is simply the fact that he was, you know, whatever else you want to say about the guy,
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.320]  he's an Apple employee and Apple employees don't talk. You know what I mean?
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:53.360]  It's true. That's true.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:58.080]  I can't wait for that. It's, it's John Markoff formerly of the New York times who's hosting it.
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.520]  And there is going to be video. Uh, it's going to be like live cast on, uh, Facebook or whatever
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.240]  they call it thing for the cause, but there's going to be video. So it's great. I hope it's
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.520]  interesting. I hope he opens up because that's a guy whose story we haven't heard since,
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:17.280]  since the whole shit went down where he got, he got forced out of the company.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.880]  Yeah. And I do kind of, I do kind of feel like this merchant's book, whatever it is,
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:26.640]  it seems like there's a lot of good stuff in it, but the fact that it doesn't have on the record
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.960]  stuff from forestall or anybody on forestall's team means at least half the story is not in the
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:37.360]  book. Yeah. And quite a, quite a large port portion of the story really. Right. Because
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.040]  there's, he, you know, getting Greg Christie and, and Boz ordering and a couple of other people from
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.480]  the design side. That's fantastic. It really is. It's a huge score for him. I can't wait to read
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:55.520]  that part of the book. Um, but saying here's the design for the iPhone is one thing actually
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:03.360]  getting it to run on, like I said, on 2007 arm hardware is an entirely other thing. And, and
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:10.880]  arguably the greater accomplishment. Yeah. I remember talking to somebody when the, when the,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:20.160]  at the Mac world expo in 2000, January, 2007, when it was announced, um, I, I knew somebody who,
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:26.240]  who I didn't know beforehand, but afterwards I knew he worked at Apple and I knew that he
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:32.320]  had disappeared and it ends up, he was working on the original iPhone, um, on the software.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.000]  And I was like, this is where you've been. He was like, yeah. And he still couldn't tell me
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.520]  anything really. You know, he could at least say, yes, this is what I've been working on.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.880]  And I remember saying to him like, okay, so it's running a stripped down version of macros 10.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.440]  I don't care how stripped down it is. It's going to take forever to turn on. Like how,
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.960]  how is that going to work? Cause like my, my current cell phone at the time, like you could
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:59.920]  totally have it powered off, powered on and it would be on in five seconds. And he just said,
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.720]  you're, and he said, you're thinking about it wrong. You're not going to turn it on and off.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:11.680]  You're going to put it to sleep. And I was like, Oh, but it's funny because here we are in 2017
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:16.000]  and it actually doesn't take that long for an iPhone to turn on anymore. But then the original
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:22.800]  one did take, it did take, I was correct. It did take forever to turn on something like 56 seconds.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.240]  If I remember correctly, I think it took longer. I think it took over a minute. I think it was
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.280]  well, you can still get that experience if you reboot your Apple watch. So
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:38.080]  So true. Oh my God. Upgrading your Apple watch. It's still,
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.680]  is there anything worse than the entire Apple ecosystem than like a minor point upgrade to
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:47.760]  watch OS? Cause you're not, you're not even going to get like a major upgrade. You're really just
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:55.280]  getting like security fixes and bug fixes. Yep. And it takes forever. Oh my God.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:02.800]  So my, my fun story on that is I have iOS 11 running on pretty much all of my iOS devices.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.800]  I have High Sierra running in a partition on my Mac because I'm not stupid enough to install it
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:13.600]  wholesale. But I still do not have watchOS 4 because every time I go to install it,
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:22.640]  it either doesn't work or it's like, will take four and a half hours to download and install.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:28.560]  Oh, the watch that's, that's, that's something Apple could, you know, future, future updates,
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:32.800]  make the watch easier to update. No, you know, they will, because it used to be so hard to
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:36.800]  update the phone. It'll be the same way because you used to have to plug it into your Mac and
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:42.240]  download it on your Mac and install it over. You couldn't do it right on the phone itself. It'll
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:48.080]  happen for the watch. And we'll all look back at these watch 1.0 and watch 2.0 days and laugh,
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.600]  but we're not there. We'll get stories. Yeah, we'll get stories from the creators of the
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:57.280]  watch at the computer history museum. It'll be great. Anyway, last but not least, I wanted to
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:03.280]  talk to you about just the overall experience, the, the experience of being at WWDC last week.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:07.120]  I thought you had a great piece. I will, I promise. I swear to God, it's going into show
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.720]  notes. You had a good piece that you wrote at, I think Friday. Was it, it was at the end of the
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:18.080]  week Friday. Yeah. Friday as I was coming home, I was on the plane and I was just kind of, you know,
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:22.640]  free, free form thinking there. There were a couple of people who wrote some really nice ones,
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:30.640]  including Steven Hackett of Relay and a couple other folks. But it's, it was a really
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:38.480]  different conference than in many years. And it, I, you know, I, I go to WWDC and it's nice to,
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.760]  to see these people, you know, to see you and to see the other folks in the media, but also to see
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:48.800]  all of these developers and podcasters and friends that I've made through over the years
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.720]  at various events and throughout this community. But it's always one of those things where like,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.960]  it's always a rush, right? Where you maybe see, you see people at like two in the morning
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.640]  for drinks. But the rest of the, the rest of the week, it's just kind of like, maybe you'll see
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:13.120]  them, you know, in and out really quickly. Whereas this year, it felt like I got to spend a, even
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.880]  being probably having it be one of the craziest WWDCs for me as a writer in recent memory.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:28.000]  I feel like I was constantly amidst everybody. And part of it is just this San Jose is not what I
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.880]  would call a crazy bustling city in the way that San Francisco is. San Jose almost reminds me a
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.160]  little more. I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a sleepy California town in a way while still being a major
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:46.480]  American city. It, it just has this relaxed sort of atmosphere, or at least it did throughout the
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:52.960]  entire week. Where almost, you know, there were, there were restaurants, but there weren't so many
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:58.000]  that like you, you could go to a coffee shop and never run into anybody. Instead, I feel like
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.960]  everybody was at the same two coffee shops. So you would constantly be running into people that you
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:07.600]  knew. You'd constantly be getting these great conversations and not just, you know, not just
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.480]  people who, you know, you might end up for drinks with, but people who could never make it to the
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:18.240]  2 a.m. drinks crowd, right? Or you've run into Apple engineers on their way from getting lunch.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:23.520]  And, and I don't know, it's the, one of the things that I always heard people say about the WWDC
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:28.720]  ticket was the sessions are great, but the reason why you buy the ticket is not for the sessions.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.960]  You buy the ticket for the labs and you buy the ticket for the random chance encounters and the
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.760]  meetings and the, like, the waiting in the rest, for the restroom line and joking there. And this
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:47.200]  year it felt like the entirety of San Jose was the WWDC keynote hall or conference hall, where
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.760]  it's just like you were constantly running into people and making those amazing connections and
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:58.240]  having interesting discussions, whether you were at WWDC or outside or at layers or at, you know,
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:02.960]  social policy, the coffee shop or, you know, there's, it was great. Yeah. Social policy
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:09.520]  turned into like, like the second, second keynote hall. It was like, oh yeah. But like,
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.880]  you wrote, like when you originally booked your ticket, you like were only staying until Tuesday
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.080]  because you, you were like, I don't know, maybe half these people are going to end up back in San
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.640]  Francisco by Tuesday afternoon, you know, people are going to stay there. And it wasn't the case
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:31.680]  at all. Like, you know, the, and, and you're exactly right to, to the point where I question
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:39.680]  how San Jose functions without WWDC because in that downtown area, there's, there's, it's a very
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:45.120]  nice layout, but it reminds me of like a college campus. It's not really like a downtown, it's more
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:51.280]  like a college campus. And there's that park and there's, you know, the, the convention center is
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.880]  at one end and there's the, at least two of the hotels, there's a Marriott and I forget the other
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:01.280]  one, a Hilton, but they're right next to the convention center. There's the park. And all
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:07.920]  around that park is almost everything that you went to that, you know, a couple of hotels, the,
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:14.320]  the Sunday night screening of the app, the human story documentary was like just one block off from
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.760]  there, you know, like nothing was more than like one block away from that, that park. But every
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:27.440]  single person I saw everywhere was there for WWDC or one of the ancillary things like layers or
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.760]  AltConf or something like that. So I don't even understand how that entire area functions when
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:39.440]  there's not a conference. I mean, I know there are, there are tech companies that work just up
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.400]  the way, you know, there's Viv and there are a couple others sort of on that, on Mission Street,
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:51.600]  on San Jose's Mission Street. Yeah. So it's, I mean, there are people and there are,
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:57.760]  there are colleges nearby. But yeah, I don't know. Maybe, maybe there are just a lot of conferences
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.760]  and that's how they, that's how they run that area. Or maybe it's just happens to be like a quiet
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.640]  spot for the folks who work on market to go get their lunch. And then this week it just turned
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.720]  into insanity. But it wasn't even, but that's a funny thing, right? It wasn't really even insanity.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.760]  It was just the right amount of people to make that entire downtown area function.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:29.120]  And it seems like the conference, I forget what it's called, McHenry, whatever it's called,
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:35.440]  the McHenry Center, has more square footage than Moscone West. I mean, I don't even think there's
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:42.160]  a question about it. No. And Apple really took advantage of that. Like, I was on Jim
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:47.760]  Dow Rumple's podcast and we recorded it in the, did you make it to the podcast?
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:54.240]  I didn't, but Rene did. And he had a... Gorgeous. Absolutely. I figured it would just be like a
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.800]  little black box in the corner because that's all you need. You know what I mean? You don't need,
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:06.480]  it doesn't need to look good. But it was amazing because it overlooked this lounge that they had
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.360]  set up that was like several thousand square foot. And while we were recording like Wednesday
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:18.400]  afternoon or Thursday afternoon, whenever the hell it was, there must have been 1100 to 1500
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:25.840]  WWDC attendees in this lounge one floor down that we were overlooking, just downloading betas and
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:32.400]  chilling and just, it was a type of space that there was nothing like that, no ability to create
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:40.560]  a space like that in Moscone West. I think, I mean, Apple obviously doesn't say stuff like this.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:45.840]  They don't say like, we'll be back here next year. We'll find out when the WWDC is announced in April
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:51.600]  next year or whenever the hell they announce it. But I would bet heavily that it's forever going
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:57.840]  to be in San Jose, henceforth. I really hope so. It just feels way more Apple-y. Apple,
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:04.080]  it feels more natural to Apple. Apple got to control more of the experience within the
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:09.360]  convention hall and they got to control way more of the experience in the surrounding neighborhood.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:16.240]  That's the biggest difference. Oh yeah. Being able to have all the WWDC banners on the signposts,
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:22.880]  I think, went around for at least a square mile was very, very impressive. That said,
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:28.560]  I do feel if I have a suggestion to Apple, it would be that they should reach out to local
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:35.840]  restaurants and bars. Yes. And tell them to treat this whole week like a weekend.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:48.160]  Yep. More staff, later hours. So my live show was on Tuesday and my event horizon for that show is,
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:56.880]  be ready to go. And all I can think is be ready to go by 7 p.m. to actually step on stage and
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:02.560]  have questions ready. And don't make a fool of yourself for the next hour or 90 minutes.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.400]  And then that's it. Once that show is over, I have no idea what the hell is going on.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.640]  It was over. It seemed like it was a success. I felt like it was a really good show. I really
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:21.040]  liked it. Phil and Craig hung around for a little bit and we talked backstage and it was all very
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:29.920]  fun. And next thing you know, they leave and I wrapped up. I dot the I's, crossed the T's
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:37.200]  with the event staff in the theater. And it was about six of us. It was like me and Amy
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.440]  and Paul Kefastis who did a great job announcing the show and a couple of other people. But we
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.360]  needed dinner. And I'm famished all of a sudden because I had lunch like eight hours before.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:56.080]  Yeah, you're on stage time. And I only pecked at it. So we needed to go eat. And Paul found a place
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:01.680]  and it looked good. And it was, I don't know, a quarter mile away, third of a mile away,
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:05.360]  not too far, you know, nothing down there, but they're open till midnight. And it was like,
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:11.520]  so we could make it easily. And so we get there at 10 25. I remember this very specifically,
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:18.480]  it was 95 minutes before their closing time, we get there. And the woman is putting the chairs
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:24.400]  up on the tables. And she goes, Oh, we're closed. And, and Paul says, but you're open till midnight.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:30.880]  And she goes, that's what the last guy said. And clearly meaning like somebody was just there like
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.240]  a minute or two before. Yeah. And who thought that maybe they would be open until their state
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:44.160]  stated closing time, or even close to their state closing time. We just close our we close our
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.560]  kitchen whenever it gets slow. And it's like, that's not how ours work. Well, there's your
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:58.320]  answer about how the town survives when WWDC is not in town. Right, they just closed.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:05.120]  Yeah, yeah. Thankfully, thankfully, I did not have as many late hours as I did this year as I have in
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.800]  previous years. But we definitely ran into that once or twice, you know, going to someplace for
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.920]  dinner and having it be like, oh, out of the office for a few hours had to go, you know,
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:21.760]  it as I said, it feels like very small town, California in some ways. So maybe maybe if the
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:27.120]  the city can just be like, hey, local businesses, well, we'll make it so that you make more money
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:33.200]  than you probably will all year otherwise. Just just just treat Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:38.800]  that week like a weekend and you'll be fine. Yeah, exactly. Don't treat it like a typical Monday
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:44.640]  because it's not going to be a typical Monday. No, if you're closed on Monday, maybe maybe stay up.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:51.920]  No, anyway, but I do think it was great. I really, really enjoyed the just the fact that it seemed
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:58.480]  like everybody who you ran into was there for WWDC. It was it was really great.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.200]  Or if they weren't, they soon became part of WWDC.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:10.640]  Yeah, I and I, I would bet, you know, again, I have no inside knowledge. Nobody, you know,
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.680]  it wasn't like I asked Phil Schiller backstage, hey, are we coming back here next year? Because
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.160]  I knew he wouldn't answer. But so nobody said anything to me. But I would I would be shocked
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:26.320]  almost if if it wasn't in San Jose going forward, because it just seems to me like it was a rousing
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:34.000]  success. I hope it is. And on a on a like personal fun note. And one of the really cool things about
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.640]  San Jose is it's flat and and relatively, you know, relatively easy to get around. As you said,
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:46.240]  like all of the venues are kind of within half a mile of each other. I had my roller skates for
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:52.000]  some first of demos. And I ended up spending the last two days of the conference just going from
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.040]  place to place on my skates. And that is the best time hands down that I've ever had going from
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:02.720]  like building to building at a conference. And if they do it in San Jose again, I'm like,
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:06.560]  I'm bringing my skates. And if you and if they if they bring it back to San Francisco,
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:13.040]  you'd kill yourself. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I have I have skated in San Francisco precisely once
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:19.200]  and it was achieved escape velocity. Yeah, you don't there are certain hills, certain streets.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.360]  You're just like, No, that's not gonna work. Very, very. Nobody has ever described San
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:31.920]  Francisco as a very flat city. No, that's so much. Thank you so much serenity. I always
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.960]  appreciate having you on the show. Everybody can read your, your fine writing at I'm or you did
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.160]  a terrific is the transcript up or do we have the transcript of the transcript is up? Yes. And it
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:49.280]  was it will be it is 90%. But it will be fully finished by the time that this show is live. So
