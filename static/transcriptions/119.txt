[00:00.000 --> 00:07.660]  So, uh, this is the show, you know, all right. David sparks was, is this your first time
[00:07.660 --> 00:12.520]  on the talk show? I know it's kind of exciting. It's very exciting. This is the thing. This
[00:12.520 --> 00:16.320]  is the problem. I've been wanting to have you on for a long time. And the reason I've,
[00:16.320 --> 00:19.680]  I've put it off is I feel like it's going to take the entire episode just to tell people
[00:19.680 --> 00:26.960]  everything you do now. Busy guy, John, what you are prolific. It's you and Renee Richie
[00:26.960 --> 00:31.440]  and Jason Snell make me sick. I feel like I find, I feel like I get to a Friday and
[00:31.440 --> 00:35.160]  I feel like, you know, I recorded a podcast and I thought it was pretty good episode and
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.780]  I had one good article on daring fireball. I'm like, that's a good week. And then I look
[00:38.780 --> 00:44.000]  at like what, what, like something you guys do and snails on like 17 podcasts. He produces
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.820]  like 16 of them. Um, you put out a book and a discrete cast and do a podcast and keep
[00:52.820 --> 00:58.560]  it. And Renee of course writes about seven or 8,000 words a week. The, um, that there's
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.040]  a, I think it was the Lonius monk at one point who said it's not the notes you play, it's
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.120]  the notes you don't play. So, so you're like monk, you know, you're the guy. Uh, anyway,
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.360]  the podcast you are referring to is, uh, your long time show Mac power users, which you
[01:14.360 --> 01:20.200]  uh, co-host I believe from the outset with the wonderful Katie Floyd. Yep. Uh, and that
[01:20.200 --> 01:24.840]  is, and it, and uh, it just moved. This is, and it's motivated me because I, you know,
[01:24.840 --> 01:31.800]  somebody moves, you move a show, the goddamn feed redirection, it never works right. It's,
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.080]  it's terrifying. It is terrifying. It's terrifying when you move a show because your, your listeners
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.360]  are subscribed to your feed. Best thing in the world is when someone subscribes to your
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.240]  podcast because they're making a little bit of a commitment. And then when you do your
[01:43.240 --> 01:49.080]  next episode, you're getting it pushed to them when they open their podcast app of choice,
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.040]  or maybe their podcast app pulls it down automatically. But there it is. And that's great. And yeah,
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.520]  I know there's people who don't, who listen, who don't subscribe, who just wait and see
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.040]  if it sounds like a good episode and then they just hit play. And that's great too.
[02:00.040 --> 02:04.320]  Love listeners, but subscribers are the best because subscribers give you consistency from
[02:04.320 --> 02:09.760]  week to week. And then when you move networks or you just, even if you don't even move networks,
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.460]  if you just do something behind the scenes where you, where you change from WordPress
[02:14.460 --> 02:18.940]  to Squarespace or you know, something like that, you have to change the feed, something
[02:18.940 --> 02:23.160]  always goes wrong. And so it's always my, you know, my, I want to help people when they
[02:23.160 --> 02:27.120]  do stuff like that and get people to, you know, Hey, double check. If you were subscribed
[02:27.120 --> 02:32.360]  to Mac power users, go to the new site. Now the new site is a you're over there on the
[02:32.360 --> 02:33.360]  relay.
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.760]  Yeah, we were actually shutting down. We we've had mac power users.com since the beginning,
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.160]  which is kind of funny. That's back in like 2008, 2009, when we were starting the show,
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.160]  we were trying to pick the name of a show and you just search websites. Oh, Mac power
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.120]  users available. That's a good name. So we're actually shutting down the.com. We're going
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.480]  to forward it over to everything at relay. They've got a nice system over there. So it's
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.120]  going to be great where you want to go and you want to listen to the show and we'll,
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.800]  we'll talk about it a little bit more too, but it's relay.fm slash MPU. Yeah. Or, or
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.320]  type Mac power users.com and it'll get you there. Okay. So really it's the first good
[03:07.320 --> 03:13.620]  show on relay. Yeah. Well, that's what I think. I don't, I don't know how these guys got by
[03:13.620 --> 03:19.120]  without me, quite frankly. I don't understand either. Um, I think they're getting by on
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.320]  the, you know, the British accent thing. I know it makes it sound, you know, he's not
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.960]  really British, you know, he's just born in New Jersey. That's what I heard too. And he
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.480]  just likes, he likes to pronounce H funny, you know, and, and people like that. So they're
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.840]  in, yeah. And you know, his name isn't really spelled with a Y. He made that up too. It's
[03:37.840 --> 03:45.360]  also some kind of big iPhone cult. I'm, I'm starting to realize. Did you, um, when did
[03:45.360 --> 03:51.280]  you say to you and Katie started Mac power users? 2009. So that's interesting. That's
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.440]  interesting. In 2009 you still chose a name that started with Mac. Yeah. Well that was
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.960]  kind of the idea. We, um, it's kind of a, I don't know who cares about this stuff, but
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.920]  the, um, Oh, I care. I like to tell us, we were thinking about, you know, doing a podcast
[04:06.920 --> 04:10.280]  together and, and everybody, we were at Mac world and I'm just like, don't do it. You
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.200]  know, there's everything that can be said about a podcast has been said and they're
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.320]  kind of right. You know, they're like, well, Mac break weekly does the news and such and
[04:17.320 --> 04:20.820]  such. And I'm like, you know, I don't want to do something everybody else does. So we
[04:20.820 --> 04:25.400]  decided, well, let's just not do it. And we talked for like four or five months about,
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.800]  you know, what would we do? And ultimately I said, I want to make a show that just talks
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.440]  about one thing, a show doesn't have anything to do with news, just talks about how do you
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.920]  get better at email or how do you get better at this or that? And, um, and Katie's like,
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.280]  that's a great idea. It's good for like 10 shows and we'll be done. I said, well then
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.580]  we'll make 10 really good shows. That was 2009. So it's worked out and you guys have
[04:46.580 --> 04:52.040]  just hit at least, and for your audience and probably my audience too, it's, it, it counts
[04:52.040 --> 04:58.120]  as a round number. You just finished episode two 55. Yeah. So now you're, you're just about
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.880]  to enter your, uh, your second bite. Yeah. You need to bite integers now. Yeah. I mean,
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.560]  we're not messing around and, and you know what, there's plenty of, we've got stuff backed
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.740]  up. We have so much we want to talk about. It's, I don't know. I love it. And it's like
[05:11.740 --> 05:15.240]  getting ready for this cause you know, I'm also a lawyer, which is kind of nuts. And
[05:15.240 --> 05:18.200]  like I spent the whole morning doing lawyer stuff and just getting ready for this call
[05:18.200 --> 05:22.000]  and like shutting down Microsoft word and all the other stuff that I do in that part
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.980]  of my life. Oh man, it felt great. Yeah. I love the word, um, power user. I think that
[05:28.980 --> 05:35.600]  it like went full circle where in the early years of the PC revolution when PCs were just
[05:35.600 --> 05:39.640]  growing, growing, growing. I mean, let's, let's just say eighties and eighties through
[05:39.640 --> 05:48.360]  the mid to late nineties power user was used with no reservation in, you know, Mac user,
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.160]  PC world. You know, any of those magazines would talk about, you know, tips for power
[05:52.160 --> 05:58.800]  users and it's, I think everybody, it's nebulously defined because it has to be, there is no
[05:58.800 --> 06:05.640]  technical definition between, you know, as somewhat informed user and a power user. Um,
[06:05.640 --> 06:11.040]  but I think everybody, it, it, it fits a general loose description of somebody who's, who's
[06:11.040 --> 06:16.120]  truly an enthusiast really does want to dig into some of the details, but probably falls
[06:16.120 --> 06:21.200]  short of being like a developer, someone who can write their own code or, or at least at,
[06:21.200 --> 06:25.240]  you know, if they do write code, it's more like automator and Apple script and stuff
[06:25.240 --> 06:26.240]  like that.
[06:26.240 --> 06:32.840]  Oh, it's, it's absolutely aspirational for our show. And, and you know, the, you know,
[06:32.840 --> 06:38.560]  the ideal nerd in my head is John Syracuse. Uh, and, and the show is not for John Syracuse.
[06:38.560 --> 06:41.560]  You know, we're not going to talk about programming pro. We're going to talk. I mean, a lot of
[06:41.560 --> 06:47.360]  our listeners, it's kind of weird because our show has a big audience, but it's not
[06:47.360 --> 06:53.600]  the usual geeks listening to podcasts. I mean, doctors, you know, business people, you know,
[06:53.600 --> 06:59.460]  single moms, people who just want to get better at this stuff. So it's an interesting space.
[06:59.460 --> 07:06.560]  We occupied like, like, um, uh, somebody was telling me, I forget who, um, somebody had
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.060]  a dentist. So the dentist, I have someone of my friends has a dentist, but he's like
[07:10.060 --> 07:15.880]  a nut for max. And so he's always kept his practices. You know, he does all the it stuff
[07:15.880 --> 07:19.880]  for his practice and has a couple, you know, has always been a Mac guy and, you know, writes
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.000]  his own file maker stuff for the, you know, to keep the practice and stuff like that.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.400]  But he's a dentist, that's his full-time thing, you know, but he has made, you know, this
[07:28.400 --> 07:33.880]  little, little system of stuff that works exactly the way he needs it for his practice.
[07:33.880 --> 07:38.360]  You know, that's a power user and there's a good chance he listens to our show. We have
[07:38.360 --> 07:41.800]  a lot of dentists. Nothing we, I mean, we had, it's funny, we just have all walks of
[07:41.800 --> 07:47.120]  life, but it's fun. And with the Mac, there's so much you can do. I mean, what little automation
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.360]  tools, you don't need to learn to program. If you get good at Hazel or, you know, keyboard
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.680]  maestro or even just text expander, you can like make so much magic happen. So we talk
[07:56.680 --> 08:00.320]  about that stuff all the time. It's fun. I do think, and I do think though, and this
[08:00.320 --> 08:03.480]  is one of the things I want to talk about it. So you name the show Mac power users.
[08:03.480 --> 08:10.960]  And I do think, I think that even though the naming Apple related websites, Mac, whatever
[08:10.960 --> 08:16.720]  is probably always was a bad idea in hindsight, because something new is going to come. Like
[08:16.720 --> 08:21.440]  it would have, it would have worked out poorly two decades ago if the Newton had really caught
[08:21.440 --> 08:28.520]  on. But you, you know, it was harder to get legal permission to use Apple than Mac, even
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.720]  though Apple often objected to Mac, whatever names for some years. And then they kind of
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.600]  backed off that, but with, with the target audience of your and Katie's show, I feel
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.000]  like it really does work. Cause I think it's harder to be the nature of iOS and the restrictions
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.340]  of iOS make it harder to be a power user on iOS. And that's not, that doesn't mean to
[08:47.340 --> 08:52.640]  say that you can't be, I mean, there is text expander for iOS and then you can know about,
[08:52.640 --> 09:01.680]  you know, apps like launch center pro and workflow workflow is another good example.
[09:01.680 --> 09:11.240]  This is probably like the others. There's a bunch of power user text note type apps.
[09:11.240 --> 09:14.760]  But to me it's different. I don't know. And I do find it interesting cause I certainly
[09:14.760 --> 09:21.280]  consider myself to be a Mac power user. Right. And, and you know, BB edit to me is like the
[09:21.280 --> 09:28.720]  canonical Mac power user app. Omni group is at their entire lineup is everything about
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.200]  their apps is geared towards power users in my opinion. I mean, not that you can't like
[09:33.200 --> 09:37.000]  it like a casual user can't just start using some of their apps. Like you could just open
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.680]  on the outliner and just command N. And if you have any idea, like from fifth grade,
[09:43.680 --> 09:47.280]  what an outline is, you'll, you'll be right at home. But the whole reason that they're
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.040]  so successful and they can charge serious money for the app is that it's, it's got so
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.320]  many you know, power user features. You can tweak it to make it just the way you like
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.640]  it on the apps, like getting an Omni app and just using it out of the box without like
[10:01.640 --> 10:05.320]  really digging in is kind of like getting a Lamborghini and just driving it in parking
[10:05.320 --> 10:10.560]  lots. There's just so much more you can do with this thing. Yeah. But you know, our show
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.280]  doesn't, the way we've dealt with that is and I'd almost argue that you can get more
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.280]  automation stuff going these days on iOS, but you know, it's, it's still a journey,
[10:20.280 --> 10:24.480]  but the way we've dealt with on the shows we deal, we still do shows, entire shows on
[10:24.480 --> 10:29.680]  iPhone and iPad and iOS related topics. And we just kind of ignore a problem with the
[10:29.680 --> 10:34.760]  name. And I don't know if someday we've bought some other URLs and we've talked about it,
[10:34.760 --> 10:37.880]  but it's like, you've kind of got a brand now and yeah, I would let it go. I would,
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.560]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't worry about it. I think people understand. And I think, I think the
[10:42.560 --> 10:47.340]  thing that makes it work is that the type of iOS users who are going to be listening
[10:47.340 --> 10:50.960]  are going to be, they're, they're, they're PCs and Mac too. They're not windows people.
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.240]  You know? Oh yeah. That's the assumption, right? Yeah. I find it interesting personally
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.280]  though, because I still definitely consider myself a Mac power user. I have a lot of custom
[11:00.280 --> 11:06.960]  modifications, you know, the paraphrase Han Solo that, that power my whole workflow for
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.600]  almost everything I do from email to especially posting stuff to Darren fireball you know,
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.300]  custom bookmarklets custom automated services that I've written a lot of, you know, a lot
[11:20.300 --> 11:27.240]  of the stuff rated around the way I do markdown. Yeah. Two points on that. Two points on that.
[11:27.240 --> 11:31.280]  Number one, I wish you'd share more of that because you do post one. I used to, I used
[11:31.280 --> 11:34.740]  to post that stuff all the time and then somehow I've gotten away from it and I realized I've
[11:34.740 --> 11:39.120]  got like this backlog of what I think are some pretty cool shit. All right. And the
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.280]  second thing is I will give you the microphone for as long as you want on Mac power users
[11:43.280 --> 11:46.360]  one day to come on and just talk about this stuff. We, we don't have to talk about any
[11:46.360 --> 11:52.360]  news. Just tell us how you, it might be a good venue for, I really might. But I don't
[11:52.360 --> 11:56.880]  really use, I don't really do any of that type of stuff on iOS, on iOS. And I use my
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.760]  phone a lot and I've been noticing it with the watch and we can get to that later on
[12:00.760 --> 12:09.480]  the show. But I have been, I've been running my iPhone down into the red a lot lately,
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.280]  a lot more than I was even just like six months ago, but I don't really do anything power
[12:14.280 --> 12:19.520]  usery on it. I don't use any of those apps. You know, I don't use text expander. I don't
[12:19.520 --> 12:28.240]  use drafts. I don't use, I don't use lawn center pro. I don't use workflow. I have loaded
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.280]  all of them and I've looked at them and I've appreciated them and I can see why every single
[12:32.280 --> 12:39.920]  one of those apps has become a hit and has like a serious enthusiast following. But like
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.160]  the way I use my iPhone, it just, none of that really resonates. Some of the most productive
[12:45.160 --> 12:50.480]  stuff I've done on iOS is just sitting down, opening by word cause it's got a great iCloud
[12:50.480 --> 12:58.240]  sync and I'll just dictate text into it and no formatting, you know, no scripts, nothing.
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.020]  Just, I just want to get texts somewhere and like on the phone you can do that, you know,
[13:04.020 --> 13:08.400]  and and I'm a, I'm an indie guy now, so I'm out in my own old sense. I'm all, you know,
[13:08.400 --> 13:12.400]  I'll be sitting at Disneyland and I'll sit down for 30 minutes and just get a bunch of
[13:12.400 --> 13:17.680]  text into the thing. And the iPhone and iPad are great for that. And that's, um, that's
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.360]  a useful productivity tip. It doesn't have to be all, you know, I don't have to post
[13:21.360 --> 13:24.480]  from there. I don't have to format. I don't do anything. I just want to get texts somewhere
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.720]  and that gives me a starting point.
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.700]  Yeah, I think, and you know, the, the app that I helped design and make Vesper is definitely
[13:30.700 --> 13:36.340]  not a power user. No tap. It is very, very straightforward and obvious and there's, there's
[13:36.340 --> 13:41.500]  no secret stuff for, you know, it doesn't have any markdown support. That's like the
[13:41.500 --> 13:45.440]  most surprising things to so many people that it just doesn't do anything related to markdown.
[13:45.440 --> 13:49.080]  But then I say to them, well, I said, I write markdown in all the time. I just put asterisks
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.080]  around words. I want to be italic, put braces around URLs. I was like, so you know, it doesn't
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.120]  do anything with it, but it's like, that's the whole, my whole thinking around the creation
[14:00.120 --> 14:04.800]  of markdown lo these many years ago, what, what the hell has it been now? 11 years or
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.560]  something like that. Uh, that's crazy. Was that you could just enter, you know, an asterisk
[14:10.560 --> 14:15.800]  anywhere you were entering text, you know, but you know, it's, it's, I mean, I don't,
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.500]  you know, you have done so much good for the internet with markdown and I know it's a tool
[14:20.500 --> 14:25.600]  you just made for yourself, but you know, putting it out there, I, I'm, I'm really appreciative
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.440]  of it. And, um, I haven't wrote a book on markdown. I know, but the, uh, but it's just,
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.760]  you know, it's just so useful. I mean, I do everything in it and I don't know what, when
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.760]  are you going to get your app on the Mac? Cause I cannot wait cause I need, I need it.
[14:41.760 --> 14:47.960]  It's a long story. I, I, I need it too. I can cheat and I've been cheating because I
[14:47.960 --> 14:56.840]  have, uh, I have Vesper for iPad running in Iowa simulator 24, 24 seven, um, which is
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.600]  easy, right? It isn't great. It's not, you know, it's like weird, so weird. I don't know
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.920]  if you've ever, do you ever, uh, have anything running in like the iOS simulator? Yeah, I've
[15:06.920 --> 15:10.920]  fiddled around with it, but I understand. I'm not complaining because it's the iOS similar
[15:10.920 --> 15:13.960]  now. You're not supposed to use apps like this, but like if you paste text in the way
[15:13.960 --> 15:17.960]  you do it is you're in a Mac app, you select the text, you copy, you go over to the iOS
[15:17.960 --> 15:24.960]  simulator, you paste, but then you have to tap in the text field and hit the paste like
[15:24.960 --> 15:30.940]  pasting, just paste it into the iOS simulator Mac app. Then in the iOS simulator, you have
[15:30.940 --> 15:35.600]  to tap the insertion point where you want the text to go and then tap the paste button
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.960]  on the little pop-up menu to get it to paste into iOS. You have to paste twice and the
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.480]  same thing for copying out. You have to call it would make me crazy. Yeah, it's, well,
[15:45.480 --> 15:51.280]  that's probably why I drink. I don't know. No, but it's a long, long story that we cannot
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.640]  get into where, where vesper from Mac is, but we, we are keenly aware that, that everybody
[15:55.640 --> 16:03.320]  wants it. Oh yeah. All right. Good enough place right here. Let me take a break and
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.480]  do our first sponsor and it is a brand new sponsor. I'm very excited to have a new sponsor.
[16:07.480 --> 16:16.880]  I love this. It's a company called last bottle wines. Last bottle is a daily wine purveyor,
[16:16.880 --> 16:24.320]  much loved for its beautiful website, 30 to 75% discounts on fine wine shipping included
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.520]  and carefully curated and often highly sought after wine selections by long time. Napa Valley
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.920]  pros blast bottle takes all the hassle out of deciding on what to buy and makes it a
[16:34.920 --> 16:41.680]  quick and educated decision. Does this sound, does this wine sound great? Is the price amazing
[16:41.680 --> 16:47.320]  shipping included? Yes, yes, yes. So easy. Lots of places to buy wine online. Of course.
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.320]  In fact, the owners of last bottle had already been doing just that for years in the Napa
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.760]  Valley before building last bottle, the online wine business that instantly hit every wine
[16:57.760 --> 17:04.560]  drinkers buttons with a combined 66 years in the Napa Valley. These guys are connected
[17:04.560 --> 17:09.500]  and they use those relationships to source outstanding wines from exceptional wineries
[17:09.500 --> 17:14.520]  and put it in the hands of wine lovers at sensational prices. Cutting out the middleman
[17:14.520 --> 17:23.280]  one wine a day, every day. Sounds great to me. I really, I me personally, I don't know
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.620]  much about wine at all. This sounds fantastic to me, but here's the thing that they've got
[17:27.620 --> 17:33.380]  that's really pushed them forward is they're going beyond a website. They've, they're releasing
[17:33.380 --> 17:40.240]  a very simple, easy to use iphone app featuring push notifications of their daily wine offers.
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.960]  The team at last bottle wanted a way to reach a more connected audience of wine lovers and
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.160]  couldn't think of a better crowd to introduce it to than you guys. The talk show. Here's
[17:50.160 --> 17:54.280]  the other thing too. Some of these wines that they get, they're one wine a day. It's like,
[17:54.280 --> 17:57.640]  you know, like one of these deal a day type things, right? But it's just for wine. Well,
[17:57.640 --> 18:04.160]  here's the thing. Sometimes it's really limited quantities, so if you really want to get juiced
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.800]  into what they're offering, the best way you could do it is get these push notifications.
[18:08.800 --> 18:12.560]  You're only going to get one a day, but then you can go look at it and if it's one that's
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.880]  going to sell out, sometimes they sell out within an hour or two. You won't miss out.
[18:17.880 --> 18:24.360]  So if you are serious about wine or if you want to get serious about wine, check these
[18:24.360 --> 18:30.520]  guys out. It really does look beautiful. Really does seem like a fantastic way to learn about
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.840]  new wines and to get great wine sent to you at what seems to me to be great, great prices.
[18:35.840 --> 18:46.680]  Here's where you go. Go to www dot last bottle wines.com slash the talk show. That's last
[18:46.680 --> 18:54.320]  bottle wines.com slash the talk show and everything you need to do is right there on the website,
[18:54.320 --> 19:01.900]  using links to their app and etcetera, etcetera. So my thanks to last bottle. Great new sponsor.
[19:01.900 --> 19:07.260]  Don't you love that there's non tech companies now sponsoring tech podcasts? Oh, I think
[19:07.260 --> 19:13.920]  I've been saying to people, I think that that's not that I mind any of the tech companies
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.760]  that do sponsor it. I mean, because that's obvious why they do, but I think that the
[19:17.760 --> 19:23.760]  non tech products, it's brilliant and I think that all of our shows, all the shows that
[19:23.760 --> 19:29.680]  you think of that people who listen to like Mac power users or the talk show or ATP, uh,
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.920]  any of the shows on relay FM, it's really not about tech. I mean, there are other podcasts
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.200]  and other podcasts networks that, that maybe are more purely technical and sort of like
[19:39.200 --> 19:45.200]  the old divide between Mac publications and PC publications. Um, you know, and, and like
[19:45.200 --> 19:48.780]  the type of things where they, where they talk about, you know, their first emphasis
[19:48.780 --> 19:52.720]  is on a specs or something like that. That's a different type of world. Like, you know,
[19:52.720 --> 19:56.880]  this show is not about that. Your show is not about that. Our show attracts, our shows
[19:56.880 --> 20:03.760]  attract people who are picky and care about shit. That's it. Right. And tech just happens
[20:03.760 --> 20:09.000]  to be one of them. And so if your product, whether it's, you know, mattresses or wine
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.800]  or pillows or all this crazy shit, which I never would have thought that, that I'd be
[20:13.800 --> 20:19.040]  selling sponsorships for it. Um, I think it makes total sense that they have great success
[20:19.040 --> 20:24.440]  with our shows because you know, some chunk of our audience of the audience that listens
[20:24.440 --> 20:27.640]  to this show that cares about the Mac and iOS and really wants to hear us talk about
[20:27.640 --> 20:32.720]  the Apple watch also really cares about wine and uh, really wants to be able to buy it
[20:32.720 --> 20:37.720]  in a cool way and get a great price. Uh, so I think it makes all the sense in the world.
[20:37.720 --> 20:42.800]  Yeah, I agree. Sort of in a way that like a political magazine, no one would ever think
[20:42.800 --> 20:47.600]  that in like a magazine that focuses on like national affairs, that all the ads would be
[20:47.600 --> 20:52.460]  for politics. What the hell are you even advertise with politics? I think the thing with tech
[20:52.460 --> 20:57.280]  that might be, it might, and I myself felt, you know, fell, fell to this and then like
[20:57.280 --> 21:00.640]  I told you like years ago, I wouldn't have expected these, these types of sponsors, but
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.080]  um, like a national affairs magazine, what do they filter? They're filled with ads for
[21:05.080 --> 21:11.780]  cars and watches and you know, just all sorts of general purpose products. It also indicates
[21:11.780 --> 21:17.520]  that the, the platform of podcasting is getting more legitimate. I mean, when we first started
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.960]  doing ads, a lot of people really had trouble understanding, you know, they don't even understand
[21:21.960 --> 21:26.960]  the metrics because everything is different from traditional advertising. In fact, I talked
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.280]  to some traditional advertising guys that just poopoo the whole thing, you know, but
[21:30.280 --> 21:34.880]  you know, they don't understand that's where people are going to get content now. Yeah.
[21:34.880 --> 21:40.600]  Well in 2007 when this show started its first run with me and me and Dan Benjamin, um, the
[21:40.600 --> 21:47.520]  very first round of it, you could see those episodes at the talk show.net still. Um, we
[21:47.520 --> 21:53.200]  wanted sponsors and I was selling, you know, I was already, I think I went full time with
[21:53.200 --> 22:00.440]  daring fireball in 2006 so I was all and, and partially based on user, you know, direct
[22:00.440 --> 22:04.460]  support from readers, from memberships and t-shirts and stuff like that. But the memberships
[22:04.460 --> 22:08.640]  and t-shirts thing really was just the way that I launched going full time. The only
[22:08.640 --> 22:14.880]  way that I got to be in the black like month to month, which I think it was like April
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.440]  2006 when I announced I was going full time and sold a bunch of t-shirts and had like
[22:19.440 --> 22:24.320]  $20,000 or something like that that we cruise on through the summer and just kind of started
[22:24.320 --> 22:30.360]  mowing through and got like by August it was like we had like nothing. But sponsorships
[22:30.360 --> 22:34.120]  were starting to pick up a little bit. I remember by like it was either October or November
[22:34.120 --> 22:37.560]  where like the little Excel spreadsheet where we were keeping track of it, where it was
[22:37.560 --> 22:42.400]  the first month where it was like, Hey, this, we actually made a little more than we spend
[22:42.400 --> 22:49.160]  on all of our expenses. Um, so I was, you know, by 2007 when we started the talk show,
[22:49.160 --> 22:53.360]  I was definitely selling enough sponsorships for during fireball that made it a legitimate
[22:53.360 --> 22:59.280]  job. Uh, we couldn't find anybody to sponsor the podcast. I mean like nobody, we couldn't
[22:59.280 --> 23:05.400]  even sell it spots for like 250 bucks. Yeah. I'd never heard the daring fireball origin
[23:05.400 --> 23:13.640]  story before. It's interesting. Well, and it's, it's, it's a long story. It takes a
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.680]  pair though, you know, to like give up a job. Well, you've sort of done that. I was, I don't
[23:17.680 --> 23:22.640]  want to talk about me. Let's talk about you. So you have already said you are an attorney.
[23:22.640 --> 23:25.880]  Now you, uh, there's another reason I put off putting out in the show. Now you live
[23:25.880 --> 23:32.000]  in a summer in Southern California. Yeah. Orange County. Right. So that's why I've been
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.240]  waiting to have you on the show right now. Today here in Philadelphia, it is 70 degrees
[23:36.240 --> 23:40.440]  and sunny. It was 70 degrees and sunny yesterday. And I believe the forecast tomorrow is around
[23:40.440 --> 23:46.700]  70 degrees and sunny. So F you, I don't even have the weather widget on my, my Apple watch
[23:46.700 --> 23:49.680]  because I live in Southern California. What do you need that for? Somebody said that to
[23:49.680 --> 23:55.240]  me. We were, I forget. I had a friend, uh, Oh, it was, uh, Adam Lisa Gore. Uh, uh, the
[23:55.240 --> 24:01.520]  other week before he was on, on my show and we were preparing and he's so, so, so excited
[24:01.520 --> 24:04.920]  about the Apple watch and he was like, let me see. He goes quick without changing anything.
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.960]  Show me your watch face. And I sent him a screenshot of my watch face and he was like,
[24:09.960 --> 24:15.720]  why do you utility utility? Uh, it is utility. It's utility with known guest, no hour numbers
[24:15.720 --> 24:22.100]  with the date at three o'clock with the fitness top, right weather, top left. And right now
[24:22.100 --> 24:27.160]  I have my calendar at the bottom, but I, I did all around with that and sometimes turn
[24:27.160 --> 24:32.180]  that off, just turn it off to nothing rather than have that goddamn no more events in,
[24:32.180 --> 24:33.180]  in all caps.
[24:33.180 --> 24:37.400]  That's kind of the, the geeks are really mad about that. No more events thing. I don't
[24:37.400 --> 24:44.440]  know. It doesn't bother me. It really bothers me. And cause it bothers me because, uh, if
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.920]  it was a real watch, if it was a mechanical way of doing it, it would just blank out like,
[24:49.920 --> 24:55.080]  so the, the, the equivalent, and again, this isn't skeuomorphic, it's not, they're not
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.960]  making it look like it flips around and that it's a little cutout panel that shows this,
[24:59.960 --> 25:05.340]  right? I think they've designed it perfectly, but it is sort of mimicking the way that like,
[25:05.340 --> 25:09.160]  like the way that the, the little hour or not the hour, the day of the month thing at
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.280]  three o'clock, it, it's a little panel just like on a mechanical watch on an automatic
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.200]  watch. So if you think about like a train station and there's the board that shows all
[25:18.200 --> 25:26.100]  of the upcoming trains, um, when there's like room to show 12, but they, there's only seven
[25:26.100 --> 25:30.840]  trains coming in the next, you know, reasonable amount of time. The bottom five rows don't
[25:30.840 --> 25:36.320]  say no more trains. It's just, they just leave it blank. Like if there's nothing left, the
[25:36.320 --> 25:40.440]  natural state of a, of an information panel is to just show nothing.
[25:40.440 --> 25:46.200]  Yeah. And it's actually takes effort to have it display no more events. I mean, there's
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.800]  code that does that so that that code could display blank just as easily. The explanation
[25:50.800 --> 25:55.200]  I've heard, the best theory I've heard for why they show that is that if you are the
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.280]  sort of person, I think that the dividing line of whether you are bothered by this or
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.480]  not is whether you have a lot of events on your calendar or not. Do you live the sort
[26:04.480 --> 26:11.060]  of life where you have a lot of meetings and stuff like that, uh, and that you seldom see
[26:11.060 --> 26:17.240]  no more events. And when that's me and when you do see it, it's like a relief. It's, it's
[26:17.240 --> 26:23.760]  like an inbox zero type of euphoria that you get, right? It's like, ah, my day is done.
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.720]  No more events. It actually pleases you to see it because you started your day with a
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.660]  whole bunch of stuff that that that was going to cycle through. Whereas with me, uh, more
[26:33.660 --> 26:38.520]  often than not, uh, you know, I've got nothing on a, on a regular day or the only thing I
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.720]  have, I do have like a calendar subscription to the Yankees schedule. And so the only thing
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.440]  on my watch is just telling me the Yankees played seven, but I knew that already. You
[26:46.440 --> 26:51.600]  know, I don't really need that on the calendar thing. Um, I, it sounds to me like you're
[26:51.600 --> 26:56.560]  living right, brother. I think it's, I have a lot of events in mind. So I think, I think
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.840]  the no more events thing, I think it, hopefully it'll change. I could, I re you know, again,
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.880]  I just like a constant refrain of the last decade is I know like at some point around
[27:07.880 --> 27:13.480]  a decade ago, we collectively realize that adding preferences every time there's any
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.000]  kind of dispute over something is not the way to build sustainable software for years
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  to come. Because eventually you end up with, you know, at any given one feature, it's not
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.380]  a bad idea, but as a general principle, if you keep doing that, you end up with these
[27:26.380 --> 27:31.640]  crazy, you know, there's way too many preferences here and you're lost trying to find anything.
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.760]  But I do think that maybe this one should be a setting. And the reason why I feel like
[27:36.760 --> 27:40.720]  some people want to see that and some people are just annoyed by that.
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.960]  I don't know that anybody, you know, I guess on my side of the fence would really care
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.280]  if it never said no more events again. I'd be fine if it was blank at the end of the
[27:50.280 --> 27:54.580]  day. It seems like the people on the side of saying get rid of it are much more passionate
[27:54.580 --> 27:57.800]  about that than the people that would want to keep it. Yeah. I wouldn't mind too, if
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.240]  there was some way that it would show the argument I've seen is that some people say
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.760]  that if it showed nothing, it would create an anxiety in them because it would make them
[28:06.760 --> 28:12.360]  feel like the calendar wasn't sinking anymore. You know, that, that it had lost the connection
[28:12.360 --> 28:18.440]  and enter watch was no, and that they do have an event upcoming, but that the watch isn't
[28:18.440 --> 28:25.020]  reading it, you know, that somehow, um, I don't know, I can't really buy that. I it's,
[28:25.020 --> 28:29.080]  it's interesting because I used a pebble for a long time, right up until the time the apple
[28:29.080 --> 28:35.160]  watch released. And I was always, the pebble was always losing connection with the phone
[28:35.160 --> 28:40.840]  and uh, you know, whether it was a calendar entry or the weather or whatever, it just,
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.600]  you know, it, it was clearly bad or old data. And so ever since the apple watch arrived,
[28:46.600 --> 28:50.360]  I mean, that's just not even an issue for me. I always know that if I look at the weather,
[28:50.360 --> 28:53.560]  it's going to be the actual current weather actually where I'm located or the calendar
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.960]  data is going to be accurate. There's been no failure. I mean, I have complete faith
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.160]  in it at this point. And I guess that's probably unfair to pebble because they're not apple.
[29:02.160 --> 29:06.040]  They don't have the same access to the operating system that the apple watch guys had, but
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.120]  boy, it just works. In fact, that's the weird thing about the watches. You don't fiddle
[29:11.120 --> 29:14.840]  with it much. I, in my case, I mean, once I figured it out, I just started wearing it
[29:14.840 --> 29:21.160]  and it was my watch. And that was that what's your watch face, uh, utility, what color,
[29:21.160 --> 29:26.360]  uh, black, I mean, utility. Oh, the watch itself is the, um, what do they call it? But
[29:26.360 --> 29:30.040]  what's your, what's your highlight color for you to orange, orange, same here. Yeah. The
[29:30.040 --> 29:34.400]  default. I love it. Yeah. And me too. My high school was black and orange. And I always
[29:34.400 --> 29:41.960]  thought that those were it, not just out of like sheer loyalty, you know, to whatever
[29:41.960 --> 29:46.680]  shitty colors your high school had. I always thought it was a, it was a good look and a
[29:46.680 --> 29:50.960]  rare one that there's not many teams in sports with black and orange. Were you, were you
[29:50.960 --> 29:56.440]  the tigers? No, we were the, uh, the mountaineers, uh, tigers is a natural, I bet, you know,
[29:56.440 --> 30:01.080]  tigers is usually like the, uh, like the NFL, uh, Bengals, you know, it's a natural orange
[30:01.080 --> 30:04.520]  and black combo. My high school is black and orange shows for a minute there. I thought
[30:04.520 --> 30:10.080]  we may have gotten the same school. Wouldn't that have been funny, but the, uh, yeah, so
[30:10.080 --> 30:14.440]  I've got, and I've got the, what they call it, the, um, the budget Darth Vader watch,
[30:14.440 --> 30:19.880]  you know, the black aluminum with the, um, the rubber band, the black rubber and, and
[30:19.880 --> 30:23.720]  the orange. It looks really nice together. I did the same thing when I use the modular
[30:23.720 --> 30:28.200]  face. I have them all orange. Yeah. Yeah. I like the orange. My son has it, uh, as,
[30:28.200 --> 30:32.480]  as, uh, red, which I've seen a lot of people with screenshots, you know, for modular he's
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.280]  a, he's a digital guy. He'd get his watch. Last time I heard you talking to him, he had
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.800]  got it. He got it. He and ahead of schedule. Um, so everything, everything we've ordered
[30:42.800 --> 30:51.320]  for the house has shown up except for my black steel links watch, which seemingly nobody
[30:51.320 --> 30:56.480]  has gotten yet. My, my oldest daughter is freshmen in college. She got one and she got
[30:56.480 --> 31:01.400]  it finally. And she, um, she sent me a, um, a diagram on it. I'm like, oh, cool. She's
[31:01.400 --> 31:11.000]  sending me a message. She wrote poop. That's a good kid. Yeah, exactly. So you pooped on
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.240]  my watch. She said, yeah, I know. I tried to draw a pile of poo the one time and it's
[31:16.240 --> 31:20.520]  not, I'm not good enough. Yeah. I can't draw anything on this thing. I mean, just it's
[31:20.520 --> 31:25.240]  terrible. Yeah. I'm not, I don't know if that's really gonna be a thing. I, the heartbeat
[31:25.240 --> 31:30.640]  thing with my wife, that's cool. Um, the taps, you can kind of develop a language with the
[31:30.640 --> 31:36.400]  taps, but the drawing the picture thing, I'm not sure where that's going. Yeah. I don't
[31:36.400 --> 31:48.800]  know. Um, the other thing that I don't know about is, um, the, the interface for you,
[31:48.800 --> 31:53.660]  you tap the side button to bring up the little 12 o'clock, you know, the 12 spot dial for
[31:53.660 --> 32:01.480]  picking a contact. Um, and now that so many people I know have an Apple watch, are you
[32:01.480 --> 32:06.720]  going to be on 12? No, it's definitely. And so what do you do? I had to start, I've already
[32:06.720 --> 32:13.840]  had to cut people. Uh, and in that just doesn't even mention the people who I might want to
[32:13.840 --> 32:17.520]  have on a quick contact list who don't have Apple watch, but I want them there so that
[32:17.520 --> 32:24.200]  I could quick send them a text message, um, from my wrist. Right. I don't, is there even
[32:24.200 --> 32:29.640]  a way to send a, a tap or a picture to someone who's not on that list of 12? I don't think
[32:29.640 --> 32:35.380]  there is no, no, no, but you can still initiate a phone call or a text. So it's a way to tell
[32:35.380 --> 32:39.820]  you can actually tell whether somebody has an Apple watch registered to their Apple ideas.
[32:39.820 --> 32:45.960]  You put them in your, your friends list, that 12 spot friends list. And if they have an
[32:45.960 --> 32:50.580]  Apple watch, they have three options. Yeah. The center, the center button exists and if
[32:50.580 --> 32:57.320]  not, they don't. And so, um, I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago, like an anticipation.
[32:57.320 --> 33:02.960]  I figured, I didn't know, but I figured that Jim Dalrymple would be getting, um, it would
[33:02.960 --> 33:09.000]  be getting a watch before April 24th. So every day I was checking to see if he'd gotten one
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.160]  yet and then like on the 23rd he showed up with the thing and then I quick sent him a
[33:13.160 --> 33:20.520]  picture of a, of a day cause I wanted to be the first person to do it. But it is an issue
[33:20.520 --> 33:25.960]  because this watch is going to be popular and like if you want it, so if you want to
[33:25.960 --> 33:30.460]  be able to do that with a friend, they have to get on your list of 12 even though you
[33:30.460 --> 33:35.040]  may want somebody else that doesn't have a watch on that list of 12 or maybe you have
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.440]  more than 12 people that have watches and just seems like a very limiting interface
[33:39.440 --> 33:43.760]  for something that they clearly intend to be a massively important part of the watch
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.720]  given that it's the one and only feature that that is that you can do with. There's only
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.140]  two buttons on the thing, hardware buttons, and one of them, when you single press it,
[33:53.140 --> 33:58.620]  it's all it. There is no configuration. All it does is bring this side menu up or friends
[33:58.620 --> 34:08.400]  list up from the side and to limit it to 12 like that really feels really limited. It's
[34:08.400 --> 34:13.040]  just really weird. And now that I'm filled up with 12 somebody, I forget who it was,
[34:13.040 --> 34:20.240]  but somebody sent me a doodle the other day and I wanted to add them to my list, but I
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.000]  was already at 12 and then when at that point, what you have to do is you have to go to the
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.600]  phone and delete somebody and add that person manually. Like there's no way to do it right
[34:30.600 --> 34:37.200]  there on the fly as you, as you get it. Yeah, it's, I bet that evolves. I think it has to.
[34:37.200 --> 34:41.560]  I think it's, it's way too, I mean, I, you know, it would be easy to change. I don't
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.320]  think anybody's going to become addicted to this 12 people in a circle thing. So I think
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.960]  it would be easy to break that in the future and do something new. And quite frankly, it's
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.680]  already changed because it's a very different interface from what they showed in September.
[34:53.680 --> 34:59.600]  Yeah. Yeah. Was it a grid? I forget. Was it a grid I think or when they actually forget,
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.680]  but I know it wasn't a circle. I totally forget what it was in September, but I know it wasn't
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.300]  a circle. It's hard to look up on that because Apple sort of thrown the September thing down
[35:09.300 --> 35:14.000]  the memory hall. It's fun though. It's fun having this watch on and you know, getting
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.860]  notifications on my wrist and just the basic stuff, but it's also just fun, like sending
[35:18.860 --> 35:22.880]  taps to people and I don't know, I think they've done a good job with it.
[35:22.880 --> 35:30.220]  Yeah, I do too. So you living in Orange County, I saw that when you first got it and you wrote
[35:30.220 --> 35:34.120]  up your experiences with it right away, you had gone to Disneyland and it looked like
[35:34.120 --> 35:42.240]  typical Orange County weather. It was sunny. That to me is as it gets nicer and nicer here
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.440]  in Philadelphia as, as we go into May from April and it's a lot fewer overcast days and
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.680]  like a lot of more days like today where it's just absolutely positively perfect. I find
[35:51.680 --> 35:54.200]  it hard to read the watch in sunlight.
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.440]  Yeah, that indirect sunlight, it is harder to read. Although I find, I think that's one
[35:59.440 --> 36:04.920]  of maybe the reasons I like the utility face. It's very easy to, um, to see. I mean the,
[36:04.920 --> 36:09.480]  the hands are big enough that you're just fine. Like the chronograph, I don't know.
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.800]  I don't think I could read that even. I think that's very difficult to read because the
[36:14.800 --> 36:21.840]  hands are hollow. They're not, they're not yelled and the extra superfluous stuff. Um,
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.720]  there's just no way I could read that stuff. I'm, I'm 47. There's just, it's not even possible.
[36:26.720 --> 36:30.740]  I don't even know what those, what they're doing in there. I can't maybe a magnifying
[36:30.740 --> 36:36.840]  glass or something, but the, uh, yeah, it's, it's great. Um, the, uh, I haven't had a whole
[36:36.840 --> 36:41.000]  lot of trouble. I can, if I take on direct sunlight, I can see how the, uh, the panels
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.500]  not attached to the glass. Like I've kind of got used to on the iPhone and the iPad.
[36:45.500 --> 36:49.600]  And um, but you know, it's generation one.
[36:49.600 --> 36:53.360]  I don't know about that. I remember there was an ATP episode a couple of weeks ago where
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.120]  they were talking about how, whether the panel is attached to the glass or not. And I think,
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.600]  and, and I might get this detail wrong, but I think, and then in the next episode in their
[37:03.600 --> 37:07.420]  followup, there was one of the Johnny Ive videos where they said on Johnny, I've said
[37:07.420 --> 37:15.320]  on some of the, on some of the watches, the, the display is fused to the Sapphire crystal
[37:15.320 --> 37:20.640]  and that's all he said. So I think it is, I think it is fused to the surface. I think
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.520]  it looks pretty close. And I think that in certain lighting, you can definitely see the
[37:25.520 --> 37:31.040]  display through the Sapphire, but it's, it's rare for me, even in sunlight, it's rare for
[37:31.040 --> 37:32.040]  me.
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.760]  I wonder if, cause mine's aluminum and a, so I don't have the Sapphire crystal. I wonder
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.600]  if, well, and the ATB guys brought it up. What Johnny Ive said, and it's just as recording,
[37:40.600 --> 37:46.320]  it's ambiguous what that means for the sport models, because does he mean all of them are
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.080]  fused and, but some, only some of them have Sapphire or does he mean only the ones with
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.720]  Sapphire or fused? I don't know. I looked at my son's sports watch and it didn't look
[37:55.720 --> 38:02.280]  to me like it was any different, but I also have to admit that it at age 42 and with the
[38:02.280 --> 38:08.520]  trouble with my left eye I, I can really see the difference. Like this is the first time
[38:08.520 --> 38:16.000]  ever that I've had seen an Apple product where I really couldn't, I think the 38 actually
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  looks good on my wrist.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.480]  I think I could totally get by with it in terms of the size, but I actually do struggle
[38:21.480 --> 38:27.720]  to read it in a way that I don't struggle to read the 42. Yeah, I am my, my wife's cause
[38:27.720 --> 38:34.660]  I had the black one. Those were constrained. So my wife's blue phone, I'm sorry, blue watch
[38:34.660 --> 38:39.200]  with the silver aluminum showed up on day one and she let me wear it for a few days
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.840]  cause I wanted to fiddle with it more than she did. And it was 38 and it was fine and
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.600]  it looked good on me. But, but I agree once the bigger one showed up, I knew exactly that
[38:47.600 --> 38:51.000]  was, that was for me. I think Adam had the same thing. Didn't he? He was saying he did
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  the same thing.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.160]  So like for example, on the chronograph is a perfect, now I don't really use the chronograph
[38:56.160 --> 39:01.680]  that much, although I do sometimes. The reason I like it is that you can just switch to chronograph.
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.000]  So I have chronograph two, two watch faces over and then you're one tap away from starting
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.320]  a timer or a stopwatch. Like if you wanted to, you know, you know, like I do it like
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.320]  when I put charcoal on the grill and then just boom, start a stopwatch. And then I know,
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.160]  you know, once it gets to like 25 minutes, start checking it to see if it's ready. Yeah.
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.600]  Siri timer. Awesome. Just hold it down. But with the 38 millimeter, with my son's 38 millimeter,
[39:27.600 --> 39:33.840]  I can't read the sub dials on the chronograph. And if it makes me feel incredibly old, like
[39:33.840 --> 39:40.400]  the little, there's a, there's a stopwatch or a second hand underneath. And it depends
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.560]  how you have it configured, but there's two sub dials. That's what those little sub circles
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.360]  are. I can't read the numbers on him on his and I can read them on mine. It was about
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.180]  your age. I am. I w I noticed I was holding books out further and further from me as I
[39:54.180 --> 39:59.000]  read them. And someone said, you know, you, you may have, you know, you may have a problem
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.600]  there. And I, we were at Costco, I'll never forget. And they had, you know, the, the sample
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.820]  reading glasses and I put a pair on and looked at some words and I'm just like, ah, damn,
[40:07.820 --> 40:12.800]  I'm getting old. I'm looking at, I fix it on their teardown of an aluminum one and it's
[40:12.800 --> 40:17.320]  not clear, but it looks like it may be attached. It's pretty close to the surface. And I, I
[40:17.320 --> 40:25.360]  think that the effect, the overall effect of the entire black surface, whichever model
[40:25.360 --> 40:32.780]  you have, looks like it's the display and the actual display just takes up, you know,
[40:32.780 --> 40:37.080]  some portion within it, with these generous, what seems to be generous margins around it.
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.160]  In fact, though, like those, when you have stuff out to the corner, they're really writing
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.200]  it right out to the corner of the display. And I, yeah, it's crazy when you take a screenshot
[40:45.200 --> 40:49.320]  and you see, and you're like, wow, that doesn't look right. It looks totally perfect. Right.
[40:49.320 --> 40:54.680]  Yeah. Yeah. And you know, and it was definitely true with some of the initial apps that came
[40:54.680 --> 40:58.920]  out in April that they had way too, the margin, you know, they had like even just two or three
[40:58.920 --> 41:04.480]  pixels of margin. It, it really made their, their stuff look cramped. Have you done the
[41:04.480 --> 41:11.080]  fitness stuff much? Have you played with that much yet? A little bit. I, you know, I I'm
[41:11.080 --> 41:16.800]  getting back into running now that I'm clear to it with the, the I stuff. So I'm, you know,
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.600]  I'm using it to run a couple of times a week and I track, you know, sometimes I do it.
[41:20.600 --> 41:24.560]  I don't know. I think when I go out while I live in a city and so I walk everywhere
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.920]  and to me going on a walk, like walking somewhere, like if I walk to pick up my son from school,
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.280]  it's like one and a half miles away. So it's like three mile walk round trip. That doesn't
[41:33.280 --> 41:37.000]  feel like exercise to me, like walking. I mean, it's, I think it's good for you. And
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.680]  I think it's one of the nice parts about living in the city, but to me that doesn't feel like
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.160]  a workout. It feels silly to me to start the workout app and say, I'm going on a walk and
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.920]  I'm just walking, but I do it just to have it to play with. The thing I realize is it,
[41:49.920 --> 41:54.560]  cause I, I never really thought about heart rate much cause I walk a lot too. And I was
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.600]  thinking, well, I'm doing great with exercise. I'm walking all over the place, but wearing
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.720]  the watch for the first week, I realized, you know, I didn't do anything to raise my
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.440]  heart rate the whole week. So now the watch actually has changed my behavior. So now I'm
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.440]  like looking for Hills to climb or spending a little time every day, kind of get my heart
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.040]  rate up. And, and I'm not sure if it's just the newness of the watch, if this will stick
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.960]  or not, but it bothers me now when I get the end day, I haven't got my 30 minutes of elevated
[42:19.960 --> 42:20.960]  heart rate.
[42:20.960 --> 42:26.120]  Yeah. And I do think too, that the fitness stuff, even though I'm not a super big fitness
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.440]  enthusiast, but I'm wearing it every day. And so now I've got, you know, I'm up to like
[42:29.440 --> 42:36.280]  six weeks now of, you know, daily stuff. It is keeping me from like wearing my old watch.
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.440]  Like it's like the, one of the main, it probably the main thing that's keeping me from just
[42:40.440 --> 42:46.280]  wearing my old watch on, you know, just for kicks, which is something I used, you know,
[42:46.280 --> 42:50.560]  I used to switch between two watches and I anticipated that I wouldn't want to wear my
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.700]  Apple watch every single day or maybe even not most days, but the fitness stuff kind
[42:54.700 --> 42:57.600]  of motivates me too. And I've heard other people say the same thing because you don't
[42:57.600 --> 43:01.120]  want to have, you don't want to lose a day and have a day where it, you know, makes it
[43:01.120 --> 43:05.680]  look like you never got out of bed or even like when you get out of bed in the morning
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.960]  and let's say I'm going to be working in pajamas for two hours, I'll still put the watch on
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.040]  because I know I'm going to be going up and down the steps and doing something. I don't
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.480]  want to lose that credit. So it's funny. I'm very motivated to get this watch on as soon
[43:18.480 --> 43:21.640]  as I wake up in the morning.
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.880]  I do find though, I still find like before we move on from watch stuff, but I do find
[43:26.880 --> 43:32.100]  I'm still right from my first review one week after wearing it. I still am annoyed when
[43:32.100 --> 43:36.680]  I look at it and the display doesn't turn on for whatever reason. And it just happened
[43:36.680 --> 43:42.040]  to me while I was coming up the stairs, my office here at the house is second floor and
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.760]  I was coming up here to do the podcasts and my arms were full. I had a coffee mug in one
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.760]  hand and I had my thermos filled with the coffee that I've been refilling in the other.
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.840]  And so I couldn't, I couldn't tilt my wrist, but I got the, I got the tap that I had an
[43:56.840 --> 44:02.240]  alert and I look at my wrist to see what it was and it's just black. And I was just so
[44:02.240 --> 44:06.360]  annoyed even though I was only 10 seconds away from being able to set it down and see
[44:06.360 --> 44:10.400]  what it was. But it's like, if you're going to give me the tap, I want to see the goddamn
[44:10.400 --> 44:11.400]  thing.
[44:11.400 --> 44:17.160]  You know, my take on that is that they, um, at some point they said the one story we never
[44:17.160 --> 44:21.400]  want written about the Apple watch is that the battery dies at 5 PM. Yep. I think they
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.080]  said, you know, more than anything. And like, it also bothers me that, that it turns off
[44:26.080 --> 44:29.720]  in like, was it six seconds? Because sometimes I actually need more than six seconds, six
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.040]  seconds to process what's on the screen. And I just feel like somewhere they said, you
[44:34.040 --> 44:37.800]  know, we're going to make it extra sensitive. We're not going to make it turn on just anytime
[44:37.800 --> 44:41.320]  you flick your wrist, we're not going to leave it on long. And we're never going to have
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.040]  a story written that says it turned that the battery died at five. And I think they, you
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.920]  know, they kind of went too far. I mean, I go to bed things at 45% battery after an 18
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.240]  hour day. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah. I, for me, it's the battery has been such a non-issue.
[44:55.240 --> 44:59.000]  The only time I ever got vaguely close, never once ran it all the way down, but one time
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.960]  in the first week while I was really, you know, working pretty much morning to night
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.480]  on how am I going to write this first review of the watch, you know, when the embargo drops
[45:09.480 --> 45:14.360]  next week, uh, I mean, and really using it in a way that was not reflective of the daily
[45:14.360 --> 45:19.640]  use of it. It was really more like, um, um, I was almost like a quality assistance tester,
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.360]  you know, like I'm testing the watch. Like it was my job to play with it all day. I ran
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.680]  it down to the like 10% or something like that, but that was, that was truly abnormal.
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.280]  I do think though that there is, I haven't seen anybody publish any kind of specs on
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.640]  this, but I think the difference between 38 and 42 on battery life is truly significant
[45:37.640 --> 45:44.520]  because it seems like my wife and son who both have 38 definitely finished the day lower.
[45:44.520 --> 45:51.000]  Neither one has ever run out. Um, but they're both significantly lower. I was thinking I'd
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.660]  be buying an extra magnetic charger and like keep it in my car. And I had all these like
[45:55.660 --> 46:00.360]  ideas when I first heard about the watch and I don't need any of that stuff for me. It's
[46:00.360 --> 46:03.560]  plug it in at the end, you know, charge at the end of the day. You're fine. Yeah. But
[46:03.560 --> 46:06.720]  if I had a setting and I feel like the other thing they wanted to do, I think you're exactly
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.700]  right that they said, we don't want anybody saying that this thing is crapping out before
[46:11.700 --> 46:18.520]  they go to bed. Um, so I feel like the roughly day and a half battery life that they've hit,
[46:18.520 --> 46:25.960]  uh, is exactly right. Cause that way you definitely have to charge it every day, but you, I don't
[46:25.960 --> 46:32.040]  see anybody complaining that the watch is turning black before they go to sleep. Yeah.
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.680]  But I can, you know, and there are some hypothetical scenarios. I mean, I'm, I'm an old man and
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.240]  I just stay home all the time. Um, but when I was a younger man, there were times where
[46:40.240 --> 46:46.840]  I would, you know, spur of the moment, uh, wind up, you know, sleeping somewhere that
[46:46.840 --> 46:53.480]  wasn't my house. Uh, you know, just sleeping at a friend's, you know, you handled that
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.760]  really well. I don't even mean to imply anything. I don't mean to imply anything, uh, any kind
[46:58.760 --> 47:04.160]  of even adult situation, maybe other than the, the consumption of adult beverages. Yeah.
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.680]  When I was a younger man, it'd be more like an overnight halo party. You know what, you
[47:08.680 --> 47:12.960]  know what? That's a, that's an example too. No, I've, uh, like in college, like we would
[47:12.960 --> 47:16.900]  have, uh, uh, all night marathon sessions, you know, where you had to, if you wanted
[47:16.900 --> 47:21.680]  to play a network game, you had to be on the land. So that's a perfect example where there's
[47:21.680 --> 47:26.480]  nothing in a, I'm not implying anything inappropriate or that I let any kind of crazy lifestyle,
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.480]  but you know, in college I sometimes would not sleep at in my bedroom or I wouldn't come
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.240]  home until six or seven in the morning. You know, in which case I do wonder whether the
[47:36.240 --> 47:40.800]  watch, I don't know that the watch as it is today would, would make it, but then these
[47:40.800 --> 47:45.640]  like charging straps and weird things are showing up. I think that's all completely
[47:45.640 --> 47:49.680]  bananas. It's crazy to me and I don't understand because you have to, the only way to charge
[47:49.680 --> 47:54.200]  it is to, is underneath and that's going to, I don't see how that can possibly work with
[47:54.200 --> 47:59.360]  the, uh, with the sensors that they have because the sensors start going bananas if they're
[47:59.360 --> 48:04.300]  not connected to your skin. It's, it's funny how much time we spend, you know, as geeks
[48:04.300 --> 48:09.560]  spend thinking about battery life and, and batteries because we, the whole world has
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.840]  changed in the last five, six years. It's all mobile now and, and charging life and
[48:14.840 --> 48:19.900]  battery time is so key and, and, and it's the big constraint right now too. So everything
[48:19.900 --> 48:25.320]  you think about charging, I'm, I'm obsessive about it. I have a charging docs all over
[48:25.320 --> 48:29.040]  my house and like if I'm just sitting here right now, my phone's in a charger. It doesn't
[48:29.040 --> 48:34.680]  need to be. It's at 100% it's, you know, one o'clock in the afternoon, but I can't help
[48:34.680 --> 48:35.680]  myself.
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.960]  Have you found that your watch or your iPhone gets worse battery life now that you're using
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.320]  it with your watch? I haven't noticed any. I'm convinced that I am. I'm convinced that,
[48:45.320 --> 48:52.680]  and I think it's because I never used anything Bluetooth before. And so I had it on for,
[48:52.680 --> 49:00.320]  um, uh, what's the feature call hand? Uh, does hand off handoff required Bluetooth though?
[49:00.320 --> 49:05.360]  Or does it, I think it uses both. Yeah, it may not, but I know that like, um, airdrop
[49:05.360 --> 49:11.240]  requires Bluetooth, but, but it only ever before I started using Apple watch, I was
[49:11.240 --> 49:17.240]  only ever had the gray Bluetooth in the status bar. The gray Bluetooth means like Bluetooth
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.760]  is on, but you're not connected to anything. It's just, it's just low power mode and it's
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.560]  there for like, Oh, okay. Hey, you can hand off this webpage or this email that you've
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.600]  started writing on your phone to this other thing and then only really does anything.
[49:31.600 --> 49:34.960]  But now it's black all the time. It's the black Bluetooth because it's connected to
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.640]  the watch and I'm convinced I'm getting worse battery life on the phone. I'm still making
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.100]  it through the day, but I'm dropping into the red. Whereas in the first few months of
[49:43.100 --> 49:48.320]  using an iPhone six, I never was in the red. Yeah. He's Bluetooth headphones and stuff
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.520]  all day long. So it's, uh, I can't tell any difference. I'll tell you one thing about
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.600]  the watch that, um, I didn't expect to like as much as I do is the whole force touch thing.
[49:58.600 --> 50:05.000]  I mean, it just, I'm fine. I'm finding, I really like having that additional user interface,
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.600]  you know, methodology, like just clearing your notifications with a force press. Yeah.
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.920]  You know, it's, I hope that that stuff makes its way to the phone. I've said this before
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.380]  and I know it sounds like a joke, but my number two, I have two tips for anybody who gets
[50:18.380 --> 50:21.520]  sample watch is I know what you're going to do is what you're going to do is you're gonna
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.360]  rip open a box and you're going to put it on and you're going to go through the pairing
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.180]  process and just start using it and exploring and doing it on your own. So go ahead. I'm
[50:28.180 --> 50:32.280]  not going to tell you that, you know, take your vitamins, um, open it up, put it on,
[50:32.280 --> 50:35.760]  play with it. And then a day or two later when you feel like you're confused, you feel
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.640]  like you're not getting at all. Here's the two things to do. Go back to your packaging
[50:39.640 --> 50:45.040]  and reread the getting started pamphlet, which is just six panels. I'm not saying read the
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.920]  user manual. I'm saying just read that getting started panel, which is like, it's like almost
[50:49.920 --> 50:55.760]  a more like a comic book than a user manual. Um, because you, I guarantee you most people
[50:55.760 --> 51:00.240]  will find something that they didn't know or didn't remember. Like, Oh, that's how you
[51:00.240 --> 51:05.320]  do Apple pay. You start by double tapping that button. Like, cause I'll admit when I,
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.960]  I'll admit it's like when I would, the first week that I had the Apple watch, um, I, I
[51:11.960 --> 51:15.000]  couldn't get Apple pay to work. I went to whole foods and I held my watch up to the,
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.280]  I figured it worked like the phone. I knew that I had to double tap that button to confirm
[51:19.280 --> 51:22.920]  it. I just figured you start by holding your watch up to the terminal and then when it
[51:22.920 --> 51:28.660]  pings like, okay, ready for Apple pay, then you double tap to confirm and nothing happened.
[51:28.660 --> 51:32.840]  And I thought, Oh, well maybe I didn't set it up right. And then event, you know, but
[51:32.840 --> 51:35.960]  just read that pamphlet. I'm telling you that you're going to learn something. And there's
[51:35.960 --> 51:39.640]  so many questions. I see it on Twitter every day when, because people are still getting
[51:39.640 --> 51:44.720]  their watches and they're asking questions that are answered in that, that pamphlet.
[51:44.720 --> 51:49.560]  And then my, it's like the, the one that were, if you double tap the, um, the crown, it goes
[51:49.560 --> 51:53.680]  to the last app. Yep. People, I've seen people say, I wish there was some way to just go
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.040]  back to the last app. And it's like, there is a way you double click the crown. It's,
[51:59.040 --> 52:03.160]  they've really thought of that. And then my second tip, my only two top tips, my second
[52:03.160 --> 52:09.240]  tip is, uh, try force tapping everywhere. Yeah. Just any app you use, whether it's from
[52:09.240 --> 52:12.960]  Apple or whether it's from a third party, try force tap and see if there's something
[52:12.960 --> 52:13.960]  there.
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.780]  Yeah, you're right. And, and so often that's like the answer to all problems when you're
[52:18.780 --> 52:23.120]  stuck somewhere. The whole, you know, there was a lot of talk when the, when the thing
[52:23.120 --> 52:27.640]  first came out about two things. The first was everybody's complaint about notifications,
[52:27.640 --> 52:31.080]  which I never really got. Cause it seemed to me like, especially some of these people
[52:31.080 --> 52:36.880]  in a tech press should understand that notifications are entirely within your control. Um, but
[52:36.880 --> 52:41.040]  you know, it's not that hard to, to just notification that hasn't really been an issue for me, but
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.600]  the other one that I, I thought was kind of unfair is that the whole thing about saying,
[52:45.600 --> 52:49.840]  well, this is a different interface and it's harder to figure out, well, it is a different
[52:49.840 --> 52:55.440]  interface. It's a smaller screen, but I don't think you should expect it any different.
[52:55.440 --> 53:01.160]  Um, I do think maybe it would be better if there was a way, if you know, there's two
[53:01.160 --> 53:05.080]  buttons or whatever, there's one button you could press that would always give you a watch
[53:05.080 --> 53:12.240]  face. But, um, but I, I really think it really wasn't that hard to figure out.
[53:12.240 --> 53:22.160]  I haven't linked to it yet, but I almost certainly will. Um, before the show airs, we're recording
[53:22.160 --> 53:29.440]  on Thursday. It's probably going to air on Friday. Um, Steven Orth, I'll link to it.
[53:29.440 --> 53:32.120]  I'll definitely have it linked from during fireball. I will try to remember the link
[53:32.120 --> 53:37.200]  to it in the show notes here. I'm making a note right now. Um, Steven Orth had an interesting
[53:37.200 --> 53:46.680]  like first week with the iPhone, um, uh, blog post. And one of his ideas was that he thought
[53:46.680 --> 53:53.840]  that maybe the, um, the side button, instead of being underneath the crown should have
[53:53.840 --> 54:01.040]  been opposite the crown and that you could tap it to go back so that, cause he found
[54:01.040 --> 54:05.280]  that anytime he was in any app that had like a navigation, you know, like here's the root
[54:05.280 --> 54:09.000]  and then you tap a thing and then you go in and then there's a little back button up there
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.520]  that it's really hard to tap that back button. And I completely six weeks in, I still miss
[54:13.520 --> 54:19.920]  back buttons a lot in that upper corner. Uh, or depending on the app, I've, I'll try to
[54:19.920 --> 54:24.600]  be hitting that back button and even worse than missing it, I'll hit something beneath
[54:24.600 --> 54:30.920]  it. Um, like I've been trying, I've been experimenting with wonder list, um, for like shopping and
[54:30.920 --> 54:35.560]  stuff like that. Like create a little shopping list in wonder list and then it's on my wrist
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.140]  and I don't have to go through the supermarket fiddling with a phone. I can just keep going
[54:39.140 --> 54:44.000]  into my wrist, but I find that sometimes, um, you know, I'll try to hit the top item
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.440]  to either check it off and I'll hit the back button that goes back to my list of lists
[54:47.440 --> 54:50.920]  or I'll try to go back to the back of list of lists and I ended up checking the top item.
[54:50.920 --> 54:56.120]  Um, so his idea is put a hardware button to go back, which I don't think is a good idea.
[54:56.120 --> 54:59.620]  And I think if you put it opposite the digital crown, it would actually create the same sort
[54:59.620 --> 55:05.880]  of problem people have with the power button and the volume up button on the iPhone six
[55:05.880 --> 55:09.760]  where people, cause they're opposite each other and when people put their fingers on
[55:09.760 --> 55:12.680]  both of them and then they try to squeeze one and they end up squeezing the other.
[55:12.680 --> 55:16.360]  Yeah. How many times you've got to take a picture and turn your camera, your phone off,
[55:16.360 --> 55:21.840]  you know, the, um, that, that New Jersey guy, Mike Hurley and, and, um, and Jason still
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.920]  on the upgrade podcast a few weeks ago did kind of a thing about this. And Mike made
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.340]  the point that, you know, the home screen on the watch is the watch face, you know,
[55:32.340 --> 55:35.640]  and I thought he made a really great point that it should be all, there should be one
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.160]  button that just gets you to the watch face at any time. And the problem with the digital
[55:40.160 --> 55:44.280]  crown is that it's inconsistent. Sometimes it does that. Sometimes it goes somewhere
[55:44.280 --> 55:48.220]  else and I, you know what the guys at Apple, I'm sure they spent a lot of time figuring
[55:48.220 --> 55:53.340]  this out, but, but I do appreciate the idea of, of just every user knows they press one
[55:53.340 --> 55:58.180]  button and the watch face comes up and from there, uh, hopefully you figured out gestures
[55:58.180 --> 56:00.320]  enough to be able to get to wherever you need to go.
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.400]  Yeah, it's a great, I really do think that that's true. And I think calling the list
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.680]  of apps, the home screen, I don't even know if Apple is calling it the home screen. I
[56:07.680 --> 56:11.900]  don't know if they even call it that, but it's not, you know, and it's, it only serves
[56:11.900 --> 56:18.440]  to confuse you to make you think that it's, that that watch works like a little iPhone.
[56:18.440 --> 56:23.520]  Um, and I do think that that is a great point. Um, because I think part of the beauty of
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.280]  iOS is that the, that's the way the home button works. No matter where you are, you can hit
[56:28.280 --> 56:32.480]  that home button and it's going to take you to the home screen.
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.680]  But then looking at my wife and daughter who neither one of them are geeks or wannabe Mac
[56:36.680 --> 56:42.480]  power users or anything like that, they use the watch is just fine. You know, I mean they,
[56:42.480 --> 56:47.320]  they're not having any trouble using it, so maybe they did it right. I don't know. Right.
[56:47.320 --> 56:52.520]  But the way on icon iOS, like you just single tap that home button and it takes you to your
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.960]  home screen and it doesn't matter if you're in an app, you hit the home button and takes
[56:55.960 --> 56:59.800]  you to the home screen. If you're already on the home screen and you've brought up a
[56:59.800 --> 57:05.400]  control center or you've brought down notification center, you can hit the home screen and it
[57:05.400 --> 57:06.400]  goes away.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.840]  Now you don't have to because you could just tap to get it to go away. But if you don't
[57:08.840 --> 57:13.040]  know to do that because there's no button that says make it go away, just hit that home
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.120]  button and it takes you there. So I can kind of see the logic of if there was just a button
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.640]  that always took you to your watch face.
[57:19.640 --> 57:27.360]  No, I think users would appreciate that. It's um, it is fun though. I'll tell you why. It's
[57:27.360 --> 57:32.800]  just fun when Apple makes something new, like a 1.0 product. I agree. And just to see what
[57:32.800 --> 57:36.640]  they've done with it. And I know I'm a geek and all that stuff, but it's just cool to
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.900]  be part of it. I think the one that excited me the most when it came out was the iPad
[57:40.900 --> 57:46.260]  because it just, I dunno, I just felt like it was such a great idea and it was just so
[57:46.260 --> 57:51.340]  awesome when it showed up. I, but the, um, but, but both, both the iPad and the iPhone,
[57:51.340 --> 57:56.680]  when they came out, I spent weeks just like going over every detail and just playing with
[57:56.680 --> 58:01.680]  them. And the thing about the, the, the watches, I didn't spend that much time fiddling with
[58:01.680 --> 58:05.800]  it. I mean, I kind of got it set up the way I wanted. I got my watch face picked out and
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.880]  I put it on and I went on with my day, but I'm just using it just as intended all the
[58:10.880 --> 58:13.880]  time. I think it's a good thing, but it is different.
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.720]  Yeah, definitely. Hold that thought though. Let's take a break and talk about our second
[58:19.720 --> 58:24.000]  sponsor. Uh, it's another, it's not the first time this is actually a return sponsor, but
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.960]  it's been a while, but definitely not a tech sponsor. Um, I want to tell you about the
[58:29.960 --> 58:36.680]  best Caesar. Now this is not your ordinary Caesar salad recipe. Uh, this is something
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.900]  different. This one's got bite, it's bold, it's edgy, it's sharp. Uh, it's the perfect
[58:41.900 --> 58:46.560]  combination of ingredients and it's this powerful salad dressing will leave you wanting more.
[58:46.560 --> 58:52.720]  Yes. The sponsor is a Caesar salad recipe. Uh, and they're back and they did great with
[58:52.720 --> 58:57.040]  their last sponsorship, which is why they're back. I love this. I personally, I do. I love
[58:57.040 --> 59:00.600]  Caesar salad. Caesar salad is like one of my go-tos in any restaurant. If there's a
[59:00.600 --> 59:05.840]  Caesar salad on the appetizer list, I'm, I oftentimes I just stop even looking to see
[59:05.840 --> 59:11.320]  what else they have. Um, so it's an app. You go there, it's an app, it's free app. You
[59:11.320 --> 59:15.800]  can learn the recipe, enjoy it for a lifetime. Um, it's been downloaded in over a hundred
[59:15.800 --> 59:21.020]  countries and has been featured on many fine blogs and podcasts and it was selected, uh,
[59:21.020 --> 59:25.680]  as one of the best new apps on the app store by Apple is one of their featured apps. Uh,
[59:25.680 --> 59:31.600]  it will also be part of this year's upcoming documentary app, the human story. Now that's
[59:31.600 --> 59:38.000]  that a Kickstarter project, uh, that started last year. Uh, great part. I've, I'm actually,
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.980]  uh, I've been interviewed for that, uh, documentary to a great, great thing that's I think getting
[59:42.980 --> 59:47.080]  a lot closer to completion. Uh, so anyway, the best Caesar was one of the apps featured
[59:47.080 --> 59:53.920]  in the documentary. Uh, it's available exclusively for iPhone and iPad. Join tens of thousands
[59:53.920 --> 59:58.760]  of people from around the globe. We've been using this app to learn, to make the best
[59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.920]  Caesar salad, the talk show listeners. Here's the deal for you. The best Caesar is available
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.680]  for free on the app store. All you have to do is download it and you will be filled with,
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.600]  with the, with a burning desire to create your own best Caesar salad. Make it, share
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.360]  it with your friends, devour it, eat it, take photos of every step of the process. Um, and
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.440]  you can visit the best Caesars, Instagram, Facebook or Twitter and share your pictures.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:28.760]  Um, perhaps you can even, uh, pair your meal with a fine wine from our other sponsor. Last
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.360]  bottle wines, right? Get a bottle of wine. It'll go well with a Caesar salad. Sign up
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:38.560]  for both. So satisfy your craving. Get this app, learn the recipe. Um, here's where you
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:47.040]  go. www dot the best Caesar.com slash the talk show. So it's the same slug as the other
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:55.920]  sponsor slash the talk show. Caesar is S a E S a r.com the best Caesar.com slash the
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.340]  talk show really is a great sound. I have to say I said a really good idea for the talk
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:06.920]  show, like a running bit. It could be like a Seinfeld episode and at the end of every
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:12.400]  show you could like tell a story that involves all of your sponsors and just close it out.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:20.000]  It could be tough, but the thing you need that base sound at the end, it would help
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.200]  if we had, uh, if we had the Casper mattresses and the hello pillows, but we don't as they're
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.800]  our final two sponsors, but then we could, we could tell a little story about eating
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:37.240]  a salad, drinking a whole bottle of wine and finished the whole bottle of wine and we needed
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:44.240]  a nap. Um, here's one more before we go move on from the watch. But, um, this is one that
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:52.880]  I've been thinking about. Um, I have turned on, if you go to settings, text and something,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.680]  it's like two things that don't really seem like they belong in the same settings panel,
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:05.720]  brightness and text, um, text size. Uh, I've turned on the option for bold text. Have you
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.880]  ever tried this? No, I haven't. So I think a lot of people probably haven't who might
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:18.000]  have because when you toggle it, either way, it pops up a dialogue that says, Hey, changing
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.560]  this setting requires restarting your watch. And so when I first week that I had it, I
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.500]  saw that and I was like, ah, I'll do that later. Cause I don't feel like restarting
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.640]  the watch right now. It takes like two or three minutes for the watch to reboot. Um,
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:38.520]  I really liked the way it looks and I don't even think that it's an accessibility issue,
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.880]  although it could be for some, um, but it's not under general accessibility. It's under
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.640]  tech settings. It's like a legitimate option. Um, I really liked the way it looks now. The
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.520]  truth is I'm, you know, as we spoke about before, uh, I'm 42 my, so my perfectly healthy
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:03.200]  right eye, uh, is already sort of on the beginning cusp of, um, requiring reading glasses. Uh,
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:11.360]  and my left eye is a mess. So, uh, uh, you know, part of it is it may be age related
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.420]  maybe, but I kind of like it even like when I don't even have my contacts in and my eyes
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:22.000]  really can't, I can still see super good up close. Um, I really liked the way the bold
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.200]  text looks. I really think it looks sort of, it's sort of like the way that in the classic
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.480]  Mac OS that like Chicago was sort of a bold, boldish font.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.080]  I just, I just activated it while you were talking and I can see that. See, I know you're
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.040]  very particular about typography, so I never thought you'd be the guy who, uh, who tested
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.200]  that. I think you would want the built in,
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.720]  but I really love it. And especially here's where I especially love the bold text is on
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.560]  watch faces, not even, I feel like it looks a little bit weird when you get like a text
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.580]  and you see the text, you know, I kind of what I would really like to talk about power
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.640]  user features. Like if, if there was an equivalent of like the way you can do like defaults,
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.560]  right? Hacks on, on a Mac OS 10 to get preferences that aren't even available visually. What
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.660]  I would love to do is turn it off everywhere except watch faces and only have it on watch
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.280]  faces. It just, what it means is that all the complications have bolder, slightly bolder
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.760]  texts. It's not like bold. It's like switching from a light ish version of San Francisco
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.680]  to a like a medium bold, semi bold version of San Francisco. And I feel like it's a really
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.760]  good look and in a way that to me looks a lot like, like a lot of real mechanical watches
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:46.160]  have fonts on the dial that are of this rough weight, you know? Yeah. And it really, and
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.120]  to me it also to go back to the viewing it in sunlight, it makes the complication text
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.040]  easier for me to read in sunlight. Do you think they're going to allow developers to
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:03.520]  submit their own watch faces at any point? No, I do not. I really don't because I think
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.560]  that or, or I think most likely no. And I think if they do, it'll, it'll be a system
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:16.480]  that runs like the way Apple TV runs today where they will be partnerships that are cultivated
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.120]  through Apple, that there is no, there will, you know, there's an app store already for
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:28.700]  apps that has thousands of apps from anybody and everybody. I think if they ever do third
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:34.560]  party watch faces, it would be like Apple TV and it would be a cultivated list that's
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.880]  hand selected and approved by Apple at a very high level.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:42.880]  Yeah. It's like on the pebble they had, you know, it was just, it was a crazy, I mean,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:49.080]  people had these nutty faces, but then occasionally someone would do like a really classy Futura
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.840]  based watch face that looked really, really actually better than anything that they had
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.320]  in their own building. David, you realize you're speaking about pebble in the past tense.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:05.480]  Well, that's true in my life. It is a past tense at this point.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:11.440]  You didn't even realize it. No, I didn't. I have a pre-order in for the pebble time.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.680]  I keep wanting to call it pebble color, which is what I feel like they should have called
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.900]  it, but it's called pebble time. But the thing that I can tell is going to be, it's, I can
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.960]  tell it's going to be a nonstarter and I feel bad for them, for me at least maybe some people,
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.080]  you know, some people might really still prefer it, but for me, the thing that kills it is
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:35.360]  the fact that this, the display is so clearly different from the bezel around the display.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.960]  Yes. It doesn't matter what to me, whether it's color or not, to me, it just looks so
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.400]  inelegant. It looks like you have a little screen strapped to your wrist.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.160]  I know it's cheaper. So that's a, that's a motivation. I know you can run it for several
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.960]  days, but the thing, you know, having used one for a year, just the fact that, you know,
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.480]  it just didn't stay paired consistently with an iPhone. And maybe if you've got an Android
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:03.480]  device, you're better off, but with an iPhone, I just found it very inconsistent. And, and
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.840]  that was just, you know, frustrating. So, and I don't have that problem at all with
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.980]  the Apple device, of course.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:17.240]  One of the weird things about this, that I hate calling them smartwatches, just the new
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.720]  digital watch 2.0 era, these new computerized digital watches is that you don't really have
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.800]  a lot of choice. It really, it all starts with what phone you use and pebbles trying
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.080]  to straddle these two worlds. And I wish them the best of luck. I that's why I pre-ordered
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:37.360]  the time. I hope that they make it. And I hope that they, you know, I feel like we need
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.200]  more companies like pebble to succeed, but I just feel like it's so hard because they're
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.760]  fighting these massive, massive companies like Apple and Google who have these resources
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.220]  that are just so hard for them to match. Well, they can't match the resources, but the fact
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:59.640]  that they can't makes it harder for them to compete. But like the Android wear versus
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.320]  Apple watch, there's, it's not even a debate, like whatever, you know, like if you're, if
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.440]  you use an iPhone, you know, I, I, Android wear doesn't work with it. And I know there's
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.640]  rumors that they're going to make it work with it. You know, like in the next month
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.040]  or two at Google IO, but it's not going to be the level of integration that Apple watch
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.360]  has, cause they're only going to be able to do the things that like pebble can do with
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.240]  iOS, which is all limited by the app store restrictions for what an app can do, you know,
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.240]  and you're going to have this fiddly setup process for Bluetooth, where you have to enter
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.460]  four digit code. It's, it's just going to be limited. And if you have an Android phone,
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.720]  you do, you don't even have a choice to use an Apple watch.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.560]  I grew up in the era where, you know, you'd be trying to use a Palm pilot with a Mac or
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:51.080]  a Tandy, you remember those Tandy word processor, you know, the little, you know, all the little
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.000]  things, you know, all these technology that wasn't Apple based, trying to get to work
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.200]  with Apple. And it was such a pain that I just have like zero tolerance for even trying
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.200]  that stuff at this point. I mean, if Apple makes both pieces, I'm just going to use the
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.840]  thing that really, I had a handspring visor. My wife had one too, which we, and she probably
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.160]  used it more than I did, which is pretty interesting because it, you know, this is back around
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.040]  99, 2000. And I remember it was when I was working at bare bones software and my pal
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.800]  Jim Korea, who's now at the Omni group, like he did like the best thing ever. He bought
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.640]  like 25, like replacement styluses for the handspring visor. And so it was like a jar
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.560]  of candy on his desk. Like, you know, just go, you know, all right, Jimmy, give me five
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.920]  more. Got one in every, but then you never had to worry about it. Cause like losing your
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.680]  goddamn stylus was it. And I'm pretty careful with my devices, but it was like, it was a
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.000]  common problem. But anyway, I sinking your stuff to your Mac was the biggest. I think
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.640]  it was what kept me from, you know, eventually made me abandon it. And part of the problem
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.400]  too, is that the max of that era didn't really have standard system databases for things
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.520]  like that. There was no built-in contacts, you know, and the classic Michael is there
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.960]  was no standard context. So it's like, you could sync with something, but it was like
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.680]  a limited number of third-party options and there was no standard system-wide calendar.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.400]  I tell people, cause when everybody, somebody gets into the discussion with me about app
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.520]  pricing, I talked to them about how my Palm pilot about every month or two, it would just
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:23.360]  duplicate all of my contacts. And if I didn't fix it and another month I would have four
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:29.440]  copies of every contact and so on. And somebody made an app and it was $50 and all it did
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.000]  was go out and knock out duplications. And I was so happy to pay it, you know, and now
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.600]  it's like, Oh, this Apple change your life and it'll be, you know, it'll allow you to
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.960]  get your work done and go home earlier. How much is it? Five bucks, five bucks. What are
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.960]  you talking about?
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:11:01.440]  It's so true. I think software, it's crazy. I don't, it's like an inverse curve to like
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.600]  the price of a cup of coffee. The more coffee gets, the more, the less willing people are
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:12.840]  willing to pay for apps. I don't know.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:19.240]  Joanna Stern of the wall street journal had a, her column a couple of weeks ago was about
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:27.200]  how to fix up your your contacts database. You know, that if you like her over the years
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.160]  have wound up, like she had like four entries for her dad. Like one was just his email.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.440]  One was just his phone number. You know, one, you know, like if, if you have a relative,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.400]  like you're even uncle Bob, but he's also listed as Robert, you know, and it's two entries
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.640]  and you know, that there's a bunch of these utilities that you can, you can buy to, to,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.320]  you know, fix it all. And it's, I saw like in the comments, people were like $4. Yeah,
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.260]  but it's like, it would save you. Like, it's like her whole thing was like, you know, it,
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.320]  if you have 500 contacts and you did it by hand, if like these apps can help you, like
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.680]  they could, you could easily save an hour. Right. And so, and how, who doesn't, whose
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.000]  time is not worth $4 for an hour or whatever the price.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.480]  Imagine you're on your deathbed and you can say, you can live another hour. It costs you
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.480]  $4. What are you going to say? You know, I mean, I don't know. All right. So speaking,
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.140]  speaking of hourly billing, let's talk about you in your career. So you're, you're an attorney
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:32.680]  and had been, what was, what was your practice? A business. I'm a business attorney. I represent
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:37.880]  small companies. I've been doing it for 21 years, but I was in a law firm the whole time
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.320]  until about two months ago. And I, I, I got out of there, man. I, I hit the brakes. So
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.880]  all of this other stuff that you've been doing, all the podcasting, the blogging, all the
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.780]  writing and all this stuff has all been on the side of you being a full-time partner
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:57.600]  in a law firm. It was never a partner. It was the way it was set up. It just wasn't
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.080]  set up that way. But yeah, I was, I was always a full-time lawyer throughout the whole process.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:10.000]  And now you are, you've not retired, but you quit that, quit that job. Now you're doing
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.360]  this stuff full-time, but you also have your own new law practice. Yeah. It's weird. You
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.520]  know, it's like maybe looking back, I mean, I guess I'll know in a few years, you know,
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.000]  it's a very public thing. You know, when you quit a job that's pays well and you've got
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.480]  insurance and all that stuff and you're like, okay, and I'm going to do that. And I'm going
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.420]  to write about, you know, the Mac and, and do some law stuff too, but I wanted to have
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:40.400]  more control and, you know, just, you know, as you get older, you just, that control thing
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.800]  is more important to you. I don't know. Maybe at some point I wanted to be like a big time
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.020]  lawyer in a big time firm, but that's just not me. I like representing small guys. I,
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.160]  my clients are, you know, I represent a lot of software developers and I do contracts
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.260]  for them and stuff like that, you know? So, um, this was something I could have done on
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.980]  my own, but I just didn't want the overhead. I didn't want any more meetings. I just didn't
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:07.920]  want all the stuff that comes with being as part of a big operation. And, and, um, I've
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.840]  also been doing the max barkey stuff, so I wanted to be able to have more time for that.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.300]  So I figured out if I worked a little bit less as a lawyer and a little bit more as
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.540]  max market, I'd have a better balance in my life. So I, I went out and announced that
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:23.160]  I've done this and now the whole world can watch me, you know, go down in flames or,
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.840]  or make it work. I'm not sure. I'm still in that point with you where I'm looking at the
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.600]  Excel spreadsheet every month, but the, um, but it feels absolutely the right thing. I
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.600]  mean, I'm already, I was just telling my wife, I said, I got to make this work cause there's
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.940]  no way I could ever go work for somebody ever again. I've got to make this work, but, um,
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.000]  it's, it's so far, it's, it's great and I love it. And the community has been really
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.920]  good to me too. Jason cocky and I had dinner, uh, a month or so ago. Um, uh, actually it
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.640]  was when I got the review for the Apple watch, I went to New York the night before just so
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.680]  I wouldn't have to take the train in the morning. And, and, uh, Jason cocky and I had dinner
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.400]  and we were talking about how having been successful at this and having done it for
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.040]  ourselves full time for some number of years now has more or less rendered us completely
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.960]  unemployable. I'm already feeling it brother. I'm, um, I've, I'm certainly well known and
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.720]  I think, I think that if I needed to get a job, I could certainly find one. I, you know,
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.920]  and then I think I would be, I would be let go within a day or two. They would be like,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.860]  this is, this isn't working out. Well, one of the things that surprised me about this
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:33.440]  whole thing was, um, I got a lot of new clients from max Sparky. I mean, people had been listening
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.040]  to me in their ear, you know, power of podcasting and writing for all these years now. Like,
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:43.700]  Hey, I could actually use you to help me with some stuff. And, and, um, that was a surprise
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:50.120]  to me. I had no expectation of any legal business from all this stuff. And so that was kind
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.160]  of nice, but, but it's also given me more time. So, you know, um, I'm working from home.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.500]  I have an office, but I work from home more than I go into the office and I love it. Um,
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:04.000]  you did a, I think a tweet like years ago, just, you know, going back when he said, here's
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.080]  my new work shoes and you had a pair of slippers. Do you remember that? I don't know if you,
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.400]  you probably don't even know. I do remember every since then that has stuck in my brain
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.040]  and it's kind of pissed me off. I'm like, Gruber can have those slippers as his work
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.460]  shoes. I need to find a way to make that work and Hey, I'm there, man. It feels good. That's
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:25.360]  the bike. In fact, I'm going to go buy a pair of slippers. I'm gonna call the John group.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.880]  My year of work shoes is, uh, right now I'm in the socks period, just wearing a pair of
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:40.560]  socks, but then it'll go to, it'll be flip flops, um, sooner, uh, you know, probably
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.040]  like after WWDC, it'll be more flip floppy. Then it'll go back to socks and then it'll
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.080]  go to slippers. Yeah. Well, you've got, you've got the seasons there out here. It's just
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.520]  bare feet pretty much. I'm upset though at the slippers. I think the tweet is a couple
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:00.080]  years old and that it was, uh, the best pair of slippers I ever had. And, um, I wore a
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:06.420]  hole through them and, um, and I couldn't, they, I forget where the hell I bought them,
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.720]  but I went back and they didn't have them anymore. And I really wished that I had done
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.560]  what I always think I'm going to do, which is when I find something like that, that I
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.160]  really like just pull a Steve jobs and buy like 20 of them and put them in a closet.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.720]  And then, you know, I never have to worry about slippers again for the rest of my life
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.440]  because my feet aren't going to change size. Yeah, exactly. Why not? Although there's a
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.740]  thing of Steve jobs probably had a lot more space to store things like that. Yeah. My,
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:37.960]  my wife always says that she's like, don't buy more crap, but I, you know, I feel like
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.840]  I could take them out of the boxes. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like if I, if I
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.880]  could take them out of the boxes and you know, the slippers, you could, you could put that,
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.360]  you could put them all in one box. I'm definitely one of those habit people. Like, um, when
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.840]  I had, when I was going into the office every day and I didn't have court, I had like eight
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:03.200]  pairs of lands in gray slacks and like 12 blue shirts. And every day I wear the same
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.440]  thing and everything office thought I was such a weirdo, but it just made so much sense
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.640]  to me just to get out of bed and shower and put that on. That was the uniform. I think
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.000]  that the slippers I love the most were lands end actually, and then they'd stop making
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.520]  them. Uh, and in fact, I, I go through slippers, like my, this job is so hard, David, I've,
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.480]  I go through slippers so fast. I've in fact, I've noticed that the slippers that I've been
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:31.160]  wearing the last year or two, uh, now that they're sort of put away for the warm weather,
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.280]  uh, I noticed that the, that they're, they're sort of worn through. Look, well, you've made,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.480]  you made the joke about, was it your grandfather who was a coal miner? My maternal grandfather
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:45.960]  was, was a coal miner. Mine as well. I mean, he also died of black lung. I mean, it's just,
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.480]  I mean, you stop and think about it. Or my, you know, my other grandfather during the
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.000]  depression, they didn't have any money. They would go out into the backwoods of Massachusetts
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.680]  and try trap red Fox. And that's how they, that's how they ate. And that's how they got
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:08.320]  by. And I'm sitting here going, Oh, the font on this watch. I mean, if he was here, he
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.000]  would just slap me. I know. I think on the one hand, I think on the one hand, my grandfather
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.200]  would have been, um, no, I think first he would have been very, very proud because I
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.640]  think it was exactly the, you know, he, he personified that American dream of, I want
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.740]  my kids to have a better life than me. You know, my mom was a registered nurse, went
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:33.280]  to nursing school. Uh, and her brother was, uh, he didn't go to, he went to like a trade
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.360]  school and was into like electronics. Like it sort of was, you know, that had the gadget
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.840]  or still does. He's, you know, it's, you know, he had like, he was like the first guy I knew
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:46.160]  in my life who had a video game system, hooked up to his TV at the Pong, you know, pre pre
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.400]  Atari, 2,600 back in the, the, I don't know, 77, something like that. Um, you know, but
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.520]  they, both of them ended up with white collar jobs. Well, registered nurses probably hard
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.160]  to call white, white, white collar. I mean, that's physical, but it's, you know, it requires
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.800]  a, uh, you know, an education. Um, and it's certainly better than coal mining. And I think
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.240]  he would have been delighted that his grandson, you know, had a job that is, you know, like
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.760]  mine, but I, you know, I don't know that he would have had much tolerance for my complaints
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.760]  about the,
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.200]  Pete Ladd Yeah. My, I come from very blue collar roots
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.380]  too. And my, my dad was actually really concerned when I said, I'm going to go to law school.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.840]  He's like, that's going to ruin you. He says, you know, there's just no way you'll be able
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.760]  to be a decent person and a lawyer. And, um, it's funny because he was totally honest when
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.920]  he said it and it has affected my life in so many ways that, that concern, it it's always
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.460]  in the back of my head and, and, you know, at points in my legal career where I could
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:49.080]  have jumped right or left, it always, you know, I was jumped right because of that statement,
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.360]  you know, it's interesting how your parents affect you on that stuff.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.960]  Pete Ladd Yeah. I had a, I took an Instagram, let me
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:21:00.320]  put it in here. I took an Instagram the other week and it, I let it slide. This is like
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.960]  my thing. And it's, I, I get when I get criticism online, I just have a thick skin and I let
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.000]  stuff slide. Um, but that's the picture I took and it's, there's a hotel a couple blocks
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.120]  away here in Philly. It's a real seedy motel. If you'd look at the Yelp reviews for it,
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.920]  it's called the Parker spruce. Uh, it's, it's like the type of, it literally is the type
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.760]  of hotel where you can go in and rent, you know, you can get it by the hour. Um, and
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.400]  it is closing. I didn't know this until I, after I took this picture, but it was a picture
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.320]  of these guys taking mattresses out of the hotel and they're the mattresses from like
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:45.080]  a seedy hotel that, uh, rents by the hour or, you know, really pretty bad looking mattress.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.880]  Yeah. Um, and I thought it was fascinating, but I, the caption I wrote is no one grows
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.480]  up thinking there'll be one of the guys who disposes of old mattresses from a seedy hotel.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.960]  And, and a lot of people in the comments are like, wow, what a Dickie comment. You're,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.760]  you know, like as though I was making fun of these guys. And I guess you could read
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.280]  it that way, but that isn't what I meant at all. Honestly, to me, it was just like a slice
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.400]  of life and I have nothing but total respect for these guys. Like those guys, what I thought
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.320]  as I walked past them is, is I had the thought, like when I think about my grandfather, I
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.660]  was like, no, those guys are working for a living. That's that's a fucking job taking
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:25.720]  those, uh, hotel, you know, those mattresses out of a hotel and it may, it's not hot, but
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.240]  that hotel is not air conditioned. You know what I mean? And moving one mattress is, is
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.200]  hard work and these guys are moving, you know, I don't know what, what it looks like. There's
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.280]  like at least a dozen of them there. Um, I, that's all I meant by, I thought it was so
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.880]  weird that people jumped on me as though I was mocking these people. I just thought like,
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.760]  Hey, you know, my, my thought was the people who are going to read this, maybe this will
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.960]  help you appreciate, you know, whatever it is you do that is probably a lot less arduous
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.800]  than a moving mattresses.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.160]  It's so easy to get in trouble on the internet, especially with an audience of your size.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.040]  So I don't know, I just, I just let it slide. But anybody who saw that and who thought I
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.200]  was making fun of them, I really didn't mean it that way at all. I meant that. I mean,
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.580]  the way I kind of, it's like talking earlier, I mean, you would go back to work for a software
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:15.600]  developer if that's what it took, you know, or, you know, whatever we, I would dig ditches
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.680]  if that's what it, whatever it takes, you know, I mean, and, um, you know, I just think
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.760]  we're lucky that we're able to get by without having to do that stuff at this point. Exactly.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:29.880]  Cause I'd be really lousy at taking to just speaking of digging ditches. Um, I'll take
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:39.400]  a break here and thank our next sponsor hover. Um, you guys know, however, it's the best
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.660]  place on the internet to register a domain name. You need a domain name, you need a new
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:48.320]  domain name, go to hover.com and start searching. They've got great tools to help you search.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:53.080]  Uh, they've got great, a great list of all these new top level domains, which have really
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:59.180]  opened a lot of one and two word, you know, this, that dot whatever, you know, there's
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:06.060]  dot finance dot coffee dot local. I guess that local is a bonjour, but uh, anyway, there's
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:10.880]  a ton of these new top level domains. I can't even hope to list them all. Uh, hover can
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.760]  help you get a new domain on any of them. They can help you find a way to get a domain
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:23.400]  on dot com dot net, all the classic TLDs. I don't even know what you'd call those, but
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.000]  even better than that, every, every domain registrar helps you register domain names,
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.640]  but hover does it the right way. Um, Oh, you know, we talk about CD, I talk about that
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:39.080]  CD hotel, the top, the domain registrar business is in large part kind of CD. It's like the
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.040]  online equivalent of CD where you go there and uh, I honestly, I'm not going to name
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.340]  names, but I can think of one that's a big one. Uh, you go there and the site is filled
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:55.780]  with junky ads. When you're trying to sign up, there's all sorts of upsells, uh, checkboxes
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:59.920]  for things that, uh, that are checked by default that ought to be off by default or really
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:05.240]  shouldn't even be an option at all. Um, then you find out that if you want DNS privacy
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.600]  so that your personal, you know, your address and your phone number and et cetera, aren't
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.960]  listed out wide open for the internet. For anybody who looks at your DNS records, you
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.880]  have to pay extra for that. Hover has none of that. There's no upsells, there's no junky
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.760]  ads for other third party stuff on their stuff. All they want to do is help you manage your
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  domain names the right way. Um, things like domain privacy, all that stuff, it's all included
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:38.220]  and they have amazing customer support, truly amazing customer support. Uh, they call it
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:43.880]  valet service. So you sign up to be a hover customer and you've got domain names at other
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.280]  registrars, uh, and you're already happy. You've already, you've seen enough that, you
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.520]  know, yes, I want to move all my domain names to hover, but I've been registering domain
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:58.480]  names since 1995 on this, that, and the other service all over the web. Just give your stuff
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.240]  help that, you know, give your, your support rep at hover, the access to your, these other
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:09.280]  registrars where you have domains and hovers valet service will just move those domains.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.480]  They'll do whatever it takes, fill out the forums, send the faxes, uh, whatever has to
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.080]  be done. They'll move them all into your hover account and then all of a sudden, boom, all
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.040]  of your domains are all there under hover with the best interface and the best service.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.200]  Uh, you don't have to pay for that. That the valet service is just part of being a hover
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:33.720]  customer and it just cleans up a hassle that is, could be nagging at you for the last 20
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.440]  years about, Hey, I should consolidate all of my domain names from one place. Really,
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.880]  really great. Um, I, I, I have domain names that hover. I know people, everybody I know
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.080]  has some at hover. Nobody ever like says, you know what, maybe I'll go somewhere else
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.320]  after hover. Once you go to hover, you're like, why would I ever go anywhere else? So
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:27:02.320]  great. Um, here's a code that will save you 10% uh, on a domain name at hover, uh, missing
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:08.260]  links. And that is in reference to the fact that the link bracelets on the Apple watch
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:15.000]  haven't shipped yet, uh, or I've only started to ship. So use that code missing links and
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.100]  you will save money and uh, they'll know that you came from the talk show. So my thanks
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:27.520]  to hover, go to hover.com H O V E R and use that code missing links and uh, they'll know
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.680]  you came from here. So what else we got to talk about?
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:42.600]  Uh, I got a new Mac. Yes. I did want to talk to you about that. I, I, um, I got, you know,
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:48.000]  pulled in on the new Mac book, the super light 12 inch. All right. All right. You have not,
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.240]  you did tell me you got that. You did not tell me which color I'm going to, I'm going
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:58.880]  to use my psychic powers and I'm going to predict that you purchased space gray. You
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:06.240]  bet. You bet. I mean, I, it's something different, but it's not gold. So, you know, uh, you know,
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.200]  the fact that you can order one, I remember when you have to pay extra for the black one.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:17.240]  Uh, definitely the, the, it was the plastic era. Yeah. But the, uh, that's true. And it's
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:22.360]  true for the watch, right? It's talking about the missing links, like the space black link
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.520]  bracelet watch costs more than the stainless steel one. Now that's not more than just a
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.500]  color though. It's not just anodized that that diamond, like what not diamond like carbon,
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:36.680]  what the hell is it called? Diamond like carbon coating. The DLC coating is a real thing and
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.860]  it actually does add value. You know, it probably, it arguably does add like a hundred dollars
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.600]  in value to it, but anyway, you do have to pay more for black.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.800]  Yeah. I, I've, you know, because of this switch in my life, I used to, um, you know, go to
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.200]  work for the man every day and I had a 15 inch retina MacBook pro. That's the first,
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.720]  the very first retina MacBook pro, and it's a great computer and it's, it's a, it's a
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.920]  beast, you know, in the nice big screen when you're sitting at your desk, eight hours a
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:07.160]  day is fine. But now that I've switched up, I don't need, I have a retina iMac at home
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:12.240]  and I'm working on that a lot and I'm not using the laptop as much, but I still need
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.160]  one. So I thought, you know what, I'm kind of as a second computer, this may work for
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.800]  me. And, uh, I was a little worried about the keyboard, so I decided to, um, to buy
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.360]  one and just see, you know, they've got a 14 day return policy and if it's just terrible,
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.440]  I'll take it back. But I stuck with it and now I'm going to sell the retina MacBook pro
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:36.720]  and, and, uh, I really like it. I mean, it's, it's cool having something so light and slim,
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:41.480]  you know, we, the big joke in my life now is Disneyland because my wife is a complete
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.260]  Disneyland. I used to be a jungle cruise skipper around if I ever told her, but the, I can
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:49.920]  totally see that though. You were probably excellent. I was, people waited for my boat.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.960]  They would say, I want his boat. I'll wait. I believe that. I'll tell you someday I'm
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:30:00.400]  going to be a WWDC sit down and I will tell you some great jungle cruise stories. Um,
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:06.180]  but anyway, it was a jungle cruise captain. I do as I think, um, I don't think Steve Martin
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.680]  actually was on there. I don't think so. Yeah. But, um, yeah, there, there's actually some
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.440]  interesting people that are former skippers. It was so much fun. I mean, it was like the
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.960]  greatest job. Um, and I had it through high school, even when I was in law school, I would
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.240]  go down there and work nights cause I just needed money. And like the boats would get
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:31.680]  stuck cause Disneyland, it's an old ride system and the boats would derail and you'd be stuck
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:36.240]  out there like 30 minutes. And, um, you know, you can't do anything. You gotta wait for
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.040]  the guy to come to yank the boat back on the rail. And I'd be like telling people how to
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:47.920]  break their leases and stuff, but the, um, you know, it was anyway, so, but now that
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:51.880]  I'm like, I have more control over my schedule. My wife wants to go to all the time. So I'll
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:57.140]  drive her up there. And then I like go, uh, like over to a quiet restaurant with this
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:01.960]  new laptop and sit there and write contracts for two or three hours. And, um, I really
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.720]  like it. But anyway, you know, the, the side is it's, it's a nice computer that the keyboard,
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.680]  I don't think is as good as the standard standard keyboard. Um, but it's good enough.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:19.120]  Well, and it's, I, I feel like the using typing on the glass for low these many years has
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.800]  lowered our standards for what's an acceptable keyboard. Like it's, you know, in my opinion,
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.120]  and again, I've talked to people at Apple about this and they have said, you know, that
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:34.160]  for, uh, you know, like with the iPad, like, um, this was around the era when Microsoft
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.640]  surface first came out and really kind of hung its hat on the fact that the cover had
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.120]  a physical keyboard and there was a lot of speculation that Apple might come out with
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.840]  something like that. Who knows? Maybe they still will someday. Maybe they will with this
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.360]  iPad pro that's rumored to be, uh, you know, upcoming. But the thing I heard from a couple
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:59.160]  people at Apple is, um, you cannot, you cannot overstate just how good, like some kids are
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:06.600]  today typing on an iPad, like kids who just don't have ingrained habits for physical keyboards
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.440]  are so blazingly fast typing on an iPad. You just can't believe it. It's, you know, and
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.320]  that the long, you know, skating to where the puck is going is not worrying about, you
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:23.640]  know, those of us with habits on old clicky keyboards. My 18 year old can type on an iPhone
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:28.640]  as fast as I can, or probably very close to as fast as I can type on a keyboard as a touch
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:34.320]  typist. And not only that, she can type on an iPhone while not looking at the keyboard.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.680]  I believe it. I totally believe it. And it's, you know, again, it just plays it, you know,
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.960]  it's a little different than the iPad argument, but not really is it plays into that argument
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:49.840]  of, you know, back in 2007, 2008, even 2009. As people who were used to Blackberries and
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.280]  stuff were thinking about switching, they're like, well, you know, when, when they come
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.240]  out with the hardware keyboard, you know, so someone like me who needs to type can type,
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.320]  you know, there's this assumption that anybody who was getting by on a no physical keyboard
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.560]  iPhone doesn't really type on it. Whereas the truth is there are people who type lots
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.760]  of stuff on them. They don't type the traditional method, but they still, and it's not just
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.000]  young people too. You know, Oh, Malik types, a lot of his blog posts on his phone, on his
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.560]  iPhone. It does. He, he, you know, I've seen him do it. He, he, you know, and he's, I can't
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:25.440]  say that he's as fast as probably as like a teenager, but you know, he's going as fast
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.560]  as he wants to, to be a writer. Well, with this computer, the, um, the retina screen
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.600]  to me was the big win. Cause I really need a retina screen. I, I cannot use a computer
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:41.320]  without a retina. I've always wanted a, a slim notebook. In fact, somebody once loaned
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.440]  me an 11 inch and I tried it for a while and it just, the screen, I couldn't look at it.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.640]  It just bugged me every time I looked at it. And this is great. But the really crazy thing
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.800]  about this computer is, um, I have this, um, external iPhone charger, you know, it's one
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.160]  I got off Amazon. I think it's, you know, it's a medium sized charger and I got thinking,
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.240]  I wonder what would happen because the power is going through the USB. Um, what would happen
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.840]  if I plugged the battery into the laptop? Would the laptop recharge the battery or would
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:20.980]  the battery recharge the laptop? You know, so I bought off Amazon, a USB C mail to USB,
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:27.440]  the old USB standard, whatever it is, a or B a cable. And I just plugged in the battery
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:31.880]  to the laptop and it charged the laptop, which is awesome.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.160]  Sort of like one of those Mophie brick type things. Yeah. It's a, um, yeah, I have to
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.440]  pull it out, but I mean, it's, I think I paid like 30 bucks for it. It's like, um, uh, I'm
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.840]  not even gonna try and say what the electronic rating is. I'll look it up in a minute and
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.480]  tell you, but the, um, it's, it's just something that you're supposed to buy to charge your
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.600]  iPad and your iPhone. You know, it's you, you plug it in to, uh, and it charges up and
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:59.000]  it's got, I think two USB ports on a female USB ports and you plug in and you plug it
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.980]  into your phone, but the thing charges up the laptop and it, if the laptops are running,
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:10.200]  it basically treads water. You know, it doesn't lose power and the battery goes out slowly
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.640]  of this thing, but I'm able to add like five hours of battery life to it. So now I've got
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.920]  that's kind of in seven hours. Yeah, you know, exactly. And then I did an experiment where
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.480]  I turned it, I ran it down to, I think 10% and then just plug the, the fully charged
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.580]  battery into it and went to bed. And it's very slow. I mean, it's not like charging
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:35.620]  really fast, but when I woke up, it was at like 75%. It was like, so it was able to put
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:40.160]  a lot of charge back into the laptop. So, so now I really feel like I can go anywhere
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.520]  because I've got this little battery and a USB cord and this little light laptop and
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.080]  I can go anywhere in the world and just work for a long time.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:56.040]  I feel like as time goes on, Apple and Apple's prowess at designing, at working with metals
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:05.000]  and miniaturizing components grows more and more. You have to see their stuff in person
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.520]  to get, and I think the watch is a perfect example of it. I mean, they've, they've, you
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:13.760]  know, tons of commercials. They, they have a website that they've had up since September
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:19.300]  with hundreds of super high quality photos of the watches, every watch, every band from
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:23.920]  every conceivable angle. And I can't tell you how many times I've gotten email from
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.280]  readers and listeners who said, you know, I was kind of going to wait for 2.0 and then
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.120]  I saw the watch and I was like, Oh my God, I got to get one. I can't believe I didn't
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.000]  order one on April 24th as soon as they saw it, but only when they saw it in person. And
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  I feel like the difference between the Mac book air or all of the whole Mac book line
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.920]  and the new Mac book, you, you have to see them when you see it in person. It, I, I thought,
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:55.240]  you know, I'm, I, I, I liked the idea of a minimal Mac book. I was sort of like, Hmm,
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:58.600]  maybe I should have, I just bought a new 13 inch Mac book pro last year. So I mean, I'm
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:04.120]  not really in the market to replace it now. But it did make me think, Hmm, maybe I should
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.240]  have waited a little longer cause that does seem like something, you know, if I have the
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.280]  retina five K Mac, I Mac at my desk and I'm only using the Mac book away from it. That
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.920]  seems like great. And then I saw it in the store and it was just like, it was just like
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:19.800]  an emotional thing. It's like seeing a sports car, you know, it's like it cause it's so
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.580]  much smaller and I've, and I use the 11 inch air for years just because I like the idea
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:29.120]  of the smallest possible notebook that you can with a full time with a full size keyboard.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.160]  Um, you just can't, the thing that blew me away was how much it looked more like an iPad
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:40.360]  with a keyboard than a Mac book. Like it just in terms of portability and size and you get
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.160]  the Mac operating system, right. You know, still is, you know, gives you a lot of automation
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:50.580]  stuff that you just really can't do realistically with an iPad. It's, it's great. I love it
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.880]  and I'm very happy with it except I would not, uh, sell the keyboard. I, you know, the
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:00.080]  keyboard is different and it's, I'm used to it now. It's like, there's a, there's like
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.880]  a happy medium because if you press too hard on it, you're just straining yourself because
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.540]  there's just not that much travel. So you're like over pressing, but then you start pressing
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:13.680]  lighter because you don't want to over press and you actually miss keys. You don't, you
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.400]  don't get the full, you know, throw of the key and there's like a sweet spot in the middle.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.180]  I think I've got it now, but it took me a few days to kind of get used to it. My thing
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:26.300]  is I've never liked any laptop keyboard and I've always appreciated that Apple does their
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:30.180]  best and really does. Like I remember a couple of years, obviously a couple of years ago
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:33.660]  cause it was Steve jobs, but at one point they were, he was introducing one of the new,
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.700]  some new Mac book and said something about their keyboard engineers and he said, yes,
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:42.780]  by the way, we really do have some engineers who do all they do is work on keyboards. Uh,
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:47.860]  I appreciate that. I, and it shows, and it's totally not surprising to me that there are
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:52.760]  some smart guys and women in Apple who've just dedicated, they're just dedicated to
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:39:00.180]  making kick ass keyboards or making the kickest assest keyboard they can, given the size constraints
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.540]  of something like the new Mac book. Um, yeah, totally appreciate that. I think I could get
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.500]  used to, I know that I probably wouldn't like it quite as much as the Mac book pro, which
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:13.540]  has more throw, but I like my old 11 that I used for years had less throw than the 13
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:18.020]  inch Mac book pro keyboard. Uh, and I, you know, I got used to it and none of it cause
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:21.580]  nothing compares to a nice desktop keyboard in my opinion.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.420]  And just the ability to take it anywhere with you and when it's this light, you really can
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.940]  take it anywhere with you. And that is something special that, that charger, by the way, looked
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:38.220]  it up. It's an anchor. I got it off of Amazon. It's a 12,800 milli amp hour, um, charger.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:44.100]  And it's, I can't, I just can't get over that. That's the name brand anchoring. 12,800 milli
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.700]  amp. All right. I'll look it up and try to put it in the show notes. Yeah. But just the
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:54.540]  fact that, uh, an iPhone charger can charge my laptop and, and like add hours to it is
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:40:00.740]  crazy, you know, but, uh, that's where we are now. Yeah. I do, I do think it gets a,
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:04.300]  you know, everybody digs on it. There was an article that said the processor matches
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:09.800]  like the, the 2011 Mac book air, which may be accurate, at least the, I got the upgraded
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.420]  one. I didn't get the entry. I got the second tier, but the, um, but I don't think those
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:20.140]  articles are really fair to it in terms of like memory access and the SSD speed, because
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:26.060]  it works fine. I'm not using it to do final cut or I books author. I'm using it for things
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:31.900]  like, you know, omni-focus and, and word processing and email and safari and stuff. And it's just
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:41.380]  fine for that stuff. Um, it's, I don't know. I, again, I just, and I feel like as much
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:45.660]  as you, if you're torn before you see it, it's like, I feel like once you see them in
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:49.360]  person, any kind of debate in your head is settled. And it's like, you can tell yourself
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.140]  in the abstract that, you know, maybe, you know, I'll just wait a couple of years before
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:59.380]  I get a retina screen on my Mac book. I'll just get the Mac book air because I want more,
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:04.460]  I want a couple of USB ports or I want whatever, uh, or I want the extra performance, you know,
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:08.660]  the way that the 13 inch Mac book pro or Mac book air is still faster than this new Mac
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:12.360]  book. Uh, go see it in person. I'm telling you, it's like, you just get this emotional
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:18.780]  appeal. And to me, the Mac book airs look suddenly looks so dated in the Apple store,
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:23.180]  like the non retina screen. And it's funny cause I've been depressed about the fact like
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:26.180]  the vision problems that I have. And I've been thinking like all my life I've been waiting
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:30.820]  for like retina and I, I've always known it was coming that we'd get these displays that
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:34.020]  have like print quality resolution. And it's like, that's when I turned, you know, hit
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.180]  the forties and my vision starts to go. And then I have this thing with my left eye and
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.060]  so good. It's like, you know what though? It's like, it actually is the opposite. It's
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.620]  like the retina screens actually help, you know, like the fact that my vision isn't so
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:47.420]  good. It's not that I can't appreciate it the way I would if everything had gone retina
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:52.060]  like in my thirties or let alone my twenties. God, I would have been amazing when my eyes
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:57.780]  were fantastic and I could see everything super, super tiny. Um, but even with problems,
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:02.300]  it looks better. It's like I can totally tell every, you know, looking at a non retina screen,
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.980]  it's, it just looks, it's gross in my opinion.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:12.740]  Yeah. And I, I've got this theory that, you know, the Mac book air is, is gonna go away.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:17.300]  I think it's definitely, you know, it's just, I mean, just like when the Mac book air came
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:23.300]  out, the Mac book at the time eventually went away. Eventually the new Mac book is going
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:28.020]  to become the standard machine. And then the Mac book air is going to become, I think,
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:32.380]  I think the formula is very simple and I think a lot of people have overthought this. I think
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:39.340]  it's simply the fact that the entry level price, once it goes down, it really can't
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:46.860]  go back up. And the entry level price for a Mac laptop has dropped to eight 99 and that
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:53.140]  was a couple of years ago when they first added the eight 99 11 inch Mac book air, right?
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:59.860]  Yeah, it's been a while. Um, but there's a reason why they haven't dropped it further.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:04.180]  And you know, part of the reason is that Apple just doesn't, you know, compete low end. But
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:09.220]  I think it's so that when they make a transition like this, they don't have as far to go to
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:16.180]  catch up. And I feel like the Mac book airs go away as soon as they can sell the current
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.780]  entry level Mac book one or whatever we want to call it, you know, the Mac book one port
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:27.180]  for eight 99. Yeah. So I feel like, you know, a year from now they'll come out with new
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:31.900]  Mac book ones with new specs at the price that it's at right now. And they can sell
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:35.420]  the one they already are making right now for eight 99. And then at that point, the
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.220]  Mac book air goes away, but they can't do it. They couldn't do it now because they couldn't
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:43.300]  just say, all right, you know, you used to be able to buy a Mac book air for eight 99,
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:48.860]  but now it starts at 11 99. And even just the way they named it tells you that's exactly
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:56.820]  I, in fact, it's almost like the biggest Telegraph strategically, you know, of their future strategy,
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:00.860]  but I can never think of from a name or in fact though the entry price is 12 99. So it's
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:07.020]  even higher. So it's, it's got a ways to go. I could even see them doing it. Maybe, maybe
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:11.980]  if they could get it to nine 99, I could see them sort of, and maybe what they would do
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:20.620]  at that point is, is drop the 13 inch Mac book air and only keep the 11 inch around
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:27.760]  at eight 99, like maybe phase out the 13 inch first and only key and, and only keep one
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.920]  model of the 11 inch around, which is the eight 99 one, if they could, you know, once
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.740]  they can drop this one to nine 99, but that's the only thing holding them back there. And
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:41.580]  they have, usually they have no sympathy for the people who need two USB ports or whatever.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:47.120]  No. And usually they they're pretty eager to get rid of old stuff, but then I look at,
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.540]  they're still selling Mac book pros with spinning discs in them. So I'm kind of surprised those
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.540]  are still on the market.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:57.100]  Yeah. It's funny what they're willing to keep around at the entry level. I'm not sure what
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:04.080]  the market at this point is for the spinning disc Mac book, Mac book pro. I gotta feel
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:10.900]  like that might be of all the, of all the devices in the Mac line that, so there's only
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:14.680]  the 13 inch, right? Or do they have a 15 inch too? Yeah. There is no 15 inch for the spinning
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:20.100]  display or spinning disc. Somebody told me it was education, but my guess would be education
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:24.180]  if they're going to buy a Mac would be at the 11 or the 13 inch Mac book air entry level.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:28.300]  Yeah. I just don't see what the appeal is of that 13 inch entry level Mac book pro it
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:34.180]  costs 10 99. I just don't see what, what the, what the appeal is of carrying all that extra
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:38.460]  weight around for something. I guess it has better graphics than the, the Mac book air.
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:45.260]  I don't know. Some people I guess I'd say probably mainly non geek people are very concerned
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:49.820]  about the loss of the optical drive. They're like, I want to watch my DVDs on the airplane
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:56.360]  or whatever and they'll buy whatever Mac lets them do that. I guess that's it. I don't know.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.000]  That seems crazy to me though. It's just, and it seems, or it seems at least it seems
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.020]  on an Apple like to me to, for them to be worried about that. Yeah. Cause I don't know
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:10.460]  spinning discs. It's just seems, you know, the only reason that you have a spinning disc
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:19.660]  is to, you know, rip, rip your stuff to digital format. Yeah. I, it's SSD transition. I was,
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:25.340]  I'm old enough to have remembered the floppy, the hard drive transition years ago. And then
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:30.540]  just a few years ago when we went to SSD, it felt to me like every computer just got
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:35.220]  way better. I mean, if you're listening and you haven't put an SSD in your computer yet,
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:40.060]  that's like the go-to and it's not that SSDs can't fail. I mean, of course not. I mean,
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.260]  any, all discs fail eventually and you know, corruption can happen because of software,
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:50.820]  not just hardware, but the, the stability of SSDs versus reliability versus hard drives.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:55.980]  It's just night and day. It's just the craziest, you know, and the end of the worst part is
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:59.400]  of all the things that can fail if people don't have, you know, good backup and we could,
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.700]  you know, do a whole show about backups. I know Mac power uses, you guys are, you know,
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:07.700]  greatly. So if there's anything to be religious about, it's having good backup, you know,
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:13.740]  policies in place, uh, duplication, triplication, you know, but yeah, let's face it. A lot of
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.980]  people don't. And if there's anything that's going to fail, it's the hard spinning hard
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:20.480]  drive. And it's like the worst thing to fail because it's the thing that could cause you
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.440]  to lose the stuff you care about most. I imagine myself like, is this like gray haired old
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:31.260]  geek talking to some young geek and explain, yeah, it was spinning 7,200 revolutions per
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:36.100]  minute and it had a little needle that would touch it. And if it didn't touch it in the
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:41.620]  right place, all of your data was lost. I mean, they're just going to look at us like,
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:46.300]  you know, we're driving model. It's a marvel that they work as well as they do. It truly
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:52.180]  is a mechanically, it's a mechanically a marvel that it works as well as it does. But you
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:56.380]  know, if you think, wow, that seems like something that might fail frequently. Well, exactly.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:00.460]  You're exactly right. Yeah, I totally think that now more I'm staring at this 13 inch
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:05.060]  Mac book pro and I cannot believe that it's actually a, like a current, like a device
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:11.020]  that you buy. I wonder if that's a difference between new Apple and old Apple. I wonder
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.660]  if they're more willing to keep stuff a little bit longer. It's not, you know, that the Mac
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:19.120]  book pro line isn't too complicated, but it just sticks out a little bit and I'm not quite
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:25.240]  sure what, what the market is for that. Have you tried just switching gears? Have you tried
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.440]  the photos app? Have you tried this whole thing? You know what? That's a great thing.
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.740]  Let's close out the show talking about photos, but before we do, I have, I have to thank
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:41.300]  our last sponsor and it is our good friend, our good friends at fracture. You guys know
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:47.220]  fracture. They are one of the biggest supporters of this show. I love them to death. They have
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.420]  a great product. What they do is they take your photos, you take photographs on your
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.760]  iPhone, take them on your camera, whatever you want to do. You take them, you send them
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:02.100]  to fracture, they print them directly on glass. I don't know how the hell they do it. They've
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:07.580]  got some kind of proprietary apparatus that they take your digital photos, put them directly
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:11.740]  on the surface of glass right there on the glass, and then they ship them to you and
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:18.700]  these fantastically clever things that are packaging material. It's like a box that protects
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:23.860]  it in shipment because it is glass in there. And then you open it up and the cardboard
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:29.740]  that's in there is the apparatus you need to do something like hang it on a wall, prop
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:34.660]  it up on your desk, put it on your mantle, anything you would want to do. They have an
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:41.740]  enormous variety of sizes, everything from little three by three type things to a giant
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:53.140]  23 by 29 inch wall size poster size sizes, everything from small to large, really great
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:59.700]  quality. Cannot emphasize, even with iPhone pictures, cannot emphasize just how well the,
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.940]  you know, I know megapixels is overrated as a camera quality thing, but we've gotten to
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:07.660]  the point where like eight megapixel pictures, you can blow them up really big and they look
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:13.860]  great. What's their size? I'm looking at their site right now. So their large is 15.6 inches
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:20.660]  by 20.8 and they have an extra large that's 22 by 29. So really big. You can go really,
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.220]  really big. They've also got square sizes. So if you've got, you know, and let's face
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.940]  it, we're just talking about Instagram. A lot of us are framing our pictures as squares
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:34.820]  right now. Squares go up to 23 by 23. They've got 11 by 11, five by five. Really, really
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:40.580]  great for Instagram type pictures or pictures you've framed, you know, as a square. Cannot
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:44.980]  say enough about the quality of their stuff and how fun it is to get it and to actually
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:49.060]  see your photos somewhere other than on a glowing screen to just hang it on a wall and
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:54.060]  appreciate it. Father's Day is coming up. You can order them in advance. Really, it's
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:57.540]  just a no brainer that we don't have to think about it. You really don't. It's like the
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:02.500]  greatest. It sounds lazy, but I'm telling you it's the greatest because your relatives
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:06.940]  love getting pictures of family members. It seems really personal. It's the easiest thing
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:11.940]  in the world to do. So go check them out. Really, really great stuff. They've got a
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:21.300]  deal for the talk show listeners. You go to their website, fracture me.com fracture me.com
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:28.780]  use the code daring fireball, all one word, daring fireball, and you'll save 15% off any
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.820]  order and the prices are great already, but you can save more just by being a listener
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:37.380]  of the show. You guys are ordering these things like crazy. I can't appreciate it enough.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:41.900]  That's why fracture keeps coming back to sponsor the show again. Keep it up, but I can't
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:46.560]  not say highly enough how much I personally endorsed their product. It's, it's just terrific.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:48.140]  So my thanks to them.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:54.540]  I heard a Mark Arment talking about how he had his apps done in fracture. And um, so
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.740]  I had all my books done cause I've written several books and I had them done with fracture
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:04.380]  prints, but because I'm a narcissist, I hung them downstairs in like my family room. Whenever
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:08.180]  it comes from my house, they see like this wall of book covers and I don't know, I can't
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:14.340]  tell myself, but man, it makes me happy. Maybe I shouldn't emphasize photos, but it really
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:18.200]  does work well with images of any kind. I know I've been in Marco's office and I've
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.040]  seen his apps and that they look great. They really do. I mean, app icons are so big. Somebody
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:31.540]  pointed out recently, but like a, uh, a retina app icon, the assets for it take up more space
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:35.800]  than would have fit on a, on a high density floppy disk. Like, so you couldn't have even
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:42.220]  fit an app icon on a floppy disk. Yeah. It's so easy to say back in my day, talking about
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:49.280]  that transition from floppies to hardware. Um, all right. So photos, this was another
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:56.940]  reason I wanted to have you on the show. So, uh, the last episode, I think, I think just
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:53:01.500]  exactly what I said, episode two 55 of Mac power users. Great episode. You and Katie
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:07.660]  go really long on, on the new photos from Mac and the whole, uh, iCloud photo syncing
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:12.020]  thing. Um, so we don't have to repeat it here. It's a great, if anybody out there hasn't
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:15.940]  listened to Mac power users, great episode, really great introduction to the show. And
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:21.660]  if you're interested in the details, um, but long story short, I think all of us were kind
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:27.660]  of skeptical. Well, that's the story. It seems to me like everybody for years has been saying
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:33.180]  Apple can't do cloud services. That's that's their weak spot. It's not never going to happen.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:37.260]  And they released this photos app and they've got the iCloud photo storage and granted you
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:42.840]  have to pay for it. Uh, I mean, assuming you have a decent number of photos, but, but,
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.220]  and I knew the new photos app would handle the libraries better than I photo did. I mean,
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.860]  I always had the impression for the last year or two that they had moved their engineering
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:54.720]  resources to something new and photo I photo was kind of lingering, but whatever the new
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.880]  thing was going to be, it was going to display your photos just fine on your Mac. But the
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.300]  big question mark to me was, will this iCloud photo thing work? And when I make a photo
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:08.300]  on my phone, will it show up on my Mac and iPad? No problem. And will all this magic
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:14.140]  stuff they, they showed off last year come true. And, you know, in my opinion, it did
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:19.220]  damned if they didn't pull it off. Yeah. And nobody's talking about it really. I mean,
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.620]  I mean, we've talked, we did a show on it. We've got a lot of people listening to our
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:27.460]  show. I've done this field guide on it. And I've only had like a couple people complaining
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:31.960]  about performance or cloud sync. I mean, there are a lot of people hitting this thing hard
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:36.980]  with like 30,000 photo libraries. And it's where I think that the skepticism was actually
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:44.320]  twofold is first is general skepticism about Apple and cloud-based anything. And then second
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.460]  is that when it comes to photos, I think so many people had burned out on iPhoto and had
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:55.420]  run up to the performance limits like, and you know, bottom line, I don't know where
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:59.300]  the line is. And I guess it probably depends a little, maybe even on the size of the photos,
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.420]  like what kind of camera you're using to take the photos you're putting in there, but at
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:07.820]  a certain reasonable level of photos, like not like, Oh, wow, that's, that's abnormal.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.900]  But like, and it's probably just combined with the fact of how long digital cameras
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:18.500]  have been a thing, right? So like iPhoto comes out in the early two thousands with the, you
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:22.860]  know, iLife and the digital hub strategy of Apple. And everybody's only got hundreds of
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:29.100]  photos or a thousand or 2000 and, you know, low, you know, now we're in the 2010s and
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:34.540]  everybody, everybody might have 10,000 photos and iPhoto wasn't dealing with that well.
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:39.340]  And you know, it's scrolling problems, performance problems. It just, and everybody, you know,
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:45.820]  there was a vibrant third party market for the utilities that would help you split up
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:53.340]  your iPhoto library, you know, and switch between different libraries because you know,
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:57.980]  just keeping all your photos in one big library wasn't work working technically, but the whole
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:02.300]  idea. And so that's a great workaround, but the whole idea of having to manage all these
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.740]  libraries defeated the whole purpose of iPhoto in the first place, which is supposed to be
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:09.660]  that, you know, Hey, you're not supposed to just throw out, here's a place where you throw
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:15.420]  all your photos. And that's what photos, the new photos promised. And I think people were
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.740]  skeptical about that, but I think the truth is that, you know, quietly in the midst of
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:26.820]  all this hubbub about the watch, Apple has solved a massive long-standing problem.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.460]  Trenton Larkin Yeah. And it works. I mean, I just, because
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:34.320]  I was running it in the beta and I was thinking, well, it's the beta. There's not that many
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.720]  people hitting the server, blah, blah, blah. But when it released my wife's library is
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.960]  even bigger than mine and it uploaded fine and it's, you know, it just works. So I'm
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.580]  really happy to see that, you know, I I'm sure there's a lot of smart people at Apple
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.260]  that knew that they had this reputation and this was something they needed to deliver
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:58.340]  on. But, um, but it really, it really does. So I got excited about it and we, we did a
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:03.380]  whole show on it. And I mean, the reason the weird thing is I was going to write a book
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.940]  about, I was going to write a book called a photo management for, you know, Mac and
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:12.340]  iOS. And I had a whole lot, I have it on the outliner, it's full of ideas and Dropbox and
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:16.000]  all these, you know, third party services. And it's a great, it would have been a great
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.140]  book, but then I started using photos. I'm like, heck with this. There's no book here.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:24.860]  I mean, just use photos. Do you think, and that's not, that's not true for the pros.
[01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:28.540]  I mean, I'm, you know, there's, there's a, there's edge cases, but for most people, this
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:34.160]  will solve your problem. Uh, I do think that there is, you know, if there's a complaint
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:40.420]  to be had, it's that Apple's public statement is I'm paraphrasing, but that they're no longer
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:47.380]  developing aperture or I photo in favor of they're going all in on photos for Mac. This
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:54.540]  is their new photo solution. And I think the truth of it is that it falls somewhere in
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:58:00.780]  between. It is a better, it's certainly better at handling a large number of photos without
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:05.540]  question. I don't see how anybody could deny that way better. To me, it's, this is an objective
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:09.660]  or an objective statement, not a subjective one way better than that handling a large
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:14.740]  number of photos than I photo ever was. I think subjectively it is better at editing
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:20.540]  photos. Uh, you know, the tools like cropping and adjusting the, uh, I would almost say
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:26.860]  in comparison to I photo, it is objectively better because, um, like changing the amount
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:33.100]  of light in an image, just turning up exposure doesn't do exactly that. It, it screws up
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:37.500]  other things. Whereas in this case, if you turn up to make an image to add more light,
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:42.820]  it turns down shadows, it does a whole bunch of stuff at once to make it better. So they're,
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:47.560]  they're bringing like having a more professional editing abilities in that you don't get with
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.460]  I photos. I'd say it's even better for that. Although you don't get the local changes like
[01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:55.880]  in aperture, you could locally, you know, increase the light in one section of the picture
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.200]  or not. And you can't do that anymore. But, um, uh, I think, you know, if you're a pro
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:04.940]  user then, and you, you really loved aperture, you're probably not going to be happy. No.
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:08.860]  And you know, and I know that there's a lot of them out there. I know that, or even if
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:12.460]  you're, you know, semi-pro prosumer or whatever you want to call it, I know that there's a
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:18.520]  lot of people out there who honestly evaluated both Lightroom and aperture and preferred
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:24.060]  aperture and I I'm a long time, uh, Lightroom user, but not like in a pro sense, just like
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:29.180]  like a total pro very much on the sumer side of prosumer. But I like Lightroom and I know
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:33.340]  that it's sort of got like a funky UI, but I like it. And it, to me, it's not like an
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:38.380]  Adobe UI. It's like a, just a unique UI that I thought was very thoughtful, uh, really
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:43.460]  like it, but I totally can see why I, even as a non non-professional photographer, I
[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:48.520]  can see the differences in aperture and Lightroom and I can see why people preferred aperture.
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:54.780]  And those people are kind of left with the short end of the stick here because photos
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:59.580]  doesn't do enough for them. And they already had decided that they didn't like Lightroom
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:04.580]  as much as aperture. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it just seemed like that's kind of a trend
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:09.020]  for people who are using the pro apps from app lately. I mean, they're, they're aiming
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:14.680]  lower. I think the, what they, the fat middle or whatever they call it, but the, um, but,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:19.420]  but for most people, I mean, cause, and I think that, and I, and I totally acknowledged
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:24.940]  those people are not going to be happy, but for so many people, such a great many more
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:29.340]  people, they were completely baffled by what to do with their photos because they're taking
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:33.780]  hundreds of pictures at one event on their phone and they just leave them on their phone
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:38.060]  or they, they figure out how to get it onto their Mac or their, and they, you know, they've
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:43.900]  got a folder somewhere and it's not backed up and they can't access it. And it's just
[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:48.620]  completely crazy. And whereas with this new system, we were at a family party and someone
[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:53.320]  was talking about something that funny that happened in 2006 and I was able to pull up
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:59.820]  a picture of it on my phone and it just like blew their mind. It is true. I find that the
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:05.500]  way that they automatically, um, you know, the, the, the interface that they've come
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:10.740]  up with this sort of years, you know, at the year's level, it's clearly, you can't see
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:17.740]  what the, the, the details are, but that you just remember when something happened vaguely,
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:22.940]  you can go back there and you know, you remember it was sometime in August we went, you know,
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:28.540]  we went on a cruise in August of 2009 or whatever. So go back to 2009, go down to about where
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:33.300]  August is. You probably see a lot of blue because you're, you know, on the ocean and
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:36.220]  just start zooming in there and you're going to find that photo.
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:40.660]  Yeah. I was surprised how well it worked on a Mac cause it seemed like a great interface
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:44.700]  for an iPad or an iPhone. And I think, well, I'm not sure if that's the best thing to do
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:49.300]  on a Mac, but when I started playing with it, you know, really it is pretty nice. You
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:53.100]  can just scroll, you can see the year, you know, a year is maybe a two or three inch
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:59.220]  block of very, you know, small thumbnails. And so you can go back years very easily and
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:04.820]  it's just, you know, and having been an eye photo with a crazy lag time for so long, it's,
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:07.500]  it feels like, you know, jumping into a sports car.
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:11.740]  I do think too, that it plays into something that I've been saying for a while now that
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:18.980]  Apple and, and I know people sometimes overuse the word quietly, like the Apple quietly blank,
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:25.020]  but I do think that they've sort of quietly become by, but, but not by luck, not that
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:32.700]  they, you know, backed into it, but purposefully have become arguably the leading camera company
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.860]  in the world or certainly without question, one of the leading camera companies in the
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:42.740]  world that they make devices. Now they just happen to be iPhones and iPads, but they make
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:50.700]  devices that people use as their primary cameras, or if not their primary, it's an important
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:57.460]  camera to their life. And part of that is more than just the end of today's world. It's
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:03.860]  more than just taking the photos. It is everything that happens after them, putting them, you
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:10.260]  know, having them in a place where you can instantly share them and having them be organized
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:15.460]  and the whole idea, the old school way, I mean, you still need to do it. If you're taking
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:19.720]  photos with a third party camera, a standalone camera, you still need to connect it by USB
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:26.820]  or pop the, the, you know, the card out and put it in your computer and import them. But
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.700]  the idea that you need to do anything more than that, to have them everywhere is just
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.780]  a non-starter or at least in terms of it should be now. And now with photos, it kind of is.
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:42.260]  Yeah. I, I just, I, I cannot get over how little has been made of this, but it just
[02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:47.220]  seems to me like this is a really good sign that, you know, Apple can figure out the cloud
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:49.220]  and they can do big data.
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:52.860]  I think part of it is that institutionally, I think it is truly an important thing to
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:56.080]  them. I really do. And I think it's one of those things where there's a lot of people
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:01.420]  that Apple all the way up to the highest levels, um, who are, you know, pretty serious about
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:04.820]  their photography. I mean, Phil Schiller is definitely serious about photography. I mean,
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:09.180]  I know that for a fact, like as a hobby, you know, it's, you know, he listed like two or
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:13.540]  it's like, he's got like two or three things in his Twitter bio. It's like Apple cars and
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:17.660]  Apple cars, sports and photography or something like that.
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:22.160]  It's interesting about the iPhone as a camera though, you know, when you first had pictures
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:27.540]  on the iPhone, definitely a point and shoot was a better camera. And now that's not the
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:33.260]  case anymore. And I've got a mirrorless SLR, you know, it's, it's not a super nice one,
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:38.100]  but it's nice. And it takes better pictures than which one do you have at this point?
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:44.620]  The Olympus PL five. And, um, I bought that 20 millimeter pancake lens with it and it's
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:49.940]  a 1.7, I believe. And that's all I ever use. I just use that pancake lens. It's great.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:55.800]  But the, um, I'm getting to the point where I, um, I don't even use that that 20 on that
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:03.200]  though is in 35 millimeter equivalence is probably like a, like 40. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.460]  It's pretty tight, but the, um, but you know, just the 1.7 is great. You know, you get a
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:13.420]  nice blurry background. The classic lens though. Like if you know, like the old school advice
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:17.380]  on how do you learn to be a photographer is you get a 50 millimeter prime and put it on
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:22.620]  your camera and then pretend like it doesn't come off. Yeah. I had a, I called it the nifty
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:30.300]  50 I had on my old can't can 80, 80 bucks. Great market. Yeah. It was like $90, $90 lens
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.180]  new from Canon. And you could get the Japanese version that doesn't really have the U S warranty
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:40.180]  for 80, which is what everybody did. I got the, um, a friend of mine had the 1.4, it
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:46.180]  was $300, but he sold to me used. I got it cheap. And, um, and I'm in orange County,
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:52.100]  Canon's national repair facility is in Irvine and like, it's like 80 bucks and I'll fix
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:56.180]  the lens. And I had like that the lens broke like two or three times. Cause every time
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:00.020]  I let somebody else use the camera, they would start cranking it. Like it was a zoom and
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:04.620]  just do something to it. But the, um, but now I got tired of carrying that big one.
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:09.620]  So I got the Olympus and now I'm getting at the point where I almost use the phone exclusively.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:14.780]  It's not because, I mean, the pictures are close enough for most things and having the
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:19.340]  geo data and everything there and having it already in my library, the moment I take it
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:23.740]  to me are becoming so convenient that it's, it's taking over. The thing for me is that
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:29.300]  it's, um, Mike, my, my photos have always been, or at least in the, in the iPhone world,
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:35.380]  I've always, I've always had two, two collections of photos. The photos that I took with my
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:40.100]  regular cameras, which, you know, used to be an iPhoto years ago for the last, I don't
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:44.360]  know, 10 years have been in Lightroom and then my iPhone photos, which have been on
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:52.420]  my iPhone. And I never bothered to put my iPhone photos into Lightroom because it just
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:56.660]  didn't seem, just didn't seem worthwhile and I didn't want to take them off. I wanted to
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:00.340]  keep them on the phone. And now in the new world, they're both, it goes both ways. I
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:05.940]  not only have my iPhone photos on my Mac, but I have any photos that I took, you know,
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:10.220]  that I take with a regular camera just magically show up on my iPhone. Well, it seems like
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:14.020]  they've solved a big problem for people. And, um, and I don't, I feel like we're not, you
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:17.780]  know, and again, it's just the way human beings are. We're, we're way more likely to spend
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:22.360]  time complaining about what isn't right than we are praising what goes, what goes well.
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:27.940]  But I really do feel that the photos thing, you know, you can add a finally if you want,
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:31.980]  but I really do feel like it's kind of gone unheralded and it really, and I know it's
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:36.060]  not perfect. I'm sure that there are people out there listening who had something go wrong
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:40.540]  during the initial upload or the import or whatever. Um, but for the most part, I think
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:44.380]  it was a really clean launch and I think it worked really well and it continues to work
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:48.180]  really well. And the thing I know one time that I was blown away is, uh, took a taken
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:52.060]  screenshots with my watch and you take a screenshot with your watch and then it shows up on your
[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:57.420]  phone. Uh, you know, almost instantly, at least in most cases, by the time I unlock
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:00.940]  the phone, it's already there. Um, and when I want to send it to somebody, but I'm on
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:06.140]  my Mac, I used to take the screenshots on my phone and like airplane to myself, to the
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:10.660]  Mac and then put it into chatter or email or whatever. Um, and then like a week ago,
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:14.340]  I was like, Hey, maybe they just show, I guess they're supposed to show up in the photos
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:18.300]  app. And if I leave the photos app running, they just show up. It's so great.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:23.860]  Well, it's like when I was doing my, my wife's 36,000 photo upload, I figured the whole network
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:27.900]  was going to be crashing. And at the same time I did, I did instead of writing the book,
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:33.220]  I did a video, I did this big video on photos and so I was testing it and I'm literally
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:39.540]  like making corrections on my iPad and I've got my Mac book pro open there while I'm doing
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:45.780]  the corrections and they show up almost immediately as soon as I finished the correction. And
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:49.860]  it's like, that's another thing that to me is super useful now because I can use my iPad
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:53.920]  and sit in front of the TV. And like everybody, when I go to a family event, I shoot like
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:59.260]  200 pictures of which really 20 are the ones I should keep, but I never have time to go
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:03.000]  through and sort that out. So I ended up keeping all these pictures and now I'm going back
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.900]  to these old events and just like, but the iPad is very easy to see him and pick the
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:10.580]  ones you want to keep and the ones you want to delete and even make cropping adjustments
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:15.340]  and little things like that with your finger. I mean, it's the whole process now is easier
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:20.500]  and I don't know, I'm just really happy to see. I was worried if I had one worry about
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:25.820]  Apple over the last few years, it seemed like they had this hole with cloud services and
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:30.580]  obviously everything's heading that direction in a lot of ways. And it seemed like they,
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:35.220]  I don't know, you know, there's a perception of institutional arrogance or that they feel
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:38.620]  like, well, we're making so much money with this other stuff. We don't have to worry about
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:42.520]  that. I was worried that one day they were going to wake up and be irrelevant because
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.500]  they never got the cloud figured out. And, um, this to me is like a really great sign
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:52.180]  that they're, they, they understand that I've got a lot of chores ahead of me on the photo
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:56.300]  front because I'm not all in, I've still got my, you know, last 10 years of photos, they're
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:00.660]  all still in Lightroom. And I think what I'm going to want to do is export everything.
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:04.300]  Maybe, you know, I've got the space, I'll keep, I'm not going to like delete the Lightroom
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:10.340]  library, but I want to export everything and then import it into photos and have it there.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.480]  Um, but one thing I'm not, I'm not sure about, maybe I, hopefully you can answer it is what
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:20.420]  goes on when you shoot raw and you import on a real camera. And I don't like, like your
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:25.420]  Olympus, you shoot raw. Do you shoot raw? Uh, not anymore. I used to. All right. Well,
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:31.540]  what if you did, if you shoot raw and you, it'll take her. And then what sinks over to
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:37.940]  your iOS devices that did it as I photo take care of creating JPEG thumbnails. The way
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.120]  it works is with the, uh, the thumbnails you're getting are super small. That's the reason
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.400]  why you can see your whole library on your, on your 16 gigabyte phone. And then when you
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:52.820]  tap on one of them, it hits the internet and it pulls down a bigger version, but it's not
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:56.780]  going to pick down. Like if you look on your phone screen, it's going to, it's still going
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:00.500]  to optimize when it downloads the image. At least that's the way it was explained to me
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:06.580]  in a way I, I discovered. So you're never going to get like the full size image downloading
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:10.340]  to your phone. I don't believe there's any way to, you know, they're going to be paying
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:15.580]  attention to max though. And you're willing to, I know there's a setting, I forget what
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:19.700]  they call it, but there's a setting that's like optimized photo storage. And what that
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:26.160]  does is it means, do you really want all of your photos here locally and in the cloud,
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:29.500]  or do you just want to have these thumbnails and we'll pull them down on demand? And I
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:33.100]  know on your last episode, you had the good advice that on at least one of your max, you
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:40.100]  should definitely have it so that your whole library is there just it in the name of duplication.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:44.060]  So that if, and as much as I like it, I don't want to give apple everything in the cloud
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:49.180]  and just say it's safe because why not have it both places just in case the server, you
[02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:53.580]  know, that something happens on the iCloud photo storage and your photo library on in
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:57.940]  the iCloud gets corrupted. Well, you've still got your photos on your Mac and then you can
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:02.920]  re upload just in case, right? Murphy's law. But what if you have two max and you want
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:08.680]  both max to have your full collection. If you import raw on Mac, a does Mac B get the
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:10.800]  raw image too.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:16.340]  I don't know. I don't know. I haven't tested that. I know that Mac, if mo both Mac, a and
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:20.760]  Mac B are downloading all images, you're going to get, I believe full size images on both
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:26.180]  max. I would assume that you get the raw image, but I'm not certain thinking you do. That's
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:30.160]  a good question because like for edits, you'd want the raw version wherever you're right.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:35.860]  And I'm, you know, and I'm wondering where the, um, like your iPad is only going to get
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:41.540]  a JPEG, uh, you know, and even when you pull it down and get the full version of it, I'm
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:45.640]  just wondering where that JPEG gets created. Does it get created on the cloud or does it
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:50.680]  get created on your Mac while it's uploading to the cloud? And I'm kind of suspecting that
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:56.320]  maybe it gets created on your Mac, which is why that upload process is CPU intensive,
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.920]  not just network intensive.
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.340]  Yeah. And, and when you think about it, the fact that you can crop the, the downloaded
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:07.880]  version on your iPad, but it's still going to crop the full version on your Mac. I mean,
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:13.020]  there was some serious engineering work done to make all that happen. Definitely. I mean,
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:17.740]  this was not easy. Um, I'm trying to think what else, anything else you want to talk
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:23.300]  about this week? No, man. It's uh, it's all good. It's been, it's been a pretty exciting
[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:27.040]  couple months for people to like Apple stuff. I totally agree. And it's, you know, and,
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.420]  and here we are heading right into WWDC, which is, you know, you know, peak, you know, like
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:35.860]  the first half of the year, this is like the, the peak. And then, you know, they'll, they'll
[02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:40.120]  go silent for two months and then, you know, ramp back up in September again. But it's,
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.120]  I'm going for the first time in my life, I'm going to WWDC. Wow. You've never been there
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:47.840]  before. No, I've always gone to Mac world, but you know, like I'm a power user. I'm not
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.940]  a developer, but you know, Mac world's not around anymore. Now my new employer has a
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:57.780]  very liberal policy. So, well, you know, Jason's now, I'm sure you saw it a few weeks ago.
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.240]  He wrote, uh, was it for I'm more, I forget. Cause he now it's like, it used to be, you
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:05.500]  always knew where Snell was writing, but now he's bouncing around, but he, you know, that
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:11.200]  the WWDC has taken over. It's the hub of the Apple community world, whether you're a developer
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.920]  or not, which is weird because it, you know, years ago you would have never thought you'd
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.500]  never recommend to someone who wasn't a developer that they go to WWDC. I certainly still wouldn't
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:23.240]  recommend you try to get into the lottery and get a ticket if you're not going to actually
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:28.160]  take it. I didn't even try. I'm going to try, but the, uh, but it's going to be fun being
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.040]  up there. I have so many friends that are going to be there. I'm talking it. I'm not
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.340]  sure if I'm supposed to say it or not. I think I'm gonna be talking to all comp about stuff.
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:41.240]  So yeah, well there's all comp and then there's a new conference, uh, layers. Um, what is
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:50.640]  the URL for the layers conference? I'm actually talking at that one. Um, it is, uh, bring
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.760]  your layers.com. But if you just type layers conference, I'm sure it'll come up. But it's,
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.760]  uh, like the Tuesday and Wednesday of WWDC week and it is literally right around the
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.680]  corner. I mean like whatever hotel anybody would pick for going to Moscone, um, where
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:09.940]  the layers conferences is in the, it's, it sounds funny that it's in the mall, but it's
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:15.320]  like that, that's a very strange mall up on market street. I went on the self-employed
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:22.920]  budget hotel. I'm at the Mosser and I don't have my own bathroom. So I'm going to be,
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:28.340]  I told my wife, I said, well, all of my, um, you know, you know, sometimes I would prefer
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:32.440]  not to be around people, you know, sometimes you're just not good at getting out. This
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:37.140]  will solve that problem for me. Cause I'm not going to want to be at my hotel at all.
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.800]  So there's like in the lobby of your hotel. But I think it's a great idea. And I do, I,
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.380]  you know, the, the, my Catholic upbringing is such that, uh, uh, there's like a guilt.
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:48.800]  Like I feel like, you know, you got to have some kind of work really. You can't just go
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:52.440]  on a boondoggle and you got to have some kind of way to justify a trip like this, but there's
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.700]  so many things. There's all comp, there's this new layers conference, which looks great.
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.740]  And it's, uh, they call it a design conference for the Mac and iOS community. Um, you don't
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:05.400]  have to be a designer to go, but it's, you know, certainly if you are, it is a fantastic
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.120]  thing. That's a great deal, a tremendous lineup of speakers, but then you can be there for
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.500]  the week and it really is it, there's no zero doubt in my mind, the WWDC is now what Mac
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:18.560]  world used to be, which is the hub where, you know, people like me and you can get together
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.400]  and we don't see each other very often. I haven't seen you since Mac world some number
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.880]  of years ago, I believe. Yeah. Yeah. It was a couple of years ago. And, uh, the, the difference
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.960]  on Mac world gave normal users a chance to go and just kind of see what's new. I mean,
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:35.480]  there was a need that we've lost with Mac world and I don't know what, if somebody ever
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.780]  is going to try and fix that. But, um, you know, it's still not a complete replacement
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:43.200]  for Mac world, but it's the best we got at this point.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.760]  Oh, I guess I should say, um, cause I know people are asking, I've the last couple of
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:53.720]  years, I've done a live version of the talk show during WWDC. Uh, and that is on again
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:59.440]  as well. That will be on Tuesday night, uh, as it has been the last few years, nothing
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:03.960]  to announce yet in terms of tickets or anything. But I think what I'm going to do, uh, and
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.960]  is why I'm bringing it up on the show is, um, so that listeners of the show get the
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:14.880]  first crack at it is next episode, whatever my next episode next week, uh, I'll talk about
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:21.440]  it on the show before I announce it on Darren fireball. And so if you want to get a ticket
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.240]  and has sold, I have to admit it has sold out every year. So, um, if you want to get
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.800]  in the best way to get in would be to, uh, wait for me to announce not this show next
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:36.560]  week's show, which would be episode, uh, one 20, I believe, uh, and quick download the
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.720]  show and start listening. And then I'll give you the, you know, listen to the show and
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.780]  then you'll, you'll know where to go to buy your tickets for that. Keep your Tuesday night
[02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:48.360]  free though Tuesday. I'm totally going to that. I can't wait. You're in, you don't have
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:52.000]  to worry about it. I'm, I'm, uh, I'm just really looking forward to it just in a couple
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.920]  weeks. So I don't know what to expect, but, uh, I'm going to be, uh, I'm going to be on
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:03.440]  the road that week. I'm not going to be hanging out in my hotel room with no bathroom. David
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:08.520]  sparks will need to borrow your bathroom. Exactly. I'll just be like in the hotel. Those
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:14.640]  of you who are coming, just be willing to offer David your, your back. You need to bring
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.900]  like a, you need to bring an external battery pack for your iPhone and you need to bring
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:25.200]  a porta potty and a toothbrush and the toothbrush. Somebody should make an external battery pack
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.840]  for that. That has a little toothbrush that flips out of the side. I stayed at the monster
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.240]  once years ago for Mac world. I was, they had me like giving like the, one of the very
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.040]  first sessions and like one of the very last. So I, and as back when macro went a whole
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.680]  week and I, so I ended up having me in like seven days there and I wanted to save money.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.100]  So I got one and it's great cause the sink is right next to the bed. You can literally
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:53.280]  just sit up in bed and brush your teeth. Where is the monster? I know it's next door to Moscone.
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:57.760]  I mean it's the best in terms of location. Yeah, I don't think I've, I've never stayed
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:02.360]  there. Yeah, I don't know. It's a, I just decided this year I was going to go on the
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.640]  cheap. Oh, I've, I have totally gone there on the cheap over the years and you know,
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.600]  I did, you know what? A lot of the cheaper hotels in that area there, it's easy to complain
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:14.260]  about it, but they're, you know, it's not bad. There's, that's great. It's great. It's
[02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:18.920]  right there. And you can just go back to your room and drop stuff off. It's nice. But the,
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.040]  but when they told me to say, well, we don't even have any rooms left with bathrooms. I'm
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:26.760]  like, well, how exactly does that work? And they're like, well, there's a community like
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:31.320]  bathroom, like for four rooms, you go out in the hallway and you, you can lock yourself
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.240]  in there. And I'm like, okay, well I'm definitely not going to be spending much time at the
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:36.240]  hotel.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.800]  Uh, yeah, but that's, like you said, that that's good though. You know, you're not coming
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:45.680]  up to, uh, to hang out in a hotel. Um, I do think the only, the downside WWDC isn't that
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:50.480]  big compared to so many of the conferences there because it, you know, the, the, the
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:55.520]  Moscone West has pretty significant limitations on attendance. Like they just can't make it
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:03.660]  bigger. Um, but there's a lot of people who go now who aren't going, don't have WWDC passes,
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:12.820]  but nowhere near as big as like Oracle world or, uh, GDC, even the game developer conference.
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:19.400]  Some of those ones that take up Moscone South and West have, and, and the hotel prices skyrocket.
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:25.800]  There was one year where the new iPad event, I think it was while the iPads were still
[02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:34.720]  coming out in the, in the spring, uh, coincided with one of those conferences. And I, you
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:38.920]  know, got the invitation, you know, the press pass, you know, the typical Apple, you know,
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:44.320]  came out like a week before the event and I went to book and then like all of the hotels
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:50.260]  were like $800 a night. I was like, what the hell? And it was because of this mega conference.
[02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:56.900]  So WWDC week isn't like that, but the overall boom in San Francisco and the way the economy
[02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:03.180]  is just on fire there has really driven up hotel prices. That's like the biggest, that's
[02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:07.700]  the biggest downside to having this thing in San Francisco is that it, you know, for
[02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:12.040]  people who are on a tighter budget, it, it kind of stinks. It's going to be fun though.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:20.580]  A couple of years ago, like around 2008, 2009, um, because of the economic, you know, shit
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:24.020]  show of the world, it would kind of help because it was like when daring fireball was still
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:28.860]  really flying low to the ground economically, uh, used to be able to get like a four, four
[02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:34.300]  and a half star hotel for like $175. Like there were a couple of years for WWDC where
[02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:37.700]  there's a gang of us who were staying at the intercontinental, which is literally right
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.380]  next door. I mean, it's like physically connected to Moscow, any West it's great. And we got,
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:47.020]  we got deals on hot wire for like $175 and it's seriously not happening this year. No,
[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:52.060]  it is nowhere near like that, but it was, it was fantastic for someone, you know, who's
[02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:57.180]  really, really did not have the budget for six nights in San Francisco. Yeah. Anyway,
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:00.100]  I will see you there. Thank you for being here. Let's get some plugs in, man. Do you
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:01.580]  have stuff to plug?
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:06.540]  Yeah, I guess the big plug for me is just max barkey.com. That's where all the stuff
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:12.180]  is max barkey.com. Your new photos for Mac field guide is there. You can just go to max
[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.740]  barkey.com and there's a big link to it in the sidebar, but it's just max barkey.com
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:24.420]  slash photos. This is a two and a half hour screencast tutorial guide, like mega guy,
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:26.300]  like a book in screencast form.
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:30.540]  Yeah. I mean like I was going to do a book, but this one, it, since it's just one app
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:34.500]  and maybe more since it's a look over my shoulder and learn it as we're kind of weird making
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:38.580]  it cause there's some of my, you know, I use my family library cause you need, where am
[02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:43.940]  I going to do it where I have 30,000 photos that I can use as an example. So, uh, but
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:47.300]  it's great. And I thought I just went soup to nuts and at the end it ended up being two
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:51.860]  and a half hours, which was probably longer than I would have liked it to be, but it cover
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:57.540]  everything. So there you have it. It costs 10 bucks. Yeah. Now I, on your show, you tracked
[02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:03.540]  your hours that you put into this is embarrassing. It's not embarrassing. No, you, you, you're,
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:08.140]  you're embarrassed by this use. You spent 81 hours in the production through 83 hours
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:12.020]  in the production of this screencast. So in other words though, I don't think that's embarrassing
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:16.180]  at all though. I think that's the way film and video production is. I mean, that's why
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:22.640]  it takes, you know, a three month shoot and two and a two, two years of pre-production
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:26.340]  for a star Wars movie to come out, right? Like you, you know, and the star Wars movies
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:31.660]  going to be two hours, you know, it's, it takes a long time. Uh, but that 10 bucks,
[02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:35.900]  it's crazy good deal. But in other words, this is not, David did not just turn on the
[02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:41.220]  screencast thing and start talking for two hours, which exactly what I do with this podcast.
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:45.100]  It's not like that at all. There's imagine if this, imagine if this show had gone on
[02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:50.180]  for 80 hours and then painstakingly we picked out the two hours of it that were solid gold.
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:54.620]  That's what this is like. So for 10 bucks, it is an absolute steal. And if you have any
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:24:01.020]  kind of interest in the new photos, um, pretty much make up, you know, both the app and the,
[02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:06.380]  the, the, the sinking, the iCloud, you know, covers everything, covers everything. Uh,
[02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:11.580]  so there you go. You go to max Parkey to get that and you got your show over at, uh, uh,
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:21.460]  the, the Mac power user show at relay.fm slash NPU. NPU is Mac power users. Yep. Uh, one
[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:27.060]  more about the Markdown book. Yeah. Why not? I need to, if there's ever a time to plug
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:32.220]  the Markdown book, it would be your first appearance on the talk show. Yeah, I wrote
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:37.100]  that book with Eddie Smith and um, I, I talked about Markdown a lot on the Mac power users
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:42.940]  cause I just think it's so awesome. I mean, on the lawyer side of my life, um, you know,
[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:48.700]  my industry runs on Microsoft word, but I like to have text in a very mobile agile format
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:54.300]  and I want to be able to open it on my iPad or my Mac or whatever. So I was a big proponent
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:58.260]  of using text until the very end and then letting someone format it. And then I found
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:03.220]  Markdown and it like made it possible for me to do a lot of the formatting myself. So
[02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:08.720]  I'm not the person you were thinking of when you gave birth to this, but I still use it
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:12.420]  all the time. And people were writing the show and say, you keep talking about Markdown,
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:16.260]  I don't understand it. And it's not that hard. I mean, you could figure it out, but sometimes
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:20.900]  people want kind of a more, you know, a walkthrough. So Eddie and I had this book and we did, we
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:24.700]  screencast it the whole thing, you know, how do you make emphasis or how do you, and we
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.380]  picked some of our favorite apps that use Markdown and showed how you would write Markdown
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:33.260]  and export it and the various things you could do with it. And, um, I really need to update
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:36.500]  that book. Frankly, I'm going to try and talk you into doing an interview with me on the
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.900]  next update. Cause we put some audio interviews in there with people that use Markdown in
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:45.700]  their daily lives. And, um, it's, it's a lot of fun. And all those books I do and I books
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:51.620]  author are really big. I mean, they're like, you know, you know, they're like gigabyte
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:56.580]  sized books because they all have like an hour and a half of video inside of them. So
[02:25:56.580 --> 02:26:00.980]  if you get one of those books, just be ready to give it a few minutes to download because
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:04.380]  there's a lot of data in there. But I will, I will tell you right now, yes, I will do
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:09.180]  an interview for you for the next version of the Markdown book. Excellent. It's criminal
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:13.700]  that I blew you off the last time. I didn't say no, but I never actually made myself available.
[02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:20.180]  Well, I figured you're busy, so it's fine. Busy, lazy, you know, but anyway, it's criminal
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:23.280]  that I didn't because it's really an honor. It's the type of thing. It's just the type
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:28.380]  of little thing that you just, I never expected it. I get like long story short, I made Markdown
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:31.680]  and I, I thought I should give this to the world. I shouldn't hold it. I just, this seems
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:35.920]  so good that I, you know, maybe everybody should use this. And then I put it out there
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:43.300]  and, and, and it didn't really take off that quickly. It was very slow and um, people were
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:47.300]  still using like my, and again, I totally understand why, but like it was like the little
[02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:52.180]  tiny bit of, of, of timing that was weird was I put Markdown out there and like the
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:58.340]  next week was when base camp debuted. Um, you know, now they're just base camp company,
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:03.820]  but you know, 30, the former 37 signals. And I know Jason, uh, very well. I know, I know
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:07.940]  David, you know, everybody, I, I, I don't know any, everybody there. I used to know
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:14.240]  everybody at 37 signals. Um, and all the comments and messaging in base camp was done using
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:19.900]  textile Dean Allen's thing, which is sort of a same type of thing as Markdown, but different
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:26.380]  syntax. Um, and it's, you know, just, it was just like, ah, that sucks. And I didn't totally
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.700]  know it like within one week, it's not like they were going to use Markdown instead of
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:33.740]  textile. I mean, obviously base camp was in development for, you know, I mean, you can,
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:37.540]  you can make apps with rails pretty quickly, but not in a week. Um, but I just thought,
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:40.060]  damn, I wish I'd come out with this sooner because I'll bet they would've used Markdown
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:43.380]  instead of textile. And then it's just didn't go anywhere. I don't know. And people, some
[02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:48.500]  people would, you know, use it. And, but then like, it was like the slowest, surest, like
[02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:53.200]  uptake, like this slow, steady thing. And then all of a sudden it's this thing and everything
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:57.660]  has Markdown built into it and people are writing books about it. And that to me is
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:00.180]  just crazy.
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:04.620]  In my, um, in my experience, the reason Markdown became so relevant to me, I was using it to
[02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:08.740]  write blog posts from X Sparky, which was great, but what really made it a big deal
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:14.860]  to me was the fact that iOS has never really supported rich text very well. And, and even
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:19.380]  if it did, I, you know, I don't want to use rich text on iOS. I just want things to be
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:24.620]  fast and to sync quickly. You know, this is before photos and Apple proving its bones.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:31.260]  And so, you know, having plain text that you can format and then open on iOS devices, I
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:35.940]  mean, Markdown was so, it was like a solution made for a problem that didn't exist yet.
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:40.500]  I would disagree that, that Mac West doesn't have good support for rich text. I think it
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.700]  had great support for rich text. The problem is there's never been a rich text format that
[02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:54.360]  has been, um, longterm stability in a longterm, not stability, but, uh, they always get old
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:29:00.820]  and then you can't, you lose it, right. That there's no compatibility. So even RTF, which
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:06.320]  RTF is still supported great on Mac, but they never ported the RTF stuff to iOS. So anything
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:09.740]  you have in RTF doesn't go to iOS.
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:15.420]  Yeah. And I guess did I say, I meant iOS is that that's the problem is iOS you're stuck.
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:21.120]  And if you want to write on your iPad and on your Mac, you need a solution and Markdown
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:26.800]  really just does that nicely in every, it seems like every writing app. I remember when
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.060]  that was like a feature selling point of a new app that it supports Markdown and now
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:34.860]  it's like, everybody just supports Markdown. It's just in it.
[02:29:34.860 --> 02:29:38.620]  Right. Uh, I've talked to my friend Brent Simmons about it cause I know Brent was on
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:43.340]  my side, but it's, it's a little bit unrelated to Markdown, but there, you know, around that
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:50.340]  time in the late nineties and the two thousands, there was the, you know, still was a, a living
[02:29:50.340 --> 02:29:55.200]  war over styled text versus plain text for email. Like, should you be sending style text
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:58.880]  email where you can hit command I and your word is actually italicized or should you
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:04.020]  be sending plain text email? And I was staunchly on the side of the plain text that this was
[02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:10.260]  a protocol that was designed on the terminal era and it's, everything should be plain text
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:16.220]  and that way everybody will be able to read, you know, it'll look right anywhere. And clearly
[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:20.440]  the plain text side lost the war for email and nobody even really, it's not even something
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:25.500]  people argue about anymore, but it was really more of a case where we lost the battle. Email
[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:31.780]  was just a battle, but longterm plain text, uh, as, as one overall, I mean, all sorts
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:36.020]  of new things are all just plain text. Facebook is sort of a plain text platform. Twitter
[02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:39.700]  is definitely a plain text platform. Nobody even thinks about it anymore.
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:46.540]  Well, and when I look at the stuff I wrote in Mac, right in 1992, I don't know, I'm sure
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:50.380]  there's a way I could get it, but I don't know how I'd get it at this point. And that's
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:55.660]  just to me, a reminder that, you know, the stuff I spend writing, I want to be able to
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:31:00.540]  access forever. And I mean, that's another reason why markdown is a good and plain text.
[02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:05.460]  I think people got thrown off because in the, the whole early era of PCs, we kept getting
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:15.380]  more powerful CPU's, bigger displays, better rendering capabilities, better access to,
[02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:19.500]  you know, a collection of fonts, cross platform, et cetera, et cetera. And so we could keep
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:24.060]  making things fancier and fancier in terms of WYSIWYG text styling. Uh, and I love to
[02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:28.980]  design stuff, but in terms of what the canonical storage format for this stuff should be, uh,
[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:32.440]  I always thought it should always be plain text because that way, anything and everything
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:34.080]  that you do in the future will be able to read it.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.300]  And I feel like the way people have caught onto that now where things like Twitter, which
[02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:42.680]  was originally designed as like an SMS platform and then turned into a web thing and now turned
[02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:46.680]  into a mobile thing. And now people are getting them on our watches and stuff. If everything
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:50.700]  is just plain text, every time there's one of these new things that comes up, it's all
[02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:53.180]  it has to do is render text.
[02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:57.260]  I'm just, in some ways I'm glad I can't access those old things. Cause I remember I had a
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:03.040]  fascination with the original San Francisco farm and I'm sure I used it inappropriately
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:09.460]  a lot. There was no appropriate way to use it. Well, there you go. I used it inappropriately
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:13.460]  period. God, I think that would be such a great Easter egg. If like the Apple watch
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:20.420]  on it on, I mean, not great. Apple would never display it. If like April 1st, if your Apple
[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:25.220]  watch, uh, displayed everything in the old San Francisco fund, that would be so awesome.
[02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:30.800]  All right. Anything else you want to plug David? I'm great. All right. Thank you so
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:36.580]  much for your time. Uh, you have to be on again sometime. Um, say hello to Katie and
[02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:42.900]  I will see you next month at the WWDC. All right. All right. Thank you. All right. I'm
[02:32:42.900 --> 02:33:12.860]  going to stop.
