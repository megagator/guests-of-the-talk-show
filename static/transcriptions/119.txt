[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  So this is the show, you know, all right, David Sparks is this is your first time on the talk show. I know it's kind of exciting. It's very exciting. This is the thing. This is the problem.
[00:13.000 --> 00:21.000]  I've been wanting to have you on for a long time. And the reason I've put it off is I feel like it's going to take the entire episode just to tell people everything you do.
[00:21.000 --> 00:46.000]  No, busy guy John. What you are prolific. It's you and Renee Richie and Jason Snell make me sick. I feel like I feel like I get to a Friday and I feel like, you know, I recorded a podcast and I thought it was pretty good episode and I had one good article on Darren Fireball. I'm like, that's a good week. And then I look at like what like something you guys do and snails on like 17 podcasts. He produces like 16 of them.
[00:46.000 --> 00:57.000]  You put out a book and the screen cast and do a podcast and keep it. And Renee, of course, writes about seven or eight thousand words a week.
[00:57.000 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah, there's a, I think it was the funniest monk at one point who said, it's not the notes you play. It's the notes you don't play. So you're like monk. You know, you're the guy.
[01:16.000 --> 01:31.000]  You're the one outside with the wonderful Katie Floyd. Yep. And that is in it and it just moved. This is and it's motivated me because I, you know, somebody moves. You move a show that goddamn feed redirection. It never works right.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's it's terrifying. It is terrifying. It's terrifying when you move a show because you're your listeners are subscribed to your feed.
[01:38.000 --> 01:51.000]  The world is when someone subscribes your podcast because they're making a little bit of a commitment. And then when you do your next episode, you're getting it pushed to them when they open their podcast app of choice or maybe their podcast app pulls it down automatically.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  But there it is. And that's great. And you know, I know there's people who don't who listen who don't subscribe who just wait and see if it sounds like a good episode and then they just hit play.
[01:59.000 --> 02:17.000]  And that's great to love listeners, but subscribers are the best because subscribers give you consistency from week to week. And then when you move networks or you just, even if you don't even move networks, if you just do something behind the seeds where you change from, you know, WordPress to Squarespace or, you know, something like that.
[02:17.000 --> 02:26.000]  You have to change the feed. Something always goes wrong. And so it's always a, you know, I want to help people when they do stuff like that and get people to, you know, hey, double check.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  If you were subscribed to Mac power users, go to the new site. Now the new site is you're over there on the relay.
[02:33.000 --> 02:47.000]  Yeah, we're actually shutting down. We've had Mac power users dot com since the beginning, which is kind of funny that's back in like 2008, 2009 when we were starting the show, we were trying to pick the name of a show and you just search websites. Oh, Mac power users available.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  That's a good name. So we're actually shutting down the dot com. We're going to forward it over to everything at relay. They've got a nice system over there.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  So we're going to be great. Where you want to go and you want to listen to the show and we'll talk about a little bit more too, but it's relay.fm slash MP you.
[03:02.000 --> 03:11.000]  Yeah, or type Mac power users dot com. It'll get you there. Okay. So really, it's the first good show on relay. Yeah. Well, that's what I think.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  I don't know how these guys got by without me. Quite frankly, I don't understand either.
[03:17.000 --> 03:25.000]  I think they're getting by on the, you know, the British accent thing. I know it makes it sound, you know, he's not really British. You know, he's born in New Jersey.
[03:25.000 --> 03:37.000]  That's what I heard too. And he just likes, he likes to pronounce H funny, you know, and and people like that. So they're in. Yeah. And you know, his name isn't really spelled with a Y. He made that up too.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  It's also some kind of big iPhone cult. I'm starting to realize.
[03:42.000 --> 03:56.000]  Did you, um, when did you say you and Katie started Mac power users? 2009. So that's interesting. That's interesting. And 2009 you still chose a name that started with Mac.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  Yeah. Well, that was kind of the idea. We, um, it's kind of a, I don't know who cares about this stuff, but the, um, oh, I care.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  I like to be able to tell us what we were thinking about, you know, doing a podcast together and, and everybody.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  You know, they're a Mac world members like, don't do it. You know, everything they could be said about a podcast has been said.
[04:14.000 --> 04:23.000]  And they're kind of right. You know, they're like, well, Mac break weekly does the news and such and such. And I'm like, you know, I don't want to do something everybody else does this. So we decided, well, let's just not do it.
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  And we talked for like four or five months about, you know, what we do. And ultimately I said, I want to make a show that just talks about one thing a show.
[04:31.000 --> 04:41.000]  It doesn't have anything to do with news just talks about how to get better at email or how do you get better at this or that. And, um, and Katie's like, that's a great idea. It's good for like 10 shows and we'll be done.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  I said, well, then we'll make 10 really good shows. That was 2009. So, and you it's worked out.
[04:46.000 --> 04:56.000]  And you guys have just hit at least an end for your audience and probably my audience too. It's, it, it counts as a round number. You just finished episode 255.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  Yeah. So now you're, you're just about to enter your, your second bite.
[05:00.000 --> 05:11.000]  Yeah. I need two bite integers now. Yeah. I mean, we're not messing around. And you know what? There's plenty of, we've got stuff backed up. We have so much we want to talk about it's, I don't know. I love it.
[05:11.000 --> 05:23.000]  And this is like getting ready for this because you know, I'm also a lawyer, which is kind of nuts. And like I spent the whole morning doing lawyer stuff and just getting ready for this call and like shutting down Microsoft Word and all the other stuff that I do on that part of my life.
[05:23.000 --> 05:52.000]  Oh man, it felt great. Yeah. I love the word power user. I think that it like went full circle where in the early years of the PC revolution when PCs were just growing growing. I mean, let's, let's just say 80s and 80s through the mid to late 90s power user was used with no reservation in, you know, Mac user PC world, you know, any of those magazines would talk about, you know, tips for power users.
[05:52.000 --> 06:04.000]  And it, it, I think everybody, it's nebulously defined because it has to be there is no technical definition between, you know, it's somewhat informed user and a power user.
[06:04.000 --> 06:21.000]  But I think everybody, it, it fits a general loose description of somebody who's, who's truly an enthusiast really does want to dig into some of the details, but probably falls short of being like a developer, someone who can write their own code or, or at least at, you know, if they do write code,
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  it's more like automater and Apple script and stuff like that.
[06:26.000 --> 06:38.000]  Oh, it's, it's absolutely aspirational for our show. And, and, you know, the, the, you know, the ideal nerd in my head is John Syracuse. And, and the show is not for John Syracuse.
[06:38.000 --> 06:50.000]  You know, we're not going to talk about program program talk. I mean, a lot of our listeners, it's kind of weird because our show has a big audience, but it's not the usual geeks listening to podcasts.
[06:50.000 --> 07:00.000]  And doctors, you know, business people, you know, single months, people who just want to get better at this stuff. So it's an interesting space we occupy.
[07:00.000 --> 07:11.000]  Like, like, somebody was telling me, I forget who somebody had a dentist. So the dentist, I have someone on my friends has a dentist, but he's like a nut from Max.
[07:11.000 --> 07:24.000]  And so he's always kept his practices, you know, he does all the IT stuff for his practice and has a couple, you know, has always been a Mac guy and, you know, writes his own file maker stuff for the, you know, to keep the practice and stuff like that.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  But he's a dentist. That's his full-time thing, you know, but he has made, you know, this little, little system of stuff that works exactly the way he needs it for his practice.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  You know, that's a power user.
[07:35.000 --> 07:43.000]  And there's a good chance he listens to our show. We have a lot of dentists. Nothing we have. It's funny, we just have all walks of life, but it's fun.
[07:43.000 --> 07:56.000]  And with the Mac, there's so much you can do, I mean, with little automation tools, you don't need to learn to program. If you get good at Hazel or, you know, keyboard maestro or even just text expander, you can like make so much magic happen.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  So we talk about that stuff all the time. It's fun.
[07:59.000 --> 08:17.000]  And I do think, though, and this is one of the things I want to talk about. So you name the show Mac power users. And I do think I think that even though the naming Apple related websites, Mac, whatever, is probably always was a bad idea in hindsight, because something new is going to come.
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  Like it would have, it would have worked out poorly two decades ago if the Newton had really caught on.
[08:23.000 --> 08:32.000]  But it was harder to get legal permission to use Apple than Mac, even though Apple often objected to Mac, whatever names for some years.
[08:32.000 --> 08:46.000]  And then they kind of backed off that. But with the target audience of your and Katie show, I feel like it really does work, because I think it's harder to be the nature of iOS and the restrictions of iOS make it harder to be a power user on iOS.
[08:46.000 --> 08:58.000]  And that's not, that doesn't mean to say that you can't be. I mean, there is text expander for iOS, and then you can know about, you know, apps like launch center pro and workflow.
[08:58.000 --> 09:11.000]  Workflow is another good example. Drafts is probably like the, well, there's a bunch of power user text note type apps.
[09:11.000 --> 09:25.000]  But to me, it's different. I don't know. And I do find it interesting, because I certainly consider myself be a Mac power user, right? And, you know, be be at it to me is like the canonical Mac power user app.
[09:25.000 --> 09:46.000]  And the main group is at their entire lineup is that everything about their apps is geared towards power users in my opinion. I mean, not that you can't like a casual user can't just start using some of their apps like you could just open on the outliner and just command N and if you have any idea like from fifth grade, what an outline is you'll be right at home.
[09:46.000 --> 09:58.000]  But the whole reason that they're so successful and they can charge, you know, serious money for the app is that it's it's got so many, you know, power user features you could tweak it to make it just the way you like it.
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  On the apps like getting an on the app and just using it out of the box without like really digging in and is kind of like getting a Lamborghini and just driving it and parking lots.
[10:06.000 --> 10:20.000]  Yes, there's just so much more you can do with this thing. Yeah, but you know, our show doesn't the way we've dealt with that is and I'd almost argue that you can get more automation stuff going these days on iOS, but you know, it's it's still a journey.
[10:20.000 --> 10:30.000]  But the way we've dealt with on the shows we deal we still do shows entire shows on iPhone and iPad and iOS related topics and we just kind of ignore a problem with the name.
[10:30.000 --> 10:41.000]  I don't know it's some day we've bought some other URLs and we've talked about it, but it's like you've kind of got a brand now and yeah, I would let it go. I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it. I think people understand.
[10:41.000 --> 10:54.000]  And I think I think the thing that makes it work is that the type of iOS users who are going to be listening are going to be their their PC is a Mac too. They're not Windows people. Yeah, that's the assumption right now.
[10:54.000 --> 11:13.000]  Yeah, I find it interesting personally though, because I still definitely consider myself a Mac power user. I have a lot of custom modifications, you know, the paraphrase Han Solo that that power my whole workflow for almost everything I do from email to especially posting stuff to Daring Fireball.
[11:13.000 --> 11:25.000]  You know, custom book marklets custom automated services that I've written a lot of the stuff related around the way I do markdown.
[11:25.000 --> 11:38.000]  Two points on that. Two points on that. Number one, I wish you'd share more of that because you do post one. I used to post that stuff all the time and then somehow I've gotten away from it and I realized I've got like this backlog of what I think are some pretty cool shit.
[11:38.000 --> 11:47.000]  All right, and the second thing is I will give you the microphone for as long as you want on Mac power users one day to come on just talk about the stuff we we don't have to talk about any news.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  Just tell us how you I think it might be a good venue for I really might.
[11:51.000 --> 12:01.000]  Yeah, but I don't really use I don't really do any of that type of stuff on iOS on iOS and I use my phone a lot and and I've been noticing it with the watch and we can get to that later on the show.
[12:01.000 --> 12:12.000]  But I have been I've been running my iPhone down into the red a lot lately a lot more than I was even just like six months ago.
[12:12.000 --> 12:34.000]  But I don't really do anything power user on it. I don't use any of those apps and I don't use text expander I don't use drafts I don't use. I don't use long center pro I don't use workflow. I have loaded all of them and I've looked at them and I've appreciated them and I can see why every single one of those apps.
[12:34.000 --> 12:44.000]  Has become a hit and has like a serious enthusiast following but like the way I use my iPhone it just none of that really resonates.
[12:44.000 --> 12:54.000]  Some of the most productive stuff I've done on iOS is just sitting down opening by word because it's got a great iCloud sync and I'll just dictate text into it.
[12:54.000 --> 13:14.000]  And no formatting you know no scripts nothing just I just want to get text somewhere and like on the phone you can do that you know and and I'm an indie guy now so I'm out in my own office and so I'm out you know me I'll be sitting at Disneyland and I'll sit down for 30 minutes and just get a bunch of text into the thing and.
[13:14.000 --> 13:26.000]  The iPhone the iPad are great for that and that's a useful productivity so it doesn't have to be all you know I don't have to post from there don't have to format do anything so I want to get text somewhere and that gives me a starting point.
[13:26.000 --> 13:37.000]  Yeah I think and you know the app that I helped design and make Vesper is definitely not a power user no tap it is very very straightforward and obvious and there's there's no.
[13:37.000 --> 13:51.000]  Secret stuff for you know it doesn't have any markdown support that's like the most surprising things to so many people that there's doesn't do anything related to markdown but then I say to them all I said I write markdown if in all the time I just put asterisks around words I wanted to tell exactly.
[13:51.000 --> 14:01.000]  But braces around you are else I was like so you know it doesn't do anything with it but it's like that's the whole my whole thinking around the creation of markdown.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Low these many years ago what what the hell has it been now 11 years or something like that that's crazy.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Was that you could just entered you know an asterisk anywhere you were entering text you know.
[14:13.000 --> 14:23.000]  But you know it's I mean I don't you know you have done so much good for the internet with markdown I don't know it's a tool you just made for yourself but you know putting it out there.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  I'm I'm really appreciative of it and I've been wrote a book on markdown I don't think I get to know.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  But it's just you know it's just so useful I mean I do everything in it and I don't know.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  What are you going to get your app on the Mac because I cannot wait because I need I need it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  It's a long story.
[14:44.000 --> 14:58.000]  I need it to I can cheat and I've been cheating because I have I have Vesper for iPad running in the iOS simulator 24 7 which is easy right.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  It isn't great it's not you know it's like weird so weird yeah I don't know if you've ever do you ever have anything running in like the iOS simulator.
[15:06.000 --> 15:22.000]  Yeah I've a fiddle to read it but yeah I understand I'm not complaining because it's the iOS sim I don't know you're not supposed to use apps like this but like if you paste text in the way you do it is you're in a Mac app you select the text you copy you go over to the iOS simulator you paste but then you have to tap.
[15:22.000 --> 15:41.000]  In the text field and hit the paste like pasting just paste it into the iOS simulator Mac app then in the iOS simulator you have to tap the insertion point where you want the text to go and then tap the paste button on the little pop up menu to get it to paste into iOS you have to paste twice.
[15:41.000 --> 15:58.000]  Same thing for copying out you have to kind of would make me crazy yeah it's it well that's probably why I drink I don't know. No it's a long long story that we cannot get into where where Vesper for Mac is but we we are keenly aware that everybody wants it.
[15:58.000 --> 16:13.000]  All right good enough place right here I may take a break and do our first sponsor and it is a brand new sponsor I'm very excited to have a new sponsor I love this. It's a company called last bottle wines.
[16:13.000 --> 16:30.000]  Last bottle is a daily wine purveyor much love for its beautiful website 30 to 75% discounts on fine wine shipping included and carefully curated and often highly sought after wine selections by long time Napa Valley pros
[16:30.000 --> 16:45.000]  last bottle takes all the hassle out of deciding on what to buy and makes it a quick and educated decision does this sound does this wine sound great is the price amazing shipping included yes yes yes so easy.
[16:45.000 --> 16:57.000]  Lots of places to buy wine online of course in fact the owners of last bottle had already been doing just that for years in the Napa Valley before building last bottle the online wine business that instantly.
[16:57.000 --> 17:21.000]  It hit every wine drinkers buttons with a combined 66 years in the Napa Valley these guys are connected and they use those relationships to source outstanding wines from exceptional wineries and put it in the hands of wine lovers at sensational prices cutting out the middleman one wine a day every day sounds great to me.
[17:21.000 --> 17:32.000]  Really I'd me personally I don't know much about wine at all this sounds fantastic to me but here's the thing that they've got that's really pushed them forward is there going beyond a website.
[17:32.000 --> 17:43.000]  They've they're releasing a very simple easy to use iPhone app featuring push notifications of their daily wine offers the team at last bottle wanted a way to reach.
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  More connected audience of wine lovers and couldn't think of a better crowd to introduce to you then you guys to talk show.
[17:50.000 --> 18:00.000]  Here's the other thing to some of these wines that they get there one wine a day it's like you know like one of these is a deal of day type things right but it's just for wine well here's the thing some of times.
[18:00.000 --> 18:06.000]  It's really limited quantities so if you really want to get juice into what they're offering.
[18:06.000 --> 18:16.000]  The best way you can do it is get these push notifications you're going to get one a day but then you can go look at it and if it's one that's going to sell out sometimes they sell out within an hour or two.
[18:16.000 --> 18:29.000]  You won't miss out so if you are serious about wine or if you want to get serious about wine check these guys out it really does look beautiful really does seem like a fantastic way.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  To learn about new wines and to get great wine sent to you at what seems to me to be great great prices here's where you go.
[18:37.000 --> 18:45.000]  Go to www dot last bottle wines dot com slash the talk show.
[18:45.000 --> 18:56.000]  That's last bottle wines dot com slash the talk show and everything you need to do is right there on the website including links to their app and etc etc.
[18:56.000 --> 19:06.000]  So my thanks to last bottle great new sponsor don't you love that there's non tech companies now sponsoring tech podcasts.
[19:06.000 --> 19:20.000]  Oh I think I've been saying to people I think that that's not that I mind any of the tech companies that do sponsor it I mean because that's obvious why they do but I think that the non tech products.
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  It's brilliant and I think that all of our shows all the shows that you think of the people who listen to like Mac power users or the talk show or ATP.
[19:29.000 --> 19:44.000]  Any other shows on relay FM it's really not about tech I mean there are other podcasts and other podcasts networks that that maybe are more purely technical and sort of like the old divide between Mac publications and PC publications.
[19:44.000 --> 19:58.000]  You know and like the type of things where they where they talk about you know their first emphasis is on specs or something like that that's a different type of world like you know this shows not about that your shows not about that our show attracts our shows attract.
[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  People who are picky and care about shit that's it right and tech just happens to be one of them and so if you're product whether it's you know mattresses or wine.
[20:09.000 --> 20:16.000]  Or pillows or all this crazy shit which I never would have thought that that I'd be selling sponsorships for it.
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  I think it makes total sense that they have great success with our shows because.
[20:21.000 --> 20:31.000]  You know some chunk of our audience of the audience that listens to this show that cares about the Mac and iOS and really wants to hear us talk about the Apple Watch also really cares about wine and.
[20:31.000 --> 20:39.000]  Really wants to be able to buy it in a cool way and get a great price so I think it makes all the sense in the world. Yeah I agree.
[20:39.000 --> 20:49.000]  Sort of in a way that like a political magazine no one would ever think that in like a magazine that focuses on like national fairs that all the ads would be for.
[20:49.000 --> 20:57.000]  Politics what the hell are you even advertising politics I think the thing with tech that might be that might and I myself felt you know fell to this.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  Like I told you like years ago I wouldn't have expected these these type of sponsors but.
[21:02.000 --> 21:10.000]  Like a national affairs magazine what do they feel they're filled with ads for cars and watches and you know just all sorts of general purpose products.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  It also indicates that the the platform of podcasting is getting more legitimate.
[21:15.000 --> 21:24.000]  I mean when we first started doing ads a lot of people really had trouble understanding you know they don't even understand the metrics because everything is different from.
[21:24.000 --> 21:34.000]  Traditional advertising in fact I talked to some traditional advertising guys that just poo poo the whole thing you know but you know they don't understand that's where people are going to get content now.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  Yeah well in 2007 when this show started its first run with me and me and Dan Benjamin.
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  The very first run of it you could see those episodes at the talk show dot net still.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  We wanted sponsors and I was selling you know I was already.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  I think I went full time with Darren Fireball in 2006 so I was all and and.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  Partially based on user you know direct support from readers from memberships and t-shirts and stuff like that but the memberships and t-shirts thing really was just the way that I launched going full time.
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  That I got to be in the black like month to month which I think it was like April 2006 when I announced I was going full time.
[22:17.000 --> 22:29.000]  And sold a bunch t-shirts and had like twenty thousand dollars or something like that that we cruise on through the summer and just kind of started mowing through and got like by August it was like we had like nothing.
[22:29.000 --> 22:46.000]  But sponsorships were starting to pick up a little bit I remember by like it was either October or November where like the little excel spreadsheet where we were keeping track of it where it was the first month where it was like hey this we actually made a little more than we spend on all of our expenses.
[22:46.000 --> 22:54.000]  So I was you know by 2007 when we started the talk show I was definitely selling enough sponsorships for Darren Fireball that made it a legitimate.
[22:54.000 --> 23:02.000]  Job we couldn't find anybody to sponsor the podcast I mean like nobody we couldn't even sell it spots for like 250 bucks.
[23:02.000 --> 23:08.000]  Yeah I'd never heard the Darren Fireball origin story before it's interesting.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  Well it's a long story.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  It takes a pair though you know to like give up a job.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  Well you've sort of done I was I don't want to talk about me let's talk about you.
[23:19.000 --> 23:28.000]  So you have already said you are an attorney now you there's another reason I put off putting off in the show now you live in summer and Southern California.
[23:28.000 --> 23:41.000]  Yeah Orange County right so that's why I've been waiting to have you on the show right now today here in Philadelphia it is 70 degrees in sunny it was 70 degrees in sunny yesterday I believe the forecast tomorrow is around 70 degrees in sunny.
[23:41.000 --> 23:51.000]  So F you I don't even have the weather widget on my my Apple watch because I live in Southern California what do you need that for somebody said that to me we were I forget I had a friend.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Oh is Adam Lisa Gore.
[23:55.000 --> 24:09.000]  The other week before he was on on my show and we were you know preparing and he's so so so so excited about the Apple watch and he was like let me see he goes quick without changing anything show me your watch face and I sent him a screenshot of my watch face.
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  And he's like why utility utility it is utility utility with no guest no hour numbers with the date at three o'clock.
[24:18.000 --> 24:33.000]  With the fitness top right weather top left and right now I have my calendar at the bottom but I I did all around with that and sometimes turn that just turn it off to nothing rather than have that goddamn no more events in in all caps.
[24:33.000 --> 24:43.000]  Well that's kind of the geeks are really mad about that no more events thing I don't know it doesn't bother me it really bothers me and because it bothers me because.
[24:43.000 --> 25:02.000]  If it was a real watch if it was a mechanical way of doing it it would just blank out like so the the equivalent and again this isn't skewer more thick it's not they're not making it look like it flips around and that it's a little cut out panel that shows this right I think they've designed it perfectly.
[25:02.000 --> 25:10.000]  But it is sort of mimicking the way that like like the way that the the little hour or not the hour the day the month thing at three o'clock.
[25:10.000 --> 25:20.000]  It it's a little panel just like on a mechanical watch on an automatic watch so if you think about like a train station and there's the board that shows all of the upcoming trains.
[25:20.000 --> 25:33.000]  When there's like room to show 12 but they there's only seven trains coming in the next you know reasonable amount of time the bottom five rows don't say no more trains.
[25:33.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's just they just leave it blank like if there's nothing left the natural state of an information panel is to just show nothing.
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  And it's actually takes effort to have it display no more events I mean there's code that does that so that that code could display blank just as easily.
[25:50.000 --> 26:01.000]  The explanation I've heard the best theory I've heard for why they show that is that if you are the sort of person I think that the dividing line of whether you are bothered by this or not is whether you have a lot of event.
[26:01.000 --> 26:13.000]  It's on your calendar or not do you live the sort of life where you have a lot of meetings and stuff like that and that you seldom see no more events.
[26:13.000 --> 26:30.000]  And when you that's me and when you do see it it's like a relief it's it's like an inbox zero type of euphoria that you get right it's like my day is done no more events it actually pleases you to see it because you started your day with a whole bunch of stuff that that that was going to cycle through.
[26:30.000 --> 26:42.000]  Whereas with me more often than not you know I've got nothing on it on a regular day or the only thing I have I do have like a calendar subscription to the Yankees schedule.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  And so the only thing on my watch is just telling me the Yankees played seven but I knew that already you know I don't really need that on the calendar thing.
[26:50.000 --> 27:02.000]  I also mean like you're living right brother I think it's a lot of events in mind so I think I think the no more events thing I think it hopefully it'll change I could I really you know again.
[27:02.000 --> 27:19.000]  I just like a constant refrain of the last decade is I know like at some point around a decade ago we collectively realize that adding preferences every time there's any kind of dispute over something is not the way to build sustainable software for years to come because eventually you end up with.
[27:19.000 --> 27:31.000]  You know at any given one feature it's not a bad idea but as a general principle if you keep doing that you end up with these crazy you know there's way too many preferences here and you're lost trying to find anything.
[27:31.000 --> 27:40.000]  But I do think that maybe this one should be a setting and I the reason why I feel like some people want to see that and some people are just annoyed by that.
[27:40.000 --> 27:51.000]  I don't know that anybody you know I guess on my side of the fence would really care if it never said no more events again I'd be fine if it was blank at the end of the day.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  Seems like the people on the side of saying get rid of it are much more passionate about that than people that would want to keep it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:11.000]  I wouldn't mind too if there was some way that it would show the argument I've seen is that some people say that if it showed nothing it would create an anxiety in them because it would make them feel like the calendar wasn't sinking anymore.
[28:11.000 --> 28:22.000]  You know that it had lost the connection and enter watch was no and that they do have an event upcoming but that the watch isn't reading it you know that somehow.
[28:22.000 --> 28:44.000]  I don't know I can't really buy that it's interesting because I used a pebble for a long time I write up until the time the Apple watch released and I was always the pebble was always losing connection with the phone and you know whether it was a calendar entry or the weather or whatever it just you know it was clearly bad and or old data.
[28:44.000 --> 28:55.000]  And every since the Apple watch arrived I mean it's just not even an issue for me I always know that if I look at the weather it's going to be the actual current weather actually where I'm located or the calendar data is going to be accurate.
[28:55.000 --> 29:08.000]  There's been no failure I mean I have complete faith in it at this point and I guess that's probably unfair to pebble because they're not Apple they don't have the same access to the operating system that the Apple watch guys had but boy it just works.
[29:08.000 --> 29:19.000]  In fact that's the weird thing about the watches you don't fiddle with it much in my case I mean once I figured it out I just started wearing it and it was my watch what and that was that what's your watch face.
[29:19.000 --> 29:31.000]  Utility what color black I mean utility out that the watch itself is the what do they call it what what your what your highlight color for you orange aren't saying here yeah the default I love.
[29:31.000 --> 29:44.000]  Yeah me too my high school was black and orange and I always thought that those they were it not just out of like sheer loyalty you know to whatever shitty colors your high school had.
[29:44.000 --> 29:51.000]  I always thought it was it was a good look and of a rare one that there's not many teams and sports with black and orange.
[29:51.000 --> 30:02.000]  The Tigers know we were the the mountaineers Tigers is an natural I'd you know Tigers is usually like the like the NFL Bengals you know it's a natural orange and black combo.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  My high schools black and orange shows for a minute there I thought we may have got the same school.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  When that had been funny.
[30:09.000 --> 30:22.000]  But yeah so I've got and I've got the would they call it the budget Darth Vader watch you know the black aluminum with the the rubber band the black rubber and the orange it looks really nice together.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  I do the same thing when I use the modular face I have them all orange.
[30:25.000 --> 30:35.000]  Yeah yeah I like the orange my son has it as as red which I've seen a lot of people with screenshots you know for modular he's a yeah he's a digital guy.
[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  He get his watch I lost him I heard you talking to you know he got it he and I had a schedule.
[30:41.000 --> 30:52.000]  So everything everything we've ordered for the house has shown up except from my black steel links watch which my seemingly nobody has gotten yet.
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.000]  My oldest daughter is freshman in college she got one and she got it finally and she she sent me a diagram on it.
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  I'm like oh cool she sent me a message she wrote poop.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  That's a good game exactly.
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.000]  So you pooped on my watch she said yeah I know.
[31:13.000 --> 31:17.000]  I tried to draw a pile of proof the one time it's not I'm not good enough.
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.000]  Yeah I can't draw anything on this thing I mean just it's terrible.
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.000]  Yeah I'm not.
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  I don't know if that's really gonna be a thing.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  The heartbeat thing with my wife that's cool the taps we you can kind of develop a language with the taps.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  But the drawing the picture thing I'm not sure where where that's going.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  Yeah I don't know.
[31:38.000 --> 31:52.000]  The other thing that I don't know about is the the interface for you tap the side button to bring up the little twelve o'clock.
[31:52.000 --> 31:57.000]  You know the twelve spot dial for picking a contact.
[31:57.000 --> 32:01.000]  And now that so many people I know have an apple watch.
[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  Are you beyond twelve oh it's definitely and so what do you do.
[32:05.000 --> 32:10.000]  I had to start I've already had to cut people.
[32:10.000 --> 32:21.000]  And in that this doesn't even mention the people who I might want to have on a quick contact list who don't have apple watch but I want them there so that I could quick send them a text message.
[32:21.000 --> 32:30.000]  From my wrist right I don't is there even a way to send a tap or a picture to someone who's not on that list of twelve I don't think there is.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  No no no but you can still initiate a phone call or a text.
[32:34.000 --> 32:48.000]  So it's a way to tell you can actually tell whether somebody has an apple watch registered to their Apple ideas you put them in your your friends list that twelve spot friends list and if they have an apple watch they have three options.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  Yeah the center but the center but exists and if not they don't and so.
[32:53.000 --> 33:02.000]  I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago like an in anticipation I figured I didn't know but I figured that Jim Dow rumple would be getting.
[33:02.000 --> 33:15.000]  It would be getting a watch before April 24th so every day I was checking to see if he'd gotten one yet and then like on the twenty thirty he showed up with the thing and then I quick send them a picture of a day.
[33:15.000 --> 33:19.000]  Because I want to be the first person to do it.
[33:19.000 --> 33:30.000]  But it doesn't issue because this watch is going to be popular and like if you want it so if you want to be able to do that with a friend they have to get on your list of twelve.
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.000]  Even though you may want somebody else that doesn't have a watch on that list of twelve or maybe you have more than twelve people that have watches.
[33:37.000 --> 33:58.000]  Just seems like a very limiting interface for something that they clearly intend to be a massively important part of the watch given that it's the one and only feature that that is that you can do with there's only two buttons on the thing hardware buttons and one of them when you single press it it's all it there is no configuration all it does is bring this side menu up.
[33:58.000 --> 34:08.000]  Or friends list up from the side and to limit it to twelve like that really feels really limited.
[34:08.000 --> 34:17.000]  It's really weird and now that I'm filled up with twelve somebody forget who it was but somebody sent me a doodle the other day.
[34:17.000 --> 34:33.000]  And I wanted to add them to my list but I already had twelve and at that point what you have to do is you have to go to the phone and delete somebody and add that person manually like there's no way to do it right there on the fly as you get it.
[34:33.000 --> 34:54.000]  Yeah it's I bet that evolves I think it has to I think it's it's way to I mean I you know it would be easy to change I don't think anybody's going to become addicted to this twelve people in a circle thing so I think it'd be easy to break that in a future into something new and quite frankly it's already changed because it's a very different interface from what they showed in September.
[34:54.000 --> 35:05.000]  Yeah was it a great I forget was it a great I think or when they actually forget but I know it wasn't a circle I totally forget what it was in September but I know it was a circle.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  It's hard to look up on that because Apple sort of thrown the September thing down the memory hall.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  It's fun that it's fun having this watch on and you know getting notifications on my wrist and just the basic stuff but.
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  It's also just fun like sending taps to people and I don't know I I think they've done a good job with it I do too.
[35:24.000 --> 35:38.000]  So you living in Orange County and I saw that when you first got it and you wrote up your experiences with the right way you'd gone to Disneyland and it looked like typical Orange County whether it was sunny.
[35:38.000 --> 35:54.000]  That to me is as it gets nicer and nicer here in Philadelphia as we go into May from April and it's a lot fewer overcast days and I like a lot of more days like today where it's just absolutely positively perfect I find it hard to read the watch in sunlight.
[35:54.000 --> 36:07.000]  Yeah that indirect sunlight it is harder to read although I think that's one of maybe the reasons I like the utility face it's very easy to see I mean the hands are big enough that you're just fine.
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.000]  Like the chronograph I don't know I don't think I could read that even it's I think that's very difficult to read.
[36:13.000 --> 36:21.000]  Yeah because the hands are hollow they're not they're not filled and the extra superfluous stuff.
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  There's just no way I could read that stuff I'm 47 there's just it's not even possible I don't even know what those what they're doing in there I can't.
[36:29.000 --> 36:49.000]  Maybe a magnifying glass or something but yeah it's it's great the I haven't had a whole lot of trouble I can if I take indirect sunlight I can see how the the panels not attached to the glass like I've kind of got used to on the iPhone and the iPad and but you know it's generation one.
[36:49.000 --> 36:59.000]  I don't know about that I remember there was an ATP episode a couple of weeks ago where they were talking about it how whether the panel is attached to the glass or not and I think.
[36:59.000 --> 37:10.000]  And I might get this detail wrong but I think and then in the next episode in their follow up there was one of the Johnny I videos where they said on Johnny I've said on some of the on some of the watches.
[37:10.000 --> 37:32.000]  The display is fused to the sapphire crystal and that's all he said so I think it is I think it is fused to the surface I think it looks pretty close and I think that in certain lighting you can definitely see the display through the sapphire but it's it's rare for me even in sunlight it's rare for me.
[37:32.000 --> 37:45.000]  I wonder if it reminds aluminum and so I don't have the sapphire crystal wonder if well and the ATB guys brought it up what what Johnny I've said and it's just as recording it's ambiguous what that means for the sport models because does he mean.
[37:45.000 --> 37:58.000]  All of them are fused in a but some only some of them have sapphire or does he mean only the ones with sapphire refused I don't know it I looked at my son's sports watch and it didn't look to me like it was any different but.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  I also have to admit that it at age 42 and with the trouble with my left eye.
[38:04.000 --> 38:13.000]  I I can really see the difference like this is the first time ever that I've had seen an apple product where.
[38:13.000 --> 38:25.000]  I really couldn't I think the 38 actually looks good on my wrist I think I could totally get by with it in terms of the size but I actually do struggle to read it in a way that I don't struggle to read the 42.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  I am my my wife's because I had the black one those were.
[38:30.000 --> 38:41.000]  Constrained so my wife's blue phone I'm sorry blue watch with the silver aluminum showed up on date one and she let me wear it for a few days because I wanted to fiddle with it more than she did.
[38:41.000 --> 39:00.000]  And it was 38 and it was fine and look good on me but but I agree once the bigger one showed up I knew exactly that was that was for me I think Adam had the same thing didn't he was saying he did the same thing so like for example on the chronograph is a perfect now I don't really use the chronograph that much although I do sometimes the reason I like it is that you can just switch.
[39:00.000 --> 39:11.000]  To chronograph so I have chronograph to to watch faces over and then your one tap away from starting a timer or a stopwatch like if you wanted to you know.
[39:11.000 --> 39:20.000]  You know like I do like when I put charcoal on the grill and then just boom start a stopwatch and then I know you know once it gets like 25 minutes start checking it to see if it's ready.
[39:20.000 --> 39:39.000]  Yeah Siri timer awesome yeah just told over there but with the 38 millimeter with my son's 38 millimeter I can't read the sub dials on the chronograph and if it makes me feel incredibly old like the little there's a there's a stopwatch or a second hand underneath and.
[39:39.000 --> 39:49.000]  Well it depends how you have it configured but there's two sub dials that are those little sub you know circles are I can't read the numbers on him on his and I can read them online.
[39:49.000 --> 40:08.000]  It was about your age I am I noticed I was holding books out further and further from me as I read them and someone said you know you may have you know you may have a problem there and I we were at Costco I'll never forget and they had you know the sample reading glasses and I put a pair on and looked at some words and I'm just like damn.
[40:08.000 --> 40:20.000]  I'm looking at I fix it on their tear down of aluminum one and it's not clear but it looks like it may be attached it's pretty close to the surface and I think that the effect.
[40:20.000 --> 40:32.000]  The overall effect of the entire black surface which ever model you have looks like it's the display and the actual display just takes up.
[40:32.000 --> 40:44.000]  So some portion within it with these generous what seems to be generous margins around it in fact though like those when you have stuff out to the corner they're really writing it right out to the corner of the display and I.
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.000]  Yeah it's crazy when you take a screenshot and you see like wow that doesn't look right yeah it looks totally right yeah.
[40:50.000 --> 41:04.000]  And it's you know and it was definitely true with some of the initial apps that came out in April that they had way to the margin you know they had like even just two or three pixels of margin it really made their their stuff look cramped.
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  Have you done the fitness stuff much of you played with that much a little bit.
[41:09.000 --> 41:21.000]  I you know I'm getting back into running now that I'm cleared to it with the I stuff so I'm you know I'm using it to run a couple times a week and I track you know sometimes I do it.
[41:21.000 --> 41:33.000]  I don't know I think why I go out while I live in a city and so I walk everywhere and to me going on a walk like walking somewhere like if I walk to pick up my son from school it's like one and a half miles away so it's like three mile walk round trip.
[41:33.000 --> 41:48.000]  That doesn't feel like exercise to me like walking I mean it's I think it's good for you and I think it's one of the nice parts of living in a city but to me that doesn't feel like a workout it feels silly to me to start the workout app and say I'm going on a walk and I'm just walking but I do it just to have it to play with.
[41:48.000 --> 42:03.000]  The thing I realize is it because I I never really thought about heart rate much because I walk a lot to and I think I'm doing great with exercise I'm walking all the place but we're in the watch for the first week I really know I didn't do anything to raise my heart rate the whole week so now.
[42:03.000 --> 42:16.000]  The watch actually has changed my behavior so now I'm like looking for hills to climb or spending a little time every day kind of get my heart rate up and and I'm not sure if it's just the newness of the watch if this will stick or not.
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.000]  But it bothers me now when I get the end day I haven't got my 30 minutes of elevated heart rate.
[42:21.000 --> 42:43.000]  Yeah and I do think too that the fitness stuff even though I'm not a super big fitness enthusiast but I'm wearing it every day and so now I've got you know I'm up to like six weeks now of you know daily stuff it is keeping me from like wearing my old watch like it's like them one of the main it probably the main thing that's keeping me from just wearing my old watch.
[42:43.000 --> 42:53.000]  On you know just for kicks which is something I used you know used to switch between two watches and I anticipated that I wouldn't want to wear my Apple watch every single day and maybe even not.
[42:53.000 --> 43:03.000]  Most days but the fitness stuff kind of motivates me to and I've heard other people say the same thing because you don't want to have you don't want to lose a day and have a day where you know makes it look like you never got out of bed.
[43:03.000 --> 43:10.000]  Yeah where even like when you get out of bed in the morning and let's say I'm going to be working in pajamas for two hours.
[43:10.000 --> 43:21.000]  I'll still put the watch on because I know I'm going to be going up and down the steps and doing something I don't want to lose that credit so it's funny I'm very motivated to get this watch on as soon as I wake up in the morning.
[43:21.000 --> 43:35.000]  I do find though I still find like before we move on from watch stuff but I do find I'm still right from my first review one week after wearing it I still am annoyed when I look at it and the display doesn't turn on.
[43:35.000 --> 43:45.000]  Whatever reason and it just happened to me while I was coming up the stairs my office here at the house is you know second floor and I was coming up here to do the podcast and my arms were full.
[43:45.000 --> 44:03.000]  I had a coffee mug in one hand and I had my thermos filled with the coffee that I've been refilling in the other and so I couldn't tilt my wrist but I got the I got the tap that I had no I had an alert and I look at my wrist to see what it was and it's just black and I was just so annoyed.
[44:03.000 --> 44:11.000]  Even if I was only 10 seconds away from being able to set it down and see what it was but it's like if you're going to give me the tap I want to see the goddamn thing.
[44:11.000 --> 44:20.000]  You know my take on that is that they at some point they said the one story we never want written about the Apple Watch is that the battery dies at 5 p.m.
[44:20.000 --> 44:36.000]  Yep I think they said you know more than anything and like it also bothers me that that it turns off in light was at six seconds because sometimes I actually need more than six seconds to process what's on the screen and I just feel like somewhere they said you know we're going to make it extra sensitive
[44:36.000 --> 44:47.000]  we're not going to make it turn on just anytime you flick your wrist we're not going to leave it on long and we're never going to have a story written that says it turned that the battery died at 5 and I think they you know they kind of went too far.
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  I mean I go to bed things at 45% battery yeah for me it's after an 18 hour day I mean it's crazy.
[44:52.000 --> 45:11.000]  Yeah for me it's the battery's been such a non issue the only time I ever got vaguely close never once ran it all the way down but one time in the first week while I was really you know working pretty much morning tonight on how am I going to write this first review of the watch you know when the embargo drops next week.
[45:11.000 --> 45:23.000]  I mean and really using it in a way that was not reflective of the daily use of it it was really more like I was almost like a quality assistance tester you know like I'm testing the watch I give was my job to play with it all day.
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  I ran it down to the like 10% or something like that but that was that was truly abnormal I do think though that there is it.
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  I haven't seen anybody publish any kind of specs on this but I think the difference between 38 and 42 on battery life is truly significant.
[45:38.000 --> 45:47.000]  Because it seems like yeah my wife and son both have 38 definitely finish the day lower neither one has ever run out.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  But they both significantly lower.
[45:50.000 --> 46:07.000]  I was thinking I'd be buying an extra magnetic charger and like keep it in my car and I had all these like ideas when I first heard about the watch and I don't need any of that stuff for me it's plug it in it you know charge a thing of the day you're fine yeah but if I had a setting and I feel like the other thing they wanted to do I think you're exactly right that they said we don't.
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.000]  Anybody saying that this thing is crapping out before they go to bed.
[46:12.000 --> 46:30.000]  So I feel like the roughly day and a half battery life that they've hit is exactly right because that way you definitely have to charge it every day but you I don't see anybody complaining that the watch is turning black before they go to sleep.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  Yeah but I can you know and there are some hypothetical scenarios I mean I'm an old man and I just stay home all the time.
[46:37.000 --> 46:48.000]  But when I was a younger man there were times where I would you know spur the moment wind up you know sleeping somewhere that wasn't my house.
[46:48.000 --> 46:56.000]  You know just sleeping at a friends you know you handled that really well I don't even mean to imply anything.
[46:56.000 --> 47:04.000]  I don't mean to imply anything any kind of even adult situation maybe other than the consumption of adult beverages.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  When I was a younger man to be more like an overnight halo party.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  You know what you know what that's a that's an example too.
[47:11.000 --> 47:20.000]  No I like in college like we would have all night marathon sessions you know where you had to if you wanted to play a network game you had to be on a land.
[47:20.000 --> 47:31.000]  So that's a perfect example where there's nothing and I'm not implying anything appropriate or that I let any kind of crazy lifestyle but you know in college I sometimes would not sleep in my bedroom.
[47:31.000 --> 47:40.000]  Or I wouldn't come home until six or seven in the morning you know in which case I do wonder whether the why I don't know that the watch as it is today would would make it.
[47:40.000 --> 47:53.000]  But then things like charging straps and weird things are showing up I think that's all completely bananas.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  It's crazy and I don't understand because you have to the only way to charge it is to is underneath and that's going to I don't see how that can possibly work with the with the sensors that they have.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  Because the sensors start going bananas if they're not connected to your skin.
[48:01.000 --> 48:13.000]  It's funny how much time we spend you know as geeks been thinking about battery life and batteries because we the whole world is changed in the last five six years as all mobile now.
[48:13.000 --> 48:22.000]  And and charging life and battery time is so key and and it's the big constraint right now too so everything you think about charging.
[48:22.000 --> 48:31.000]  I'm obsessive about it I have charging docks all over my house and like if I'm just sitting here right now my phones in a charger doesn't need to be it's at a hundred percent.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  It's you know when o'clock in the afternoon but I can't help myself.
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.000]  Have you found that your what or your iPhone gets worse battery life now that you're using it with your watch.
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.000]  I haven't noticed any times convinced that I am I'm convinced that and I think it's because I never used anything Bluetooth before.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  And so yeah I had it on for.
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.000]  What's the feature called hand out doesn't hand off required bluetooth though or does it could I think it uses both.
[49:02.000 --> 49:11.000]  Yeah it may not but I know that like air drop requires bluetooth but but it only ever before I started using Apple watch.
[49:11.000 --> 49:20.000]  I was only ever had the gray bluetooth in the status bar the gray bluetooth means like bluetooth is on but you're not connected to anything.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  It's just just low power mode and it's there for like.
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  Oh okay hey you can hand off this web page or this email that you've started writing on your phone to this other thing and it only really does anything.
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.000]  But now it's black all the time it's the black bluetooth because it's going to the watch and I'm convinced I'm getting worse battery life on the phone.
[49:38.000 --> 49:46.000]  I'm still making it through the day but I'm dropping into the red whereas in the first few months of using an iPhone 6 I never was in the red.
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  Yeah I used bluetooth headphones and stuff all day long so it's I can't tell any difference.
[49:52.000 --> 50:00.000]  I'll tell you one thing about the watch that I didn't expect to like as much as I do as the whole force touch thing.
[50:00.000 --> 50:09.000]  I mean just I'm finding I really like having that additional user interface you know method all these like just clearing your notifications with a force press.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  I hope that that stuff makes its way to the phone.
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.000]  I've said this before and I know it sounds like a joke but my number two I have two tips for anybody who gets Apple watch.
[50:19.000 --> 50:27.000]  Is I know what you're going to do is what you're going to do is you're going to ripple in the box and you're going to put it on and you're going to go through the pairing process and just start using it and exploring and doing it on your own.
[50:27.000 --> 50:37.000]  So go ahead I'm not going to tell you that you know take your vitamins open it up put it on play with it and then a day or two later when you feel like you're confused you feel like you're not getting it all.
[50:37.000 --> 50:53.000]  Here's the two things to do go back to your packaging and reread the getting started pamphlet which is just six panels I'm not saying read the user manual I'm saying just read that getting started panel which is like it's like almost a more like a comic book than a user manual.
[50:53.000 --> 51:03.000]  Because you I get I guarantee you most people will find something that they didn't know or didn't remember like oh that's how you do Apple pay you start by double tapping that button.
[51:03.000 --> 51:10.000]  Like because I'll admit when I I'll admit it's like when I would the first week that I had the Apple watch.
[51:10.000 --> 51:22.000]  I couldn't get Apple pay to work I went to Whole Foods and I held my watch up to the I figured it worked like the phone I knew that I had to double tap that button to confirm it I just figured you start by holding your watch up to the terminal.
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.000]  And then when it pings like okay ready for Apple pay then you double tap to confirm and nothing happened.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  And I thought oh well maybe I didn't set it up right.
[51:31.000 --> 51:40.000]  And then event you know but just read that pamphlet I'm telling you you're going to learn something and there's so many questions I see it on Twitter every day when because people are still getting their watches.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  And they're asking questions that are answered in that that pamphlet.
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.000]  And then my it's like the the one that where he double tap the the crown it goes to the last half.
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  Yep people I've seen people say I wish there was some way to just go back to the last half.
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  And it's like there is a way double click double click the crown it's they've really thought of that.
[52:00.000 --> 52:07.000]  And then my second tip my only two top tips my second tip is try force tapping everywhere.
[52:07.000 --> 52:14.000]  Yeah just any app you use whether it's from Apple whether it's from a third party try force tap and see if there's something there.
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.000]  Yeah you're right and and so often that's like the answer to all problems when you're stuck somewhere.
[52:20.000 --> 52:36.000]  The whole you know there was a lot of talk when the thing first came out about two things the first was everybody's complain about notifications which I never really got because it seemed to me like especially some of these people in a tech press should understand that notifications are entirely within your control.
[52:36.000 --> 52:49.000]  But you know it's not that hard to to just notification that hasn't really been an issue for me but the other one that I thought was kind of unfair is the whole thing about saying well this is a different interface and it's harder to figure out well.
[52:49.000 --> 52:56.000]  It is a different interface it's a smaller screen but I don't think you should expect it any different.
[52:56.000 --> 53:07.000]  I do think maybe it would be better if there wasn't a way if you know there's two buttons there wouldn't be there's one button you could press that would always give you a watch face.
[53:07.000 --> 53:12.000]  But I really think it really wasn't that hard to figure out.
[53:12.000 --> 53:20.000]  I haven't linked to it yet but I almost certainly will.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  Before the show airs we're recording on Thursday it's probably going to air on Friday.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  Steven Orth I'll link to it.
[53:29.000 --> 53:35.000]  I'll definitely have it linked from during fireball I will try to remember to link to it in the show notes here I'm making a note right now.
[53:35.000 --> 53:49.000]  Steven Orth had an interesting like first week with the iPhone blog post and one of his ideas was that he thought that maybe the
[53:49.000 --> 53:59.000]  the side button instead of being underneath the crown should have been opposite the crown and that you could tap it to go back.
[53:59.000 --> 54:09.000]  So that because he found that anytime he was in any app that had like a navigation you know like here's the route and then you tap a thing and then you go in and then there's a little back button up there.
[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  That it's really hard to tap that back button and I had completely six weeks in I still miss back buttons a lot in that upper corner.
[54:17.000 --> 54:26.000]  Or depending on the app I'll try to be hitting that back button and even worse than missing it I'll hit something beneath it.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  Like I've been trying I've been experimenting with wonder list for like shopping and stuff like that.
[54:32.000 --> 54:40.000]  Like create a little shopping list in wonder list and then it's on my wrist and I don't have to go through the supermarket fiddling with a phone I can just keep going to my wrist.
[54:40.000 --> 54:51.000]  But I find that sometimes you know I'll try to hit the top item to either check it off and I'll hit the back button that goes back to my list of lists or I'll try to go back to the back list list and I end up checking the top item.
[54:51.000 --> 55:06.000]  So his idea is put a hardware button to go back which I don't think is a good idea and I think if you put it opposite the digital crown it would actually create the same sort of problem people have with the power button and the volume up button on the iPhone 6.
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  There are people because they're opposite each other and when people put their fingers on both of them and then they try to squeeze one and they end up squeezing the other.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  How many times you've got to take a picture and turn your camera your phone off.
[55:17.000 --> 55:26.000]  That New Jersey guy Mike Hurley and Jason selling the upgrade podcast a few weeks ago did kind of a thing about this.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  And Mike made the point that you know the home screen on the watch is the watch.
[55:31.000 --> 55:39.000]  It's you know and I thought he made a really great point that it should be all there should be one button that just gets you to the watch face at any time.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  And the problem with the digital crown is that it's inconsistent sometimes it does that sometimes it goes somewhere else.
[55:45.000 --> 56:00.000]  And I you know what the guys at Apple I'm sure they spent a lot of time figuring this out but but I do appreciate the idea of just every user knows they press one button and the watch face comes up and from there hopefully you figured out gestures enough to be able to get to wherever you need to go.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  Yeah it's a great I really do think that that's true and I think calling the list of apps the home screen I don't even know if Apple is calling it the home screen.
[56:07.000 --> 56:19.000]  I don't know if they even call it that but it's not you know and it's it only serves to confuse you to make you think that it's that that watch works like a little iPhone.
[56:19.000 --> 56:32.000]  And I do think that that is a great point because I think part of the beauty of iOS is that the way the home button works no matter where you are you can hit that home button and it's going to take you to the home screen.
[56:32.000 --> 56:47.000]  But then looking at my wife and daughter who neither one of them are geeks or want to be Mac power users or anything like that, they use the watch is just fine you know I mean they they're not having any trouble using it so maybe they did it right I don't know.
[56:47.000 --> 56:57.000]  Right but the way I got iOS like you just single tap that home button and it takes you to your home screen and it doesn't matter if you're in an app you hit the home button takes you to the home screen.
[56:57.000 --> 57:06.000]  If you're already on the home screen and you've brought up a control center or you've brought down notification center you can hit the home screen and it goes away.
[57:06.000 --> 57:14.000]  Now you don't have to because you could just tap to get it to go away but if you don't know to do that because there's no button that says make it go away just hit that home button and it takes you there.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  So I can kind of see the logic of if there was just a button that always took you to your watch face.
[57:20.000 --> 57:28.000]  Now I think users would appreciate that.
[57:28.000 --> 57:38.000]  It's just fun when Apple makes something new like a 1.0 product I agree and just to see what they've done with it and I know I'm a geek and all that stuff but it's just cool to be part of it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:48.000]  I think the one that excited me the most when it came out was the iPad because it just I don't know I just felt like it was such a great idea and it was just so awesome when it showed up.
[57:48.000 --> 57:57.000]  But both both the iPad and the iPhone when it came out I spent weeks just like going over every detail and just playing with them.
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  And the thing about the the watches I didn't spend that much time fiddling with it.
[58:02.000 --> 58:11.000]  I kind of got it set up the way I wanted I got my watch face picked out and I put it on and I went on with my day but I'm just using it just as intended all the time.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  I think it's a good thing but it is different.
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  Yeah definitely hold that thought though let's take a break and talk about our second sponsor.
[58:21.000 --> 58:28.000]  It's another it's not the first time this is actually a return sponsor but it's been a while but definitely not a tech sponsor.
[58:28.000 --> 58:36.000]  I want to tell you about the best Caesar now this is not your ordinary Caesar salad recipe.
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  This is something different this one's got bite it's bold it's edgy it's sharp.
[58:41.000 --> 58:46.000]  It's the perfect combination of ingredients and it's this powerful salad dressing will leave you one anymore.
[58:46.000 --> 58:54.000]  Yes the sponsor is a Caesar salad recipe and they're back and they did great with their last sponsorship which is why they're back.
[58:54.000 --> 59:03.000]  I love this I personally I do I love Caesar salad Caesar salad is like one of my go to's in any restaurant if there's a Caesar salad on the appetizer list.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  I often times I just stop even looking to see what else they have.
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.000]  So it's an app you go there it's an app it's free app you can learn a recipe enjoy it for a lifetime.
[59:13.000 --> 59:20.000]  It's been downloaded in over a hundred countries and has been featured on many fine blogs and podcasts and it was selected.
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.000]  As one of the best new apps on the app store by Apple is one of their featured apps.
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.000]  It will also be part of this year's upcoming documentary app the human story.
[59:31.000 --> 59:41.000]  Now that's that Kickstarter project that started last year great part I've I'm actually been interviewed for that documentary too.
[59:41.000 --> 59:48.000]  Great great thing it's I think getting a lot closer to completion so anyway the best Caesar was one of the apps featured in the documentary.
[59:48.000 --> 59:55.000]  It's available exclusively for iPhone and iPad join tens of thousands of people from around the globe.
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  I've been using this app to learn to make the best Caesar salad the talk show listeners here's the deal for you.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  The best Caesar is available for free on the app store I have to do is download it and you will be filled with this with a burning desire to create your own best Caesar salad.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Make it share it with your friends to power it eat it take photos of every step of the process.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  And you can visit the best Caesar's Instagram Facebook or Twitter and share your pictures perhaps you can even pair your meal with a fine wine from our other sponsor last bottle wine right get a bottle wine it'll go well with the Caesar salad sign them for both.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  So satisfy your craving get this app learn the recipe here's where you go www dot the best Caesar dot com slash the talk show so it's the same slug as the other sponsor the slash the talk show Caesar is s a.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I said a really good idea for the talk show like a running bit it could be like a Seinfeld episode and at the end of every show you could like tell a story that involves all your sponsors could be and just close it out could be tough.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  But the thing you need that based on the end.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  The hello pillows but we don't as there are final two sponsors but then we could we could tell a little story about eating a salad drinking a whole bottle wine.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  That I've been thinking about I have turned on if you go to settings text and something it's like two things that don't really seem like they belong in the same things panel brightness and text text size I've turned on the option for bold text if you've tried this.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  No I have so I think a lot of people probably haven't might have because when you toggle it either way.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  It pops up a dialogue that says hey changing the setting requires restarting your watch and so when I first week that I had it I saw that I was like I'll do that later because I don't feel like restarting the watch right now it takes like two or three minutes for the watch to reboot.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  I really like the way it looks and I don't even think that it's an accessibility issue although it could be for some but it's not under general accessibility it's under text settings it's like a legitimate option.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  I really like the way it looks now the truth is I'm you know as we spoke about before I'm 42 so my perfectly healthy right I is already sort of on the beginning cusp of requiring reading glasses and my left eye is a mess so.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  You know part of it is a maybe age related maybe but I kind of like it even like when I don't even have my contacts in and my eyes really can't I can still see super good up close.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  I really like the way the bold text looks I really think it looks sort of sort of like the way that in the classic Mac OS that like Chicago was sort of a bold boldish font.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  I just activated while you were talking and I can see that I know you're very particular about typography so I never thought you'd be the guy who tested that I think you would want the built in but I really love it and especially here's where I especially love the bold text is on watch faces.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Not even I feel like it looks a little bit weird when you get like a text and you see the text you know I kind of what I would really like to talk about power user features like if if there was an equivalent of like the way you can do like defaults right.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  On Mac OS 10 to get preferences that aren't even available visually what I would love to do is turn it off everywhere except watch faces and only have it on watch faces it just what it means is that all the complications have bolder slightly bolder text it's not like bold.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  It's like switching from a light ish version of San Francisco to a like a medium bold semi bold version of San Francisco and I feel like it's a really good look and in a way that to me looks a lot like a lot of real mechanical watches have fonts on the dial that are of this rough weight.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  You know yeah and it really and to me it also to go back to the viewing sunlight it makes the complication text easier for me to read in sunlight do you think they're going to allow developers to submit their own watch faces at any point no.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  I really don't because I think that or I think most likely no and I think if they do it'll it'll be a system that runs like the wake Apple TV runs today where they will be partnerships that are cultivated.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  There is no there will you know there's an app store already for apps that has thousands of apps from anybody and everybody. I think if they ever do third party watch faces it would be like Apple TV and it would be a cultivated list that's hand selected and approved by Apple at a very high level.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Yeah it's like on the pebble they had you know it was just it was a crazy main people had these nutty faces but then occasionally someone would do like a really classy Futura based watch face that looked really really actually better than anything that they had in their own.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  David you realize you're speaking about pebble in the past tense. Well that's true in my life it is a past tense at this point. You didn't even realize it. No I didn't. I have a pre-order and for the pebble time. I keep wanting to call it pebble color which is what I feel like they should have called it but it's called pebble time.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  But the thing that I can tell it's going to be it's I can tell is going to be a non starter and I feel bad for them for me at least maybe some people you know some people might really still prefer it.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  But for me the thing that kills it is the fact that this the display is so clearly different from the bezel around the display.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Yes it doesn't matter what to me whether it's color not to me it just looks so an elegant looks like you have a little screen strapped to your wrist.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  You know having used one for a year just the fact that you know then it just didn't stay paired consistently with an iPhone and maybe if you've got an Android device you're better off but with an iPhone I just found it very inconsistent and and that was just you know frustrating so and I don't have the problem at all with the Apple device of course.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  One of the weird things about this.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Is that you don't really have a lot of choice it really it all starts with what phone you use and pebbles trying to straddle these two worlds and I wish them the best of luck I that's why I pre ordered the time I hope that they make it and I hope that they know I feel like.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Like we need more companies like pebble to succeed but I just feel like it's so hard because they're fighting these massive massive companies like Apple and Google who have these resources that are just so hard for them to match.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Well they can't match the resources but the fact that they can't make it harder for them to compete.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  But like the Android where versus Apple watch there's it's not even a debate like whatever you know like if you're if you use an iPhone you know I Android where it doesn't work with it and I know there's rumors that they're going to make it work with it.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  You know like in the next month or two at Google IO but it's not going to be the level of integration that Apple watch has because they're only going to be able to do the things that like pebble can do with iOS which is all limited by the app store restrictions for what an app can do you know.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  And you're going to have this fiddly setup process for blue to three after four digit code.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  It's just going to be limited and if you have an Android phone you don't even have a choice to use an app watch.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  I grew up in the era where you know you'd be trying to use a palm pilot with a Mac or a Tandy.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  You remember those Tandy word processor.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  You know all these technology that wasn't Apple based trying to get to work with Apple and it was such a pain that I just have like zero tolerance for even trying that stuff at this point.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  I mean if Apple makes both pieces I'm just going to use them.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Yeah the thing that really I had a hand spring visor. My wife had one too which and she probably used it more than I did which is pretty interesting because it you know that.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  This is back around ninety nine two thousand.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  And I remember it was when I was working at barebone software on my pal Jim Korea who's now at the Omni group like he did like the best thing ever he bought like twenty five like replacement styluses for the hand spring visor.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  So it was like a jar candy on his desk like you know just go you know all right Jim yeah give me five more.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Got one and every right but then you never had to worry about because like losing your goddamn stylus was it.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And I'm pretty careful with my devices but it was like it was a common problem.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  But anyway I was sinking your stuff to your Mac was the biggest and I think it was what kept me from you know eventually made me abandon it.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  And part of a problem too was that the max of that era didn't really have standard system databases for things like that.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  There was no built in contacts you know in the classic Mac OS there was no standard contacts so it's like you could sync with something but it was like a limited number of third party options and there was no standard system wide calendar.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  I tell people can everybody somebody gets into the discussion with me about app pricing I talked to them about how my palm pilot about every month or two it would just duplicate all of my contacts.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  If I didn't fix it in another month I would have four copies of every contact and so on.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  And somebody made an app and it was $50 and all it did was go out and knock out duplications and I was so happy to pay it you know.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And now it's like oh this app will change your life and it'll be you know it'll allow you to get your work done and go home earlier.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  How much is it five bucks five bucks what are you talking about?
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Oh it's so true.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I think it's crazy.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  It's like an inverse curve to like a price of a cup of coffee.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  The more coffee gets the more the less willing people are willing to pay for apps I don't know.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal had a her column a couple of weeks ago was about how to fix up your your contact database.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  You know that if you like her over the years have wound up like she had like four entries for her dad like one was just a email one was just a phone number.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  One you know like if if you have a relative like you have an uncle Bob but he's also listed as Robert you know and it's two entries and you know that there's a bunch of these utilities that you can you can buy to fix it all.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  And it's I saw like in the comments people were like four dollars.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  But it's like it would save you like it's like her whole thing was like you know if you have five hundred contacts and you did it by hand if like these apps can help you like they could you could easily save an hour.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  Right and so and how who doesn't whose time is not worth four dollars for an hour or whatever the president.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Imagine you're on your deathbed and you can say you can live another hour at class your four dollars.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  What are you going to say you know I mean.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  All right so speaking speaking about really billing let's talk about you in your career.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So you're you're an attorney and you had been what was what was your practice.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Business I'm a business attorney I represent small companies have been doing it for 21 years but I was in a law firm the whole time until about two months ago and I.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  I got out of there man I hit the brakes.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  So all of this other stuff that you've been doing all the podcasting the blogging all the writing and all this stuff has all been on side of you being a full time partner in a law firm.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Not that it was never partner.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Well I am that the way it was set up just wasn't set up that way but you know I was I was always a full time lawyer throughout the whole process.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And now you are you've never talked but you quit that quit that job yeah now you're doing this stuff full time but you also have your own new law practice.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Yeah it's weird you know it's like maybe looking back I mean I guess I'll know in a few years you know it's a very public thing you know when you quit a job that pays well and you've got insurance and all that stuff and you're like okay and I'm going to do that I'm going to write about it.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  You know the Mac and and do some lost stuff too but I wanted to have more control and you know just you know as you get older you just that control thing is more important to you.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I don't know maybe at some point I wanted to be like a big time lawyer and a big time firm but that's just not me I like representing small guys my clients are you know I have represent a lot of software developers and I do contracts for them and stuff like that you know so.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  This was something I could have done on my own but I just didn't want the overhead I didn't want any more meetings I just didn't want all the stuff that comes with being as part of a big operation.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And I've also been doing the Mac Sparky stuff so I wanted to be able to have more time for that so I figured out if I worked a little bit less as a lawyer and a little bit more as Mac Sparky I'd have a better balance in my life so I.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I just tell my wife I said I got to make this work because there's no way I could ever go work for somebody ever again I've got to make this.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But it's so far it's great and I love it and the community has been really good to me to.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Jason cocky and I had dinner a month or so ago.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Actually it was when I got the review for the Apple Watch I went to New York the night before just so I wanted to take the train in the morning and Jason cocky and I had dinner and we were talking about how.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Having been successful at this and having done it for ourselves full time for some number of years now has more or less rendered us completely unimportant.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  I'm already feeling it further like I'm.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  I'm certainly well known and I think.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  I think that if I needed to get a job I get certainly fine when I you know and then I think I would be I would be let go with.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Well one of the things that surprised me about this whole thing was I got a lot of new clients from Mac Sparky and people had been listening to me in their ear you know power of podcasting and writing for all these years now like hey I could actually use you to help me with some stuff and.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  And that was a surprise to me I had no expectation of any legal business from all this stuff and so that was kind of nice but but it's also given me more time so you know.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  I'm working from home I have an office but I work from home more than I go to the office and I love it I'm you did a I think a tweet like years ago just you know going back we said here's my new work shoes and you had a pair of slippers.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  I don't know if you probably don't know I do ever ever since then that has stuck in my brain and it's kind of pissed me off I'm like Gruber can have those slippers as work shoes I need to find a way to make that work and hey I'm there man it feels good.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  That's the like I'm going to go buy a pair of slippers I'm called the John group my my year of work shoes is right now I'm in the socks period just wearing pair of socks.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  But then it'll go to it'll be flip flops sooner.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  And you know probably like after WWC it'll be more flip floppy then I'll go back to socks and then it'll go to slippers.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  Yeah well you've got you've got the seasons there out here it's just bare feet pretty much now it's I'm upset though at the slippers I think the tweet is a couple years old and that it was the best pair of slippers I ever had.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  And I wore a hole through them and and I couldn't they I forget where the ally bottom but I went back and they didn't have them anymore.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  And I really wished that I had done what I always think I'm going to do which is when I find something like that that I really like just pull a Steve Jobs and buy like 20 of them and put them in a closet and then you know I never have to worry about slippers again for the rest of my life.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  It's like feet aren't got a chance size. Yeah exactly why not. Although there's a thing of Steve Jobs probably had a lot more space to store things like that.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Yeah my my wife always says that she's like don't buy more but you know I feel like I could I take them out of the boxes you know I mean I feel like if I if I could take them out of the boxes and you know this slippers you could you could put that you could put them all in one box.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  I'm definitely one of those habit people like when I had when I was going into the office every day and I didn't have court.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  I had like eight pairs of lands in gray slacks and like 12 blue shirts and every day I wore the same thing and everything office thought I was such a weirdo.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  But it just made so much sense to me to get out of bed and shower and put that on that was the uniform.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  I think that the slippers I love the most were lands in actually and then they stopped making them. And in fact I go through slippers my job is so hard David.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  I go through slippers so fast. I've in fact I've noticed that the slippers that I've been wearing the last year or two now that they're sort of put away for the warm weather.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  I noticed that they're sort of worn through.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  Well you've made you made the joke about was your grandfather was a coal miner. My maternal grandfather was was a coal miner.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  Mine as well. I mean he also died of black luck. I mean it's just I mean you stop and think about it or my you know my other grandfather during the depression they didn't have any money.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  They would go out into the backwards of Massachusetts and trap trap red fox and that's how they that's how they ate and that's how they got by.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  And I'm sitting here going oh the font on this watch.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  I mean if he was here he would just slap me.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  I know.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I think on the one hand my grandfather would have been.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  No I think first he would have been very very proud because I think it was exactly the you know he personified that American dream of I want my kids to have better life than me.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  You know my mom was a registered nurse went to nursing school.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  And her brother was he didn't go to he went to like a trade school and was into like electronics like he sort of was you know that the gadget or still does he's you know he had like he was like the first guy I knew in my life who had a video game system
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  up to his TV at the pong you know pre a target twenty six hundred back in the I don't know seventy seven something like that.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  You know but they both of them ended up with white collar jobs well registered nurses probably hard to call white white white color I mean that's physical but it's you know it requires a you know an education.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  And it certainly certainly better than coal mining and I think he would have been delighted that his grandson you know had a job that is you know like mine but I you know I don't know that he would have had much tolerance for my complaints about the.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  My I come from very blue color it's my dad was actually really concerned when I said I'm going to go to law school he's like that's going to ruin you he says you know there's just no way you'll be able to be a decent person and a lawyer.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  That that concern it's always in the back of my head and and you know at points in my legal career where I could have jumped right or left it always you know I was jumped right because of that statement you know it's interesting how your parents affect.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  I had a I took an Instagram here let me put it in here I took an Instagram the other week and it I let it slide this is like my thing and it's it I get when I get criticism online I just have a thick skin and let stuff slide.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  But that's the picture I took and it's there's a hotel the couple blocks away here in Philly it's a real CD motel if you look at the Yelp reviews for it it's called the Parker spruce it's like the type of it literally is the type of hotel we can go in and rent you know you can get it by the hour.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And it is closing I didn't know this until I after I took this picture but it was a picture of these guys taking mattresses out of the hotel and they're the mattresses from like a CD hotel that.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  Rent by the hour or you know really pretty bad looking mattress yeah I thought it was fascinating but I the caption I wrote is no one grows up thinking they'll be one of the guys who disposes of old mattresses from a CD hotel.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  And a lot of people in the comments are like wow what a dickey comment you know like as though I was making fun of these guys and I guess you could read it that way but that.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Well honestly to me it was just like a slice of life and I have nothing but total respect for these guys like those guys at when I thought as I walked past them is is I had the thought like when I think about my grandfather I was like no those guys are working for a living that's that's a fucking job taking those.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  You know those mattresses out of a hotel and it's it's May it's not hot but that hotel is not air conditioned you know what I mean and moving one mattress is hard work and these guys are moving you know I don't know what what it looks like there's like at least a dozen of them there.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  That's all I meant by I thought it was so weird that people jumped on me as though I was mocking these people I just thought like hey you know my my thought was the people who are going to read this maybe this will help you appreciate you know whatever is you dad is probably a lot less arduous than move mattresses.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  It's so easy to get in trouble on the internet especially with an audience yours so I don't know I just I just let it slide but anybody who saw that and who thought I was making fun of them I really didn't mean it that way at all I meant the way I kind of it's like talking earlier I mean you would go back to work for a software developer if that's what it took.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Or you know whatever we I would dig ditches if that's what it whatever it takes you know I mean and you know I just think we're lucky that we're able to get by without having to do that stuff at this point.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Exactly because I'd be really lousy to keep just speaking of digging ditches.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  I'll take a break here and thank our next sponsor hover.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  You guys know hover it's the best place on the internet to register domain name you need a domain name new domain name go to hover.com and start searching they've got great tools to help you search.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  They've got great a great list of all these new top level domains which have really opened a lot of one and two word you know this that dot whatever you know there's that finance dot coffee dot local.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I guess that local is bonjour but anyway there's a ton of these new top level domains I can't even hope to list them all.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Hover can help you get a new domain on any of them they can help you find a way to get a domain on dot com dot net all the classic TLDs I don't even know what you'd call those.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  But even better than every every domain register helps you register domain names but hover does the right way.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  We talk about CD I talk about that CD hotel the top the domain register business is in large part kind of CD it's like the online equivalent of CD where you go there and.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Honestly I'm not going to name names but yeah I can think of one that's a big one you go there and the site is filled with junkie ads when you trying to sign up there's all sorts of up cells check boxes for things that that are checked by default that ought to be off by default or really shouldn't even be an option at all.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Then you find out that if you want DNS privacy so that you're personal you know you're addressing your phone number and etc are enlisted out wide open for the Internet for anybody who looks at your DNS records you have to pay extra for that.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Hover has none of that there's no upsells there's no junkie ads for other third party stuff on their stuff all they want to do is help you manage your domain names the right way things like domain privacy all that stuff it's all included.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Then they have amazing customer support truly amazing customer support.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  They call it valet service so you sign up to be a hover customer and you've got domain names at other registrars.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  And you're already happy you've already you've seen enough that you know yes I want to move all my domain names to hover but I've been registering domain name since 1995.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  It's that in the other service all over the when just give your stuff help that you know give your your support rep at hover the access to your these other registrars where you have domains.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  And hovers valet service will just move those domains they'll do whatever it takes fill out the forms send the faxes.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Whatever has to be done they'll move them all into your hover account and then all of a sudden boom all of your domains are all there under hover with the best interface and the best service.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  You don't have to pay for that that the valet service is just part of being a hover customer and it just cleans up a hassle that is could be nagging it you for the last 20 years about hey I should consolidate all my domain name so one place really really great.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  I I have domain names over I know people everybody I know has some at hover nobody ever like says you know what maybe I'll go somewhere else after hover once you go to hover you're like why would I ever go anywhere else.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  So great.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Here's a code that will save you 10% on a domain name at hover missing links and that is in reference to the fact that the link bracelets on the Apple watch haven't shipped yet.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  Or I've only started to ship so use that code missing links and you will save money and they'll know that you came from the talk show so my thanks to hover go to hover calm hovr and use that code missing links and they'll know you came from here.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  So what else we got to talk about.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  Yes, I did want to talk to about that.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  I got you know pulled in on the new Mac book the super light 12 inch.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  All right.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  All right.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  You did tell me you got that you did not tell me which color I'm going to I'm going to use my psychic powers.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  I'm going to predict that you purchased space gray.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  But I mean it's something different but it's not gold.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  You know the fact that you can order when I remember when you have to pay extra for the black one.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Definitely.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  It was the plastic here.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  But yeah.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  So it's true.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  And it's true for the watch.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  Right.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Talking about the missing links like the space black link bracelet watch costs more than the stainless steel one.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  More than just a color though it's not just and it's eyes to that diamond like what not diamond like carbon.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  What the hell is it called diamond like carbon.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I mean the DLC code is a real thing and it actually does add value.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  You know it probably it arguably does add like a hundred dollars in value to it.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  But anyway you do have to pay more for black.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  I I've you know because of the switch in my life I used to you know go to work for the man every day and I had a 15 inch retina MacBook pro.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  It's the first the very first retina MacBook pro and it's a great computer and it's it's a it's a beast.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  You know in the nice big screen when you're sitting at your desk eight hours a day is fine.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  But now that I've switched up I don't need I have a retina I Mac at home and I'm working on that a lot.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  And I'm not using the laptop as much but I still need one.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  So I thought you know what I'm kind of as a second computer this may work for me and I was a little worried about the keyboard.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  So I decided to to buy one and just you know they've got a 14 day return policy and if it's just terrible I'll take it back.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  But I I stuck with it now I'm going to sell the retina MacBook pro and and I really like it.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  I mean it's it's cool having something so light and slim.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  You know we the big joke in my life now is Disneyland because my wife is a complete Disney land.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  I used to be a jungle crew skipper around a favorite.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  No but the I can totally see that you were probably excellent.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  I want people waited for my boat.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  They would say I want his boat.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  I believe that.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  I'll tell you some day I'm going to be a WWDC sit down and I will tell you some great jungle crew stories.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  But I think I don't think Steve Martin actually was on this.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  Yeah.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  But yeah there's actually some interesting people that are former skippers.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  It was so much fun.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  It was like the greatest job.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  And I had it through high school even when I was in law school.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  I would go down there and work nights because I just needed money.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  And like the boats would get stuck because in Disneyland it's an old ride system and the boats would derail.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  And you'd be stuck out there like 30 minutes and you know you can't do anything.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  You got to wait for the guy to come to yank the boat back on the rail.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  And I'd be like telling people how to break their leases and stuff.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  But anyway so now that I'm like I have more control of my schedule.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  My wife wants good Disneyland all the time.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  So I'll drive her up there.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  And then I'll go over to a quiet restaurant with this new laptop and sit there and write contracts for two or three hours.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  And I really like it.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  But anyway the side is it's a nice computer.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  The keyboard I don't think is as good as the standard keyboard.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  But it's good enough.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  Well and it's I feel like the using typing on the glass for low these many years has lowered our standards for what's an acceptable keyboard.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Like it's you know in my opinion.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  And again I've talked to people that Apple about this and they have said you know that for.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  You know like with the iPad like this is around the era when Microsoft Surface first came out and really kind of hung its hat on the fact that the cover had a physical keyboard.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  And there was a lot of speculation that Apple might come out with something like that.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Who knows maybe they still will someday maybe they will with this iPad pro that's rumored to be you know upcoming.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  But the thing I heard from a couple people at Apple is you cannot you cannot overstate just how good like some kids are today typing on an iPad.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Like kids who just don't have ingrained habits for physical keyboards are so blazingly fast typing on an iPad.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  You just can't believe it it's you know and that the long you know skating to where the puck is going is not worrying about you know those of us with habits on old clicky keyboards.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  My 18 year old can type on an iPhone as fast as I can or probably very close to as fast as I can type on a keyboard as a touch typist.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  And not only that she can type on an iPhone while not looking.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  Yeah I've seen it keep it I believe it I totally believe it and it's you know again it just plays it you know it's a little different than the iPad argument but not really is it plays into that argument of you know back in 2007 2008 even 2009.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  As people who were used to blackberries and stuff were thinking about switching and like well you know when when they come out with one of the hardware keyboard you know so someone like me who needs the type can type you know there's this assumption that anybody who is getting by on a no physical keyboard iPhone.
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  Doesn't really type on it whereas the truth is there are people who type lots of stuff on them.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  They don't type the traditional method but they still and it's not just people too you know oh Malek types a lot of his blog posts on his phone on his iPhone.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  He does he you know I've seen him do it he he you know and he's I can't say that he's as fast as probably as like a teenager but you know he's going as fast as he wants to to be a writer.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Well with this computer the the retina screen to me was the big win because I really need a retina screen I cannot use a computer without a retina I've always wanted a a slim.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  Notebook in fact somebody once loaned me an 11 inch and I tried it for a while and just the screen I couldn't look at it just bugged me every time I looked at it and this is great but the really crazy thing about this computer is.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  I have this some external iPhone charger you know it's one I got off Amazon I think it's you know it's a medium size charger and I got thinking I wonder what would happen because the power is going through the USB.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  What would happen if I plug the battery into the laptop would the laptop recharge the battery or with the battery recharge the laptop you know so I bought off Amazon a USB C. Mail to USB the old USB standard whenever it is a or be.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  It's a cable and I just plugged in the battery to the laptop and it charged the laptop which is awesome sort of like some of those movie brick type things yeah it's a.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Yeah I have to pull it out but I mean it's I think I paid like 30 bucks for it it's like I'm not even trying to say what the electronic rating is all look it up and admit until you but the.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  It charges up and it's got I think two USB ports on a female USB ports and you plug in the plug into your phone but the thing charges up the laptop and it if the laptop's running it basically treads water.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  You know it doesn't lose power and the battery goes out slowly of this thing but I'm able to add like five hours of battery life to it so now I've got.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  You know exactly and then I did an experiment where I turned it I ran it down I think 10% and then just plugged the fully chart battery into it and went to bed and it's very slow I mean it's not like charging really fast.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  When I woke up it was at like 75% it was like you know so it was able to you know put a lot of charge back into the laptop so so now I really feel like you can go anywhere because I've got this little battery in a USB cord and this little light laptop and I can go anywhere in the world and just work for a long time.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  I feel like as time goes on Apple and Apple's prowess at designing and working with metals and miniaturizing components grows more and more you have to see their stuff in person to get.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  And I think the watches are perfect example of it I mean they've you know tons of commercials they they have a website that they've had up since September with hundreds of super high quality photos of the watches every watch every band from every conceivable.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  And I can't tell you how many times I've gotten email from readers and listeners who said you know I was kind of going to wait for 2.0 and then I saw the watch and I was like oh my god I got to get one.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  Macbook airs or all of the whole Macbook line and the new Macbook you have to see them when you see it in person it I thought you know I'm.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  I like the idea of a minimal MacBook I was sort of like maybe I should have I just bought a new 13 inch MacBook Pro last year so I mean I'm not really in the market to replace it now.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  But it did make me think maybe I should have waited a little longer because that does seem like something you know if I have the right in the 5k Mac I Mac at my desk and I'm only using the Macbook away from it.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  That seems like great and then I saw it in the store and it was just like it was just like an emotional thing it's like seeing the sports car you know it's like it's so much smaller and I use the 11 inch air for years just because I like the idea of the smallest possible notebook that you can with a full time with a full size keyboard.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  You just can't I the thing that blew me away was how much it looked more like an iPad with the keyboard than a MacBook like it just in terms of portability and size.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  And you get the Mac operating system right you know still is you know gives you a lot of automation stuff that you just really can't do realistically with an iPad.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  It's great I love it and I'm very happy with it except I would not sell the keyboard I you know the keyboard is different and it's.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  I'm used to it now it's like there's a there's like a happy medium because if you press too hard on it you're just draining yourself because there's just not that much travel so you're like over pressing.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  But then you start pressing lighter because you don't want to over pressing you actually miss keys you don't you don't get the full you know throw the key and there's like a sweet spot in the middle I think I've got it now but it took me a few days to kind of get used to it.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  The thing is I've never liked any laptop keyboard and I've always appreciated that Apple does their best and really does like I remember a couple years it was obviously a couple years ago because it was Steve Jobs but at one point they were he was introducing one of the new some new MacBook.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  And said something about their keyboard engineers and he said yes by the way we really do have some engineers who do all they do his work on keyboards.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Appreciate that like and it shows and it's totally not surprising to me that there are some smart guys and women in Apple who've just dedicated they're just dedicated to making kick ass keyboards or making the.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  And just the ability to take it anywhere with you and when it's this light you really can take it in.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  And just the ability to take it anywhere with you and when it's this light you really can take it anywhere with you and that is something special that that charger by the way look it up it's an anchor I got it off Amazon it's a.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  100 milliamp hour charger and it's I can't just can't get over that. Yeah but just the fact that an iPhone charger can charge my laptop and and like add hours to it is crazy you know but that's where we are now.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  I do think it gets it you know everybody digs on it there was an article that said the processor matches like the the 2011 MacBook Air which may be accurate at least the I got the upgraded one I didn't get the entry I got the second tier.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  But I don't think those articles are really fair to it in terms of like memory access and the SSD speed because it works fine I'm not using it to do final cut or I books author.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  I don't know again I just and I feel like as much as you if you're torn before you see it it's like I feel like once you see them in person any kind of debate in your head to settle and it's like you can tell yourself in the abstract that.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Maybe you know I'll just wait a couple years before I get a retina screen on my MacBook I'll just get the the MacBook Air because I want more I want a couple of USB ports or I want whatever.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Or I want the extra performance you know the way that the 13 inch MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is still faster than this new MacBook.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  So see it in person I'm telling it's like you just get this emotional and to me the MacBook Air's look suddenly looks so dated at any Apple store like the non retina screen.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  And it's funny because I've been depressed about the fact like division problems that I have and I've been thinking like all my life I've been waiting for like retina and I've always known it was coming that we'd get these displays that have like print quality resolution and it's like that's when I turned you know hit the 40s and my vision starts to go and then I have this thing with my left
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  side so good it's like you know what though it's like it actually is the opposite it's like the retina screens actually help you know like the fact that my vision isn't so good it's not that I can't appreciate it the way I would if everything had gone retina like in my 30s or let alone my 20s God I would have been amazing when my eyes were fantastic and I could see everything super super tiny.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  But even with problems it looks better it's like I can totally tell every you know looking at a non retina screen it's it just looks it's gross in my opinion.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  And I've got this theory that you know the MacBook Air is going to go.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  I think I think the formula is very simple and I think a lot of people have over thought this I think it's simply the fact that the entry level price.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Once it goes down it really can't go back up.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  And the entry level price for a Mac laptop has dropped to 899 and that was a couple of years ago when they first added the 899 11 inch MacBook Air right. Yeah it's been a while. But there's a reason why they haven't dropped it further and you know part of the reason is that Apple just doesn't you know compete low in.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  But I think it's so that when they make a transition like this they don't have as far to go to catch up and I feel like the MacBook Air is go away as soon as they can sell the current entry level MacBook one or whatever we want to call it.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  So I feel like you know you're from now they'll come out with new MacBook ones with new specs at the price that it's at right now and they can sell the one they already are making right now for 899 and then at that point the MacBook Air goes away.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  But they can't do it. Yeah they couldn't do it now because they couldn't just say all right you know you used to be able to buy a MacBook Air for 899 but now it starts at 1199.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Yeah they named it tells you that's exactly I in fact it's almost like the biggest telegraph strategically you know of their future strategy that I can ever think of from a name or in fact though the entry price is 1299 so it's even higher so it's got a ways to go.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  I could even see them doing it maybe maybe if they could get it to 999 I could see them sort of and maybe what they would do at that point is is drop the 13 inch MacBook Air and only keep the 11 inch around.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  At 899 like maybe phase out the 13 inch first and only key and only keep one model of the 11 inch around which is the 899 one if they could you know once they can drop this one to 999 but that's the only thing holding them back.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  They have no sympathy for the people who need two USB ports or whatever. No and usually they they're pretty eager to get rid of old stuff but then I look at they're still selling a MacBook Pros with spinning discs in them so I'm going to surprise those are still on a mark.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Yeah it's funny what they're willing to keep around at the entry level.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  I'm not sure what the market at this point is for the the spinning disk MacBook MacBook Pro.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  Of all the devices in the Mac line that so there's only the 13 inch right or do they have a 15 inch to yeah there is no 15 inch for the spinning display or spinning disk.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  Somebody told me there's education but my guess would be education if they're going to buy a Mac would be at the 11 or the 13 inch MacBook Air entry level.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  Yeah I just don't see what the appeal is of that 13 inch entry level MacBook Pro across 1099.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  I just don't see what the what the appeal is of carrying all that extra weight around for something I guess it has better graphics than the MacBook Air I don't know.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  Some people I'd say probably mainly non geek people are very concerned about the loss of that optical drive.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  They're like I want to watch my DVD's on the airplane or whatever and they'll buy whatever Mac lets them do that.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  I guess that's it I don't know that seems crazy to me though it's just in a seems or it seems at least it seems on on Apple like to me to for them to be worried about that.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  Yeah because I don't know spinning discs it's just seems you know the only reason that you have a spinning disc is to you know rip rip your stuff to digital format.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  Yeah I SSD transition and I'm old enough to have remembered the floppy the hard drive transition years ago.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  Right where with him and then just a few years ago when we went to SSD it felt to me like every computer just got way better.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  I mean if you're listening and you haven't put an SSD in your computer yet that is like the go to.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  It's not that SSDs can't fail I mean of course not I mean any all discs fail eventually and you know corruption can happen because of software not just hardware but the stability of SSDs versus reliability versus hard drives it's just night and day.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  It's just the craziest you know and the worst part is of all the things that can fail if people don't have you know good backup and we could you know do a whole show about backups.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  I know on Mac power users you guys are you know rightly so if there's anything to be religious about it having good backup you know policies and plays.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  Duplication, duplication, you know but yeah let's face it a lot of people don't and if there's anything that's going to fail it's the hard a spinning hard drive and it's like the worst thing to fail because it's the thing that could cause you to lose the stuff you care about most.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  I imagine myself like is this like gray haired old geek talking to some young geek and explain yeah it was spinning seventy two hundred revolutions per minute and it had a little needle that would touch it and if it didn't touch in the right place all of your data was lost.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  I mean they're just going to look at us like you know we're driving model.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  It's a it's a marvel that they work as well as they do.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  It truly is a mechanically it's a mechanically a marvel that it works as well as it does but you know if you think wow that seems like something that might fail frequently well exactly right.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Yeah I totally think that now more I'm staring at this thirteen is MacBook Pro and I can't believe that it's actually like a current like a device that you like.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  I wonder if that's a difference between new Apple and old Apple I wonder if they're more willing to keep stuff a little bit.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  I'm not quite sure what what the market is for that.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Have you tried just switching gears have you tried the photos app if you tried this whole thing that you know what that's a great thing let's close out the show talking about photos but before we do I have to thank our last sponsor.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  And it is our good friend our good friends at fracture you guys know fracture they are one of the biggest supporters of the show.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  I love them to death they have a great product what they do is they take your photos you take photographs on your iPhone take them on your camera whatever you want to do you take them send them to fracture they print them directly on glass.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  I don't know how the hell they do it they've got some kind of proprietary apparatus that they take your digital photos print them directly on the surface of glass right there on the glass and then they ship them to you and these.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  It's fantastically clever things that are packaging material it's like a box that protects it in shipment because it is glass in there and then you open it up and the cardboard that's in there is the apparatus you need to do something like hang out on a wall.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  On your desk put it on your mantle anything you'd want to do they have an enormous variety of sizes everything from little three by three type things to giant 23 by 29 inch.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Wall size poster size sizes everything from small to large really great quality cannot emphasize even with iPhone pictures cannot emphasize just how well that the you know I know megapixels is overrated as a camera quality thing but we've got into the point where like eight megapixel pictures you can blow them up really big and they look great.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  What's their size I'm looking at their site right now so their large is 15.6 inches by 20.8 and they have an extra large that's 22 by 29.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  So really big you can go really really big they've also got square sizes so if you've got you know and let's face it we're just talking about Instagram a lot of us are framing our pictures of squares right now.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  The squares go up to 23 by 23 they've got 11 by 11 5 by 5 really really great for Instagram type pictures or pictures you framed you know as a square.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Cannot say enough about the quality of their stuff and how fun it is to get it and to actually see your photos somewhere other than on a glowing screen to just hang on a wall and appreciate it.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Father's Day is coming up you can order an advance really it's just a no brainer that we don't have to think about it it really don't it's like the greatest it sounds lazy.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  But I'm telling you it's the greatest because your relatives love getting pictures of family members it seems really personal it's the easiest thing in the world to do.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  So go check them out really really great stuff they've got a deal for the talk show listeners you go to their website fracture me dot com fracture me dot com use the code daring fireball.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  All one word daring fireball and you'll save 15% of any order and the prices are great already but you can save more just by being a listener of the show.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  You guys are ordering these things like crazy I can't appreciate enough that's why fracture keeps coming back to sponsor the show again keep it up but I cannot say highly enough how much I personally endorse the product it's it's just terrific so my thanks time.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  I heard a mark arm and talk about how you had his apps done in fracture and so I had all my books done except written several books and I had them done with fracture prints.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  All the book covers and I don't know I can't all myself but man it makes me happy just yeah maybe I shouldn't emphasize photos it you know it but it really does work well with images of any kind I know I've been in Marcos office and I've seen his apps and they look great they really do.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  All my cons are so big somebody pointed out recently I it's but like a a retina app icon the assets for it take up more space than would have fit on a high density floppy disk like so you couldn't even fit an app icon on a floppy disk.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  It's so easy to say back in my day talking about that so transition from floppy to hard.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  The last episode I think I think just exactly what I said episode 255 Mac power users great episode you and Katie go really long on on the new photos from Mac and the whole I cloud photos thinking thing.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  So we don't have to repeat it here it's a great if anybody out there who hasn't listen to Mac power users great episode really great introduction to the show and if you're interested in the details.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  But long story short I think all of us were kind of skeptical.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  Well that's the story it seems to me like everybody for years has been saying Apple can't do cloud services that's that's their weak spots not never gonna happen.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  And they released this photos app and they've got the iCloud photo storage and granted you have to pay for it me assuming you have a decent number of photos.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  I had moved their engineering resources to something new and photo I photo was kind of lingering but whatever the new thing was going to be it was going to display your photos just fine on your Mac but the big question mark to me was will this iCloud photo thing work and when I make a photo on my phone will it show up on my Mac and I had no problem and will all this magic stuff they they showed off last year come true and you know in my opinion it did.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Damned if they didn't pull it off. Yeah and nobody's talking about it really I mean I mean we've talked we did a show on it we've got a lot of people listening to our show I've I've done this field guide on it and I've only had like a couple people complaining about performance or cloud sync I mean there are a lot of people hitting this thing hard with like 30,000 photo libraries.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  And I think that the skepticism was actually two fold is first is general skepticism about Apple and cloud based anything and then second is that when it comes to photos I think so many people had burned out on I photo and had run up to the performance limits like and you know bottom line.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  I don't know where the line is and I guess it probably depends a little maybe even on the size of the photos like you know what kind of camera you're using to take the photos you're putting in there but at a certain reasonable level of photos like not like wow that's that's abnormal but like.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Probably just combined with the fact of how long digital cameras have been a thing right so like I photo comes out in the early 2000s with the you know I life and the digital hub strategy of Apple and everybody's only got hundreds of photos or 1000 or 2000.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  And you know low you know now we're in the 2010s and everybody everybody might have 10,000 photos and I photo wasn't dealing with that well.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  You know it's scrolling problems performance problems it just and everybody you know there's a vibrant third party market.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  For you know utilities that would help you split up your I photo library you know and switch between different libraries because.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  You know just keeping all your photos in one big library wasn't working technically but the whole idea and so that's a great work around but the whole idea of having to manage all these libraries defeated the whole purpose of I photo in the first place was.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  It's supposed to be that you know hey you're not supposed to just throw out here's a place where you throw all your photos.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And that's what photos foot the new photos promised and I think people were skeptical about that but I think the truth is that you know quietly in the midst of all this hubbub about the watch Apple has solved a massive long standing problem.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Yeah and it and it works I mean I just I was running in the beta and I was thinking well it's the beta there's not that many people hitting the server blah blah blah.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  But when it released my wife's library is even bigger than mine and it uploaded fine and it's you know it just works so.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  I'm really happy to see that you know I'm sure there's a lot of smart people at Apple that knew that they had this reputation and this was something they needed to deliver on.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  But it really it really does so I got excited about it and we did a whole show on it and.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  I mean the reason the weird thing is I was going to write a book about I was going to write a book called photo management for you know Mac and iOS and I had a whole I have it on the outliner it's full of.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  Ideas and Dropbox and all these you know third party services and it's a great what would have been a great book but then I start using photos I'm like heck with this there's no book here I mean just use photos.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Do you think and that's not that's not true for the pros I mean I'm you know there's there's there's edge cases but for most people this will solve your problem.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  I do think that there is you know if there's a complaint to be had it's that Apple's public statement is paraphrasing but that they're no longer developing aperture or.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  I think the truth of it is that it falls somewhere in between it is a better it's certainly better at handling a large number of photos without question I don't see anybody could deny that way better.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  To me it's is an object or an object of statement not a subjective one way better than that handling a large number of photos then I photo ever was.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  I think subjectively it is better at editing photos.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  You know the tools I cropping and adjusting the.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  I would almost say in comparison to I photo it is objectively better because like changing the amount of light in an image just turning up exposure doesn't do exactly that it screws up other things.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  Whereas in this case if you turn up to make an image to add more light it turns down shadows it does a whole bunch of stuff at once.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  To make it better so they're they're bringing like having a more professional editing abilities and that you don't get with I photos I'd say it's even better for that although you don't get the local changes like in aperture you could locally.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  I think you know if you're a pro user then and you really loved aperture you're probably not going to be happy with photos.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  And you know I know that there's a lot of them out there I know there or even if you're you know semi pro pro swimmer whatever you want to call it.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  I know that there's a lot of people out there who.
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  Honestly evaluated both light room and aperture and preferred aperture and I'm a long time light room user but not like in a pro sense just like in like a total pro very much on the swimmer side of pro swimmer.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  But I like light room and I know that it's sort of got like a funky UI but I like it and to me it's not like in Adobe UI it's like it just a unique UI that I thought is very thoughtful.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  Really like it but I totally can see why I even as a non non professional photographer I can see the differences in aperture and light room and I can see why people preferred aperture.
[1:59:48.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  And those people are kind of left with the short end of the stick here because photos doesn't do enough for them and they already had decided that they didn't like light room as much as aperture.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  Yeah well I mean it just seemed like that's kind of a trend for people who are using the pro apps from app lately I mean they're they're aiming lower I think the what they the fat middle or whatever they call it but the.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  But for most people I mean because and I think that and I totally acknowledge those people are not going to be happy but for so many people such a great many more people.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  They were completely baffled by what to do with their photos because they're taking you know hundreds of pictures at one event on their phone and they just leave them on their phone or they they figure out how to get it down to their Mac or their and they you know have got a folder somewhere and it's not backed up and they can't access it and.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  I just completely crazy and where's what this new system we were at a family party and someone was talking about something that funny that happened in 2006 and I was able to pull up a picture of it on my phone and it just like blue their mind.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  It is true I find that the way that they automatically.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  You know the the interface that they've come up with this sort of years you know at the years level it's clearly you can't see what the the details are but that you just remember when something happened vaguely you can go back there and you know you remember it was sometime in August we went you know we went on a cruise in August of 2009 or whatever so back to 2009.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  And go down to about where August is you probably see a lot of blue because you're you know on the ocean and just start zooming in there and you're going to find that photo.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Yeah I was surprised how well it worked in a Mac seemed like a great interface for an iPad or an iPhone and I think I'm not sure if that's the best thing to do on a Mac but when I started playing with it you know really it is pretty nice you can just scroll you can see the year you know a year is maybe a two or three inch block of.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Very you know small thumbnails and so you can go back years very easily and it's just you know and having been an iPhone with a crazy lag time for so long. It's it feels like you know jumping into a sports car.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  I think too that it plays into something that I've been saying for a while now that Apple and I know people sometimes over use the word quietly like Apple quietly blank. But I do think that they've sort of quietly become it by but but not by luck not that they don't you know back into it but purposefully have become.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Arguably the leading camera company in the world or what certainly without question one of the leading camera companies in the world that they make devices now they just happen to be iPhones and iPads.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  But they make devices that people use as their primary cameras or if not their primary it's an important camera to their life and part of that is more than just the end of today's world it's more than just.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Taking the photos it is everything that happens after them putting up you know having them in a place where you can instantly share them and.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  Having them be organized and.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  The whole idea the old school way and me still need to do it if you're taking photos with the third party camera stand on camera still need to connect it by USB or pop the.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  You know the card out and put it in your computer. And import them but the idea that you need to do anything more than that to have them everywhere is just a non starter or at least in terms it should be now and now with photos it kind of is.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  Yeah I just I cannot get over how little has been made of this but it just seems to me like this is a really good sign that you know Apple can figure out the cloud and they can do big data.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  I think part of it is that institutionally I think it is truly an important thing to them I really do and I think it's one of those things where there's a lot of people that Apple all the way up to the highest levels.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  You know pretty serious about their photography I mean Phil Schiller is definitely serious about photography I mean I know that for a fact like as a hobby you know it's you know it lists it like.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  It's like he's got like two or three things in his Twitter bio it's like Apple cars and.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  I have all cars sports and photography or something like that.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  It's interesting about the I phone is a camera though you know when you first had pictures on the iPhone.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Definitely a point and shoot was a better camera and now that's not the case anymore and I've got a mirrorless SLR you know it's it's not a super nice one but it's nice.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  And it takes better pictures.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  I have the Olympus PL5 and I bought that 20 millimeter pancake lens with it and it's a 1.7 I believe and that's all I ever use.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  I just use that pancake lens it's great but the I'm getting to the point where.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  I don't even use that 20 on that though is in 35 millimeter equivalence is probably like like 40.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  It's pretty tight but the but you know just the 1.7 is great you know you get a nice blurry background.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  The 50 though is the classic lens though like if you know like the old school advice on how do you learn to be a photographer
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  you get a 50 millimeter prime and put it on your camera and then pretend like it doesn't come off.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Yeah I had that I called it the 50 I had on my old can't yeah I can't 80 but 80 bucks great market.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Yeah I was like $90 a 90 dollar lens new from Canon and you could get the Japanese version that doesn't really have the US warranty for 80 which is what everybody did.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  I got the friend of mine had the 1.4 it was $300 but he sold to me used I got it cheap.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  And in I'm an orange County Canon's national repair facilities in Irvine and like it's like 80 bucks and I'll fix the lens.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  And I had like that the lens broke like two or three times because every time I let some else use the camera they would start cranking it like it was a zoom and just do something to it.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  But now I got tired of carrying that big one so I got the Olympus and now I'm getting at the point where I almost use the phone exclusively.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  It's not because I mean that the pictures are close enough for most things and having the geo data and everything there and having it already in my library the moment I take it to me are becoming so convenient that it's it's taking over.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  The thing for me is that it's my my photos have always been at least in the iPhone world post iPhone world of all of it's I've always had two two collections of photos.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  The photos that I took with my regular cameras which used to be an I photo years ago for the last I don't know ten years have been in Lightroom and then my iPhone photos which have been on my iPhone.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  And I never bothered to put my iPhone photos into Lightroom because it just didn't seem to seem worthwhile and I didn't want to take them off I wanted to keep them on the phone.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  And now in the new world there both it goes both ways I not only have my iPhone photos on my Mac but I have any photos that I took you know that I take with a regular camera just magically show up on my iPhone.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  Well it it seems like they've solved a big problem for people and I don't I feel like we're not you know and again it's just the way human beings are we're we're more likely to spend time complaining about what isn't right then we are praising what goes what goes well.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  But I really do feel that the photos thing you know you can add a finally if you want but I really do feel like it's kind of gone unheralded and it really and I know it's not perfect I'm sure that there are people out there listening who had something go wrong during the initial upload or the import or whatever.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  But for the most part I think it was a really clean launch and I think it worked really well and it continues to work really well. I think I know one time that I was blown away is took a taken screenshots with my watch you take a screenshot with your watch and then it shows up on your phone.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  You know almost instantly at least in most cases by the time I unlock the phone it's already there.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  And when I want to send it to somebody but I'm on my Mac I used to take the screenshots on my phone and like airplane to myself to the Mac and then put it into chatter or email or whatever.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  And then like a week ago I was like hey maybe they just show I guess they're supposed to show up in the photos app and if I leave the photos app running they just show up it's so great.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  Well it's like when I was doing my wife's 36,000 photo upload I figured the whole network was going to be crashing and at the same time I did instead of writing the book I did a video I did this big video on photos and so I was testing it and I'm literally like making corrections on my iPad.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  And I've got my Mac but pro open there while I'm doing the corrections and they show up almost immediately since I finished the correction.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  And like everybody when I go to a family event I shoot like 200 pictures of which really 20 are the ones I should keep but I never have time to go through and sort that out so I ended up keeping always pictures and I'm going back to these old events and just like with the iPads very easy to see them and pick the ones you want to keep and the ones you want to delete and even make cropping adjustments and little things like that with your finger.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  I mean it's the whole process now is easier and I'm just really happy to see I was worried if I had one worry about Apple over the last few years.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  It seemed like they had this whole with cloud services and obviously everything's heading that direction in a lot of ways.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  And it seemed like they I don't know you know there's a perception of institutional arrogance or that they feel like well we're making so much money with this other stuff.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  We don't have to worry about that I was worried that one day they were going to wake up and be irrelevant because they never got the cloud figured out.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  And this to me is like a really great sign that they're they understand that.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  I've got a lot of chores ahead of me on the photo front because I'm not all in I've still got my you know last 10 years of photos they're all still in Lightroom and I think what I'm going to want to do is export everything.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  Maybe you know I've got the space I'll keep I'm not going to like delete the lightroom library but I want to export everything and then import it into photos and have it there.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  But one thing I'm not I'm not sure about maybe I hopefully you can answer is what goes on when you shoot raw and you import on a real camera like like your Olympus you shoot raw do you shoot raw.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Not anymore I used to. What if you did if you shoot raw and you it'll take raw and then what syncs over to your iOS devices that does I photo take care of creating JPEG thumbnails.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  The way it works is with the the thumbnails you're getting our super small that's the reason why you can see your library on your on your 16 gigabyte phone.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  And then when you tap on one of them it hits the Internet and it pulls down a bigger version. But it's not going to pick down like I feel like on your phone screen it's going to it's still going to optimize when it downloads the image.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  At least this is the way it was explained to me in a way I I discovered so you're never going to get like the full size image downloading to your phone.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  I don't believe there's any way to do it you know that they're going to be what if you go painted did you have two max though and you're willing to.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  I know there's a setting I forget what they call it but there's a setting that's like optimize photo storage and what that does is it means.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Do you really want all of your photos here locally and in the cloud or do you just want to have these thumbnails and we'll pull them down on demand and I know on your last episode you had the good advice that on at least one of your max you should definitely have it.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  So that your whole library is there just it in the name of duplication so that yeah even as much as I like it I don't want to give Apple everything in the cloud and say it's safe because why not have it both places just in case the server you know that something happens on the iCloud photo storage and your photo get library on in the iCloud gets corrupted.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Well you still got your photos on your Mac and then you can re upload just in case right Murphy's law yeah but what if you have two max and you want both max to have your full collection if you import raw on Mac a does Mac be get the raw image to.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  I don't know I don't know I haven't tested that I know that Mac if both Mac a and Mac be are downloading all images you're going to get I believe full size images on both max.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  Because like for edits you'd want the raw version wherever you're right and I'm wondering where the like your iPad is only going to get a jpeg.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  I'm wondering where that jpeg gets created does it get created on the cloud or does it create it on your Mac while it's uploading to the cloud and I'm kind of suspecting that maybe it gets created on your Mac which is why that upload process is CPU intensive not just network intensive.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  And when you think about the fact that you can crop the downloaded version of your iPad but it's still going to crop the full version on your Mac. I mean there was some serious engineering work done to make all that happen definitely I mean this was not easy.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  Try to think what else anything else you want to talk about this week now man it's uh it's all good it's been it's been a pretty exciting couple months like people like apples I totally agree and it's you know and and here we are heading right into W W DC which is you know.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  Peak you know like the first half of the year this is like the peak and then you know they'll they'll go silent for two months and then you know ramp back up in September again but it's I'm going for the first time my life I'm going to W W DC. Wow you've never been there before.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  But you know Mac world's not around anymore now my new employer has a very liberal policy so well you know Jason Snow. Yeah I'm sure you saw it a few weeks ago he wrote. Was it for I'm more I forget because he now it's like it used to be you always knew where snow was writing but now it's he's bouncing around but he you know that the W W DC is taken over it's the hub of the Apple community world.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Whether you're a developer or not which is weird because it you know years ago you would have never thought you'd never recommend to someone who wasn't a developer that they go to W W DC.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  I still wouldn't recommend you try to get in the lottery and get a ticket if you're not going to actually take not even try right yeah try but the but it's going to be fun being up there so many friends that are going to be there. I'm talking it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say no I think I'm going to be talking at all comp about stuff so.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  And then there's a new conference layers. What is the URL for the layers conference I'm actually talking at that one. It is.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Bring your layers dot com but if you just type layers conference I'm sure it'll come up but it's yeah like the Tuesday and Wednesday of W W DC week and it is literally right around the corner I mean like whatever hotel anybody would pick for going to Moscone.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Where the layers conferences is in that it's it's sounds funny that it's in the mall but it's like that it's a very strange mall up up on Market Street.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  I went on the self employed budget hotel I'm at the monster and I don't have my own bathroom so.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  And if he I told my wife said well all of my you know sometimes I would prefer not to be around people you know sometimes you're just not good at getting out this will solve that problem for me because I'm not going to want to be at my hotel at all.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  So there's I'll be like in the lobby if you're but I think it's a great and I do you know that my Catholic upbringing is such that there's like a guilt like I feel like you know you got to have some kind of work really you can't just go on a boondoggle you got to have some kind of way to justify a trip like this.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  But there's so many things there's all com for there's this new layers conference which looks great and it's they call it a design conference for the Mac and iOS community.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  You don't have to be designer to go but it's you know certainly if you are it is a fantastic thing it's a great deal a tremendous line of those speakers but then you can be there for the week and it really is it.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  There's no zero that my mind the WDC is now what Mac world used to be which is the hub where you know people like me and you can get together and we don't see each other very often I haven't seen you since Mac world some number of years ago I believe.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Yeah it was a couple years ago and the difference in Mac world gave normal users a chance to go and just kind of see what's new I mean there was a need that we've lost with Mac world and I don't know what if somebody ever is going to try and fix that but.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  You know it's still not a complete replacement for Mac world but it's the best we got at this point.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  I guess I should say because I know people are asking I've the last couple of years I've done a live version of the talk show during WDC and that is on again as well that will be on Tuesday night.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  As it has been the last few years nothing to announce yet in terms of tickets or anything but I think what I'm going to do.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  That's why I bring it up on the show is so that listeners of the show get the first crack at it is next episode whatever no next episode next week I'll talk about it on the show.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  Before I announce it on Darren Fireball and so if you want to get ticket and has sold I have to admit it has sold out every year so.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  I want to get in the best way to get in would be to wait for me to announce not this show next week's show which would be episode 120 I believe.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  And quick download the show and start listening and then I'll give you the you know listen to the show and then you'll know where to go to buy your tickets for that.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  Keep your Tuesday night for you though Tuesday I'm totally going to that I can't wait yeah you're in you don't have to worry about it.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  I'm I'm I'm just really looking forward to it's just in a couple weeks so I don't know what to expect but I'm going to be I'm going to be on the road that week not going to be hanging out in my hotel room with no bathroom.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  David Sparks will need to borrow your bathroom exactly so I'll just be like in the hotel lobby those of you who are coming just be willing to offer David your.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  You need to bring like a you need to bring a external battery pack for your iPhone and you need to bring a port of money and the toothbrush and the toothbrush.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  Somebody should make an external battery pack for that that has a little toothbrush that flips out of the side.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  I stayed at the monster once years ago for macro I was they had me like giving like the one of the very first sessions and like one of the very last.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  So I in as back when macro went a whole week and I so I ended up having me in like seven days there and I wanted to save money so I got one and it's great because the sink is right next to the bed.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  You can literally just sit up and bed and brush your teeth.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  Where is the monster I know if it's next door to Moscone I mean it's the best.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I don't think I've I've never stayed there.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  Yeah I don't know it's I just decided this year I was going to go on the cheap.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Well I have I have totally gone there on the cheap over the years and you know I did you know what a lot of the cheaper hotels in that area there.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  It's easy to complain about it but they're you know it's not bad.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  There's that's great it's great it's right there and you can just go back to room drops stuff off it's nice but the.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  But when they tell me and say well we don't even have any rooms left with bathrooms I'm like well how exactly does that work.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  Like well there's a community like bathroom like for four rooms you go out in the hallway and you can lock yourself in there.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  Okay well I'm definitely not going to be spending much time at the hotel.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  Yeah but that's you know you said that that's good though you know you're not coming up there too to hang out in the hotel.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  I do think the only the down side WWDC isn't that big compared to so many of the conferences there because it you know the the Moscone West has pretty significant limitations on attendance.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  Like they just can't make it bigger.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  But there's a lot of people who go now who aren't going don't have WWDC passes.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Yeah but nowhere near as big as like Oracle World or GDC even the game developer conference.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Some of those ones that take up Moscone South and West have and the hotel prices skyrocket.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  There was one year where the new iPad event.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  I think it was while the iPads were still coming out in the in the spring coincided with one of those conferences.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  And I you know got the invitation you know the press past you know the typical Apple you know came out like a week before the event.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  And I went to book and then like all of the hotels were like eight hundred dollars a night. I was like what the hell.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  And it was because of this mega conference.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  So yeah WWC we didn't like that.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  But the overall boom in San Francisco and the way the economy is just on fire there has really driven up hotel prices.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  That's like the biggest that's the biggest downside to having this thing in San Francisco is that it you know for people who are on the entire budget.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  It kind of stinks. It's going to be fun though.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  A couple of years ago like around 2008-2009 because of the economic you know shit show of the world.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Which kind of helped because it was like when Daring Fireball was still really flying low to the ground economically.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  I used to be able to get like a four four and a half star hotel for like a hundred and seventy five dollars.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  Like there are a couple of years for WWC where there's a gang of us who are staying at the intercontinental which is literally right next door.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  I mean it's like physically connected to Moscone West.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  It's great.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  And we got we got deals on Hotwire for like a hundred and seventy five dollars.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  And it's serious not happened in this year.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  No it is nowhere near like that.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  But it was it was fantastic for someone you know it was really really did not have the budget for six nights in San Francisco.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  Anyway I will see you there.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  Thank you for being here.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  Let's get some plugs in man.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  Do you have stuff to plug?
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  Yeah I guess the big plug for me is just maxbarkey.com.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  That's where all the stuff is.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  maxbarkey.com.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  Your new photos from Mac field guide is there.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  You can just go to maxbarkey.com and there's a big link to it in the sidebar.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  But it's just maxbarkey.com slash photos.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  This is a two and a half hour screencast tutorial guide like make a guide.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  Like a book in screencast form.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  I mean like I was going to do a book but this one since it just went out but made more since it's a look over my shoulder.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  And learn it as we're kind of weird making it because there's some of my you know I use my family.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  I use my family library because you need where am I going to do it where I have 30,000 photos that I can use as an example.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  But it's great.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  And I just went soup to nuts and at the end ended up being two and a half hours which was probably longer than I would have liked it to be but I cover everything.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  So there you have it.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  It cost ten bucks.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  Now.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  On your show you tracked your hours that you put into it.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  This is embarrassing.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  It's not embarrassing.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  No you're embarrassed by this.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  You spent eighty one hours in the production of the screencast.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  So in other words though I don't think that's embarrassing at all though.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  I think that's the way film and video production is.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  I mean that's why it takes you know three months shoot and two years of pre production for a Star Wars movie to come out.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Right like you you know and the Star Wars movie is going to be two hours you know it takes a long time.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  But that if ten bucks it's crazy good deal.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  But in other words this is not David did not just turn on the screencast thing and start talking for two hours which exactly what I do with this podcast.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  It's not like that at all.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  Imagine if this imagine if this show had gone on for eighty hours and then painstakingly we picked out the two hours of it that were solid gold.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  That's what this is like.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  So for ten bucks it is an absolute steal.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  And if you have any kind of interest in the new photos.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  Pretty much make up you know both the app and the the the the syncing the iCloud you know the iCloud covers everything covers everything.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  So there you go you go to max parking to get that and you got your show over at the Mac power user show at relay.fm slash MPU MPU is Mac power users.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  Yep. We'll move right about the markdown book. Yeah why not I need to if there's ever a time to plug the markdown book it would be your first appearance on the talk show.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  Yeah I wrote that book with Eddie Smith and I I talked about markdown a lot on the Mac power users because I just think it's so awesome.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  I mean on the lawyer side of my life you know the my industry runs on Microsoft Word but I like to have text in a very mobile agile format.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  I want to be able to open it on my iPad or my Mac or whatever.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  So I was a big proponent of using text until the very end and then letting someone format it and then I found markdown and it like made it possible for me to do a lot of the formatting myself.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  So I'm not the person you were thinking of when you you know gave birth to this.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  But I still use it all the time and people were writing the show and say you keep talking about markdown I don't understand it and it's not that hard.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  But sometimes people want kind of a more you know a walkthrough.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  So Eddie and I had this book and we did we screencast at the whole thing you know how do you make emphasis and how do you and we picked some of our favorite apps that use markdown and showed how you would write markdown and export it and the various things you could do with it.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  And I really need to update that book frankly I'm going to try and talk you in an interview with me in the next update because we put some audio interviews in there with people that use markdown in their daily lives.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  It's a lot of fun and all those books I do in I books author are really big.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  I mean they're like you know you know they're like gigabyte size books because they all have like an hour and a half of video inside of them.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  So if you get one of those books just be ready to give it a few minutes to download because there's a lot of data in there.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  But I will tell you right now yes I will do an interview for the next version of the markdown book. Excellent. It's criminal that I blew you off the last time. I didn't say no but I never actually made myself available.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  Well I figured you're busy so it's fine busy lazy you know but anyway it's criminal that I didn't because it's really an honor. It's the type of thing.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  It's just the type of little thing that you just I never expected it I get like long story short I made markdown and I should give this to the world.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  I shouldn't hold it. I just this seems so good that I you know maybe everybody should use this and then I put it out there and and it didn't really take off that quickly.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  It was very slow and people were still using like my and again I totally understand why but like it was like the little tiny bit of of timing that was weird was I put markdown out there and like the next week was when base camp debuted.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  And now they're just base camp company but you know 30 the former yeah 37 seconds and I know Jason very well I know I know David you know everybody I don't know anybody there I used to know everybody 37
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  and all the comments and messaging in base camp was done using textile denalance thing which is sort of a same type of thing is markdown but different syntax and it's you know just it was just like oh it sucks.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  And I'm totally not like within one week it's not like they were going to use markdown instead of textile I mean obviously base camp was in development for you know.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  I mean you can you can make apps with rails pretty quickly but not knowing but I just that damn I wish I'd come out with a sooner because I bet they would have used markdown instead of textile.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  And then it's just in going anywhere I don't know and people some people would you know use it but then like who's like the slowest sureest like uptake like the slow steady thing and then all of a sudden it's this thing and everything has markdown built into it and people are writing books about and that to me is just crazy.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  In my experience the reason markdown became so relevant to me I was using it to write blog post from ex-marky which is great but what really made it a big deal to me was the fact that iOS has never really supported rich text very well.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  And even if it did I you know I don't want to use rich text on iOS I just want things to be fast and to sync quickly you know this is before photos and Apple proving its bones and so you know having plain text that you can format and then open on iOS devices.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  I mean markdown was so it was like a solution made for a problem that didn't exist yet. I would disagree that the macOS doesn't have good support for rich text. I think a great support for rich text the problem is there's never been a rich text format that has been long term stability in a long term not stability but.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  They always get old and then you can't lose it yeah right that there's no compatibility. So even RTF which RTF is still supported great on Mac but they never ported the RTF stuff to iOS so anything you have an RTF doesn't go to iOS.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  Yeah I guess that I say I meant iOS is that that's the problem is iOS you're stuck and if you want to write on your iPad and on your Mac you need a solution and markdown really just does that nicely in every it seems like every writing app.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  I remember when that was like a feature selling point of a new app that it supports markdown and now it's like everybody just supports markdown it's just in it.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  You know around that time late 90s and the 2000s there was the you know still was a living war over style text versus plain text for email like should you be saying style text email where you can hit command I and your word is actually italicized or should you be sending plain text email and I was staunchly on the side of the plain text that this was a protocol that was designed.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  The terminal era and it's everything should be plain text and that way everybody will be able to read you you know it'll look the right anywhere and clearly the plain text side lost the war for email and nobody even really it's not even something people argue about anymore.
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  But it was really more of a case where we lost the battle emails just a battle but long term plain text as as one overall I mean all sorts of new things are all just plain text Facebook is sort of a plain text platform Twitter is definitely a plain text platform nobody even thinks about it anymore.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  Look at the stuff I wrote in Mac right in 1992 I don't know I'm sure there's a way I could get it but I don't know how I'd get it at this point and that's just to me a reminder that you know the stuff I spend writing I want to be able to access forever and I mean that's another reason why markdown is a good in plain text.
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  Look at thrown off because in the whole early era of PCs we kept getting more powerful CPUs bigger displays better rendering capabilities better access to you know collection of fonts cross platform etc etc etc so we could keep making things fancier and fancier in terms of wizzy wig text styling.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  But in terms of what the canonical storage format for this stuff should be I always thought it should always be plain text because that way anything and everything that you do in the future will be able to read it and I feel like the way people have caught onto that now where things like Twitter which was originally designed as like an SMS platform.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  And then turned into a web thing and now turned into a mobile thing and now people are getting on our watches and stuff if everything is just plain text every time there's one of these new things that comes up it's all has to do is render text.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  I'm just in some ways I'm glad I can't access those old things because I remember I had a fascination with the original San Francisco.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  And I'm sure I used it inappropriately a lot but there was no appropriate way to use it yeah there you go I used it in appropriately period.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  I think that would be such a great Easter egg if like Apple watch on it on I mean not great Apple would never just be if like April 1st if your Apple watch displayed everything in the old San Francisco fun.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  That would be so awesome.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  All right anything else you want to plug David.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  I'm all right thank you so much for your time.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  You have to be on again sometime.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  Say hello to Katie and I will see you next month at the WWDC.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  All right thank you.
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  I'm going to stop.
