[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  Were you a Prince fan?
[00:01.600 --> 00:04.000]  I can't say that I was.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  As someone who grew up in the 80s, it was impossible to miss him.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  And I watched tons of MTV.
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  And so all of the songs from the 80s are totally ingrained in my head.
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  Because I've watched them all the time.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.000]  Because I watched MTV all the time.
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  I liked him a lot. I cannot say I was particularly a fan.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  I came around to it later.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  Because like you, I was more of a...
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  I always put him in the pop category a bit more.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Which I think is fair to say.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  And I was kind of probably like a more rock and roll-y kind of guy.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  But I mean after I got out of that phase of like...
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  You know when you're a teenager you tend to delete things into good and bad a lot more.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  But yeah, once I got into sort of appreciating...
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Oh man, he's immensely talented and he's had so much cultural impact.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  In terms of other music and other bands.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Just the way they behave. He's amazing.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  Yeah, I tweeted something last night.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  It was a tribute. It was from when George Harrison died.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  And his son had like a tribute.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  And Prince played.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  And didn't even sing.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  It was like Tom Petty and I forget who the...
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  Somebody else.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  George Harrison's son was on stage.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  Yeah, and Petty did most of the lyrics.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  But then Prince came on with this guitar solo at the end.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  And it's just jaw-droppingly good.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  And I'd always heard.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  And some people on Twitter. Most people just retweeted it.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  Because it's an amazing performance.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  It's a great song. Well played.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  And it's just an amazing ending.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  And then it's even better because at the end Prince knows he nailed it.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  And he just nonchalantly tosses his guitar up in the air.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  And it never comes down.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  What the hell happened to his guitar?
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  He must have been on a wire the whole time.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  Yeah, and he just saunters off stage.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  It's such an amazing show.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  I've seen him perform and he is incredible.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  I realize it's a guitar and not a microphone.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  But effectively it is the greatest mic drop I've ever seen.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  I mean, in addition to being a great song and a great performance.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  It is literally the best mic drop I've ever seen because it doesn't come down.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  And he rocks out like Jimi Hendrix style.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Which you're not accustomed to hearing necessarily in his songs.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  But he can do it. You know what I mean?
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  Just in my back pocket I could be the next Jimi Hendrix.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  Yeah, it's just in his back pocket.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  I play a lot of funk and stuff.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  And there were a couple of people on Twitter who were like,
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  To me, how can you not know that Prince is one of the top 20 guitarists of all time?
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  Maybe like top 10.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  And I didn't know.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  I knew he was great.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  I knew he could play a bunch of instruments.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I knew he was a very talented musician, including the guitar.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  I knew that because people told me.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  But I didn't know it in the way you really know it when you actually see it.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  Yeah.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  I realized then that all of those guitar solos on all of Prince's songs that are so amazing are him.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  And I didn't know that before.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Well, half of the other instruments that are being played are also him.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Right.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  That he's just doing it all in a way that's just almost impossible to comprehend.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  I think one thing that I could probably convince you to appreciate about him a lot is that,
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Remember when he had to change his name?
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  He had to?
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  Yeah, so the record label basically had him by the balls for producing albums under the name Prince.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  And he didn't like his deal.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  So he's like, screw it.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  And in the ultimate, fuck you.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  He's like, I'm going to change my name to this character.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Oh, I remember when he changed his name to the character.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  I didn't realize that it was a way out of his...
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  It was 100% a way out of his like, screw you.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  You're not owning my masters, my music.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  I'm taking it.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  And you're not owning my name because I'm going to change my name to something ridiculous.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  And he never bothered explaining to that.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  It's not like he went on all the shows and just told people.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  He was like, look, I'm doing that.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  I'm going to keep focusing on my work.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Same reason why he doesn't want all the YouTube stuff is he wants to basically be able to own all the distribution.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  Yeah.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Because he thinks artists deserve to be paid.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And I absolutely have been aware of his stance on that.
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  Last night, I mean, like half the people in the Western world last night, you know, Amy and I started, you know,
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  went to listen to some nice tunes and not on Apple Music.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  I knew, you know, first thing I tried.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  And I instantly thought, well, I guess I knew that actually, you know, because he's not into that.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  So we just started buying a bunch of stuff from iTunes.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  It was a lot of fun.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Good stuff.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  I posted a link today on Daring Fireball.
[04:30.000 --> 04:40.000]  I don't know if you saw it, but just like a random screenshot from a movie that Prince made in 1990 called Graffiti Bridge,
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  where he played like, you know, like a sort of thinly veiled version of himself, like a young songwriter.
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  And in 1990, the character, he was, you know, composing a song on like a little Mac.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  And of course, and it was totally legit.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  It wasn't like a phony fake UI.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  It was like a real app from the day of, you know.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  Like MIDI tracking?
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  Yeah, MIDI tracking.
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  Like trackers?
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  Yeah.
[05:06.000 --> 05:13.000]  So like the actual screenshot in the movie is actually like an actual song that he wrote.
[05:13.000 --> 05:21.000]  It was like, so you got like a little look at his, Prince's own like, you know, working setup.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  Workflow when he's like trying stuff out with a Mac.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  It's like Warhol drawing on that.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  Right.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.000]  Right.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  It's like a little Mac paint.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Right.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  A little nine inch.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Look at this screen.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  It's tiny.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  God, what would it have been if it was an SE?
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I think that it was like the guy who wrote the blog post was trying to figure out.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  He nailed it down.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  It was either an SE or an SE30.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Yeah.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  The SE30 didn't come out until like late in the year before the movie was made, though.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  So there's, I think there's a much better chance that it was just an SE.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  So that would have been just a 68,000 chip, I think.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  I don't know if it had a 6820.
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.000]  But it wasn't until the SE's 68030 that the Mac really got fast.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  So that was a pretty slow machine.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  Nine inches.
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.000]  You know what, though?
[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  You got to, it says a lot about his forward looking.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  Absolutely.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  Take on being an artist that he's like, look, I'm going to try this crazy thing.
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  That probably sounded tinny and kind of crappy to him compared to all of the other options
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  he had.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  But he was fascinated enough to like, oh, this is cool.
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  I want to learn how to do it.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  Yeah.
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  And I'm sure the final output maybe didn't come right off the Mac in a lot of ways because
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  he played a lot of actual analog instruments.
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.000]  But maybe to get the composition right, it's that power of digital editing and the way
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  that you can move stuff.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  I mean, we take it for granted to there.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  And people who've grown up in an all digital world, I could see why they take it for granted.
[06:49.000 --> 06:57.000]  But when you learn to be a writer, like I did, where we didn't have word processors
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  or computers at our disposal all the time.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  I mean, I used to actually, in high school, I used a typewriter to write stuff.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  And it's like when you think about when you're halfway through a thing and you really want
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  to move a paragraph or even just take out a sentence, if you realize you've just duplicated
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  the same sentence twice, something that you wrote like the page before.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  And it's like you either have to retype the whole page or just live with it.
[07:24.000 --> 07:30.000]  You start making decisions based on convenience rather than what it should be.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Craft.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  Right.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  I mean, if you wanted to do anywhere near a halfway decent job, it was almost impossible
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  not to type the whole thing twice.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  Because how could you not make some sort of editing decision where you go through it
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  with a pen and then retype it?
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  And you would literally have to retype the thing.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  I mean, I'm sure music was the same way in a lot of ways.
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  And that digital editing, the same way that it's revolutionized word processing,
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  same way for music.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  Oh, I'm sure.
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  Yeah.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  So I...
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Just like changing the tempo.
[08:02.000 --> 08:10.000]  There's almost a third dimension to music that doesn't necessarily happen in writing.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Yeah, totally.
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  What I remember from those days, the early days in the Mac around that time, is yes, yes.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  We were constantly running up against every single one of the limits of the machines.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  I mean, just stacks full of floppy disks all stuffed within a few bytes of being full.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  A hard drive that was completely full.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  If you go back even just a few more years, you didn't even have a hard drive.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  Everything was on the floppy drive.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Severely RAM constrained.
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  I mean, most of those devices, a lot of those early Macs only had a gigabyte or two gigabytes.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  My Mac LC in 1991 had four, a whopping four gigabytes, not gigabytes, megabytes.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  Okay, good.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  Four megabytes of RAM.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  So your RAM constrained, storage constrained.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  The storage was incredibly slow.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  The hard drives were slow.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  The floppies were so slow you could hear them making the reads and writes.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  Yeah.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  I guess you could hear the hard drives too, but the floppies...
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.000]  I used to find that comforting.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  Yeah, definitely, because you knew...
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  Something was working?
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  It was comforting in a way you didn't think about until it went away.
[09:20.000 --> 09:29.000]  And then you realized that if you think that something might be going wrong, you don't have that comfort.
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  At least back then, it's like if you thought something was going wrong, like a crash, or the system's locking up,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  but you could still hear the thing you were hoping was being saved being written to.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  You had hope that, okay, at least it's still writing to the disk.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Or if it locked up and all, you could hear it like it were, and then a clicking noise.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Right, there were certain noises.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.000]  You could definitely...
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  A big part of the diagnosis of any problem back then was what kind of noises...
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  Mechanical go-but is falling apart.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  Right, because there were certain... if it was perfectly repetitious, then that's a bad sign.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  Yes.
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  Because that's like the same thing as going...
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  Yes.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  You could hear... sometimes you could hear it when a program had wedged itself into an infinite loop.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  Yes.
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  And that was bad.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  But there was a certain randomness to the sounds of a file being written, that it wasn't quite repetitious, that was soothing.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  Because it was seeking to the different sectors, so you'd hear the...
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  Yes, it was.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  It was more of an analog relationship.
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  It was fundamentally a digital machine, but there was, you know, the actual spinning disk
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  and the physicality of the ones and zeros being written to the disk gave it a certain...
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  a genuinely analog dimension that came across in your relationship with it.
[10:48.000 --> 10:56.000]  I feel like there's probably a... I don't drive, so correct me, but like a manual versus automatic kind of...
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  Like you're very aware of the machine in one case, and in the other case you're kind of divorced from it a little bit.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  Well, and I think there's also a... if you compare it to driving, and I'm not really a car guy, but I do drive,
[11:07.000 --> 11:20.000]  but I think there's also, almost undisputably, a comparison to... as decades go on, our cars are more and more abstract
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  in terms of just how much isolation there is from the noise outside, the shock absorption.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  And older cars, you really feel the road, and you feel it's... you're just so much less removed.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  I mean, it's almost shocking sometimes when you look at a car from the 60s or 70s, let alone further,
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  like how thin the doors are, you know, it's... everything was a lot more thinner and you just felt the road more.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  And it's more pleasing, I think, overall. I mean, obviously, consumer money talks.
[11:50.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's more pleasing to have it abstracted, but in a way, as the driver, you're removed from the... just the feel of the road.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  Yeah. Did you show me that video? I don't know if I shared it with you.
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's like an old 1950s Buick crashing into, I don't know what, like a modern smart car or something?
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  No, I don't think so.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  And the Buick just gets destroyed.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  It was...
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  Like the little guy just... it's so much better engineered now.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's absolutely amazing the differences that they've made in the ability to...
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  Survive a crash.
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.000]  I forget what they call it. To keep the... to maintain the integrity of the passenger cabin and sacrifice the entire rest of the car.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  It's just unbelievable. Whereas in the old days, the whole car would just collapse like a can of Coke.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  Yeah.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  It really is.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  The engine block would be like going right into your chest.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  It's sickening too because you think like those old time cars, the old cars were so heavy that they would be safer.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  But they just weren't because the structure, you know, the structural integrity just wasn't there.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  But it really is like it's just stepping on an empty aluminum can. The whole thing just collapsed into itself.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  Well, you know, designed for different goals.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  The ATP guys are like shaking their fists at us now.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  Oh, I don't think so. I think Syracuse is probably happy about the old time Mac talk.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  Maybe.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  They had a good segment recently where they were talking, I guess because it was sort of...
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  One of the recent episodes was the... Hey, it's Apple's 40th anniversary. Let's look back at our first Macs.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  And I couldn't listen to Marco or Casey.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  No.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  That's awful.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  I honestly... I consider myself a Johnny Cam lately.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  You are.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  And I'm like 97.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  Because you're a graphics guy. Right.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Yeah.
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  So, you know, anything after that, I'm like, come on, kids, get your IP.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  No, that was one of those times where Syracuse, it was really...
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  You know, it just felt like he was creepily picking the thoughts out of my brain because it was...
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  He actually started using a Mac a few years before me, even though he's a few years younger than me.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Just because my school, my high school only had one Mac.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  Yeah.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  And the longer I went, I had like... It was almost like they had classes for just like two or three of us in programming.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  As like my last two years of high school, there weren't... It was only like two or three other kids in the class.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  And I wanted a color display, so I used the 2GS.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Oh.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  That...
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  I would have made that choice too.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Well, there was only one Mac and it was, you know, and I didn't want to...
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  You know, I guess I could have argued for equal time on it.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  It was a... I remember it was a class name named Elliot.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  But it was like, you know, we were trying to decide which one of us would maybe use the Mac and who, you know...
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  And then there were a bunch of 2GSs in the lab that, you know, we could choose from.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  I guess if neither of us wanted to use the Mac, we could have both used the 2GS.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  But he, you know, he seemed more interested in the Mac and I was fine to let him have it.
[14:49.000 --> 14:59.000]  I played with it a little and I remember playing with, especially with MacWrite and MacPaint, MacPaint in particular and MacDraw.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  But even back then with MacDraw, even in 1989 or 90, I was instantly baffled by Bezier curves.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  But if it... Oh yeah.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  I understood what it meant.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  I understood that it... what a vector graphic could offer and I was fascinated.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  But damned if I could navigate the interface.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  But MacPaint, man.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  Well, the control points are like voodoo.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  So I learned the Mac.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  And I say that knowing the math and how to do it, but it's still like... it's unintuitive, yeah.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  Yeah, it's very unintuitive.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  And everything I learned about the Mac was just completely intuitive.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  I remember too weird...
[15:36.000 --> 15:49.000]  I didn't like the Mac because... so I started on Apple II Plus, left the Apple II GS, then got into PCs.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  And for whatever reason, because I was a stubborn kid, I was like, I didn't like the Mac floppy disk.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  I just... it was like... because it had that latch, you know, like the three and a half inch floppy disk.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  And I just found it inelegant and I found that you... I liked the five and a quarter ones
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  because you could flip them over and use a hole punch and then you could get a whole second side.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  You could do that with the plastic ones too.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  But it was obviously harder to...
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  It was harder to make the hole, you know?
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Yeah.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  So it was dumb, but it was like a five year phase of my life.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  And I mean, I was getting into like hardcore Intel assembly programming and stuff at the time.
[16:27.000 --> 16:34.000]  But then I did a drafting class in high school because I liked drawing.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  Turns out, not the same thing.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  But one of the things we have to do is work on a Mac, in a Mac Draw.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  It changed my mind very soon after that.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  I mean, the software was brilliant. I loved it.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  It was such a new, different experience.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  It was so funny too. I know Casey even mentioned it because Casey's way too young.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  But he was baffled by the fact that the three and a half inch ones were still called floppies
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  even though there was nothing floppy about them because they were in a harder shell.
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  It's just one of those stupid names because what they did...
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  I think long story short, there used to be eight inch floppies really coming back.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  And that predates my time.
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  But then in the Apple II era, what most of us in the 80s knew were the five and a quarter inch.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  I bet your parents have a stack of five and a quarter inch floppies.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  Yeah, probably even five and a quarter inch floppies.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  No, because I didn't have a computer in the house.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Oh, really?
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Yeah, I've told this story before.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  My parents refused to buy me a computer.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.000]  This is why your career in technology went nowhere.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  A lot of my friends were getting computers.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  My friend Joey had an Apple IIe, which I deeply coveted.
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  From the early days on, I perceived that Apple's computers were of superior build quality
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  and were made with an eye to design that the others weren't.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  But I would have taken any of them. I would have taken a Commodore.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  I would have taken any or all of them.
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  But my friends were getting computers. They were all relatively expensive.
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  The Apple in particular. Some things don't change.
[18:11.000 --> 18:16.000]  But even a good Commodore 64 was...
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  They weren't cheap.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  They weren't cheap. And a lot of my friends had to push because their parents were like,
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's a lot of money.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  And you're not going to use it enough.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  You're just going to play games. We already have an Atari for games.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  My parents wouldn't buy me a computer because they said,
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  If we buy you a computer, we're worried that you're never going to leave the house.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  I don't know if it was the right parental decision or not.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  I can't quite say, even in hindsight, I can't quite say I agree with them.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  But maybe because I had a pretty good social life in high school.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  But maybe I wouldn't have had a computer at home.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  I think it's probably the right decision.
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  Because we're kind of similar. Not entirely.
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.000]  The first Apple II I got was the second summer after I moved from England here.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  So I didn't really know a lot of people in Canada.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  And I basically spent the entire summer inside programming.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  And that became part of my...
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  I don't know how to describe it. Like recharging.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  You know, when you need some alone time to go and do something just for yourself.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  And that lasted all during high school.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  Which is when I actually became good at what my trade is now.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  But yeah, there was a lot of time I just did not go outside.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  When I really should have.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  Like in the beautiful summer I'd be like, maybe I'll just try fixing this little bug.
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  In the summer between 10th and 11th grade, my high school shut down.
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  The building had needed a lot of repairs, especially the roof.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  And the school district had another building.
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  There was a middle school.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  And in the decades prior, the population of the school district decreased.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  Such that they closed the middle school.
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.000]  Put the 5th and 6th graders in the elementary school.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  And it went from 3 schools, elementary, middle and high school to just 2 buildings.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  An elementary school for 1 to 6.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  And a high school for 7 to 12.
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  And in between 10th and 11th grade, they shut down the high school.
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  And moved the high school to the middle school.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  Because it was cheaper to fix up the middle school.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Which had been dormant for like 4 or 5 years.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  And shut down the high school.
[20:36.000 --> 20:43.000]  So the computer teacher didn't trust the movers with the computers.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  And let students take the computers home for the summer.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  So I got to take an Apple 2GS home for the summer.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  Oh man, that's awesome.
[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  And I had a job.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  I actually, the school hired a bunch of kids to help move the school.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  So I was working as a mover.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  There's a couple good stories.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  That's pretty smart. Was that like a legit job?
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  Like they got paid minimum wage?
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  Oh yeah, minimum wage. Absolutely.
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  Well it could have been just playing fast and loose.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  I think it was either $3.75 an hour or $4.25 an hour.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  $4.25 an hour.
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  That would make sense.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  And backbreaking work.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  I remember moving the library.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  Oh my god.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  Because what is heavier than a box full of books?
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Very little is heavier than a box of books.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  And it's just thousands of books, tens of thousands of books.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Oh, it was awful.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  And we used to ride, it was like a two mile ride to go between the buildings.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  And we just had like this big flatbed open air truck.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  And we would just load it up with stuff and then find spots to sit.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Open air, no seatbelts or anything, just a bunch of kids on a truck.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  Oh man, I love that. How old school is that?
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  Let's hire some minimum wage kids and just throw them in the back of a truck along with some books.
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  They also did hire some adults, like day laborer types.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  I mean, people who just do moving, these are not highly skilled workers.
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  This is like the bottom of the skill chain in the laboring world.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  And I remember the one day when we were still moving the library, we had the card catalog.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  And so it was, you know, this predates computerization of the card catalog.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  It was just this, do you remember what they looked like?
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  They just are like little tiny drawers.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  They were like two hole punches on the bottom, like little cards that you pull out.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Yeah, and you'd pull it out and it was just filled with index cards.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  And the one guy, this guy, it wasn't a kid, it was an adult, he was like, what the hell is this?
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  And we were trying to explain to him that these are like an index of every single book in the library.
[22:57.000 --> 23:04.000]  And he just takes a few out while we're on the road going like 35 miles an hour and just throws them up in the air.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  I mean, I was an asshole as a teenager. I really was.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And I did a lot of shit that, in hindsight, I really feel like I need a good smacking.
[23:16.000 --> 23:23.000]  But I was appalled because I saw that as data loss.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  Some of the stuff I did, like vandalism or stuff like that, I wrote off just because it seemed ultimately harmless.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  Yeah, put a bit of graffiti on a political sign.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Right, right.
[23:34.000 --> 23:41.000]  But I mean, messing with books, that was never... burn a book.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  Right, right. I'll tell you what, the same summer, so the same summer when we're moving,
[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  the old high school had a central courtyard so that classes on the inside got sunlight too, right?
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  So in other words, it's sort of an O-shaped building. It was rectangular, but like a doughnut, three floors, central courtyard.
[24:00.000 --> 24:09.000]  And one of the classrooms on the third floor had like a janky old big-ass color TV, and it wasn't new at the time.
[24:09.000 --> 24:17.000]  And we dared each other to throw it out the window into the courtyard to see what kind of noise it would make.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  And ultimately, me and another guy took it, like neither of us would do it by ourselves,
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  and it was heavy enough that I don't know if I could have. It was really heavy.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  But me and another guy, I don't want to name him.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Just in case.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  I don't want to put his name on the right. I can afford it.
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  And another kid opened up the window, and we tossed this big-ass color TV out the window.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  And it made the greatest noise. Oh my God, it was worth it.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  So I did that, and I didn't feel the least bit guilty about it.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  And then there was a discussion. There was a meeting later about the TV. Did anybody know?
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  What happened to it?
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  Does anybody know about the TV in the courtyard? And nobody could remember anything about that.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  That's weird.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  But the tossing the cards out of the card catalog, though, to me, that was beyond the pale, because it's like data loss.
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the way you put it is just data loss.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  Have you seen that, I think on one of the BOS CDs that they shipped the OS on,
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  like one of the demo movies was them tossing monitors off the top of their office block?
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  No, I don't think so.
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  Like, it was exactly what you described. They just dragged a bunch of old monitors up, and they just threw them off the roof.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  Which maybe explains why they went out of business, but it was pretty funny.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  Ask Lisio about that. He probably has a link or something.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  All right, I'm going to see if I can Google it after the show.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  BOS developer tossing monitors off the roof.
[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  Yeah, so being a Letterman addict probably didn't help either, because tossing a TV off the high floor of a building is a very Letterman-like thing to do.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Yes.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  The difference is that if the Letterman show tossed a TV off the roof, they bought the TV.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  Yes, yeah. Controlled environment. There's no way anybody's going to get hit by that TV.
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  I did not buy the TV I threw out the window.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  But I had a job. It was a full-time job. We worked eight hours a day.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  I played tons and tons of basketball all summer long, filling in the gaps whenever it wasn't working.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then every other waiting moment was spent on the computer.
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  And I thought that the fact that I held a job and still played recreational basketball all the time,
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  and went to movies with friends on weekends and stuff like that,
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  seemed to me like I was able to have a computer.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  But my parents were like, see, this is why we can't buy you a computer.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  And doing all that other stuff, they somehow seemed to think that I was spending time.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Ah, you turned out okay.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  Oh, yeah, I don't know about that.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  Well, for the sake of this argument, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  The difference, though, I would say this, and I think that it was the fact that I just didn't,
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  like I said, I got to play with that one Mac in the lab enough that I saw what it was all about,
[27:15.000 --> 27:26.000]  and I saw the appeal, and I really saw the cleverness of having a system that was fundamentally a graphical user interface.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  But the idea of getting obsessed with user interface design just hadn't occurred to me yet.
[27:31.000 --> 27:43.000]  And the profoundness of the cleverness of the Mac's UI system, I needed to use it more to appreciate it.
[27:43.000 --> 27:51.000]  I don't think it had occurred to anybody yet, with the exception of the people that worked on the Lisa and then the Mac.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  It's one difference with Syracuse to me. It seems like, listening to his early history of computing,
[27:56.000 --> 28:06.000]  that he got that aspect of the Mac maybe instantly, but certainly with less exposure to it than I did.
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  I needed to own one, which I did when I got to college.
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  I had that Mac, like I said, the aforementioned four megabyte of RAM, 40 megabyte hard drive Mac LC.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  And then I really, really appreciated it.
[28:19.000 --> 28:27.000]  So I liked the Mac, like I said, in the drafting class. I was like, OK, I get it. This is something totally different.
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.000]  But I didn't really appreciate one until I bought one immediately after the next acquisition.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  And then I was stuck with OS 8 for a year.
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  And I felt immediately like, oh man, I'm stuck with this operating system that's not good.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  And then I learned all of the great things about it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  So yeah, I do consider myself a Johnny Gum lately.
[28:53.000 --> 29:02.000]  But what I mean by nobody had appreciated it, I don't think the people at Xerox PARC were necessarily thinking about design
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  the same way that Apple was when they went to actually try to implement first the Lisa and then the Mac.
[29:09.000 --> 29:16.000]  Yeah, it's hard to say without using this. I've never gotten the chance to use the Xerox Star.
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  But I've read enough about it and the work that Xerox did and seen it and kind of looked at it.
[29:21.000 --> 29:29.000]  Because I used to be a little bit more obsessed with the angle that Apple really didn't even do anything with the Mac.
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.000]  And they ripped off Xerox, which legally isn't true because they actually got Xerox in exchange for a bit of Apple stock.
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  It was totally on the up and up legally. They said, how about we give you a little bit of stock in the Apple computer and then let us...
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  Also, I just think that's a facile argument in general.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  Well, it's wrong...
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  It doesn't matter? Who cares?
[29:47.000 --> 29:56.000]  No, but at the time when there were more and more arguments between PC...
[29:56.000 --> 30:03.000]  Sure, at the time it was a point. But I mean, it's only a point if you're trying to make an appeal to authority argument.
[30:03.000 --> 30:10.000]  Right. And I never got too bogged down in... I mean, somebody might be able to dig up some old Usenet post that destroyed it.
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  Me too.
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  But I seem to recall that I always...
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  I was very anti-old school Mac guys for a while.
[30:15.000 --> 30:30.000]  I found it tiresome because I was 100% certain that I was on the right side. And it seemed to me like the people on the other side didn't really have anything to contribute anyway.
[30:30.000 --> 30:36.000]  So if they want to be wrong, they can be wrong. Like, it wasn't worth trying to convince them. What would be the point?
[30:36.000 --> 30:43.000]  If you can't see how superior this is, then forget about it. I mean, Syracuse mentioned it on those episodes.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  It's incredible how you've grown and you've edited towards that kind of thing.
[30:46.000 --> 30:53.000]  Right. Oh, yeah.
[30:53.000 --> 31:01.000]  One of the things that I thought was, to me... Do you remember when you... I don't know if you were too late. I mean, ResEdit was still a thing.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:03.000 --> 31:10.000]  ResEdit to me is maybe my favorite Mac program of that time.
[31:10.000 --> 31:19.000]  While being foreign to me, I love the idea of a resource fork. I love the idea of stuffing extra information in there.
[31:19.000 --> 31:30.000]  On the Windows side, they tried to do something similar. Like, the EXE format is a flat format, but you can have resources appended to it.
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  Right.
[31:31.000 --> 31:37.000]  But it's not the same thing as having an actual resource fork, which is good and bad.
[31:37.000 --> 31:54.000]  Good in that it's just one flat binary stream. Bad in that you don't have the nuance and expressiveness of a ResEdit or a multi-resource file.
[31:54.000 --> 32:07.000]  Well, and it did. The whole idea predated the era of universal... the Internet. It's the Internet that really solved the problem of every computing device.
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  I think the Internet turned everything into the lowest common denominator.
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  It did. That was...
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  The Unix binary stream thing.
[32:15.000 --> 32:16.000]  Right.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  It reset the clock in a lot of ways. In some ways negative, you know.
[32:20.000 --> 32:27.000]  Exactly. It's not to say that it meant the best thing won. It just meant, though, that there might be a good reason to go with the lowest common denominator.
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  Right.
[32:28.000 --> 32:31.000]  The solution of everything is just a single fork file.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  Yeah.
[32:32.000 --> 32:40.000]  I was coming from OS2 at the time, and even NT, which both had multiple resource file forks.
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  Right.
[32:41.000 --> 32:56.000]  Like, at that time, all of the file systems had followed what the Mac had done, which was like, okay, there's data in one segment, and then there's a bunch of other segments that have, you know, either metadata or, you know, what you guys call resource forks.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  The concept...
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.000]  Or extended attributes, which you still have to do the same.
[32:58.000 --> 33:16.000]  Conceptually, though, is what really... It's not even the technical details of whether it was a two-fork, multi-fork file system, or if they had done something more of a hack. Like, let's say it's... Or, you know, like, a lot like what we have on OS10 now, where your app is really just a folder that the binder treats as a file.
[33:16.000 --> 33:17.000]  Totally.
[33:17.000 --> 33:28.000]  Or, you know, just imagine if the original Mac had gone with the same thing, where it's a special magic kind of folder, and in the folder are all the resources, and every one of the resources is itself actually just a flat file.
[33:28.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's the conceptual design of having this one app that you could edit all that stuff with, all these different resources, so that even in the nerd mode of either being a developer or just being an enthusiast who wants to customize the icon for a file or an app or a folder, or any of the other many, many things you could edit and manipulate in ResEdit.
[33:56.000 --> 34:05.000]  The fact that even when you did those things, you were still within the same GUI universe, and you didn't have to resort to a command line or something.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Yeah, no, in some ways that's kind of like the Smalltalk, like living in an environment.
[34:09.000 --> 34:19.000]  Yes, I do think so. I think in a strange way, even though the Mac, the original Mac, I don't think you would say the technical way was all that influenced by Smalltalk.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  No, it's super different. But the concept is a little bit the same, right?
[34:22.000 --> 34:31.000]  Yes, that you stay completely committed to this limitation that you're self-imposing, and beauty will come out of it.
[34:31.000 --> 35:00.000]  Yeah, I think so. And, you know, it's funny, NeXT used to do that with apps that shipped even on OS X up until, oh, I'm going to make up a number, 10.2, 10.3? Most of the apps would ship with nibs, which were NeXT interface builder files, which you could open up in Interface Builder, which has since been merged into Xcode.
[35:00.000 --> 35:10.000]  And then edit the UI of the app. Like, if you didn't like the arrangement of dialog boxes, you could change it. Just like in ResEdit.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  Right.
[35:12.000 --> 35:23.000]  These days, they've moved away from that. They all get compiled down into stuff that you can't edit afterwards.
[35:23.000 --> 35:38.000]  From a software reliability point of view, I think that's probably a good idea. But I like that the old west style of stuff was common between both platforms.
[35:38.000 --> 35:55.000]  The classic Mac OS was, and I'm not saying that it should have, in hindsight, that it should have gone through to today. I mean, there's certainly some advantages to the Mac OS X philosophy of the design of the system.
[35:55.000 --> 36:05.000]  Where things started getting locked down, and some of the technical aspects of it were not as conceptually beautiful, but more practical.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  That's when I first kind of became familiar with Syracuse.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  Back then, it was mailing lists. And I would argue the future-looking pragmatism, and he would argue that, well, it just sucks.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  In terms of, let's say, window sizing. And like, well, look, it's all done on the GPU, and they're doing a bunch of stuff, and it's going to get better.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  And he'd be like, yeah, but it sucks. And he was right. He's right. I think I'm also right.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  There was a beauty to the original Mac OS, though, that hasn't been matched since.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  I totally agree with you.
[36:46.000 --> 36:54.000]  And I completely agree with John Siracusa that iOS is closer, much closer, than Mac OS X is to the...
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  The original iOS, yeah. I think now we're getting into more convoluted territory, where I'm not so sure.
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  Well, the big difference, and this never would have made sense in the era of the original Mac.
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.000]  I don't think it ever would have occurred to anybody, even Steve Jobs, to lock the system down and not even allow you to...
[37:17.000 --> 37:27.000]  ResEdit's a perfect comparison. There's never going to be a ResEdit for iOS that lets you dittle with the icons for apps or other resources in it.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  Because there's another aspect of iOS that that would be philosophically opposed to.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  There's a sort of, do not allow you to shoot your...
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  Part of the design of iOS is to design a system that prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot.
[37:42.000 --> 37:53.000]  Even if you've got a real itchy case of athlete's foot and you just want to shoot yourself in the foot, you can't do it in iOS by itself.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  That just never would have occurred to anybody in the Mac OS era.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  I don't think the fact that... I mean, it wasn't like the machine shipped with ResEdit.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  You had to put it on your machine.
[38:04.000 --> 38:13.000]  But not even allowing you to do ResEdit or having a ResEdit that wasn't allowed to edit certain system files or something like that.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  It just didn't make sense.
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.000]  Some of the hacks we would do, we would go right into... Remember, there was the system suitcase.
[38:20.000 --> 38:30.000]  One of the things that I say made the original Mac so beautiful is that the entire file system was...
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  There was no crap. There was like... Or as years went on, very, very little crap.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  It was just a folder that said system folder and inside was a suitcase file called system.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And that had all the resources for the system itself.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  And they were all neatly organized. There were no hidden folders or anything like that.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  The only hidden folder I can remember would be the desktop folder that had the root level of the hard drive.
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  There was an invisible folder called the desktop folder, which was the actual location in the file system where everything you put on your desktop was.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  Notably under the root of the disk, not under the user.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  Because there was no user.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  Right. Well, this is why things got a little bit interesting when it was Tan came along, right?
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Things got a little bit freaky.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  Right.
[39:19.000 --> 39:27.000]  And that's why we started... I don't remember if it was a beta that actually hid anything outside of user.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  Oh, man. I think that they're wireless.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  Might have been floated, but...
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  They went back and forth on a lot of those things.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  Yeah.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  Let me take a break while we're...
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Yeah, you think so?
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Thank our first sponsor.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  41 minutes in and we haven't even done a show yet.

[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  Because guess what? Podcasts... anybody who's listening to me talk about Audible right now.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  You are somebody who enjoys listening to people talk to audio, spoken audio content.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  I don't know how you're listening to me. You're using, you know, your phone.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  If you're using your desktop, got headphones on, you're pumping it through your car speakers.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  But whoever you are and whatever you're doing, you like listening to spoken word audio content.
[40:47.000 --> 40:54.000]  So Audible with over 180,000 of these things is something you ought to look at.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  You have to fill up the remaining time that you have to listen to stuff.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  I mean, don't stop listening to the talk show.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  But, you know, if you've got free time where you wish that there was more stuff to listen to,
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  Audible's the one place that has more stuff than you'll ever be able to listen to.

[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  Because Audible offers their great listen guarantee.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  If you start an audiobook and you don't like it, it bores the hell out of you or whatever.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  If it's not what you thought it was going to be, you can exchange it for free for another one.
[41:35.000 --> 41:43.000]  Cannot be better. People who listen to a lot of audio content, this is the place to go to soak up more of it than you'll ever get.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  So go to audible.com slash talk show and get your 30-day free trial.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  Thank you to Audible for sponsoring the talk show.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  I didn't even have this in the notes.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  I always prepare very copious and well-organized notes for the show.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  And I did not have a trip down memory lane.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  Here's how much I like the Mac. I liked the Mac so much when I was a freshman in college and finally owned one and had it.
[42:05.000 --> 42:15.000]  I spent my entire freshman year, all of my free time, either playing games or hacking or diddling with the system resources in ResEdit.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  And didn't go out drinking or anything like that.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  While I did recreation, I continued to play basketball. I played basketball and then I sat in my dorm room staring at my Mac LC.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  Just staring at it.
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.000]  And we didn't have a network at the time. There was no internet in the dorms at Drexel University at the time.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  You know what?
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  And modems were so expensive. They were preposterously expensive.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  They were like not a joke.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  They were preposterously expensive.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  What, 91? 90?
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  Yeah, 91 to 92.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yeah.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  I've told this story before, too. We wired up the dorm room, Calhoun Hall at Drexel, with PhoneNet.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  I forget what they were called, but they were these little, and they were, these were pretty cheap.
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  You could get them, you order them out of the back of Mac World Magazine or Mac User.
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  You mail order these things, get them, get yours from Mac Connection.
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.000]  It was about 15 bucks and you'd get a little, about the size of a mouse, maybe even probably smaller than the mouse of the day.
[43:12.000 --> 43:20.000]  And it would plug into the serial port of your Mac, and then it was a phone connector on the other side, on the box.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  And so then you could use phone cable, just regular old telephone cable, to create a local talk network.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  Oh, man. Macs are good at that.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  So then you're playing video games again.
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.000]  Right. Specter was the name of the, it was like a first person shoot, like a vector based, you know, pseudo vector based tank game.
[43:38.000 --> 43:49.000]  And we wired up the whole floor. And we figured out, you know, and then we figured out that, you know, this is like the first time I learned how, you know, some electrical stuff work.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  That there's nothing really magical about phone cable. It's just copper. That's all it is.
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.000]  There's no, it's just copper and, you know, electrons move on it. There's, you know, and the colors are just to match up.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  There's nothing different about them.
[44:03.000 --> 44:20.000]  So, yeah, we figured out we could, we just ran speaker wire through the drop ceiling all around the, the, I forget what floor I was on the eighth floor, seventh floor of Calhoun Hall, and then just ran phone wire between anybody who wanted to get on the network or not.
[44:20.000 --> 44:28.000]  You know, and you don't have to do any soldering or any just, you know, connect the, just make sure the cable and then just electrical tape it up.
[44:28.000 --> 44:35.000]  So we had the whole floor wired up. Networking. There was a chat app. Oh, my God. It was like the first time I ever had, I forget what it was called.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  Boy, somebody out there will remember it.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  But it wasn't the hot wire, was it?
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  No, it was way before that.
[44:45.000 --> 44:50.000]  But you, I guess you'd have to know, you didn't have a user ID. You have a Mac name, though.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  So your Mac would have a name on the local top network. So that's how you, you know, that was like your ID.
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.000]  So, but you could like effectively just send DMs to each other, which was amazing.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  Of course, everybody does this all the time now, but it was like my introduction to text.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  Yeah, I know. Yeah, that is really cool.
[45:05.000 --> 45:13.000]  And it was all through a proper Mac interface. There was no, it wasn't like you had to go to a terminal type application or anything like that. It was great.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  And then we found out the kids on the floor above us had done the same thing.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  So did you bridge them? Did you create?
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  Yeah, there was a lot of trash.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  Let's call it an internet.
[45:22.000 --> 45:30.000]  Well, there was a lot of trash talking about who's better at Spectre. And so we ran some wire outside my room up to the one.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  Physically created an internet.
[45:32.000 --> 45:41.000]  Yeah. And then one day the guy, I forget his title, but whoever it was, he was the guy who was in charge of that dorm. You know, like.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  I forget his title, but the guy that was in charge of that dorm.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  But there was, he had like a name.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  That sounds like an 80s villain.
[45:48.000 --> 45:56.000]  Yeah, well, he was a nice guy. I have to say he was, it was a very 80s movie situation where I got a knock on the door and was told to come down and meet him.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  And it was me and the guy above me who's thing.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  He said smoking jacket was like one of those candy with those candy cigarettes.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  The dorm faced south, or at least my side of the dorm faced south.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  And so it caught the afternoon sunlight. The afternoon sunlight came into our dorm room.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  He said he was coming up the street yesterday and noticed a very bright.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  This is where we where we screwed up is that we just use speaker wire instead of we didn't really try to disguise it.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  And that the copper of the speaker wire really it was bright. It like blinded him.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  And he saw like a very bright line between our dorm rooms.
[46:32.000 --> 46:39.000]  And when he got closer and figured out what it was, you know, that this is a fire hazard and we've got to take this down immediately.
[46:39.000 --> 46:47.000]  And he obviously and I tried to explain to him that I think I think I'm correct that it was not a fire hazard.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  I don't think there's enough voltage.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  Right. There's not enough voltage. You know, it's not a fire hazard.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  Also, not a dumb suggestion.
[46:56.000 --> 47:03.000]  No, not a dumb suggestion. And I could totally see why as someone with a job that, you know, needed to deal with this.
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  So we said, Oh, yeah, we'll get right on it. We'll take it right down.
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  And all we did was take down the bridge between the two floors, of course.
[47:10.000 --> 47:17.000]  And hope that he didn't make any kind of spot inspection because it also seemed clear he had no idea.
[47:17.000 --> 47:25.000]  He I think he because he saw it, he thought it was a connection between my room and the kid above his room, not a connection between like 30 dorm rooms.
[47:25.000 --> 47:33.000]  Right. Those were the days.
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  Can't compete with that. Maybe could have used it like a shielded wire a little bit more.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[47:43.000 --> 47:50.000]  You know, money was money was a problem, though. I mean, this was a network that we, you know, other than everybody had a $15 box to buy themselves.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  And I would say the rest of it cost us about $10.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  Yeah, wherever, wherever we went to buy speaker wire in bulk and electrical tape.
[48:00.000 --> 48:12.000]  I like that you stepped up from just using the, like, sort of the 10 that you can get from like gum wrappers, burning off the paper side and using the 10 and just kind of wrapping it together.
[48:12.000 --> 48:22.000]  I'm trying to Google the name of this app and I cannot find it. I don't know how to because it's because it was something that was only of use in the maybe late 80s, very late 80s and early 90s.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  It all predates the internet and predates Google. So it's like impossible.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  You know what?
[48:29.000 --> 48:39.000]  You used to go to I would I would think about like old school Unix names. Yeah, no, it wasn't a Unix name. It was a total Mac thing. It was a pure support, but like, like a riff on it.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Yeah.
[48:41.000 --> 48:51.000]  It was like wasn't wasn't talk like something you could do local talk, but it but the No, yeah, local talk was the protocol, but talk on Unix.
[48:51.000 --> 49:05.000]  Yeah, I remember talk and there was like variants of it like and talk and yeah, talk. Amy and I used to use that extensively because it's an entirely retro episode of the show.
[49:05.000 --> 49:14.000]  So Amy was in Pittsburgh and I was in Philadelphia. And even though it's still the state of Pennsylvania, it was still this is how ancient the early 90s were.
[49:14.000 --> 49:26.000]  The long distance phone calls were still a thing. So we used to write just by talking a few minutes a week, we'd rack up $100 a month phone bill, which was massive college student.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  So there was no way to cost effectively speak on the phone from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.
[49:33.000 --> 49:45.000]  And then we just, you know, we got email and we'd email each other. And then when we discovered, like talk and then talk, but we had to use them like she had to use it from
[49:45.000 --> 49:54.000]  like a lab at Pitt at University of Pittsburgh. She didn't have a computer in her dorm. And eventually I think I got a modem soon enough. But I think when we first started doing it, I might have had to go to the lab too.
[49:54.000 --> 50:10.000]  So we'd have to like schedule a time because you wouldn't be able to get in touch. You know, like the whole idea of how do you start texting with somebody is a totally different problem when you don't have the phone with you at all times.
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.000]  Yeah, there's no better sexy talk than scheduled time in the lab.
[50:16.000 --> 50:24.000]  Yeah, but it worked. It was amazing. You could see what each other was typing at the same time too, at least with one of them. The one we liked the best.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  Oh, like character by character? With the deletes? Yeah, I kind of missed that.
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.000]  And you could make jokes with it. You know, it was good. It was a good way to like make jokes where you type something and then delete, delete, delete.
[50:34.000 --> 50:42.000]  Yeah, I'm of two minds to that. I'm kind of glad that people don't get to see what I was about to say. But I remember those apps when it was like...
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  You had to be careful. Yeah.
[50:46.000 --> 50:57.000]  I'd like a three digit ICQ code at one point, which I never used. Do you remember ICQ at all?
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  Yeah, I never really used it though.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Really? Well, mostly PC thing.
[51:02.000 --> 51:17.000]  Yeah. And I remember not getting... it was like a real eye-opener to me where I heard of it and I saw it and I don't think I ever signed up for it. But it was like six months after I became aware of it when I realized that the name was a pun.
[51:17.000 --> 51:30.000]  Because I also remember IRC. And you know, IRC was just Internet Relay Chat. And I did use that, of course. And then I thought ICQ was just the same thing where it had meant something and I didn't realize that it was ICQ.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Yeah, it's got a cute name.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  Which explains why I had no interest in using it.
[51:36.000 --> 51:44.000]  Well, I also at the time did not have any interest in talking to people that weren't in front of me.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  Which has changed as I have become employed.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  Are you still looking?
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  I am. I'm tweeting. I'm going to tweet here. This is a live... this is a tweet live during the function.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  A live tweet.
[51:56.000 --> 52:04.000]  Anyone remember the name of the early 90s chooser extension for instant messaging on local talk? Let's see if Twitter can...
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  Let's see if Twitter can...
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  Can save the day?
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  Yeah.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  Yeah.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Fill in the role of the live audience.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Right.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  I just want to say we actually had a plan. Like I have an online document here.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Let's get into it.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  And you know what? The first one was Prince.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Right. We did that.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  And we're still doing that.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  Well, what was next on your OmniOutliner? Was it the Ben Thompson Apple...
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  Yeah, the Apple services stuff.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  Right. So, Ben Thompson...
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  And I don't want to drag you back to this because I love the tripped on...
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  No. No. We've filled it up. I'll just wait until my Twitter replies have that.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll get back to that.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  So, how would you summarize Ben Thompson? Ben Thompson had a great piece on...
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  Ben Thompson as a person?
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  No, no, no. The Ben Thompson.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  I don't like that guy.
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  Yeah, he's difficult.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Hi, kid. Hi, kid.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  He had a good piece. His weekly free...
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  He may take that to heart.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  His weekly free for everyone Stratechery column this week was...
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  I thought really... I mean, it's always good, but I thought this one was particularly good.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  Yeah.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  More or less arguing that...
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  All right. One of the things that makes Apple very unique,
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  I'm going to try to summarize this very quickly,
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  is that Apple doesn't have product divisions.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  There's no Mac division.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  The logical way for a company that sells what Apple sells
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  would be to have a Mac division, an iPhone division,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  probably a separate iPad division.
[53:32.000 --> 53:39.000]  Although, you could argue whether the iPad would be in the iPhone division.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  A new watch division, etc.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  And they don't.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  TV or accessories.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  Accessories division with TV being the thing.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  And they don't. That's not how the company's been set up.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  That's the first thing, and probably the most important thing,
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  that Steve Jobs did when he came back in 1997,
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  was dismantle that sort of thinking,
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  and put in what is best called...
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  I mean, this is the part where Ben can smart talk us,
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  because he actually knows the business school terminology.
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.000]  Yeah.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  I love when you ask me to talk about this.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  I'm like, seriously?
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  I'm the dummy on it.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  I'm a pretty technical guy, but this side of...
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  Anyway, he calls it functional versus divisional.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  You just described divisional.
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  Apple works as a functional structure.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  And, you know, there have been exceptions.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  The iPod division was sort of an exception to this.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  But they got rid of that.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  Well, wait. Let's define why.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  The iPod division was separate from that,
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  because it had its own OS and its own manufacturing.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  Manufacturing thrust.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Yeah. It made sense for it.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  And I think it sort of evolved naturally,
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  and it wasn't really seen as an exception,
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  but simply that it just made sense,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  especially in the early years.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  Yeah.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  And I don't think it's overstating it,
[55:04.000 --> 55:11.000]  that the decision to go with a stripped-down version of OS X
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  as the OS for the original iPhone,
[55:15.000 --> 55:23.000]  instead of a muscled-up version of the iPod OS,
[55:23.000 --> 55:31.000]  or some other new OS in the mindset of the iPod OS.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  And in personal terms...
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  PIXO.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  Right. Right. Exactly.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  What was it called?
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  PIXO.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  PIXO?
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  P-I-X.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  It was either P-I-X-O or P-I-X-I-O.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  I forget.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  Yeah. I think it was P-I-X-O.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  But, yeah, it was an embedded operating system,
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  you know, for...
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  PIXO.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  That they licensed and heavily modified.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  PIXO.
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  Right.
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  I think I'm being fair in describing that as a...
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  and including all of the early iPods
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  as ever more computer-like electronic gadgets.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  And then the other mindset is...
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  and the industry just had to wait
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  until computers got small enough and cheap enough
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  and ran with low enough energy
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  to make ever more gadget-like computers.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Right?
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  The iPhone is a gadget-like Unix computer.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  I mean, it really is.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  It's a much better Unix computer
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  than most of the servers of the earlier part of our lives.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I mean, going back to what we were talking about previously,
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  when OS X first became a thing,
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  people were all worried about, like,
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  well, Unix writes out these massive log files every night at midnight.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Right.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  You can't do that on a PC.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  You know, a few years later,
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  it's appropriate to be using on a phone
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  because of a lot of the work that went into OS X
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  and sort of taming Unix back to be,
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  I guess, more focused or, you know, back to the roots.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  I remember at the Macworld
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  where the original iPhone was introduced.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  It was Macworld Expo January 2007,
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  and it's the biggest sensation of all sensations.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  We don't have to go into that.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  But then there was, you know, the trade show was there afterwards,
[57:21.000 --> 57:29.000]  and I think I was doing a live episode of the talk show.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  I did it with Cable Sasser.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Dan Benjamin wasn't there, and so...
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Was Craig there too, or was it just Cable?
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  I think it was just Cable that time.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  Yeah, because you were in this glass booth, right?
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  No, it was a different one.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  We weren't in a glass booth,
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  and we had an audience of people.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  It might have been after that one
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  where we did it in the glass booth,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  which was weird.
[57:57.000 --> 57:58.000]  But we're out on the open show floor.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  The acoustics are terrible.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  I don't know where the audio is,
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  but we obviously knew what we wanted to talk about.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  It just means Cable Sasser talking about this amazing iPhone.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  And I just remember Cable came up,
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  and we had, I don't know, 50, 100 people in front of us,
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  and Cable said,
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  How many of you guys are thinking you're going to buy one right away?
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  And everybody's hand just shot up.
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.000]  Like, just shot up.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  I've never seen any product
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  where every single person just needed to have one right away.
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  It was amazing.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  But anyway...
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  Wait, just a small interjection.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  Okay.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  I couldn't buy one in Canada.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  I was there.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  I saw one.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  I bought it.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  All I could do, and I've told the story before,
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  but all I could do for like a long time
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  was slide to unlock to call 911.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  That was it.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  I spent a bunch of money on something so incredible.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Oh, but you could use it as an iPod Touch.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  And the only thing I could do
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  would be to call the police to arrest me
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  for abusing a feature on my new phone.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  And you could use it on Wi-Fi.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  Not until after jailbreak.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  Oh, that's right, because...
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  I couldn't even jailbreak it at the time.
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  I'm telling you, all I could do was slide that thing.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  I totally forgot about that,
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  that you had to unlock the carrier unlock it.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  You had to get it unlocked by AT&T
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  before it would even work as an iPod Touch.
[59:22.000 --> 59:23.000]  That's right.
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  So I finally...
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  Slide to unlock.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  I would have bought one too.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  I would have done the same thing.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  It was like me buying the Mac
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  as soon as Jobs returned to the company,
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.000]  or like Next got bought.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  I was like, okay, I'm in.
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  Let's see what you got.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  So after the podcast,
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  there was a friend at Apple who I'd known for a while.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  Still there, so I can't say who,
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.000]  but somebody...
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  And I knew that they had...
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  He had disappeared for a while,
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.000]  and just disappeared in terms of...
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  He was obviously working on something
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  that was all-consuming.
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  And it turned out he was working on the first version.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  It wasn't even called iOS yet.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  And even then, even though he could reveal that,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  yes, this is what I've been working on.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  He's an Apple person.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  He still can't, even off the record in private,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  just commiserating after the show.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  It wasn't miked or anything.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  But I had questions,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  and Apple friends always let you ask questions.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  They just sometimes don't answer them.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  You just have to get used to that.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  And I asked him,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  I was like,
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  okay, so if it's running even the most stripped-down version
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  of OS X conceivable,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  just really, really lighter weight
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  and really take a hatchet to all sorts of stuff
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  that the daemons and processors that run in the background.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  I was like,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  that is going to take forever to turn on
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  compared to an iPod or a regular cell phone.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  And he just looked at me and smiled,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  and he just said,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  yes, as though, yes, there's no way to avoid that,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  but what if you don't have to turn it off all the time?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  And I was like,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  oh, and I realized,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  oh, that is interesting.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  And that whole story was inspired by the way
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  that most Unix machines were configured
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  that at the turn of midnight
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  just start doing a spew,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  a whole bunch of automated system cleanup and log files
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  and all this stuff and rotate and do all this crazy stuff.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  And just because all the Unix machines we knew to date did that
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  doesn't mean that a one that was built for consumers
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  would have to do that too.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  It's like you just step away
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  and realize that that is a terrible assumption to make.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Right.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  And I always took that one step further in that
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  A, they didn't give you swap space.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Right.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  And just to explain that,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  if you use more memory than is available to you,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  typical Unix systems will try to make it available to you
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  by granting you disk space to swap out portions
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  of whatever you're working on.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Instead, it would tell you,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  you're getting very close to the limit here,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  and then there wasn't even three strikes.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Right.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  The second strike was like,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  okay, you're dead.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Right.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  I'll just kill you.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Your app will go away.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And that brought a new discipline to writing applications
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  that was foreign to the Unix world
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  where you presumed that you had,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  if not complete control,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  at least you could marshal the system
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  into doing exactly what you wanted.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Right, especially once we got to the point
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  where disk space was,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  if not infinite,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  was at least compared to RAM infinite.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Once we started measuring hard disks
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  in hundreds of gigabytes at least,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  maybe even the early,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  maybe even like 40, 80 gigabyte sizes.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Compared to RAM, that's just humongous.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  And therefore, Unix's game of
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  we'll just pretend RAM is infinite
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  and write out what you're using to disk
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and move from disk back into actual RAM,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  what we need on the fly, could work.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  But that's exactly why, in layman's terms,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  and this just doesn't happen anymore
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  if you have SSDs,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  and it probably doesn't happen anymore
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  just because most of us don't need swap,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  or at least don't need much.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  But in the days of spinning hard drives
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  and low amounts of RAM,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  when your system started to slow down
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  and you'd hear your hard drive
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  or feel it going all the time,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  that's exactly why,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  because it was constantly shuffling back and forth.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Like it was a visual thing.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  I'm kind of glad we did that memory lane thing
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  at the top of the show,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  because it gives a lot more context
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  to this kind of stuff.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Well, the other philosophical aspect
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  of traditional Unix
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  is that a process that starts running
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  will run until the process itself decides,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  okay, I'm done, and now I'm leaving.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And you could have bugs
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  that would crash the thing.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  You, as a user,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  could take personal interaction
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  and kill the process manually,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  like force quit it.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  But the system itself would do whatever it takes
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  to make sure that bugs aside
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  and user action aside,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  you will run forever
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  if you want to run forever.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And iOS, like you said,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  said you need to be ready to die
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  in a moment's notice.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Right.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Traditional Unix operating systems
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  bend over backwards
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  in service of the applications
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  that they're running.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  If you have any data that...
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  iOS bends over backwards for the user.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Right.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  And for the interactions...
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  The interactions, yeah.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  And so the idea as a proper iOS developer
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  is if you have any data
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  that needs to be saved,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  you need to save it constantly
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  and at all times.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  At any time it changes, save it.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Any time it changes, save it automatically.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Because you might be killed
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  in any moment,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  and that's fair game.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  You may be killed,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  and then the user may come back to your app,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  and you're expected to be in the same spot.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  To pretend like nothing had happened.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Yeah, I mean the home button
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  used to just kill you.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Yeah, every time, automatically.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  As soon as they hit the home button,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  whatever was running was...
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  And I love that discipline.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  I really do.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Like in the time...
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  A little bit of hardcore.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  In the time it took for the animation
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  to go back to the home screen,
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  you were expected to be
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  completely cleaned up.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  Yeah, you were...
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Cut the boot.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  But so anyway,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  that decision, that fateful decision
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  to go the cut-down version of OS X root,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  effectively squeezed Tony Fidel
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  out the door
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  and sort of brought an end
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  to that functional arrangement.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  And then in 2011...
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  No, that would be a divisional arrangement.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  Yeah, the divisional arrangement.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  And then, you're correct.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  And then in 2011,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  with the Scott Forstall ouster,
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  it really ended it.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  Because effectively,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  I think it's fair to say
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  that Scott Forstall
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  ran an iOS division within Apple.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  Maybe that's a little too glib,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  but it's, you know...
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Forstall...
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  Yeah, I don't know how to...
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Maybe.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  You know, and there were obviously
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  some parts that were shared between OSs,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  but they tended to filter back and forth
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  years later, right?
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Like, and there was even an event
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  the one time where they made that
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  the theme of the event.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  It was called, like,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  the Back to the Mac.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Back to the Mac.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Back to the Mac, yeah.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  And it was...
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Look, we created a bunch of these
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  cool technologies for iOS
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  in the last few years,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  and it actually...
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  These things would make sense on OS X,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  and so we've taken them back to the Mac.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  As opposed to today's,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  I would say,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  extremely functionally aligned Apple,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  where Craig Federighi's team...
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  In charge of software.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000] ...is in charge of software.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  And yes, there's some divisions,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  and it seems like the WatchOS team
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  is sort of off on its own,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  but I don't think in a contentious way.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  It's just in a,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  they have to put their heads down.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  No, I don't think it's contentious.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  I just think it's early days.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Right.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  I think it makes sense for early days
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  that you sort of get to go off.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  I think you could probably say
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  that Apple TV is kind of in the same boat,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  but Apple TV is, I believe,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  under Eddy's cue.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Yeah, I think so,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  but I'm not entirely sure.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  I'm pretty sure.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Yeah, I'll bet you're right.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  And so, Ben Thompson's argument
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  is that this works great for devices.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Apple has proven that it works great,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  and it explains Apple's...
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Anything can end,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  because it all depends on actual execution.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  They have to.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  It's easy so long as you keep making great products,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  and that's actually a very...
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  The keep making great products
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  is difficult in and of itself,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  but if you do,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  it's easy to keep them popular
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  and to keep the integration between things
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  that makes Apple stuff so famously fun and easy
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  and attractive to use.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Yeah, and in some ways,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  I do think that it's folly
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  to associate the success of one company
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  with the prominence of one kind of model.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  Like, you don't...
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  Whether one company succeeds or fails
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  has a lot more to do with other factors
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  other than their particular model.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  And I don't think you can look at any functional company
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  and be like,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Well, they're bound to be like Apple,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  because that's not the truth.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  Similarly, I don't think you can say that any company
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  that follows a division organizational pattern
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  is going to become like DuPont,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  which is his example.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Right.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Right, Ben's example is that...
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  Excuse me.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  I think it's pretty interesting.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  It's to compare Apple today to DuPont
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  from like 100 years ago.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  Well, and that effectively...
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  DuPont became huge by doing one thing,
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  which was making gunpowder.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And then...
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Turns out in multiple one, that was popular.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And then post-war,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  they realized that gunpowder was at a technical level
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  very similar to making paint,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  and a lot of stuff needed to be repainted
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  because of World War I.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  And so they decided...
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  What seemed like a natural area of growth
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  for the DuPont company was to expand into making paint.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  And yet somehow they ended up losing tons of money
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  on the paint business because of...
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Even though it was similar to manufacture,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  the market was entirely different.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Right.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  So selling gunpowder, they would sell to massive buyers.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Like...
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Well, I mean, obviously the military.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Yeah, effectively, I think mostly military.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Buy a lot of bullets, you know.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  Selling paint, you'd be selling to Ma and Pa
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  that are trying to like paint their house
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  or their small business kind of thing.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  Very different.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Very different marketing, very different packaging,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  very different distribution schemes.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Right.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And they ended up having to switch.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  And so they switched to a divisional...
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  Divisional.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Right.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  So there's a paint division and a gunpowder division,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  and it worked out.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  And then that became the model for big corporations ever since.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  And now Apple is seen as the exception
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  as opposed to a hundred years ago
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  where Apple's functional arrangement
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  would have seemed more natural.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  So the question is,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  should Apple services be split out into divisional?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  This is where...
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  The whole point of Ben's thing is that
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  this works great for Apple with devices.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  It is not working out well for them with services.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  And Apple themselves,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  their executives on the quarterly call
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  like three months ago,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  emphasized their efforts into services.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  And Ben's argument is that
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  they should split services out into a separate division,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  even account, you know,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  even do a separate profit and loss for that division.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Not even.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  I think...
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Well, he equivalates on that a little bit,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  but...
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  Equivocates, I should say.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  But separate profit and loss would allow them to track
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  the progress of the services division
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  separately from the product division.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  I can see...
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  I'm not entirely convinced that he's right,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  but I can definitely see...
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  Me neither.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  I see that he might be.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And the difference is that I think,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  and I think, you know, I think he makes this point too,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  but that the traditional divisional nature
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  is what creates intercompany political conflict
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  that blocks...
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  It often leads to this is why a company
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  never tends to disrupt itself.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  That if Apple had a culture like that,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  then the iPhone,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  they never would have even debated
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  whether it was the iPod division that would make the iPhone,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  because of course they did,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  because the iPod was the new hot thing at Apple at the time.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And then the iPod division might have made,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  designed an iPhone that was designed to make sure
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  that it didn't keep people from wanting to still buy an iPod.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  And just go forward a little bit more.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Then if there was an iPhone division
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  and Steve Jobs wanted to make a tablet,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  they would have been political, you know,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  resistance within the company of,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  but what if these tablets make people
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  not buy as many iPhones and so on and so forth?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Or the Mac division in particular would say,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  no way, what if, you know,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  the MacBooks are the heart and soul
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  and the only part of our business that's growing.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  And clearly this tablet,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  which you guys even want to even make a keyboard for,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  is something that's going to...
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  How could it not?
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  How could every one of these that you sell
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  for only $750 not mean that someone's less likely
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  to buy one of our things for $1,500?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  Right.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  Well, I mean, just look at the new smaller iPad Pro
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  with just, whatever, a couple of days ago updated MacBook.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Right.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  I don't know.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  They very much seem to be in the same spectrum to me.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  Well, without question.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  I mean, it's, you know, and it's which one you prefer,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  but it's in a divisional...
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  And I, you know, I know enough about Apple,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  and I have enough friends who work there,
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  and you do too,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  that I'm not arguing that Apple is a company
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  without internal politics
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  and without grumbling between people who work on this
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  and people who work on that.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  Or people who, even if what they're working on
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  isn't even in conflict with each other,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  but a lot of times the most astute critics
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  of things within Apple that are subpar
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  are other people at Apple who work on something else,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  who the whole reason they work at Apple
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  and have a career at Apple
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  is they tend to be very talented people
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  with very high standards for how stuff works,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  that they get the Apple way.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  I'd even remove the proviso
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  that they work on something else.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Yeah, sometimes...
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  I honestly think people that work at Apple
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  are their own worst critics.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  That's a fantastic point.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  That is very true.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Which is honestly kind of what makes them
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  a great company.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Right.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  That's kind of the key.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  Right.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And that sometimes when you talk to people at Apple,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  the people who I think are the best
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  and the people who I'm like,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  Oh, of course you're successful at Apple,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  are the people who...
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  You're exactly right.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  They are the ones who know all the things
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  that suck about the thing that they work on.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  And you say like,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Hey, the new body color is really great.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And they'll be like,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Thanks, but...
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  I mean, come on.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And then they know everything that's wrong with it.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  And it's like,
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Oh yeah, of course you work at Apple.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  And the people who want to brag
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  about the stuff that they work on,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  you're like,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  You're not going to last long.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Yeah.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I mean, you and I,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  I think we were probably there together,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  but talking to people who worked on early iPhones
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  and telling them how awesome the touch interaction is.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  And then they're like,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Oh my God, I can get it to go.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  Look, if I do this and this,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  it's way below 60 frames per second.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Like they knew all the paths to get to,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  to do something that would make scrolling
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  or whatever drop beneath 60 frames per second.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  And they're like,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  This is dog shit.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And you're like,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  You just built the most amazing...
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  By the time it ships,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  they're onto the next thing, right?
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Right, exactly.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  But that's exactly why they keep getting better year over year,
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  is that they're disgusted by the...
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  It's just as a,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  I don't know,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  as a broader metaphor.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Did you cook ever?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Sometimes I cook a few things.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  Okay, so you know when you cook
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  and then you like,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Okay, whatever that burger didn't turn out as well.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  I hope Amy doesn't listen to this show.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  Okay, sorry.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  But whatever,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  when you cook something
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  and then you're eating it
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  and you're always,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  for me at least,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  I'm the harshest critic.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I'm like,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Oh, it didn't work out so well.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Oh, I could have left this a little bit more.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  These could be a little bit more tender.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  And everybody else is like,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  Would you shut up and stop being a dick?
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Because I'm trying to enjoy the meal.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  And I'm always like,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Yeah, maybe next time I'll do this.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  And that's just because that's the way your mind works.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  And I think at Apple with software or hardware,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  I think that's what you're thinking.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  It's like,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  Okay, that came out of the oven pretty good.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  I'm happy.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Glad that shipped.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Now,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  you know,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  how do I improve on that?
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  That's absolute.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  I mean,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Amy does most of the cooking here,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  and that's absolutely how she is.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  She's way,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  she's her own harshest critic.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  No,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  and it just shows you if you're a good person,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  a good worker who's focused on improving the product,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  that's the way your mindset has to be.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  And if you're a sort of self-centered person
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  who's more worried about your own career
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  or just the way other people perceive you
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  because you have an inferiority complex or something like that,
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  then you're going to want to make people think that
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  whatever you've done is awesome and perfect
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  and laugh at the competition and stuff like that.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  You can still laugh at the competition.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  Well, yeah.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  Sometimes they suck.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  But you know what I mean.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  I do totally know what you mean.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  Yeah,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  there's a difference between laughing at them and discounting them.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  Yeah,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  you still,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  I still sometimes meet people at Apple who,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  and I'm exaggerating,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  but in some degree seem to buy into the
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  we're Apple,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  whatever we do is going to be the best,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  you know,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  sort of thinking that the exceptionalism of Apple is just,
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  that's just the rules of the game are whatever Apple makes is excellent
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  just because it's Apple.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  No,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  that's not by fear.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  That's by a hard fucking word.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  And I'm exaggerating that,
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  you know,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  putting it in words like that.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  But there's a certain mindset that you buy into that even a little bit,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  and it's,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  I,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  to me,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  it's a very dangerous way of thinking and it's a natural trap to fall into,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  but the best people,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  um,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  um,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  um,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  don't have that mindset.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  Uh,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  let me interrupt the show.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  Breaking news,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  doo,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  doo,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  doo,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  doo,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  doo,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  doo,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  doo,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  doo,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  doo,
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  doo,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  doo,
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  doo,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  doo,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  doo,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  doo,
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  doo.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  But that was expensive.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  We couldn't do that in the dorm.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Anyway.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  The name of the app was, uh, broadcast.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  It was awesome.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  It was awesome.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  Also,
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  we should have just put four words on a hat and guess that line broadcast.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Oh,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  it's
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  a good name.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  That's a great name.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  I will see.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  I will do my best to find a link for the show notes that that shows it.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  So the
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  What do you think about this service?
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Well, I can kind of see it. So in a follow-up piece that is
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  I don't think it's public. No, it was
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  on his subscriber-only newsletter. Maybe you should
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  ask him to just make that public. He's done it a few times, he really has.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  I've asked him and he's been like, yeah, whatever. Yeah, now it's like a week old. I'll see what I can do.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Yeah. He
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  clarifies some of his points. He gets a lot more
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  detail into his thinking.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  And also acknowledges some of the
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  trepidation,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  I should say, about switching into
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  services into its own division.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  But does bring out the point that Apple Retail was run as its own division for
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  a long time. Because running
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  a retail division is fundamentally different than running
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  a hardware or software organization.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  Is that not true for services, too?
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  Yeah, I almost think that the online services are very closely
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  analogous to the stores, where the services are just
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  glue that is there to make
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  the devices better. The devices are still the fundamental business of
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  the company, and the stores are just a way
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  to get more of the devices sold, and
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  the services are just a way to make the devices better once you own them.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  It's like, what the stores are before you have the new Apple device in your hand,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  the services are to what you do with it after you
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  opened it and started using it.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  Here's where
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  I don't know if I'm even playing devil's advocate, but I'm going to come at this from a
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  different aspect.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  The stores,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  saying the stores were just a way to push Mac products, okay, fine.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  But are the services just a way to push the devices?
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  Or are they a thing unto themselves?
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  That is what Apple has kind of been saying.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  All of it is further
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  serving the Apple brand as a whole, right?
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  Because that's why the stores are nice, right?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  Some of the nicest stores I've ever seen that sell any products anywhere,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  and that they're famously...
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  But they are!
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  They're not ornate.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  They are architecturally very minimalist.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  But that
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  famously, the earlier stores, I don't think they use the same material anymore,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  but they got a special kind of limestone from Italy that Steve Jobs had seen
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  while traveling in Europe, and all sorts of crazy stuff that they do
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  to make every detail right. There's no sense of
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  cheaping out in the stores. And I think that the services should be the same way,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  where it's not like, well, this is just an afterthought to help. I think they should
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  be thought of as these things that are first-class
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  parts of the Apple brand and the Apple customer experience.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  Okay, so what are the services? Can you name them right there?
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  That sounded
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  like I'm challenging you. I know. I'm honestly, I'm like, okay, what are they?
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  Well, the one area where I disagree with Ben, and we
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  do it on the podcast occasionally, is he has a lower opinion
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  of Apple's online services than I do. I actually think Apple's online services are
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  a lot better than they get credit for. And I think in many cases,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  many cases suffer from
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  just the notion, the basic notion that people believe Apple
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  makes great devices and crummy services. And by starting with that framework in their mind,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  they're a lot more likely to focus on the negative
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  aspects of Apple services. And then secondly, some of them
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  suffer from a bad first impression. And Maps is a great
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  example of that, where a lot of people, some people, and
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  real-world usage, Apple Maps is off the charts. It's by far
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  and away the most popular Maps service for iPhone and iOS
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  users. And part of that is just by nature
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  of being pre-installed. But secondarily, it's gotten a lot better.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Am I arguing that it is as good as Google Maps?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  No. But I don't use Google Maps anymore
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  just because I never, you know, that whole like, I'll keep the
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  app installed because if Apple Maps lets me down, I'll use Google Maps.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  That hasn't happened to me in forever, at least since the transit came to
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  New York and Apple Maps. And I think inarguably, anybody
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  who looked at Apple Maps, just the general state of how much is mapped and how much detail,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  it's much improved. So I'm not
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  as down on services overall. I mean, Maps is just one example. But anything
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  like that. Maps, iMessage, iCloud...
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Well, wait. So let's take iMessage as a
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  service.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  The value proposition of iMessage is that it's
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  encrypted end-to-end. And it works across
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  all your devices. All your iOS devices. And your Mac.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Okay. All your Apple devices. How do you
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  ensure that that is true? Like, how do you put that into a web browser?
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  I don't think they should. I wouldn't.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Okay, so that limits the value of the service to only Apple devices. Right.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  That's what I'm saying. Like, how do you break out services apart from the devices
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  that they support? Right. I see what you mean. You're saying... Like, how do you make a division
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  that is all about, so Microsoft did it, and you were on board for
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  it with Azure.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Where they could just be like, you know what? Screw Windows and Office.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  We're just going to make an awesome service. Yeah. That's different
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  than what Apple can do with the services that they currently run
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  because they seem
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  quite integrated with the devices
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  or at least the notion that they have a trusted endpoint.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  And it kind of conflicts if you're going to start saying
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  hey, and you report your own profit and loss, and
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  you're not allowed to expand to Windows or Android with the web.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  Aren't you cutting your... Well, that becomes
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  a strategy to access, like... You're cutting them off at the knees. You're saying we're going to count,
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  we want you to be as profitable as you can, but we're setting rules that'll prevent you
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  from being as profitable as you could be, just as an independent entity.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Because we think it serves the company's interests overall.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  Right. And I don't think they faced that
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  with retail. Because it couldn't
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  really conflict with their... Yeah, there weren't any
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  rules, there weren't any strategy tax type rules imposed
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  upon the Apple Store that held them back. Like, for example,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  they're not... I'm sure that if Ron Johnson back in the day had said
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  to Steve Jobs, hey, some of these people are coming in and
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  they want to buy Windows laptops, too. Can we sell some Dell
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  laptops on a table across from the Powerbooks? And
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Jobs would have said, you're fired. But he wouldn't have done that, though.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  That actually wouldn't have actually helped the Apple Stores
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  make more money. In theory, you could see how
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  turning it into more of a Best Buy, where they sell anything and everything, defeats the
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  whole purpose, which was to focus that by putting all the Apple stuff together
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  and showing that it was different, actually made it more likely that they would sell them.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  But they did sell accessories that were not on Apple. Some had even competed
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  with Apple stuff, like headphones. Yeah.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Yeah. They still do. Yeah,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  they bought Beats, which is the biggest one. But they don't impose
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  a rule on them that you can only sell Apple stuff like headphones.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  Well, you can't sell a book that... What was the book that
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Jobs got yanked? Oh, that was one a long time ago. I forget which one.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Yeah. That was funny.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  I just
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I honestly admire the just capriciousness of that
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  kind of stuff. Did they use to sell books? Is that...
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  I don't know. But, I mean, you remember the story. I'm sure you wrote about it.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  Right.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I do remember. I mean, it wasn't even that long ago, but I remember when they used to sell tons and tons
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  of box software. Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Well, some of her friends, like Omni and Shipley, like Delicious Monster,
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  had some stuff. Oh, yeah. We had definitely no people who had
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  I think BB Edit was still in boxes at the time. Oh, yeah? Yeah.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  I don't care. In fact, I know that BB Edit at some point was still in a box
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  and when it was in a box, it was in the Apple stores.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Box software is a herd. I mean, people
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  hit the app store. Wow. The 30% you lost
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  The 30% you lose on the app store is nothing compared to what you lost in
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  box software. I mean, we could do a whole show about it, but it's
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  from the games, too. I mean, it was exactly the same, probably even worse, because
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  there was more money involved.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  I mean, you're literally buying spots to be like
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  how much money is it going to cost us to have it at foot level? Part of the reason
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  Like, not even eye level. Like, foot level. It's a protection racket.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  Yeah. It was like, okay, we'll take it, but we're
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  going to put it on the bottom shelf, which was like ankle level. Well, first you have to
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  get into taking it, which is like dinners and
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  just flirty girls
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  It's a nightmare.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Talking to sales dudes is not cool.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  So I'm glad all of that aspect is gone. But at the same time, it's
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  still not great in terms of actually getting
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  the way the app stores are working.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  I don't want my box at the ankle
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  level. Well, then you have to pay. Yeah. And it was exactly
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  why apps were so expensive. They had to be expensive. There was no way
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  to sell, like, even a relatively small app that you knew would appeal
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  to, like, consumers and that you'd want to be, like, a consumer-friendly price. There was no way
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  to, like, price it accordingly because so much money came off the top that you had to
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  charge, like, $75 just as a starting point, if not more.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  I don't know. We can come back to this.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  Let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at

[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Much better question would be what type of website you can't build with
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  Squarespace. Squarespace has gotten amazing.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  It's always been a good product, always been a good hosting service, but you go to Squarespace
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  and they take care of everything. You start an account, you start, you
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  tell them what type of site you want to build, a store, a blog, a podcast,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  a portfolio site if you're an artist, anything like that.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  You tell them, you know, you go through, it's all visual, then they show you templates
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  for that type of site and you pick a template and you pick
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  features that you want that you have and then you see it. What you see is the actual
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  website that you would have if you turn it on and make it live and any changes
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  you make, you don't make through code, you just make them when you're logged into
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  your account as the account owner. You just make them visually.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  It is truly WYSIWYG brought to the web
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  where you're in the web browser looking at your site and you just move the stuff
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  and change the stuff right there as you're looking at it. It is phenomenal

[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  thanks to Squarespace. Yeah, I don't know. Back to whether or not I agree
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  with Ben. I don't know. It makes a good case. Maybe the answer
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  is sort of a half and half and I don't know. Maybe that's stupid. Maybe I'm trying to
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  have it both ways, but maybe I would say
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  not so much the profit and loss aspect of it.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  And again, iMessage is another example. How are they supposed to make money on iMessage? There's no money.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  But, if compared to these other chat
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  services like WhatsApp and WeChat and stuff like that,
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  I think if you broke iMessage, I mean, they can't strategically. There is no way to break
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  it out, but just in terms of daily active users, which is like this measurement term
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  that investors love to hear, at least at the moment, iMessage
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  is worth billions. But there's no real way that they have a plan
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  to make money. They're not going to start shooting ads through iMessage.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  I think, if anything, iMessage is
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  one of the most obvious
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  sort of counterarguments to breaking
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  services out from the rest of the company.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  In that,
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  getting that blue balloon is awesome.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  And iMessage being part of the iPhone experience is
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  huge. And so,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  in his first piece, Ben argues that people buy iPhones
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  for the software and hardware, and I agree.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  But iMessage is a big thing for me. It really is.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  I remember texting you back in the day, and it would cost us 75 cents
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  of text. Right, because we were crossing the international border.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  Crossing the international border, talking about Mad Men, or whatever.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  And that racked up pretty quick. And I like you,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  but I don't like you that much. That's a dollar.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  But yeah, no, iMessage fixed that.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  So that's great. And yeah, sure, WhatsApp could, and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  But I think
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  iMessage is one of those things that ties closely to iOS
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  or Apple devices that
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  are used for better integration of
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  services with Apple products. The whole thing about preferring blue
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  bubbles to green bubbles, even if you take cost aside, even if it's US to US
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  and so you know that it's out of your food bucket,
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  is obviously subjective. It bothers some people because it's
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  sort of a, if not classism,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  it is some sort of a
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  tribalism. I was about to say tribe mentality, so same thing.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  Tribalism. Which is just innately offensive,
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  or maybe offensive is too strong a word, but people object to it. And for good
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  reason, right? That human beings have this natural instinct to be
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  tribal, and it's that sort of thinking that leads, if you take
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  it to the extreme, to intolerance, if not
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  outright, racism, bigotry of what you want,
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  what have you. That you really have to be conscious of it all the way up to the top level and that
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  therefore it's just unsavory. And I get that. I really do. I joke about the blue
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  bubbles and green bubbles sometimes. But I get it when there's people
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  who really push back on that. I do get it.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  I honestly don't think that was an intentional design decision
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  in order to ostracize anybody. No, I don't think so either. I think it was like,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  these ones are costing money and these ones aren't. Yeah, and I think it was worth knowing
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  who had them. But there's an interesting
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  objective version, not subjective, but objective
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  advantage to it.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  At least one, which is that
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  you know that the emoji you send are going to look the same. I just saw an article this week.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  I didn't link to it. I don't know why I didn't link to it from during Fireball. But there was an article that, somebody did a study
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  that showed that people interpret
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  an emoji from different platforms differently. And at certain code points
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  like, you know, it's like face with, you know, grinning teeth.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  And it has a different emotional effect
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  you know, based on the iOS version of it compared to the Android or
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  Twitter. Right. And, you know, just subtle cues. And it just,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Because each render that, I don't know if everybody knows, but
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  what you see on your screen is not what somebody else sees on their screen. Right.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  And a face with grinning teeth on your screen
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  may look, I don't know, I don't know this
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  but like, let's say with two buck teeth on the other
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  screen. So it looks like you're just having a
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  wide smile on your screen but you look like you're sending
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  a hick, a stereotypical hick
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  emoticon to the other person on the other screen.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  And when you're dealing with a
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  particularly dense communication stream like emoticons
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  that becomes problematic, right? Right.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  And I don't know that maybe people don't worry about it, or I do a little bit
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  because I find, I always, you know, I mean it's shocker given my career
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  I really, it pains me to think that I'm not
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  you know, people aren't understanding what I'm trying to communicate as clearly as possible.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Have you given into
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  emoticons in chat? I don't think we do it. No.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  I've never did. And Emoji have saved me from it. I've never
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  really was a big user of like the ASCII art, you know
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  smiley faces. I mean, I'm not going to say I never sent them, but
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  I've just found them to be too silly, so I didn't.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Yeah, I think he used them with my... I use Emoji though. I use Emoji
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  now, you know, I'm not going to say like a teenager, but I use it quite a bit.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  I use them more in Slack than anywhere else.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  I use them on Twitter now. Sometimes I give a lot of thumbs up on Twitter.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  Oh yeah? Yeah, because I find it to be exceptionally
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  efficient, you know. There's one that across the board
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  nobody's going to misinterpret. It doesn't matter how you draw it, a thumbs up or a thumbs down.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  Yeah, it's not like a sailboat. It's like, what do you mean?
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Yeah, I find it to be... it's a great addition to our
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  you know, obviously I thought it was silly at first
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  because I'm a curmudgeon, but once I opened my mind to it, I really thought, this is great
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  improvement, and so much better than ASCII art, you know, colon
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Oh yeah, that's garbage. I mean, if I'm
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  writing something, there's no way I'm going to use that. If I'm reacting to something
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  I feel better about it. I don't know if I've ever spoken about this. In recent years
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I have spoken to... I think you would know, you're a close enough reader to know that
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  in my writing I don't really use a lot of exclamation marks. No, very, yeah.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  But in email... Count them on two hands. In email I use them
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  a lot. I use what I consider to be the friendly
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  exclamation mark. And here's a perfect example
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  and it's a very common example
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  is people often send me typo reports. Maybe I've spelled a word wrong
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  or I've made a little mark down error in a post
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  where I've used the wrong parenthesis or I missed something
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  and you see, you know, like a raw URL that's clearly supposed to be a hyperlink
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  and people will email me or Twitter me and say, hey, you've got a typo.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  Well, a lot of people, I think everybody knows this
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  consider correcting someone's spelling or punctuation on the internet to be
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  a faux pas. That you, the person pointing out the error, are the jerk.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Because you're pointing out, you know... I love it.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  I would rather have a hundred people tell me about a spelling error I made on Daring Fireball
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  than to have it go uncorrected because everybody thinks
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  you know, either thinks, I'm sure someone else told him or
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  I don't want to be the jerk to tell John that he has an error.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  So, and I try to. I can't, sometimes, and if I post and then
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  go make coffee or go run an errand and the error is up for an hour
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  I get a lot of them and it's almost, it's like I can't be bothered to
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  thank everybody. But if I fix it right away, I try to thank everybody. And I'll
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  often write fixed comma thanks and put an
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  exclamation mark after the thanks. Because to me, that reads as very friendly.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  And unambiguously, what do I mean by fixed comma thanks exclamation
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  point? To me, it's, I don't know, it's just maybe the
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  way I read that exclamation point. It's fixed and a genuine thanks.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Whereas if I wrote fixed comma thanks period, I can see
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  how that would be misinterpreted as, yes, as dry.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Yeah, fixed. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for...
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  I only ever send me fixed. Yeah, I don't give you that.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  No, you don't give me that.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  That's because I don't need it. I find, and
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  years ago, I mean, I don't know how many years ago I started doing that.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  But it was uncomfortable with it because I'm so uncomfortable with exclamation
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  points to be, to me,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  a false sense of familiarity and friendliness.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And to me, and for example, in marketing materials, almost every single
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  exclamation mark that's used in any marketing material is
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  terrible. It's a terrible, and it means that whoever is
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  doing the copywriting is full of shit. It is exactly
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  why some people think the word marketing is a dirty word. And all
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  good brands, you know, with good marketing either never
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  use exclamation marks or almost never, and when they do, there's
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  some kind of good argument for it. But find me an ad from BMW with
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  an exclamation mark in it. Find me an ad from Apple with an exclamation mark in it.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  It's nearly impossible. So anybody out there... And it's also a
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  rookie mistake. It's a mistake that someone makes doing their own marketing when they're not
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  used to doing marketing, because they think that they're infusing the material
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  with enthusiasm when what they're really infusing it with is bullshit.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  An air of desperation.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Yeah, yeah. Because they could say something completely accurate.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  Right. But when you put an exclamation mark, it's like
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  you're trying to really call something out. But I agree with you, in casual communication,
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  especially these days,
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  you know, it's just a friendly way of being like, oh, thanks!
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  Like, it... Long story short, though...
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  I mean, it's a modifier. If you're reading an outline
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  out loud, it's a modifier on
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  the way that that sound should be, right? Like, it goes
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  up. Yeah. Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks!
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Different things. And as I do more podcasts, or I don't
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  really do a lot of podcasts, plural, but as I podcast more and more, I've
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  grown lazy in my writing. Not lazy, but I've grown to
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  appreciate the fact that I can use inflection on a podcast in a way that
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  takes a lot more mental effort and prose to
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  be unambiguous about whether you're being sarcastic
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  or not. Well, you need to set it up. Also,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  I think it doesn't help you... Okay, that's a bad
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  way to start a sentence. But it doesn't help you that like a lot of your...
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  in your linked list, it's like one word
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  retorts, basically. So if you then
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  write with brevity, it's
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  read in the same voice as these one word retorts that you
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  use in the linked list. Yeah.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  I've used emoji on Daring Fireball a few times, too. Just like twice, though.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  Have you? I missed that. I need a better way to do it.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  What side is that? I don't know. I'll make that side. I need to look into it.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  There is some sort of... I wouldn't... not that I would use it frequently, but
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  what makes me unlikely to use it frequently is the whole issue of... The rendering.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  Right, the rendering. And not even being able to control the long-term rendering on
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  Apple and iOS devices. Who knows if and when they're ever going to redraw some of the
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  some of the clips. Yeah, happy face could be a swastika like next week, and you have
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  no control. Right.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  I'm trying to see. I just sent you a link to this Verde
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  story on this study that shows people interpreting emoji differently.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  And it's the one with grinning teeth is a really good one. Because it's on all the other
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  platforms. And I don't know exactly what the name of the... It's
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes. And Apple's
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  glyph makes it look like somebody who is... Oh, man.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  You see the teeth. It's not a smile.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  And it's almost like you've just said the wrong thing. Right.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  Right? Like the look you would give if you just mentioned somebody's
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  son or their mother. Like, hey, how's your mother? And then
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  all of a sudden you remember that their mother died recently.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Or something like that. The sort of grin you would make in that situation.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  Like a seething like, sorry about that. Whereas the Microsoft,
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  Samsung, LG, and Google ones are all unambiguously
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  a toothy smile. You know, it's all happy.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  They're all happy. Perfect example. And so there's a value
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  to iMessage in the fact that you... And maybe people don't think about it consciously.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  But you know what the other person is going to see.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Well, wait. Doesn't that mean
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  that iMessage should
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  normalize to what these other guys are doing?
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Personally, I prefer the Apple logo. I think it looks better. And it's useful.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  It's useful in a way that... And I don't think that there's another... It is useful, but does it match
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  the grinning face with smiling eyes?
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  The description of the emoji, right? But even with the other ones, the study
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  assigned, you know, polled people on whether they think this is a negative connotation
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  or positive connotation of the glyph. Even among the other ones, there's a fairly wide
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  variety. They're all positive, and Apple's is negative. Apple's is negative. Oh, they're grouped way closer
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  together, dude. But there's a difference. Like, the difference between Microsoft and Google
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  is over a point on a five point scale. I agree that there's
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  definitely... Oh my god. Are you... Come on, dude. No, no, no. Apple is...
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  There's a four point difference between Microsoft and Apple
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  in the negative direction. No, no. I'm not trying to argue that on the case of this particular one
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  that Apple is not an outlier. No, I'm not arguing
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  that. But I'm saying, though, even not counting
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  Apple, it's interesting to me that the ones who agree on the basic
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  sense of it still have a different... Oh, sure.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  And I think for most of the emoji, that that's
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  probably the case. I think most of them, there is no outlier.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  But that there's still a... I agree.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  The other thing is context.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Emojis very seldomly make sense without
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  any words around them, right? Or at least context
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  in a conversation. So while you could look at...
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  I don't know what this tested. It was like, okay, what do you think about each one
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  of these emojis? You could feel totally different, given...
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  The researchers surveyed online respondents on how they interpreted the
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  emoji's sentiment, rating it on a scale from negative five, strongly negative,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  to plus five, strongly positive.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I have... You know what? I'll tell you what. I don't think
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  I've ever used this Apple emoji. Our friend
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  of the show, Paul Kefasas, he likes to use that emoji.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  As being... As a person who is
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  an observer of
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  the uncomfortable aspects of life. Yeah.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Uncomfortable is what that says. Right. He likes to document
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  sort of the weird on his one-foot tsunami.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  In personal correspondence, he will often...
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  That's one person I know who has sent me that emoji.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  But, gooding face with
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  smiling eyes is the name of that emoji.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Do you think Apple has accurately rendered that notion?
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  No. I think not. Although... So while they like
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  the uncomfortable, I'm totally into...
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  Yeah, I think the problem with it is that it doesn't...
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  It's not the eyes, it's the grin. Because to me a grin...
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but to me a grin implies a smile. That a grin
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  is a subset of a smile. Whereas that is absolutely not
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  a smile. No, that's like a... That's a drawn teeth kind of thing.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Yeah, a tooth suck. It's like the name of that emoji should be
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  Embarrassed Tooth Suck. Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Which I firmly believe is a
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  perfectly valid emoji to have. And that's a great representation
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  of it. Yeah, here's the dictionary definition of
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  grin. It is a smile broadly, especially in an unrestrained
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  manner with the mouth open. Dennis Appear is the example.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Dennis Appear to grinning used cheerfully.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  As a noun, it is a broad smile.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  Definitely. I think that the grinning teeth
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  is inaccurately rendered. But now it's too late. Or is it? I don't know.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Because if they change it, then all sorts of things, all sorts of ways
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  that it's already been used are changed in meaning.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  Depends who you're talking to, and that's the problem.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Right. Like emoji are words that
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  when I send them to you, change meaning.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  I love it, but it's nowhere near...
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  This is nowhere near the list of stuff. We're getting into linguistics. I love it.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Yeah, and there is an advantage
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  there to the old school ASCII emoticon artwork, where it's
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  a little bit... It's a little bit more defined.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Your semicolon might look different than my semicolon, but I still get
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  I know of stupid Winky when I see it. Right.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  Uh...
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  I don't even know how we got here. I don't know.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  Oh, we were talking about iMessage and services and whether they should be broken apart.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  And so we got to ask... I also wonder
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  You got that to want specific emoticons.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  As I wonder about the...
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  The one we're talking about, I'm looking at the study now. I should not... I'll link to this
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  study in the show notes, I promise. I'm copying and pasting it now.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  They have examples of the ones with the biggest deltas.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  The grinning teeth one is not only is Apple an outlier as the emoji, that particular
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  the distance from which the...
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  There's no other emoji that they studied that has a spread like that.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  It just means something different. Yeah, it's actually... And I think concentrating on that
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  one in particular, actually you lose the general context of the
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  study, which is that even with the ones where they're generally all compliant with
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  the description, people have a different interpretation of
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  what they mean, or at least the sentiment of being positive or negative.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  Right, which I think is a super interesting point.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  I think The Verge, and it's not a knock,
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  but whatever. They picked the most illustrative point.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Because it's easiest to write about. Well yeah, we'll look at that.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  That's clearly an outlier. And that makes you want to
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  learn more about it. So it's really not a knock on them,
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  but it really illustrates that people on different platforms
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  will see different things. And Ben Thompson, if he's listening,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  if he does listen to this show, he's probably screaming at us that we're not talking about stickers.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Because Ben's a big fan and studier
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  of the chat services, the ones that are cross-platform, like WhatsApp and WeChat.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  And those things have these things called stickers,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  which are like emoji, but they're accustomed to the service.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  And it's just sending an image like an emoji.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  And maybe around a holiday, they'll come out with a whole set of them about
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  Christmas. So instead of just like an emoji, you've got Santa Claus on a Christmas tree.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  You could have a whole set of stickers all about Christmas, or whatever.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  I was so down on that. But you know what?
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  I talked to
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  him over Slack, and sometimes I don't even care
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  to actually respond to him, but I'll do one of those reaction emoji.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  Exactly. And I'm like, oh, Ben, you kind of got me on this
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  sticker stuff.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  So I don't know. The more
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  I talk about it with you, the more I'm starting to disagree with him.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  Disagree with him? Oh, you should get him on the show, because he's a smart cookie.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  He's never done this show yet. Has he? Yeah, what are you talking about?
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Is he? I'm pretty sure he's on this show.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  Well, let me look at the archives. You don't remember talking
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  to Ben. It's like three times
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  at least, dude.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  Alright, ten times.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Ten times? No, maybe it's five.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I just searched for Thompson on the page, and it'll show up twice for each one, because I'll mention
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  him in the title.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  You know what? He's never doing it again.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  I'll tell you that much right now. I didn't actually forget. He's been on twice since August
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  of last year. He's probably on more often than I am.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  Probably. And four times in the last year.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  What about Apple Music?
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Isn't Apple Music already sort of a standalone...
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Oh, man. And they have to sort of do profit and loss
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  on that. I mean, they know how many subscribers they are, and they know how much they're paying.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  You know, whether they actually count it and hold it accountable
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  and have goals for it, and you're getting fired if you don't meet this
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  the way some companies would in their divisions.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  Usually they know exactly how much Apple Music is making
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  and how much it's costing, and therefore they know whether it's profitable or not, and they know
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  what the delta is month to month. And we know it because
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  they leak things like the number of subscribers.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  It's very, very competitive business.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  So getting back to the press tax,
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Ben's basic argument is that whatever gets measured gets
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  fixed. There's no way they don't know if Apple Music
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  is making or losing money. And
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  it's not that they say that they don't have
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  profit and loss in the company. It's that they
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  report one level of profit and loss.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  Which is a very different thing. I don't think that means internally
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  that they don't worry about this kind of stuff.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  So they expanded what?
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  iCloud Drive storage. There's no way they did that without
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  considering profit and loss. No way. Well, of course not, because they charge for that.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  Right. So clearly they've got some numbers.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  In fact, I'm telling you, the more I talk about it,
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  it's a great piece, but the more I talk about it, the more I think I disagree.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  I totally agree that he's
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  identified a problem. I don't think his proposed solution is right.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  Because to me, iCloud Drive's another example where
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  they don't do profit and loss across the way other companies do.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  But you would never guess that by the way they charge for iCloud storage.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  Right? Based on the way that they charge
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  for iCloud storage, you would think the opposite. You would think this is a company where somebody in the
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  iCloud division has a gun to their head that they're supposed to make a lot of money on this.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Yeah. Because they charge more than anybody.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Yeah. And there's another one too.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  iCloud Drive, to me, works amazingly well.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  I honestly, in my experience, and I know somebody out there
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  is going to disagree and think that I'm smoking apple dope or something,
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  but I find that it is up to Dropbox
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  quality, which is invisible, that I never
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  if I'm editing apps that I know use iCloud Drive
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  like I have a couple of important numbers spreadsheets.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  At this point, when I save stuff in Numbers,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  I know that it's there and I can go to a different Mac or a different device and it's going to be there.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  It's just there. That's not the case. I still use Dropbox
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  because I use it in different ways and Dropbox is a lot easier to use
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  as a sort of junk drawer where you just put anything and everything and have it go
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  everywhere. And iCloud Drive, to me, still works best in the mindset
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  of, hey, the documents for Numbers, you go to
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  Numbers, you know, it's not really, I don't really, even though you can put arbitrary
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  files in your iCloud Drive now, I still use Dropbox for that, but just in terms
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  of having the sync work just invisibly, nearly instantaneously,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  it's up there. I think they get a bad rap
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  for problems that they had in the past and people either aren't giving it
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  a fair look with open eyes now or
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  they're just too set in their mindset that Apple, you know, that anything
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  related to iCloud sucks. But what they charge for it, I think
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  it's almost crazy compared to what other people charge for storage.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  I think the storage rates are exorbitant. The functionality
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  seems to be really pretty solid at this point.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  I just
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  can't believe that they couldn't charge a lot less than they should. And if
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  anything, they should be, because, you know, it's really only meant to be used on expensive
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  Apple devices that have high profit margins. It seems to me like
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  iCloud Drive storage per gigabyte ought to be less than the competition,
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  not more than the competition, because like Dropbox, just to name one example,
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  all the money they're making is for people paying for Dropbox storage. They don't sell
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  $800 cell phones with 40% profit margins that they
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  can get other revenue from. All they have is the storage, whereas this
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  is just one little thing. So there's an example where I don't know how to do it.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  Yeah, but they can make more money.
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  I don't disagree with you, but I mean, you know, if they
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  run the scenarios and they make more money
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  you say. Yeah, exactly. If Apple can make more money and they run the
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  projected scenarios. Right, and Moltz and I often run it, you know, for some reason
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  Moltz in particular and I, when he's on the show, always run into this where we end up talking ourselves
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  into spending Tim Cook's money, you know, and I totally realize. Which is
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  an easy and awesome thing to do, because it's fun. Right, but I totally
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  realize that the way you become the world's most profitable
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  company is that you, you know, cut your losses.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  And you, you know, you sweat the details. You make money. You don't piss money away
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  here and there and that all sorts of ideas that we have involve Apple pissing a little
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  extra money away here and there and then, you know, piss a little away here and there
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  and then all of a sudden you're not the world's most profitable company. Well, because ultimately, so the
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  argument is that they should make iCloud
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  storage cheaper, despite the fact
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  that we don't know how many, like what the percentages
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  of iOS device owners or Apple device owners
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  are that subscribe to it. They should make it
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  cheaper in order to make them happier. Well, but
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  we've already got a cust sat
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  number of like 98. Right. Like maybe when that drops
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  to like 89, maybe that's when you're like, okay.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  I almost think that Apple should know better than to trust the customer sat
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  because people. I do too and I actually think they do.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  People maybe don't have high enough expectations yet. They don't expect to have infinite
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  storage online and so therefore they don't judge Apple by that
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  and therefore they say I'm completely satisfied with my iPhone even though they only have 5 gigabytes
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  of storage in their iCloud account. Whereas I think Apple knows better than that
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  and it just comes back to my hour ago story about being
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  appalled when the guys just threw a handful of card catalog things up in the air. Like data loss,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  data loss. It just breaks my heart knowing that there are people
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  who can't put their entire photo library in their iCloud account because
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  they only take the free iCloud storage. Like I really
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  really think that. I don't want to quite say there's a moral obligation
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  but on some spectrum it is. On some spectrum being in favor of
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  avoiding data loss at all costs is a moral issue and I really
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  wish that more and more people would be able to reasonably
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  serve their and save their entire photo and video library to their
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  iCloud account. Because otherwise if they lose or break their phone they might lose
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  photos and videos permanently.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  I don't disagree with you about that at all.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  What that costs I don't know.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  I mean
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  there's always local backups.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  I know.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  But not to get all capitalist on it because
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  I'm Canadian so we should probably just nationalize every
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  company.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  But
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  doesn't the fact that they can make money on
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  you know, like if
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  people need this kind of protection. It's effectively insurance, right?
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  Can Apple not be in the insurance
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  of your business? I think the best thing that
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Ben wrote in that piece was the Draper quote
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  was his name Draper? Or am I thinking of Mad Men? The management guy who said
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  what you measure is what gets approved.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  That's the key. Don Draper.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  He might as well have said it.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  Don Draper would never say that. He would say the exact opposite.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  But
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  I think that what Apple needs is better and
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  more rigid measurements of their services. They should
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  and higher standards for them. I see fewer and fewer
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  times that I see any kind of out of sync iMessages. I use
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  iMessage all the time. I use it across a bunch of devices and in
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  my use it is excellent and getting better. There's another one of those things
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  where I just feel like don't judge it by how it used to be but it's
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  really gotten good at when I'm at my Mac. The iMessages
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  aren't going off on my other devices because it sees that I'm active on my Mac
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  and texts that I've sent from my phone all day if they're
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  on iMessage when I get to my Mac they're waiting for me if I want to get back to it.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  But it's still not perfect. I just had an interaction
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  with someone the other day and I don't know why but my
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  text to this guy only go to my phone or
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  from him they only go to my phone at least and they don't go to my Mac
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  and I don't know why. They're blue and it
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  seems like both devices are set up with the same phone number and the same
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  Apple ID and whether he's sending it to my phone number or my Apple
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  ID email address. I don't know but everybody else
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  is synced between. So just
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  instead of 99.9% of messages syncing properly between
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  devices maybe make it 99.99 but measure
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  it. There ought to be and I do always opt into the
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  send Apple diagnostic stuff so
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  hopefully they're measuring and they see that there's a glitch
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  but that to me is the bottom line. Not that it should be about dollars
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  and cents and profit and loss but that they should pick better metrics and
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  improve these services to those levels.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  What do you perceive as the services that Apple has that need the most
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  work?
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  Cloud Sync has actually got better. Do you think it's good enough?
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  As somebody who ships Mac software that
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  goes to the cloud. This is your app Napkin. Yes, Napkin.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  We had some early reports where they were like
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  the files would clobber themselves when they were synced over the
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  that was bad. But things have worked out
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  better. Notes
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  is actually a really great app and I'm sorry to say
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  that because I know you. No, I don't disagree at all.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  Well, you know, I don't want to tell you on your show
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  that they had a new version of Notes. The version of Notes that debuted
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  last fall with iOS 9
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  and the new version of Mac OS El Capitan
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  because the old version of Notes only synced through IMAP and it was a terrible hack
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  and acted like a terrible hack and was unreliable and the new one
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  uses CloudKit, I think. I'm 99%
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  sure that it's dog food in CloudKit, which is not
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  files in a file system like iCloud Drive.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  I'm not quite sure what the word is, but asynchronous abstracted
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  object permanence, I guess.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  Yes, that's a good way to say it. Well, it's a bunch
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  of words. It's gobbledygook, really. But it's an API that developers
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  seem to like and it seems to work the way
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  it's supposed to, which is exactly what a service should be.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  That's change of pace. Right.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  It's a good API or a good enough API and it's reliable.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  And it works within the timeframe that you would hope
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  that it would work, where the note that you just pecked out and pasted on your Mac
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  you pick up your phone and go and it's there on your phone.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  So, it's a good example. iTunes and Apple Music
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  are a mess.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  I mean, I don't even understand iTunes anymore.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  You had Eddie on the show recently and he was like
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  well, when you go to the Music tab, all you see is the music
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  and it's like, that's not the problem. Right.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  If I play an album that I own through Apple Music, I can click on
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  the album art and click on a song on it and it'll start
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  playing. And then if I try to navigate to find, like to play
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  What's Next and I click on an album that happens to have been included through
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  my Apple Music subscription, the song will stop.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  So I can't
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  I can't go and add it to Up Next.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  For whatever reason. I don't know though how much that counts. I agree that there are
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  problems there. I find Apple Music to be confusing. Apple Music
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  I don't understand it and I'm a very technical person. It triggers the
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  maybe I'm a dummy thing that I think makes me a good designer
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  and a good critic of design. Oh, I know I'm a dummy.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  Right, but I'm also technical. I'm unable to understand
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  overly complex interfaces and that therefore
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  I think I'm good at explaining why.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  Over the line of this doesn't seem to explain itself.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  I can start to understand the rules.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  But they're arbitrary and based on technical limitations rather
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  than like interaction limitations. I don't know that that counts as being bad at services though. I feel that
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  it's more of a sign of being tolerant of insufficient
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  user interface design.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  The client expression of that service is
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  suboptimal.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  By and large, I'm actually
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  not that down on Apple services per se.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  But I also, I don't think I rely on them as
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  much as many other people do. Like a lot of people do collaborative
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  document sharing over Google
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  or calendar sharing. I don't have to
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  do that. I don't know if I'm exposed
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  so much to the negative
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  sides of maybe where Apple is
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  not quite at the forefront.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  Well, the other thing too that plays into this and I often think about and I don't know how much
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  if it is a problem or not is that Apple is in a position where
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  they benefit from the services of others.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  So if there's collaborative aspects to Google
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  docs that Apple's pages
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  or whatever else can't provide, the fact is that you can get the full
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  benefit of that while using an Apple product.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Because Google docs has iOS apps and
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  a web version that runs anywhere. And I think that's
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  true for a lot of services.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  The problem for Apple was back
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  in the early, to cycle back to two hours ago in the show, the problem was back in the old
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  days when Apple was so much smaller that all this stuff didn't work
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  on Apple stuff. I mean most famously, the best example I can think
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  of was that at first Napster was a Windows only thing.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  And there was this amazing thing that was a sensation that lit the entire
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  world on fire and Mac users were left
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  out at first and then it was like we had third party clients that
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  just used the Napster API. Which were
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  actually in some ways better because they were designed by Mac developers and had better
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  interface. But then as Napster itself, the first party
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  Napster would change things, the Mac changes, you had to wait for the third party
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  developers making these sort of... Yeah, that's the story of the Mac in the 90s.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  And Apple doesn't have that problem anymore, nobody does Mac second.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  Or iOS second at least, maybe Mac second, but not iOS.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  So I think it's a little different, and I don't think that they have to do all the
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  services themselves. And in fact, I think that that kind of thinking, it
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  sort of is what led to Microsoft's downfall where to me
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  where Microsoft really fell off as the dominant, the company that really drove the industry
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  in every important sense, was that they institutionally
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  they wanted to do everything. And anybody who had any kind of success
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  Microsoft would say, well they're making money on that, let's go do something
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  that beats them. So they competed with Oracle,
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  they competed with Sun, I mean you name it, they competed with them.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  And they even... They won a lot of those fights.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  They did, but it... Sometimes dirty, sometimes fair and square. But I think it
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  let them take their eye off the ball that they didn't have any... I think trying
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  to do it all is inevitably going to lead to failure.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  So do you think that's where Apple's going?
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  No, I don't think so. But I think though that the
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  mindset that they have to be as good as Google at all services
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  is maybe the wrong way to look at it, because maybe they don't. They just have to
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  remain an appealing platform for Google to make sure
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  it remains a first class citizen. And I don't see any signs that that's
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  changed.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  So what do you think about this Intel
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  layoff kind of thing? Which seems like a weird segue.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  Let me take a break before we talk. That's a great way, a great final
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  topic. Let me take a third break here and thank our third
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  sponsor of the show, our final sponsor, our good friends, love this company,
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  Fracture. Fracture is a company that prints photos directly onto
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  glass. Super high quality. I say it all the time,
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  I cannot... it looks like nothing else. It doesn't look like... it's not like
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  getting a printed photo on paper that is perfectly mounted under glass.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  It looks different and in a way that is better.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  It looks... it's just uncanny what it looks like.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  It is super, super nice. You get a piece of glass, your photo is printed directly on it.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  They have all the sizes you could possibly imagine. Little like 3x3
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  square ones, 4x4, I forget what the size is, but little tiny desktop ones.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  Really, really big ones that you would mount on a wall. It's really
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  kind of amazing. I know megapixels are so overrated as a camera thing.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  A way to rank camera quality. But the fact is
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  that there's a certain threshold for printing things big and you need enough
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  megapixels and it's amazing to me that the iPhone is well past it.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  You could take an iPhone picture and if it's in focus and sharp, you can
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  print it up to really big size and get really, really amazing output
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  out of that. And I say that knowing that for anybody who's listening to me, most of your photos
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  are probably taken with your iPhone. There's very few people who take a majority of their
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  photos on stand-alone cameras. And even people who use stand-alone cameras
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  probably don't take a majority of them on anything other than their phone. You can go really, really
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  big. And fractures prices are really affordable
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  too. It starts at just $15 for the small square size and it goes
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  up from there. They make fantastic gifts for family, friends, and loved ones. I know
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Mother's Day is coming up. It is a fantastic. Hurry up. Get your order in for Mother's Day.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Because it's a small company and I
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  know right before the holiday it's going to get backed up. But if you listen to this
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  at the end of April, hurry up and get it in. It's a great gift.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  And I just can't say how happy I am with them. I wouldn't get
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  my photos printed to mount or to put on a desk any other way.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  Because it's so much, it's both more convenient and higher quality.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  And I don't know how you can beat that. So if you need
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  any more reason to go ahead and use Fracture, give them a shot.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  You can save 10% off their already excellent
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  prices by using the code TALKSHOW10.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  That's just TALKSHOW spelled out and then 10.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  And just go to FractureMe.com to check out their services online.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  FractureMe.com. My thanks to them. So Intel. Intel announced that what are they laying
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  off? Like 10% of their workforce. 12,000 people?
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  12,000. Yeah.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  I think it's unsurprising. I think, you know, and it's always funny.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  The number surprises me.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  I mean, so you were probably hip to the
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  I'm pretty sure you were hip to the industry
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  back when IBM had its first layoffs.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  Like late 90s? You know
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  what, actually, this is before, I think before Apple got involved
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  with them. But IBM was a powerhouse and they were
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  like an old school company. Like, we don't do layoffs.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  You work at IBM and you retire. It's a point of pride.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  You're a company man. You get to watch. We set you up.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  And then they hit some times and they
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  did some layoffs. And this Intel
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  thing kind of reminds me of that a little bit.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  Yeah, and especially because they were
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  especially going back to the 90s, you just cannot
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  emphasize how, you know, I know that they used the term Wintel, but that was
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  Wintel was Windows as the software and Intel as the CPU.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  The Wintel duopoly was just so dominant in the industry
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  in terms of both what actual people were
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  actually using, which was Intel based computers with
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  Microsoft software running it, and where the money was going.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  It was going to Microsoft and it was going to Intel. I mean, you could have reaped
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  all of the rewards of the
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  90s stock market just by putting money into Intel and Microsoft.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  Oh yeah. And it just seemed, that sort of
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  success over a decade, after a while
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  it's human nature to just see it as inevitable.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  Intel is always going to be Intel.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  And it just, I don't know, going back in time and telling somebody
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  in 1997 that Intel is going to have massive layoffs in 2016.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  I mean, 2016 would sound like a long time off, but you would think, wow, something weird
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  happened in between now and then, because that doesn't seem possible.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  Well, and something weird did happen. I think a couple of things did. I think
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  that there's, I think it's multi-variable
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  and that all of the variables, all of them worked against Intel.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  It's like a perfect storm. Yeah, I can't think of really wanting
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  to just take it in their favor. Like all the ways that the industry has changed since
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  their heyday have all been against their favor.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  I mean, let's just recount them.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  Obviously one of them is the shift to, the fact that
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  PC sales have plateaued and are in a decline
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  because people are either using their old PC
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  longer and their older PC is
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  good enough performance-wise that we've reached, you know, maybe
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  that's even a separate factor in that. The saturation point. Right, that
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  we've reached a point where client-side computing
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  is fast enough for most people most of the time. So there's
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  no need to replace your older PC if it's still running based on performance reasons.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  Obviously and famously, people are doing a lot more of their personal computing on
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  quote-unquote mobile devices, which roughly means phones
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000]  and tablets. And the phones and tablets, most of them, overwhelming
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  majority of them, are using ARM-based chips, which Intel doesn't make.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  And which, funny enough, they sold, they had like an ARM
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  that they sold
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  just before the cell phone. And now, here's the thing though, I wonder though, they're even keeping
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  that. I don't know that that would have saved them because one of the other factors is that
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  Intel's business is based on the fact, on the idea
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  that a significant portion of the cost of a PC is the
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  CPU. That that's, you know, however much
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  the PC costs, a big chunk of it is
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  the CPU. And Microsoft's business used to be based on,
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  and to some degree still is, but they've successfully moved away
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.000]  from this in a way that I don't think Intel has. That in the old
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.000]  days, pretty much the entire cost of the PC was an Intel
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  chip, a license for Windows, and then a whole bunch of
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  cheap components, like hard drives and RAM and stuff like that. That was all
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  commodity-based. Everything else was a commodity.
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  Software is software. They can pivot better than
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  Intel can, being hardware.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  I think that you can move on from being the OS
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  provider and onto something else faster than Intel can move
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  off of being the chip provider onto something else. Well, and being a chip
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  provider where the CPU is not a mere commodity. It was a
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  mere component. I mean, and just look at the market. They both saw their legs cut out
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  from beneath them, and now what? We Mac users
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  always think, at least I always think of Intel stickers, the Intel inside stickers
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  in the context of that poor sap at the Apple press conference who asked
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  Steve Jobs why the
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000]  first, you know, 2006 kind of thing. 2006 or 2007.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  It had to be 2007, I think, because it had to be after the ones came out.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  2006 was the year that the switch was announced.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  And then 2007 would be when it came out. So the poor guy at the
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  press conference in 2007 who asked why Apple's Intel-based MacBooks
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  don't have an Intel inside. Was that the same year as the iPhone?
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000]  Yeah. That's embarrassing.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  You're worrying about the wrong thing, dude.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  But just think about the fact that the idea that
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  the Intel chip is so important to the PC, whether it's from HP
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  or Dell or Compaq
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  back in the day, or a name that you named Sony, you know, that they all put
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  a visible Intel inside sticker on the outside
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000]  of the PC or the laptop. And I know that there were marketing
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  deals, and everybody took it, and there was money that was involved. But the notion
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  of putting a CPU maker sticker... Mac users
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  laugh because Apple just wouldn't do it. But no phone has a
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  Qualcomm inside sticker on it. It's just the CPU is reduced
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  in importance. It's just another one of the components. Now, it's obviously an important
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  component, and you can obviously spend, you know, higher-end phones have
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  more cutting-edge CPUs. But it's just a different world.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  The idea of the CPU being so supremely
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  or so extremely supreme to the
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  device, it's just no longer the case.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  They can't expect to make hundreds of dollars from a CPU in a phone.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  Right?
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  I honestly don't know if they can expect me.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  I'm talking out of my ass here, and somebody will hopefully correct me. I'm talking out of my ass,
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  but I would guess that Intel makes more money
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  from a $300 PC that gets sold
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  today with an Intel CPU than
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.000]  they would make from an ARM CPU
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  in an $800 iPhone, if they were to make the CPU for the
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  iPhone. I don't think... Well, an ARM CPU is sure
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  because they'd be licensing the ARM IP.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  Right, and part of the... Which they used to partially
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  own, but they sold it.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  Oops.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  I don't know where to go for Intel. I don't.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  They seem like they
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  should go onto the server side, and
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  I don't know enough about how those architectures work these days,
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  but it seems to me that eventually a bunch of really low-powered
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  ARM chips
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  with SSDs attached could perform a lot of the web traffic
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  that is
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  mostly what needs to be served up today.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  Yeah, I don't know what the way forward
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  for them is either, but I do think... I don't know if you need a super-powerful CPU
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  on the back end anymore. Maybe we've tapped out
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  in terms of what a single CPU needs to do, and now we're
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  looking at a hive mind of CPUs.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  I just see that... I think that the way forward for them is
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  probably not in making things for consumers.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  And whether it's the server or whatever other professional market, but that's the only way
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  for a company like Intel to make high-priced components.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  I think at the consumer level, we've entered an era where
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  those chips are all... They're all commodities now.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  Yeah. You know what?
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  I've been a long-term fan of IBM.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  And they got out when the
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  getting was good. They sold off their PC industry
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  to Lenovo. They gave up OS2
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  probably ten years too late. But they're IBM, so
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  they were supporting their customers for a long time.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  Just before you start going into OS2. I don't want to talk about OS2.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  I'm just saying that as a company, they've managed their business for like a hundred
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  and something years, and they've known when it's
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  good to let go, and they've
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  made good on their promises.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  I think that them selling the ThinkPad business when they did
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  is, in hindsight, a great example of skating
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  to where the puck is going. That they were exactly right. They sold it not
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  before it was too late. They sold it while it could still command a premium price.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  But they totally saw that that was going away. And they went to a services business.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  And they had to cut a bunch of jobs, which is unfortunate.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  But IBM, they've been
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  kicking it for like a hundred and some odd years now.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  Kind of hard to... How do you argue with that?
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  Well, that's about it for my list of topics. Anything else
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  you want to talk about? We've been going on for a while.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  WWDC is very expensive. That's the last thing I wanted to talk about.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  So, Apple finally, and I mean
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  non-sarcastically, I really do think that they should be embarrassed that they announced
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  WWDC dates only eight weeks before it actually happens.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  I think Apple's got to put on their big boy pants and
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  commit to it at least, I would say four months in advance.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  But at least twelve. I think at least twelve. But
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  anyway, they... At least twelve. Like a year in advance. No, twelve weeks.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  Twelve weeks. Twelve weeks. But you know,
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  I skipped between months and weeks there.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  So they announced WWDC dates. It's exactly when
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  everybody thought it was going to be. June 13th to
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  17th. But a lot of people have noted that, including me,
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  because I'm not buying it. I didn't enter the lottery.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  It's always easy for me to say because every year, at least since
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  2007, I've gotten a press pass for the keynotes. And in recent years
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  they've let some of the people with press passes go to conference
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  sessions and stuff like that. But so I didn't even enter the lottery.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  Because I don't want to take the lottery spot from somebody who really, really wants to go and
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  doesn't have the privilege I do of getting a press pass.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  Yeah, it's the same with me. I don't... Not that I know I could guarantee a pass, but
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  I do not. I will be there. I can talk to a lot of these people.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  It's fine. Like, I don't need a pass. I'd love to be there.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  But, man. Tight seatin'.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  It is... And it's funny. I knew that the prices for hotels
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  in downtown San Francisco have gotten more expensive.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  And my thought was... Because as someone who goes to New York a couple times a year, I know
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  that Manhattan famously, and to me rightfully so, is
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  the greatest city in the world
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  says in America. But arguably the greatest city in the world.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  It makes total sense to me that Manhattan is the most expensive hotel city that
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  I'm familiar with. And off the top of my head, it seems like not just
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  for WWDC, but the last few times I've gone out for the last year or so
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  every time I go out for an Apple event and I stay in San Francisco. It seems to me that
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  it's no longer a case of bad luck. Like, the one year
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  the iPad event in the fall was coincident with
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  the E3 gaming conference. It was
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  the big gaming conference that's in San Francisco. I don't know if that's E3 or what the name of it is.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.000]  GDA. GDA, yeah. The Game Developers
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  Conference. GDC. GDC is the association.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  Sensationally, I mean, just
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  tens of thousands of attendees. And it was like, holy cow,
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.000]  and it was held at Moscone, so it's all the downtown hotels. Super
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  expensive. But it's been the case for the last few years where it doesn't matter
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  whether it's June or March or September,
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000]  it's expensive. And then somebody pointed out to me on Twitter that
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  Bloomberg actually did a report and San Francisco is now the most expensive hotel
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  city in the world. And it was exactly, it's not just
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  me wanting to get a nice room at a cheap rate, it's actually
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  like the truth. It's more expensive than whatever the city is in Switzerland.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000]  It's more expensive than New York. It's crazy. And it really puts a damper
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  in the ability for us as a community to
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  just say, hey, even if you don't get a conference ticket or even a developer, you should
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:56.000]  come out to San Francisco that week anyway because all of us will be there together and
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  people can show up, you know, people get tickets to my live talk show,
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.000]  people can, you know, talk in hotel lobbies
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000]  and make friends and make contacts and schedule all
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000]  sorts of other events. But the sheer cost of it now is really, it's
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:16.000]  absolutely locking people out.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  I don't know what Apple can do about that. It's not Apple's fault. It really isn't. No, no.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  And there's been some suggestion that they could do it in Vegas and
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.000]  I don't think that'll fly. It doesn't work. And you know me,
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.000]  I love Vegas and I love Apple.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  I don't think it would work though. I know it's, and it's as a function
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  of having tons of really high quality
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  hotel rooms at reasonable rates, Vegas definitely has
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  that. I mean, you get a four, four and a half star room at Vegas almost
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  all the time for under $200 a night. And in terms of
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  having conference space, there's a couple of options I think they have. I've never,
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  WWC is a little different than like a convention, but you know, there's
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  a lot of places there and I know that the Aria hotel is building a new one.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  But I think it's for other reasons. I think it's off brand for Apple
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  and I don't think it works for them in terms of... They have to move a lot of people and
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  honestly, a lot of people just come up to, a lot of Apple people
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  come up because it's there. Yeah,
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  they shuttle a lot of Apple people who are involved at WWDC in some
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  degree or another, still are in Cupertino during the week
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000]  either some of the days or every day, maybe just in the morning and then
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  you know, get there. It's like, oh yeah, okay, I'll come and run a lap.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  There's an awful lot of cars shuttling forth from the south of Valley
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  up to San Francisco with Apple employees and back and forth during WWDC.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  Whereas if they held it, whether it's Vegas or any other city
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000]  that required air travel, it's everybody has to go
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000]  and everybody has to stay there all week and it adds...
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000]  It adds cost, it adds commitment, it adds disruption
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000]  and any time you do air travel like that, even if it's not changing...
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  Subtracts serendipity. Oh yeah, maybe I'll just go and show up.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000]  Well, and it adds a day before and after. Just not even talking tear down
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  and stuff like that. It just means you've got to go the day before
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:20.000]  and you've got to leave the day after as opposed to if you're just driving an hour
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  down there, you know, it's a little different. Yeah, it won't leave the Valley.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Yeah, I think... Yeah, it's like if they could find another option in
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  the Valley, maybe, but you know, it's like in the old
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  days... I never went to one in San Jose. Like the first
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  WWDC I went to, it was already in San Francisco at Moscone.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  I went to a GDC in San Jose back in the
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000]  old days. But you and I have friends, good friends, you know, like Chris,
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  you know, your partner with Napkin at
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  Aged and Distilled, who, you know, I think he was probably at Adobe
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  back then, right? Yeah, pretty sure. So back when he was at Adobe at the
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  San Jose era WWDCs, Brent Simmons
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  had been to a San Jose era WWDC.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  Everybody agrees that in terms of, you know, the social aspects
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  of it, it was terrible because San Jose, like the light, you know, they turn out the lights at
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  5 o'clock in the afternoon. And so you just lose all sorts of
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  social serendipity.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  And I don't think it's big enough anymore. I really don't. No, no, you can't do it there anymore.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  They could maybe open the other Moscone portions, but...
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  Quite frankly though, in the early years of Daring Fireball,
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  in the first at least five years that I went to WWDC,
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  I wouldn't have been able to afford it if the hotels were as expensive then as they are now.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  No. No, I mean
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  I find it obscene now.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  And it hurts too. I find that air travel has gotten more expensive too.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  I don't know what the reason for that is, but it may be specific to
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  the Philly, the SFO route, and the way that the airline options
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  out of Philadelphia have changed since then.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  It's becoming like a five grand adventure.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  One week costs you about five grand, I'm going to guess.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  At least, it's really almost sickening.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  Not to be gross, like crass about it, but I mean, that's like
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  serious money. No, that's like really like
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  how do you spend that kind of money without really thinking about
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  is this worthwhile to attend? You could go to like a really nice
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  vacation resort somewhere for a lot less money than to go there
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  and have some bum urinating on the sidewalk
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  in front of you. I love San Francisco, but
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  let's face it, it's not a resort destination.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  It's really crazy how expensive it is, and I don't know what to do. I bet Apple
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  actually is a little concerned about that. But on the other hand,
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  it sells out so fast that they have to have a lottery. The last time they didn't have
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  a lottery, it literally sold out in under a minute.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  Every single ticket for sale sold out in under a minute.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  I think the last one I got to, you texted me at like 8.30 in the morning.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  And I was like, I just pressed okay until I managed
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  to buy a ticket. That was a couple of years ago.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  Yeah, I think it was three years ago. I think this might be
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  the second year of a lottery, I think.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  It's not like they're going to have trouble filling out the
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  seats. And I think for the student scholarships, I know that they announced
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  this year that they're going to institute, they're going to have travel plans
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  or they're going to help with travel for some of the student scholarships too, which I can only
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  assume includes a hotel, whether it's free or
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  whether it's just discount or just a relatively
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  low reasonable price that includes
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  the hotel accommodations. I couldn't afford even
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  half of what we've been seeing.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  What park was, what, 400 bucks a night?
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  At least, yeah. When I looked the other day, the park
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  55, which is to me the baseline hotel in the neighborhood,
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  is 409 dollars a night, which is insane.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  It's just insane.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  The park 55, I like those guys, I do.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  But I mean, 400 bucks a night. It's a fine hotel, but
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  it is, I feel like somebody's getting bribed to have it on the four
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  star list instead of the three and a half star list.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  It was always like, well, it's not the best, but at 189
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  dollars a night, I'd rather save the money, you know what I mean?
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  You could get a better hotel for 250 dollars a night back then, but you'd think
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  like, well wait, I'm coming out for six nights, that's 50 and he had a fee, it's like
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  almost 400 bucks, it's like, for 400 bucks I'll stay at the park 55.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  But now that they've got the prices over 300 dollars, 400 dollars,
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  it's like, you gotta be kidding me. 400 dollars a night to stay in this place that looks like it came out of
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Do you remember when the intercontinental just opened and it was like
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  10 bucks a night kind of thing? The park 55 reminds me
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  it just seems to me like it's like the nicest hotel in
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  East Berlin during the Cold War.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  Because of the grotesque architecture. Yeah, the brutalist architecture and
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  the way that they think that this is what we think a nice hotel is like.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  It's just crazy, it's absolutely crazy.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  There's no more, see, there used to be, the other thing too is we've got, you know, amongst our pals
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  and their little friends we have, somebody would figure out some way
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  every year, somebody would go through Hotwire or Priceline
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  or something like that and they're like, hey, if you go through Hotwire and search for
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  a hotel within one mile of this location
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  there's a four star option and it's only 179 dollars
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  a night and I booked it and it's the such and such hotel which is
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  right, it's a great hotel. And then everybody would quick do it and we'd get a
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  everybody would figure out, there's no more, there's no secret anymore to getting a
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  hotel in San Francisco. You know what, that never worked for me because I'm Canadian.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  And like, whatever service they used, it was probably Kufasa,
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  whatever service it was like. Yeah, U.S. people only.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  I'm like, okay, get something full price.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  That's crazy. Yeah, I don't know what Apple can do or anybody can do.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  No, they can't fix that. I can't help but think, and I could be wrong,
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  I mean, you know, it's only a bubble if it pops, but I can't help but think that
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  the San Francisco go-go economy
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  is a bit of a bubble and that it'll come back down to earth. Because I don't think
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  it's the natural state of affairs that San Francisco is
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  more desirable than Manhattan.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  I like San Francisco a lot as a city, but
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  no, I agree with you. I feel like one way or the other, either the economy
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  pops and the prices go back down or they build enough new hotels that
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  the supply and demand
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  equation changes. But somebody was saying on Twitter that there aren't really any
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  plans for new hotels, that there's a couple, but no plans for hotels
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  that would be sufficient to really change the overall supply and demand ratio.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  So we're stuck. Well, hotels are more, I mean,
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  try living there, right? Talk to our friends.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, nobody likes that. Some of the suggestions people
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  had on Twitter, and they're reasonable, and maybe this is what
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  I would do if I couldn't afford it now,
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  if it was ten years ago in the early days during Fireball, is people are saying you can
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  stay out by the airport for a lot less
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  and take like an UberX into the city every day and take it back at night,
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  which sounds crazy because the Ubers from SFO to downtown is
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  it's not cheap, but way cheaper. It's about thirty bucks a pop.
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  Right. And my plan is
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  to just stay down in Pacifica, and that'll be about
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  twenty bucks. And a lot
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  of explaining to my girlfriend. I'm sorry I'm showing up at five o'clock in the morning.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  I'm just going to sleep in the garage.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  My plan is to spend just a sickening amount of money on one of the regular hotels.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  I've got one already. And the other thing too, the other last thing is that
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  booking in advance was not any sort of benefit either.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  Because I had a guess as to when the WWDC would be.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  It was right. And I booked a hotel room months ago. I think it was
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  like January. At a terrible rate.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  At an absolutely terrible rate. But I know I like the hotel and
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  I was worried that
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  it might get so busy that it would be hard to
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  get a room at any rate if I waited until after it was announced.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  And so I booked it not because hey I'm going to lock in a great rate. I booked it because
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  I thought well at least this way I know I have a hotel at least a reasonable
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  by today's standard San Francisco rate. But it's refundable and
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  I'll just keep searching and hoping that maybe in the last week or two
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  there might be some deals. I can get a refund
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  up until like Friday before WWDC starts.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  So when you check in and they ask you how many keys you want, you're going to say
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  two, right? I always get two.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  Cool. Fine. Perfect. I'll have my friend Guy with me.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  Problem solved. Yes.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  Two queens.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  Guy English.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  Thank you for doing the show. This has been a great talk.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  It's always fun. People can get all the Guy English they want on Twitter
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  at G-T-E.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  G-T-E.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  And they can see your great app Napkin
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  at Aged and Distilled. The Mac App Store. Yeah or the Mac App Store.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  I got a podcast still called The Deebok that you can check out
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  where we interview people about, oddly enough, computer history.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  With fellow long-time friend of the talk show Rene Ritchie.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  Yeah. That guy's not a dummy.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  Also, I don't know how, he's the nicest
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  guy in the world.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  To me, just talking about all this stuff just turns you cynical. How do you not get
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  cynical? And that son of a bitch, Rene Ritchie, does not have a... He's like the Canadian's Canadian.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  He is the Canadian. He doesn't have a cynical bone in his...
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  He's one of the nicest people I've ever met. Alright. Thank you, Guy.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  Thank you, Joe. Have a good week. You too.
