[00:00.000 --> 00:03.940]  It's good to have you on Skype tells me that we haven't talked on Skype for over a year
[00:03.940 --> 00:07.300]  I think that's their polite way of saying it's been too long since you've been on the show
[00:07.820 --> 00:09.820]  Yeah, definitely too long. She's
[00:19.960 --> 00:21.960]  Anyway big week for you
[00:22.380 --> 00:27.820]  Congratulations. I'm really happy for you. Oh, thanks so much. Yeah, it's it's been really huge, you know
[00:27.820 --> 00:33.180]  And I feel great because I made the app I wanted to make I could see it in my head
[00:33.740 --> 00:41.100]  For all these years and I had certain goals and met them and the feedback has just been tremendous. So yeah super happy
[00:41.140 --> 00:45.660]  So for those who don't know although I'm suspect I suspect that most people listening do know net news wire
[00:46.620 --> 00:47.720]  5.0
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.080]  Shipped this week. I made fun of you. I think you listened to my show with Jim
[00:52.080 --> 00:55.020]  I did I yeah, I've made fun of you in a very friendly way about your
[00:55.020 --> 00:56.700]  personal
[00:56.700 --> 00:58.700]  definitions of the alpha beta
[00:59.140 --> 01:06.220]  Yeah, I mean I've been using I've been using net news wire this your your new net news wire in a weird way
[01:06.220 --> 01:11.380]  Sort of a 2.0. Maybe a 3.0. If you say that you originally had net news wire
[01:11.380 --> 01:14.260]  I don't want to confuse anybody the new version is 5.0
[01:14.500 --> 01:19.300]  But there was I would say the third era of net news wire, you know
[01:19.300 --> 01:26.180]  Yeah, definitely was the original we can get into all this in detail. There was yours from the early 2000s then there was
[01:27.460 --> 01:33.840]  Maybe four eras, maybe maybe the who was the company that bought it when they Newsgator Newsgator
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.940]  I would I would sort of say though that was sort of a continuation of the original era
[01:37.940 --> 01:44.860]  It's just new ownership. Then there's the black pixel era and and now there's the new open source back in Brent Simmons hand era
[01:45.220 --> 01:47.220]  Yeah
[01:47.220 --> 01:48.300]  I
[01:48.300 --> 01:52.300]  I've been using it this version this year this new era from
[01:53.020 --> 01:59.260]  It barely worked. It was called evergreen for a while because black black pixel still owned the net news wire name
[01:59.660 --> 02:05.860]  I don't even think you were calling them alphas. I don't even know what the hell the version numbers were D for development D for development
[02:05.860 --> 02:08.360]  That's right. Yeah, I've been using it since then and
[02:09.060 --> 02:11.260]  I'd never really stopped using the RSS
[02:12.100 --> 02:16.100]  but I was actually my other RSS reader while evergreen was
[02:16.100 --> 02:20.380]  it either only barely or non-functional was
[02:21.300 --> 02:26.340]  Net news wire three point three two, right? Of course still my biggest competition
[02:26.340 --> 02:31.860]  I'm sure but I have the advantage that it's gonna stop working on Catalina. So the weird thing about this
[02:31.860 --> 02:33.780]  I know you and I've talked about it
[02:33.780 --> 02:37.340]  It's just such a bizarre coincidence that that the last
[02:38.420 --> 02:43.340]  Brent Simmons version of net news wire was net news wire three point three two
[02:43.340 --> 02:44.980]  and
[02:44.980 --> 02:50.900]  And again, no offense to my friends at black pixel who do excellent work and and whose version of net news wire was in many
[02:50.900 --> 02:57.280]  Ways certainly more modern looking and enacting then that news wire three point three two and kept up with the times
[02:58.820 --> 03:01.180]  It just didn't fit my brain the right way
[03:02.300 --> 03:05.940]  So I just kept using what I was familiar with net news wire three point three two
[03:06.220 --> 03:09.620]  But back in the day in the 90s Quark Express
[03:09.620 --> 03:12.940]  Hit version three point three two
[03:14.460 --> 03:15.780]  This was when I was in college
[03:15.780 --> 03:19.500]  So, you know, I don't know what time it came out, but it probably would have been sometime around 90
[03:20.500 --> 03:25.820]  1995 or so and you know again every company has their own weird ways of doing version numbers
[03:25.820 --> 03:30.520]  It's it's one of the ways that we pretend that software engineering is this incredibly
[03:31.260 --> 03:36.840]  Scientific rigorous field and everybody just wings it with virgin. I mean right with Vesper we
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.720]  We goofed around and tried to make everything have a double-oh-seven in it. That's right
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.840]  Our best release has always had a double-oh-seven. Yeah
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  But Quark had this thing where it was three point three two wasn't three point three point two is three point three two
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.520]  Although I think it was a the way they did that tenth of a digit or hundred digit
[03:57.520 --> 04:04.400]  Whatever you want to call it. The two was what most developers would have called three point three point two not three point thirty two
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.820]  But then they also had our updates. So it was three point three two and I
[04:10.600 --> 04:17.080]  This is perverted because I can't even remember what I had for dinner last night, but I can remember it was three point three two r5
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.480]  Minor minor bug pack. Mm-hmm. I don't even remember how we used to
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.360]  Install them back then I guess we had the internet and we get them over it and and by 95
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.760]  Yeah, maybe yeah and our you know and quark was very you know as the entire, you know
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.980]  Adobe's apps and everybody in the graphic design industry. I mean piracy was rampant, but they had you know, so they had all sorts of anti-piracy
[04:43.820 --> 04:48.720]  You know checks, you know against other copies running on the local Apple talk network and stuff
[04:48.720 --> 04:51.080]  So our student newspaper at Drexel we were totally legit
[04:51.080 --> 04:56.580]  I forget how many how many Macs we had that had quark installed, but every single one of them had a legit license
[04:56.580 --> 04:58.720]  It was totally legit, you know, so I guess it was
[04:58.720 --> 05:03.900]  With a legit license. It was kind of easy and you felt confident installing patches
[05:03.900 --> 05:08.160]  Like with like if you were pirating like Photoshop or something, it was always a bit of a worry
[05:08.160 --> 05:11.640]  Yeah, I'll get to the latest version. So what if they patch the way that
[05:12.360 --> 05:14.880]  Somebody cracked my you know, the serial number etc
[05:15.200 --> 05:19.280]  But anyway, it just is so funny to me that two of the most used apps in my life
[05:19.880 --> 05:23.780]  Stalled for a long time at three point three two. Yep
[05:23.780 --> 05:29.900]  What does it mean? Nothing, but yeah, she means it should be in my passwords
[05:32.660 --> 05:38.580]  So let's look back at the history so net news wire and I know it's been but it has been years
[05:38.580 --> 05:41.020]  So I think it's okay if we rehash this and we've talked about this
[05:41.020 --> 05:46.860]  Oh sure about this on the show but net news wire and daring fireball sort of came about at the same time
[05:47.580 --> 05:49.580]  Daring fireball I started in August
[05:49.580 --> 05:54.520]  2002 and I believe 2002 was when net news wire shipped
[05:54.980 --> 06:01.120]  Yeah, I started working on net news wire in 2002 net news wire light 1.0 shipped maybe that fall
[06:01.760 --> 06:08.680]  And then net news wire 1.0 full version shipped in like February or March maybe the following year
[06:08.680 --> 06:13.860]  Yeah, so but it was all very, you know public betas and all this stuff. So yeah, it was it was very out there
[06:13.860 --> 06:15.520]  I don't and again I
[06:15.520 --> 06:21.600]  As with many of my longest and best internet friends. I really have no memory of how you and I met
[06:24.520 --> 06:30.520]  I think we met by email somehow like we were on yeah, maybe a bbedit mailing list or something. I
[06:31.040 --> 06:36.440]  Somehow I feel like we knew each other online before we met in person, but I don't know. Yeah for sure
[06:36.440 --> 06:41.880]  We must um, yeah. Yeah, we definitely knew each other online because we didn't meet in person for a few years later
[06:41.880 --> 06:45.520]  I don't remember how we met online, but I do remember early
[06:46.400 --> 06:52.760]  And very early in the net news wire days reading this new daring fireball blog and thinking wow this youngster
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.360]  He seems to be doing pretty well real up-and-comer. I think I'll add him to the default feeds list
[06:59.840 --> 07:05.600]  Being on the net news word default the feed list for me at least was a huge boost because I think the overlap between
[07:05.600 --> 07:12.940]  The audience that net news wire appealed to and the people who I think would it would and probably still do enjoy
[07:13.560 --> 07:15.000]  my writing
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.440]  was a large amount of overlap my one of my favorite stories about net news wire and
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.520]  the founding of daring fireball is
[07:23.560 --> 07:25.560]  back in the early 2000s
[07:26.600 --> 07:33.960]  I'm still running movable type of daring fireball, but it movable type was brand new and it was it was a breakthrough because it was
[07:33.960 --> 07:40.760]  Relatively easy to install, you know, so you could just pay five bucks a month at a shared host like dream host or pair
[07:41.400 --> 07:44.080]  Also, you know dream host is still around. I think you're still using them
[07:44.120 --> 07:49.160]  Oh, yeah, I still have an account at pair pairs been around since the 90s great company out of Pittsburgh
[07:49.480 --> 07:55.760]  but you could get you know pay, you know, four five six bucks a month or something like that you get a shared hosting account and
[07:56.560 --> 08:01.280]  you'd have a zip file and you'd move it up to the CGI bin and unpack it and
[08:01.280 --> 08:05.280]  And then you'd edit there'd be like one of the files would be the one you'd edit with
[08:06.200 --> 08:11.440]  You know put a password in there and and you know customize whatever and then boom
[08:11.440 --> 08:15.200]  You've got movable type installed and you could you know a bunch of default templates
[08:16.100 --> 08:22.620]  You know and and I forget when WordPress came out, but it wasn't too long after and there was a predecessor to WordPress
[08:22.620 --> 08:24.620]  I think called gray matter and
[08:25.560 --> 08:29.080]  rings a bell and of course user land had
[08:29.080 --> 08:34.840]  Had the what was the radio the user land? Yeah before that we had Manila
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.360]  Which was a hosted thing Manila is the one that I worked on most
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.200]  But a lot of these, you know, and it really was the it was when blogging
[08:43.920 --> 08:51.160]  Exploded in popularity based and a big part of it was prior to the release of these open source or or and or commercial packages
[08:51.160 --> 08:53.160]  like radio or Manila
[08:53.160 --> 08:59.840]  It you only way you could have a blog was if you wrote your own little system of doing it
[08:59.840 --> 09:02.480]  Or you just hand-edited HTML
[09:02.480 --> 09:08.960]  I mean that's how Zelman for years Jeffrey's elements extremely popular site was just and edited HTML for years
[09:10.520 --> 09:16.640]  Which was aid, you know not an enjoyable experience even if you know HTML and be
[09:16.640 --> 09:23.280]  a sort of required technical expertise that a lot of people who could be should be in our
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.280]  Terrific writers and bloggers don't have and don't want to have all of a sudden with these packages boom
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.040]  You know it opened the door to lots of other people and it's of course only gotten easier since then
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.240]  But one of the things was that was a telltale thing was that you could kind of tell from most people sites
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.560]  What what they were using as their back end because they either stuck to one of the default templates
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.280]  Or they took one of the default templates, and then just sort of tweaked it tweak the colors
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.720]  Maybe added a custom logo at the top or something like that right you could oh, yeah, that was very true
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.920]  Yeah, you could tell a movable type site or instantly yeah, so movable type the others
[09:56.920 --> 10:04.400]  Yeah, one of the weird things about movable type was that it like when I got started like in 2002 the default templates all had
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.800]  Three RSS feeds over on the side. It was like you'd have a link for RSS
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.080]  RSS zero point nine one zero point or one point oh and then RSS
[10:16.080 --> 10:18.280]  I guess RSS 2.0. Wasn't out yet
[10:18.280 --> 10:24.960]  I don't know, but there you know in a weird way that RSS had these weird forks and multiple versions that
[10:25.600 --> 10:31.880]  Weren't really they were more different than each other than the version numbers made it look speaking of version numbers being weird
[10:32.520 --> 10:35.260]  Moveable type just get just by default gave you all three
[10:35.260 --> 10:40.720]  Right right and so it was just you know those were very nerdy days, and yes, somebody thought well
[10:40.720 --> 10:47.860]  Let's give people a choice. Why not right so the way I did daring fireball was I installed it
[10:48.580 --> 10:53.460]  And was torn between whether I should write my own system or use movable type, and it's I always think in hindsight
[10:53.860 --> 10:55.220]  There's what a lot of times
[10:55.220 --> 10:57.260]  I regret not writing my own thing from scratch
[10:57.260 --> 11:05.260]  And then there's other times where I think well that I probably wouldn't have gotten during fireball started until like 2009 if I'd done
[11:05.380 --> 11:08.660]  Tweaking your pearl yeah, I don't know on the other hand I got marked out
[11:08.660 --> 11:11.620]  I got marked on out pretty quick, so maybe I could have yeah, I don't know it's hard
[11:11.620 --> 11:16.300]  It's it's you know one of those mysteries will never have answered, but anyway. I installed it
[11:16.940 --> 11:22.180]  Looked at the default templates. I didn't do anything with it. There's no public remnants of that experimentation left
[11:22.180 --> 11:26.620]  I never told anybody it was just me trying to figure out how it all worked would this suit my needs
[11:26.620 --> 11:30.780]  Is this a better use of my time you know can I customize it can I still customize everything the way?
[11:30.780 --> 11:38.340]  I want it figured out that I could and then in start of starting with a template and tweaking it. I started from nothing
[11:38.340 --> 11:44.540]  I just erased everything figured out how the template system worked and built the way daring fireball looks from scratch and
[11:45.180 --> 11:52.460]  You know and I was you know like one window was my what I was building from scratch from a totally blank slate
[11:52.460 --> 11:55.180]  a literally blank slate gray
[11:56.460 --> 12:02.820]  And on the other was like their default template for the same thing so like here's the default template for your home page of your
[12:02.820 --> 12:07.660]  Block and I'd look at what they had and I'd look at what I wanted and you know I could say oh
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.260]  Here's how you do that. Here's how you get dates
[12:09.260 --> 12:12.620]  I can kind of see how you format dates blah blah blah and I copy and paste it over
[12:13.020 --> 12:16.500]  And I got to the RSS part, and I was like what the fuck is this shit
[12:16.500 --> 12:20.340]  I honestly didn't get it and they called it syndication and the only
[12:20.340 --> 12:27.260]  Syndication the way I thought of the word syndication as a media nerd was like syndicated newspaper columnists
[12:27.260 --> 12:29.260]  Right like you know
[12:29.940 --> 12:35.700]  They can sit on X2 yeah in comics right so like Calvin and Hobbes was syndicated so then you know
[12:35.900 --> 12:41.820]  500 newspapers across the country or the world all had the same comics and there were national
[12:42.540 --> 12:48.180]  Op-ed columnists, so you know not everybody can be the New York Times where they have their own stable of in-house
[12:48.180 --> 12:50.220]  award-winning columnists
[12:50.220 --> 12:56.180]  You know small-town papers would you know and still do I guess have syndicated columnists well?
[12:56.180 --> 13:00.340]  I thought well why would I want to be syndicated? I want people to read my stuff at my site
[13:00.340 --> 13:02.260]  I don't understand this at all doesn't this mean
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.760]  What does this mean if I have this syndication that people can put my articles on their site forget it?
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.180]  I didn't understand. I really didn't understand what the hell it was for why there were three versions
[13:12.340 --> 13:17.700]  Anyway, the whole point of the story is then when net news wire shipped or started shipping
[13:17.700 --> 13:20.060]  And I was started using the betas it all just clicked
[13:20.060 --> 13:24.660]  I was like oh I get it it so you can read all these you can see when there's new articles and read them
[13:24.660 --> 13:29.340]  Right here. Oh, I better quick and then like immediately like pick one within 30 minutes
[13:29.340 --> 13:33.180]  I had an RSS feed on during fireball. Yeah right on
[13:34.860 --> 13:39.340]  But I literally it was net news wire that made art that made me understand
[13:39.340 --> 13:46.260]  What RS that the potential and what it was meant to be I think it was a lot of people's first exposure to RSS
[13:46.260 --> 13:50.740]  The readers before then there hadn't been like a desktop
[13:51.340 --> 13:56.820]  Reader like this right been a number of browser-based ones some that you could run locally even but
[13:57.420 --> 14:01.460]  there hadn't been like an app you could just download and you know start going and
[14:02.280 --> 14:05.740]  Yeah, so for you, and I think a lot of people that was that was their first exposure
[14:06.460 --> 14:13.260]  The other interesting thing and in hindsight and here we are in 2019. It's a very different story, but
[14:13.260 --> 14:17.980]  And it just makes the the complete 17 year
[14:18.980 --> 14:25.900]  storyline so interesting to me is that in 2002 Coco the the you know application programming
[14:26.740 --> 14:28.420]  frameworks
[14:28.420 --> 14:36.200]  That were new with Mac new to the Mac with Mac OS X and came over from next step with Apple's
[14:37.180 --> 14:39.940]  acquisition slash reunification with next in
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.940]  1997
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.980]  Was
[14:45.980 --> 14:50.220]  uncertain like longtime Mac developers were looking at it with a still in
[14:50.460 --> 14:55.620]  2002 even with a quizzical I you know, and there was still open, you know, there were vigorous debates
[14:56.780 --> 15:03.020]  Over the carbon versus cocoa versus the pragmatic. Hey, I'm just gonna do whatever it is that works which is
[15:03.940 --> 15:08.280]  you know, I think the right way to have looked at it all along rather than be
[15:08.280 --> 15:10.880]  religious or dogmatic about one side or the other
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.480]  But part of it part of your inspiration was it wasn't just that you wanted to make a good reader
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.480]  It was that you wanted to make
[15:18.480 --> 15:20.080]  You know
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.680]  You you were intrigued by cocoa and really wanted this. This was something you could really sink your teeth into
[15:25.480 --> 15:32.160]  Yeah, absolutely. I had been coming from working on an app that started on Mac OS 7
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.280]  I guess and had been carbonized for OS 10
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.560]  but I was no longer with that company and I wanted to
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.440]  write something new and at that point it seemed like writing something new and cocoa would be great because
[15:45.880 --> 15:52.240]  It cocoa just did so much more so much more easily than writing everything using them
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.720]  Using the Macintosh toolbox or carbon whatever you want to call it
[15:56.480 --> 15:58.480]  That just left so much
[15:58.640 --> 16:01.600]  So much for you to handle that cocoa just like did
[16:01.600 --> 16:08.160]  And I part of me just couldn't believe it. Like wait a minute. They just up and did all these things for me
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.180]  I don't have to deal with I just found that amazing and yeah
[16:12.180 --> 16:18.200]  So I think it was about 10 months from start to to shipping net news where I won point out
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.200]  And I was learning cocoa. I was brand new to it. But still yeah, it really accelerated the development
[16:24.960 --> 16:30.360]  And was just so much fun and it resulted in something that
[16:30.360 --> 16:31.760]  and
[16:31.760 --> 16:38.700]  I think this is true of net newswire 5 shipping this week that felt so at home with the system
[16:39.200 --> 16:41.800]  Looked felt it's like, you know
[16:43.560 --> 16:44.840]  It
[16:44.840 --> 16:47.440]  It breaks down for a lot of apps in a lot of ways
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.160]  But sometimes it usually it's a compliment if you can say about a third-party app
[16:52.160 --> 16:57.560]  This looks like what it should look like what we would hope it would look like if Apple were to do this
[16:57.560 --> 17:04.560]  Mm-hmm, you know and in a lot of ways that the the one comparison and you know
[17:04.560 --> 17:05.720]  We could get into it later
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.440]  But one obvious comparison and something I'm I know for a fact that you've looked at over the years many times is well
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.440]  How does Apple Mail do blank because yeah reading email and reading RSS?
[17:18.120 --> 17:21.880]  there's a lot of similarities, you know a feed is similar to a
[17:21.880 --> 17:29.360]  mailbox or an account perhaps and then in the account is a bunch of messages and in a feed are a bunch of
[17:29.360 --> 17:32.880]  Articles and you click on an article or you click on a message and then you read the message
[17:33.440 --> 17:35.440]  Or you read the article
[17:36.220 --> 17:38.600]  You know and mail back then had drawers
[17:39.640 --> 17:41.640]  Yes. Yes it did. Yeah
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.560]  That newswire had drawers drawers were very cool
[17:44.920 --> 17:51.800]  Yeah, though to be fair net newswire never put the source list in a drawer where mail actually did in those days
[17:51.800 --> 17:54.160]  Yeah, I do know your mailboxes were in a drawer. Yeah
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.820]  Net news wires drawer was used for a directory of feeds. I remember that right? Yeah
[18:00.840 --> 18:03.600]  Yeah, which was an awful lot of work to maintain
[18:04.840 --> 18:12.680]  So I'm not still doing that though. I kind of wish I did but boy, it's just too much work. It's it's interesting
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.960]  because
[18:15.960 --> 18:17.960]  I
[18:19.880 --> 18:25.220]  There's a you know, and I think a lot of the coverage this week of net news wire is sort of a
[18:26.040 --> 18:31.520]  Hey, it's not just the hey net news wires back. But a hey is RSS making a comeback and
[18:32.720 --> 18:40.680]  In some ways it's warranted because I think the heyday of reading people's blogs via RSS was certainly a decade ago
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.160]  But it's a weird it's also a weird thing because in a way
[18:45.160 --> 18:52.040]  RSS has never ever ever been more popular and continues to grow at a crazy rate because of
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.480]  podcasts and podcasts are all
[18:56.120 --> 18:58.120]  RSS feeds every single podcast
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.320]  Well, maybe not every I guess there's now these weird ones that you have to sign up for a
[19:03.280 --> 19:07.720]  Specific app and and they're tied to a paid service or something
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.720]  But I wouldn't call that a podcast. I wouldn't either. I've argued that I wouldn't you know, it's just a show
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.880]  it's an audio show and we've had audio shows for ever since Edison invented the radio, but
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.240]  You know, but what everybody thinks of as podcasts including my podcasts
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.120]  The Omni podcast that you host, you know that they are
[19:29.800 --> 19:31.800]  distributed to whatever
[19:31.800 --> 19:38.360]  Podcast app you use to listen by RSS and each episode is an RSS entry. So it's
[19:40.200 --> 19:43.160]  Astoundingly popular and even though people don't realize it
[19:44.280 --> 19:49.280]  You know, you have no reason it's it's plumbing in that case. It's right. Yeah. Why you shouldn't have to know, right?
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.560]  I don't know how many you know, the the staggering growth and the listeners of podcasts
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.520]  You know, I'm sure that literally I'll bet ninety-eight percent of them. Maybe ninety-nine percent of them
[19:58.520 --> 20:02.800]  Maybe ninety-nine percent of them have never even heard of the initials RSS, right? And that's fine
[20:02.960 --> 20:10.640]  but one of the things that that that Apple has done as the I think very honorably as the steward of the
[20:10.680 --> 20:12.280]  iTunes
[20:12.280 --> 20:13.720]  podcast
[20:13.720 --> 20:17.360]  App and directory is they've made that directory
[20:17.880 --> 20:23.580]  Open to third-party clients, not just third-party clients on their own platforms, you know, like
[20:23.580 --> 20:31.340]  a Android podcast apps can use the iTunes directory to get what you were trying to do with net newswire, which is like
[20:31.580 --> 20:33.580]  Let's just have a list of as many
[20:34.020 --> 20:38.220]  Good RSS good or even decent, you know anything that's not really what I mean
[20:38.220 --> 20:43.180]  I don't know what your criteria were but for the most part what seems like with Apple is as long as it's not
[20:43.580 --> 20:45.580]  you know hate speech and or
[20:46.620 --> 20:49.940]  like pornography or something that you know, they listed in the
[20:49.940 --> 20:51.940]  The
[20:52.300 --> 20:55.180]  iTunes podcast directory and so third-party apps like
[20:56.020 --> 21:02.500]  Overcast and and whatever else can let can you can search for a feed and they can just find it, right?
[21:02.500 --> 21:06.860]  So you can search for ommi and the Omni shows
[21:08.180 --> 21:12.880]  Is that the name of the podcast the Omni show the Omni show? Yeah, right the Omni show will will show up
[21:12.880 --> 21:20.760]  and so you don't even need to do the tricky thing, which is find a URL to the RSS feed for the Omni show and
[21:21.480 --> 21:25.980]  Paste that and manage a list of URL subscriptions. You could just go to a directory and do it
[21:25.980 --> 21:30.960]  so there's certainly merit there and I think the way that it's worked out with podcasts has certainly shown that there is but
[21:31.560 --> 21:37.280]  You need somebody like Apple at the heart of it to aid who you can trust and be who can do the hard work of
[21:37.280 --> 21:42.920]  Maintaining this ever-growing mountainous database of feeds
[21:43.760 --> 21:45.480]  yeah, and I've
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.000]  Just last night. I was thinking like that would be another great open source project. Hmm
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  No, we could get people, you know involved
[21:52.040 --> 21:58.500]  But then I thought and I've really got my hands full just with menus wire. I would really like somebody else to do this
[21:59.300 --> 22:02.880]  you know, there are a lot of things like that, but that would be so helpful in in
[22:02.880 --> 22:07.240]  Bringing us back to the open web. Another one. I've talked a lot about is
[22:07.880 --> 22:09.760]  Something like Technorati, you know
[22:09.760 --> 22:14.120]  Those these blog search engines the index a bunch of blogs and if I want to go see
[22:14.240 --> 22:17.400]  Who on the blogosphere is talking about net newswire, you know?
[22:17.400 --> 22:22.740]  I have a feed that watches for that. And so I see that from wherever, you know, whenever it comes up
[22:23.360 --> 22:26.360]  We used to have a bunch of this stuff and we don't anymore
[22:27.440 --> 22:28.920]  Yeah, I haven't thought it comes back
[22:28.920 --> 22:35.960]  I haven't thought of Technorati in a long time and there was a time when man was that super useful. Oh sure
[22:35.960 --> 22:41.240]  Yeah, how there were some smaller things like blog bridge and I think yeah who even had a blog search engine
[22:41.240 --> 22:45.040]  And they were all pretty useful. Yeah, but it was definitely an interesting way to find
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.640]  Not just when people were talking about a topic you're interested in but as somebody who had a blog you could find
[22:52.960 --> 22:57.160]  You I would constantly find like I you know interesting
[22:57.160 --> 23:02.320]  Blog posts linking to my own blog posts, you know, you could search Technorati
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.400]  I forget how you did it, but it wasn't too hard and you could search for
[23:06.280 --> 23:10.360]  you know blog posts that they had indexed that linked to daring fireball dotnet and I
[23:10.880 --> 23:13.240]  Frequently found things that I had not seen before
[23:14.160 --> 23:16.480]  Yeah, and that's in those days. That's the way we had
[23:17.200 --> 23:20.060]  Conversations they were just kind of ad hoc across the web
[23:20.720 --> 23:25.400]  And you know, so somebody wrote something linked to me. I might have some kind of reply
[23:25.400 --> 23:31.760]  well, that's another blog post and I would link back to whatever they wrote and you know, that's not as easy as as
[23:32.760 --> 23:36.240]  Twitter but it was more substantial I think
[23:37.400 --> 23:41.220]  I think it was definitely more substantial. I mean and again there's trade-offs
[23:41.220 --> 23:47.000]  it's you know, like with everything I'm not gonna say Twitter's bad or Twitter ruined it and there's a certain convenience and there's
[23:47.600 --> 23:50.840]  There are certain advantages to the centralization of Twitter
[23:50.840 --> 23:58.560]  And knowing that there's just one place where I can look at for at replies to at Gruber and find a bunch of conversations
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.000]  But boy even at 280 characters the modern limit it's it it loses a lot of nuance
[24:06.520 --> 24:09.120]  Yeah, sure does. Yeah, and then there are
[24:09.960 --> 24:12.120]  disadvantages to that centralization, too
[24:14.560 --> 24:17.720]  So I tend to I tend to prefer
[24:17.720 --> 24:23.920]  Decentralized systems up on the on the grounds that even if Twitter were not borderline evil
[24:23.920 --> 24:27.440]  That's just way too much power in the hands of you know
[24:27.960 --> 24:30.920]  Unaccountable people. Yeah. Yeah, I agree
[24:33.480 --> 24:40.000]  Yeah on the whole I would take the trade-offs of the web we had circa 2005 2006
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.520]  Which really you know and it coincidentally was right around when Twitter first popped up
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.720]  I think coincidentally, I don't think Twitter's, you know, I think that even if Twitter itself had never
[24:53.800 --> 24:56.400]  Become popular I still think the same sort of
[24:57.400 --> 25:03.040]  shift away, I mean somebody some other platform would have done the Facebook ization and
[25:03.920 --> 25:05.840]  Twitter is a
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.040]  of
[25:07.040 --> 25:09.840]  And you know centralization of of this sort of thing
[25:10.320 --> 25:13.680]  Yeah in another timeline we have different names for these same things
[25:13.680 --> 25:15.680]  It's just some other companies did it
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.720]  It is interesting though, it does seem like a lot of people are starting to push back on this
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.120]  I saw David Hannah Meyer Hanson had a nice tweet
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.800]  Linking to the suite setups review of net news wire 5
[25:31.920 --> 25:33.920]  And just mentioned one of many
[25:34.160 --> 25:41.240]  Excellent points to be made about getting but if you've gotten away from RSS feed reading like just the fact that you know
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.480]  You don't get tracked. It's not about throwing tracking ads at you and stuff like that
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.680]  Yeah, absolutely, right I said something about corporate surveillance I think yeah, that's you know
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.680]  That's one of the things you can get away from
[25:57.320 --> 26:03.000]  Actually can do it. Have you noticed because then the other thing that is sort of like what's old is new again
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.280]  And I don't think it's a coincidence. I think it's sort of tied to the potential for RSS reading
[26:08.280 --> 26:15.200]  Again, I with my whole aside from five minutes ago about how RSS is more popular than ever because of podcasting
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.880]  Henceforth when I'm talking about RSS reading. I'm really talking about sort of the net news wire
[26:21.080 --> 26:26.600]  Sort of genre of feed reading where you're reading articles mostly from people who write blogs
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  But the other thing that's really
[26:31.560 --> 26:34.360]  Resurged in popularity is email newsletters
[26:34.360 --> 26:41.800]  Yeah, I find that fascinating and in both free and paid and you know, like friend of the show Ben Thompson at Stratecary
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.400]  you know is is doing a fantastic job with his
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.560]  paid
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.400]  subscription daily update newsletter with one free post a week and there's a couple other people in
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.600]  Neil Seibart has above Avalon similar business models
[27:00.600 --> 27:08.600]  I think one reason it's more popular is for those sort of if you want if your business model for doing your writing full-time
[27:09.480 --> 27:11.480]  Is going to be based on
[27:12.280 --> 27:17.240]  Not just on advertising and sponsorships, you know, which is really the same thing
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.280]  Like like mine at daring fireball in here in the talk show
[27:24.280 --> 27:26.120]  If you're gonna go for
[27:26.120 --> 27:33.640]  Reader support I really it really makes sense that you kind of need something
[27:34.760 --> 27:41.160]  Behind a paywall of some sort like you it it doesn't really work to say I'm going to publish everything for free
[27:41.400 --> 27:44.360]  And if you want to pay me pay me, I mean people will pay something
[27:45.240 --> 27:46.440]  but
[27:46.440 --> 27:51.400]  What really prompts people to pay is if they have to pay to read and at a technical level?
[27:51.400 --> 27:58.200]  It's a lot easier with email than it is with a website in my opinion
[27:58.840 --> 28:04.760]  and and maybe easier is the wrong word because I'm not I'm not really thinking of this as the
[28:06.120 --> 28:11.560]  Developer of making it work or the publisher who's going to use this as my business model
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.520]  I'm thinking as just the reader who wants to okay. I want to read Ben Thompson's stuff
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.560]  Or I want to read the New York Times or the Washington Post or any of these other publications that you know
[28:21.560 --> 28:25.160]  Like you have X number of free articles a month and then you have to pay
[28:26.040 --> 28:29.640]  I I really I do it I pay for a very
[28:30.840 --> 28:33.240]  I don't know at least half a dozen subscription
[28:34.120 --> 28:40.680]  Things probably closer to at least 10 maybe I pay for the times the Washington Post I pay for a bunch of newsletters
[28:40.680 --> 28:46.760]  Pay for the Wall Street Journal. I'm always getting logged out of them the New Yorker
[28:46.760 --> 28:50.040]  I have a print New Yorker subscription, but it comes with a free online one
[28:50.040 --> 28:55.080]  I I can't tell you how many times a month I have to sign back into the New Yorker website
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.760]  And because they're telling me I'm out of free articles, even though I'm a paid subscriber
[28:59.640 --> 29:01.640]  Yeah happens to me too with Washington Post
[29:02.360 --> 29:04.360]  Yeah, that's that's a good question
[29:04.360 --> 29:11.080]  Yeah, that never happens with Stratechery. Yeah, right. It always every day guess what shows up in my email box every day
[29:11.080 --> 29:16.200]  My email from Ben Thompson with his thoughts on the business news from the day before the last few days
[29:17.160 --> 29:18.200]  and
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.440]  It's a it's a this is and this is the other thing that to me makes it easier
[29:22.440 --> 29:27.960]  It is an easier better reading experience because guess what? I don't have I don't have any
[29:27.960 --> 29:33.720]  Pop-ups showing up on my email telling me that they have a cookie policy and I'm inherently
[29:34.280 --> 29:39.160]  I mean, how many times I mean, I don't understand. I know it's a GDPR and it's this European thing. Yes. Well, I
[29:39.880 --> 29:40.920]  freaking nonsense
[29:40.920 --> 29:46.040]  I I would rather delete every freaking cookie in the universe than have to dismiss one of those things again
[29:47.080 --> 29:49.720]  That and would you like notifications from this website?
[29:50.360 --> 29:54.280]  No, thanks. And I would rather delete every freaking cookie in the universe than have to
[29:54.280 --> 29:57.480]  Would you like notifications from this website? No, thanks
[29:57.800 --> 30:04.040]  and the popovers that that cover the actual content of the article, even if they're not trying to say
[30:04.840 --> 30:09.000]  You you can't read this because you don't subscribe they pop over and they say hey
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.640]  Why don't you sign up for our newsletter or whatever give us your email address and and they cover the article?
[30:13.880 --> 30:20.280]  That never happens when i'm reading email and yep, very very similarly. It does not happen when i'm reading rss
[30:20.840 --> 30:22.040]  right
[30:22.040 --> 30:24.760]  Now the difference is I will say that
[30:25.720 --> 30:27.560]  if I were reading most
[30:27.560 --> 30:30.120]  Actually, I guess every single one. I can't think of a single
[30:30.680 --> 30:37.080]  site in my net newswire subscriptions where if I went to that person's website because almost every single one is a person's website
[30:37.480 --> 30:40.840]  where they would be covering their content with popovers, but
[30:41.480 --> 30:43.480]  It's just a nice way to read
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.640]  and you know and I feel like
[30:46.200 --> 30:48.200]  that is
[30:48.200 --> 30:52.120]  It it's just one of many ways that the entire
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.000]  Big corporate media world has just sort of lost the ball
[30:57.800 --> 30:59.800]  in today's world where
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.280]  They're you know, and I don't blame them. I get it. It's tough
[31:02.360 --> 31:06.840]  it's never been the business has never been tougher to do good journalism and
[31:08.120 --> 31:13.400]  I get it that it's i'm not trying to say it's easy just because daring fireball is doing okay
[31:13.400 --> 31:21.240]  Uh, i'm not saying it's easy, but it's so clear that you know, hey, is this just is this a nice experience for our readers?
[31:21.880 --> 31:25.400]  Is just a clearly nowhere near the top of the priority list
[31:26.040 --> 31:30.280]  Right and that that seems stunning to me like job one is to create
[31:31.880 --> 31:39.000]  Something nice to read right right so the experience of reading it should be way, you know way at the top of the list and
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.600]  The fact that these sites are almost uniformly hostile to actually reading the content
[31:45.560 --> 31:47.560]  Is just madness
[31:47.560 --> 31:53.480]  I and I know i've used this analogy before and it's it seems like a stretch because it would be so
[31:54.040 --> 31:57.800]  It would it would actually lead to physical confrontations in the real world
[31:58.840 --> 32:05.080]  But when you buy a copy of of a newspaper and you're reading it on the subway
[32:05.080 --> 32:09.000]  Nobody ever comes up and covers up the article you're reading, you know
[32:10.200 --> 32:13.320]  With a flyer for uh, you know something else
[32:14.520 --> 32:19.240]  It you don't get interrupted as your score, you know, all right, you don't scroll a newspaper you
[32:19.960 --> 32:23.800]  Scroll your eyes, right you go down nothing actually covers up some you know
[32:23.800 --> 32:28.920]  Like when you hit the space bar when you're reading an article on a website and all of a sudden that's when they put the interstitial
[32:28.920 --> 32:32.040]  Up that covers the article you're reading and tells you you're you're done
[32:32.040 --> 32:35.080]  That never happens in the real world. It's it it you know
[32:35.640 --> 32:39.720]  The worst part about reading the newspaper is maybe your hands get a little ink on them or something like that
[32:40.040 --> 32:43.880]  I guess some people struggle to read a broadsheet, but I never I always
[32:45.240 --> 32:48.680]  I you know, you fold it in half. Yeah, right. There are ways
[32:50.760 --> 32:54.280]  I just think it's crazy and I really feel like that the
[32:55.320 --> 32:57.880]  web publishing world and you know, you see this too with
[32:57.880 --> 33:06.120]  How much javascript is in the payloads for these websites nowadays with all these ad networks and even with the privacy implication of the tracking
[33:06.360 --> 33:10.920]  Aside, it's just an enormous amount of code and it and you can see it when you monitor
[33:11.480 --> 33:14.040]  Your tabs in a process monitor, you know
[33:14.040 --> 33:19.480]  Like activity monitor to see what's going on and all of a sudden you just have a an article you're reading open and it's using
[33:19.800 --> 33:22.440]  20 percent of your max CPU or something like that
[33:22.440 --> 33:28.360]  It it's madness and I I really feel like people are ready
[33:29.560 --> 33:31.720]  To go back to the relaxing, you know
[33:31.720 --> 33:37.160]  Let's let's use something to read these articles that just is optimized for making it as pleasant as possible
[33:38.040 --> 33:41.240]  Yeah, people who like to read I mean they like to read
[33:42.600 --> 33:47.720]  Or they they want to like to read they want to enjoy it. All right, I think that's a really good idea
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.200]  Yeah, or they they want to like to read they want to enjoy it, right? Uh, one of the things I delight in is um
[33:54.440 --> 33:56.680]  On my personal blog, there's no javascript
[33:57.320 --> 34:04.040]  Um, it's on a cheap shared host. I pay almost no money for it and yet it's fast
[34:04.440 --> 34:08.040]  Right because without you know, all that junk it's you know
[34:08.680 --> 34:12.280]  It's all pre-rendered. It's just html. No cookies are even involved
[34:12.280 --> 34:18.920]  It's just it's just super fast. I I like it when people tell me that they that when they're worried about their internet connection
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.160]  That they go they they go to the they open a browser tab and type da
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.400]  Let it auto complete and see if if daring fireball loads fast, then they know everything then it must be something else
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.880]  Right and if daring fireball loads slow, then maybe there is something wrong with their internet connection
[34:34.920 --> 34:41.240]  That is music to my ears. Yeah, right. It's one of the joys of statically rendered sites
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.240]  Even though some all this crap in them even though every once in a while something is my fault or this sort
[34:47.240 --> 34:52.920]  You know, like I need to you know, do my annual reboot of apache or something like that. Sure, but uh,
[34:53.560 --> 34:59.080]  But for the most part it really it really is edifying to hear that but it also makes me
[35:00.200 --> 35:02.680]  Crazy because it's so easy
[35:03.880 --> 35:08.280]  I know how about just don't do the things right? You can save a whole lot of time
[35:08.280 --> 35:13.480]  I know I know but yeah, all right, let me hold that thought because I want to I want to take a
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.640]  Take a break here. Thank our first sponsor and then I have a programming story. I want to tell you
[35:20.600 --> 35:22.840]  our first sponsor speaking of fast web hosts
[35:23.480 --> 35:32.040]  Is linode l-i-n-o-d-e looks like linode to me, but it's pronounced linode because they specialize in linux
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.000]  They just opened their newest data center in toronto
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.320]  It's built using their most up-to-date hardware and their next generation network backbone. Actually, this might be out of date this information
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.280]  I'm telling you. I think mumbai india is actually open now, too
[35:45.160 --> 35:47.160]  anyway linode is
[35:47.640 --> 35:52.600]  Dedicated hosting in virtual containers with data centers all over the world
[35:52.600 --> 35:56.440]  The fact that they have them in countries like canada is really really important
[35:57.400 --> 36:01.720]  If you're in canada and you have to comply with in-country data protection requirements
[36:01.720 --> 36:08.760]  And legal requirements, it's not just about getting the latency down just because it's nearer to you physically or maybe nearer to your audience
[36:09.400 --> 36:14.920]  For some people it's actually a legal requirement very important. They're expanding literally expanding all over the world
[36:15.160 --> 36:18.760]  toronto mumbai can't get much further apart than that. I don't think
[36:20.200 --> 36:23.240]  Anything you want to build any kind of website you want you can build it on linode
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.720]  They have dedicated cpus if you need them distributed applications hosted services
[36:27.720 --> 36:33.160]  Everything features native ssd storage. Of course, everything's hooked up to a 40 gigabit network
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.880]  You can pick from 10. I think it's 11 now though worldwide data centers
[36:38.520 --> 36:42.600]  You pay for what you use with hourly billing across all plans and add-on services
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.320]  So you can pay based on your typical traffic and if something happens every once in a while where you know
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.280]  You're going to get a big burst of traffic and you might need more resources. You only pay for it while you need it
[36:52.280 --> 36:59.800]  Super super easy. Um, and one of the things is they have great pricing plans start at just five bucks a month
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.320]  And that's not like a special offer special deal or a super limited
[37:04.200 --> 37:05.800]  I think that you couldn't really use
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.800]  An awful lot of people could go
[37:08.360 --> 37:14.440]  A long way on their just default five dollar plan and they have a special offer for listeners of the show
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.680]  Use this code talk show 2019
[37:16.680 --> 37:22.120]  Talk show 2019. You get a twenty dollar credit. You could use that for four months of service
[37:22.680 --> 37:25.080]  And no questions asked don't like it done with it when you're done
[37:25.880 --> 37:28.840]  Cancel it four months free with a twenty dollar credit
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.080]  The url linode.com
[37:31.080 --> 37:35.480]  Slash the talk show so that's a little confusing there. It's sort of like an intelligence test there
[37:35.800 --> 37:37.800]  The url is linode.com
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.400]  The talk show the promo code to get the talk show
[37:41.400 --> 37:48.940]  The url is linode.com slash the talk show the promo code to get the 20 credit is talk show 2019
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.640]  Anyway, I am a customer i'm moving slowly but surely everything during fireball over there
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.720]  Uh just working on something this week, which i'm actually about to talk to bran about
[38:00.360 --> 38:02.360]  over to my linode server
[38:02.760 --> 38:09.720]  I can't say enough about how good and easy and for somebody who's been using the same server for over 10 years how much nicer
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.960]  Things have gotten in command line land. So my thanks to linode. Uh, they're not just a sponsor. I'm a customer
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.880]  I really recommend them and remember that code talk show 2019 save 20 bucks
[38:21.240 --> 38:23.080]  So anyway
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.560]  I forget who said it. I should actually google it. I should probably do more research as the host of the show
[38:27.880 --> 38:29.880]  You've probably heard the adage. Uh
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.560]  I'm sure you have premature optimization is the root of all evil. Oh, yeah for sure. Yep, uh,
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.440]  Premature, let's see here
[38:38.440 --> 38:40.440]  Let's see here
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.240]  There we go, you can hear my uh apple extended keyboard too there
[38:46.680 --> 38:53.320]  I've got one also. Yeah, they're still the best. Its source is credited to uh, donald newth. Is it new or canoe?
[38:53.400 --> 38:55.400]  I actually I think it's
[38:55.480 --> 38:58.520]  Actually, that's a good question. I think it's newth, but damn
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.000]  The most celebrated computer scientist who's ever walked the earth after maybe after alan turing
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  And I don't know how to pronounce his name
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.960]  um
[39:09.960 --> 39:12.360]  But it's a well-known adage
[39:13.240 --> 39:15.240]  And I think people misinterpret it
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.560]  I know you believe it and one of the things that I wanted why I thought of talking to you about it
[39:20.520 --> 39:22.520]  is that
[39:22.920 --> 39:24.520]  Net news wire
[39:24.520 --> 39:25.480]  is
[39:25.480 --> 39:27.480]  uh small
[39:27.480 --> 39:29.320]  fast and stable
[39:29.320 --> 39:30.040]  and
[39:30.040 --> 39:31.080]  You know
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.840]  There's a part of me and I know what you think too
[39:32.840 --> 39:38.440]  Like I just I looked at it after unpacking it and installing it and looking at it in the bundle in my applications folder
[39:38.440 --> 39:40.440]  It's like 9.9 megabytes
[39:42.360 --> 39:44.680]  Which is by today's standards a very small app
[39:45.320 --> 39:49.160]  Yeah, tiny but there's a part of me that's so old and remembers
[39:49.720 --> 39:52.040]  You know when apps needed to fit on floppy disks
[39:52.920 --> 39:58.360]  Where where you think 10 megabytes? Geez, what the hell is in there? How many floppies is that going to be?
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.960]  Right, and you know part of the reason that coco apps could always be if you know if engineered well
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.880]  And didn't use a lot of third-party frameworks could be very small is because the coco the the system frameworks
[40:10.040 --> 40:14.600]  You don't need them in your app you they're they're in the system. And so the app itself just
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.880]  Just needs your code the code for your little app
[40:19.640 --> 40:26.360]  And you know, it's a total digression but that's why swift apps have been bigger than objective c apps because up until very recently
[40:26.360 --> 40:28.360]  because the swift
[40:29.000 --> 40:37.160]  Binary interface was still changing between versions of swift swift apps needed to bundle all the swift libraries and frameworks within each app bundle
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.360]  But all of a sudden now that that's stable swift apps are going to get smaller, too
[40:43.880 --> 40:50.840]  But that newswire it's super fast. It's really really fast. It's fast at everything there are it
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.880]  I remember when I first started using evergreen again, and I I like fished out all of my
[40:56.440 --> 41:01.160]  feeds from my old version and that newswire which itself was also fast and and
[41:01.720 --> 41:04.680]  imported them into the new app and
[41:05.320 --> 41:11.880]  Launched it or hit reload or something after importing it and I was like, well, when's it gonna load? Oh, oh, it did already
[41:13.240 --> 41:16.600]  It loaded all like, you know 50 50 different feeds updated all of them
[41:16.600 --> 41:22.200]  It, you know, it had no exaggeration within a handful of seconds to two seconds. There they are. They're updated
[41:24.040 --> 41:26.040]  I think that people
[41:26.120 --> 41:31.640]  Tend to to the misinterpretation of that premature optimization is the root of all evil
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.600]  Is the idea that you don't you don't have to optimize as you go?
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.040]  You don't have to keep things fast as you go you can you know, we'll fix it later
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.000]  You can let it get slow and then we'll fix it later
[41:43.000 --> 41:50.200]  You can let it get slow and then we'll we'll optimize it later because donald newt says premature optimization is the root of all evil
[41:50.840 --> 41:52.840]  That that is not what he meant
[41:53.240 --> 41:56.040]  And I think that's actually the way a lot of software goes
[41:56.760 --> 41:57.880]  haywire
[41:57.880 --> 42:04.120]  I love the old i've told this story before many times, you know that the the rule don melton imposed on the webkit team
[42:04.760 --> 42:05.800]  when
[42:05.800 --> 42:08.200]  He he started the safari project at apple
[42:08.200 --> 42:15.720]  Was that every time you checked code in you had to run, you know, the the tests and benchmarks and the rule was
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.040]  Nothing could regress performance wise so if you were adding feature x to safari and the webkit browser
[42:22.600 --> 42:27.400]  And you ran the you it was all working and then you ran the tests and it made something slower
[42:28.200 --> 42:32.600]  You couldn't check it in you had to figure out how to get it working where it didn't make anything slower
[42:32.600 --> 42:37.800]  All that's a great rule, right? And this was informed by his time at mozilla
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.880]  where
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.640]  Where they would say well
[42:42.440 --> 42:44.680]  This works. We'll make it fast later
[42:45.480 --> 42:48.680]  And later never happened and all of a sudden yeah, right
[42:49.640 --> 42:52.600]  so I take this rule to mean a different thing don't
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.280]  Don't write code assuming you know what the best optimizations are going to be
[42:58.840 --> 42:59.880]  I mean
[42:59.880 --> 43:06.200]  Write intelligently, but then run it and test it and figure out is it actually slow. Where is it slow?
[43:06.200 --> 43:08.200]  You know what? How can we change it?
[43:08.920 --> 43:09.800]  don't
[43:09.800 --> 43:11.800]  right because guaranteed
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.640]  A lot of the time what you think is going to be slow isn't actually slow at all and it's something you didn't even think about
[43:17.640 --> 43:24.600]  Ah that that's the slow down but you have to measure it. You have to find out right exactly that and that is exactly the lesson
[43:24.600 --> 43:32.040]  That i've i'm paying the price for as we speak. Um, I forget when I first wrote it might have been this far back
[43:32.040 --> 43:37.160]  It's 2009. It's probably about 10 years old, but I wrote and still use my own little
[43:38.360 --> 43:44.840]  Bot to automatically post articles to the at daring fireball twitter account
[43:45.720 --> 43:49.880]  And I know there are a bunch of services that do this you can just sign up
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.720]  But I wanted the tweets to be formatted just the way I want them. And so of course I wrote my own
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.320]  And
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.960]  It's something that I was running on a server with a uh, it's a little pearl script. It just reads my rss feed
[44:06.840 --> 44:08.840]  Makes a list of all the articles
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.680]  Looks for ones that are new something that hasn't been tweeted yet if it finds one
[44:14.680 --> 44:22.840]  Posts it as a tweet and then saves saves that id for that article so that it won't get tweeted again
[44:23.800 --> 44:26.360]  And stops and then it's a cron job
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.680]  Cron is a for those who you who don't know i'm going out in a wheelchair
[44:30.680 --> 44:34.680]  I'm going to try to talk programming on a non-programmers podcast, but I think I can do it
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.720]  Cron is a long-standing 30 40 year old unix utility
[44:39.720 --> 44:45.560]  That you can use to set up recurring tasks, you know, so you could say run this script every five minutes or run
[44:45.560 --> 44:51.800]  This one every hour or run this script every sunday at midnight or something like that. You can set up a schedule
[44:51.800 --> 44:52.760]  It'll do
[44:52.760 --> 44:55.800]  Do these tasks so I have it set up as a every five-minute cron task
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.960]  The the logic being if I go on a
[45:02.520 --> 45:05.000]  Posting spree and I post two things on the screen
[45:05.000 --> 45:11.320]  Why not have them show up five minutes apart on your twitter stream so that you're not looking it doesn't feel like the at during
[45:11.640 --> 45:13.640]  fireball account is
[45:15.160 --> 45:17.160]  Harassing you
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.160]  the other thing my script a few of the other things i've added to the script over the years is
[45:22.040 --> 45:24.040]  It also won't post anything
[45:24.520 --> 45:30.680]  I forget how long it doesn't really matter, but I think it's like 10 minutes. So it it will be a little bit longer
[45:30.680 --> 45:39.160]  How long it doesn't really matter, but I think it's like 10 minutes. So it won't post anything that was posted within the most recent 10 minutes
[45:39.720 --> 45:45.240]  The idea being that gives me 10 minutes to fix any typos or mistakes before it gets tweeted and
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.720]  It gives chris pepper 10 minutes to email you exactly. Well, that's actually uh often what happens
[45:52.280 --> 45:55.160]  An incredible percentage of the mistakes I make uh
[45:56.040 --> 45:58.040]  The typos and stuff like that
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.760]  Are fixed within the first 10 minutes. And so that's you know, one of the things it does
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.960]  And for the most part this thing has just run and run and run for like 10 years and with a few tweaks here and there
[46:11.880 --> 46:14.760]  But about a month ago it just stopped working
[46:16.760 --> 46:18.760]  Nothing
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.920]  And uh, I was traveling at the time and I didn't even notice
[46:22.920 --> 46:28.440]  Uh, and I guess I should have some kind of some figure out it's on my list of things to do as I fix this
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.200]  Is to figure out some way that I can get notified that it hasn't been working
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.200]  But somebody on twitter said hey is that daring fireball account dead what's going on and I look and I was like, huh?
[46:40.200 --> 46:43.640]  There's like four days of stuff missing and I couldn't figure out what was going on
[46:44.280 --> 46:49.960]  And it was weird. I ssh in the machine and what I could do is instead of just letting cron run it automatically
[46:49.960 --> 46:55.560]  I can just type the name of the script and it should run and I have it set up so that when it runs that way
[46:57.080 --> 47:02.440]  Print some useful information for me to read about what you know, if it's posting anything or sees anything
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.720]  And it was giving me this weird error and it didn't really make it was very unhelpful
[47:08.440 --> 47:10.440]  And then I figured it out what it was
[47:11.160 --> 47:13.160]  was that
[47:13.160 --> 47:19.560]  Um, okay i'm getting dangerous out in the weeds here
[47:20.440 --> 47:22.180]  so tls
[47:22.180 --> 47:25.820]  1.1 is is a a standard it's part of https
[47:26.760 --> 47:28.760]  So if you're using secure http
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.680]  Tls is a newer more cryptographically secure version the server
[47:34.680 --> 47:39.000]  I was running the script on was so old and I it was it at the time
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  It's linux is a lot better now where you can do apt-get update something and it'll update the the system
[47:45.720 --> 47:47.720]  The server I was running this on uh
[47:48.440 --> 47:55.240]  Really couldn't be updated easily. I would really kind of have to cut, you know, download, you know, take everything create a new instance
[47:55.720 --> 47:58.600]  With a modern version of linux and reinstall everything
[47:58.600 --> 48:06.860]  Um, which is a lot of work but the server had a version of open ssl that only did tls 1.0
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.320]  And at some point in july, I believe I still could be wrong on this
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.560]  But it makes all the sense in the world that twitter finally pulled the plug on their apis for twitter posting
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.660]  And no longer accepted tls 1.0. So I had a server that couldn't speak tls 1.1
[48:23.660 --> 48:28.460]  trying to speak to an api that only spoke tls 1.1 and
[48:29.100 --> 48:30.940]  Forget what I was using
[48:30.940 --> 48:35.580]  to do the actual posting but was giving me an error message that
[48:36.620 --> 48:39.820]  Was not anywhere near as clear along those lines as you would think
[48:41.260 --> 48:43.260]  Sounds like programming
[48:43.260 --> 48:52.540]  Uh now here's the part where I bit myself on premature optimization what I did 10 years ago is
[48:53.900 --> 48:55.660]  I was keeping
[48:55.660 --> 49:01.420]  Uh, all of the tweets that had already been posted in what in pearl is called a hash
[49:01.980 --> 49:04.540]  what in a lot of programming environments is called the
[49:05.660 --> 49:09.420]  What do you call it? What do you call a an array where where the indexes are keys?
[49:09.420 --> 49:16.060]  A dictionary a dictionary right? Yeah, a lot of programming languages call it a dictionary. This is a data structure. That's very simple
[49:16.780 --> 49:20.860]  You have a key and you have a value so I could say for the key brent
[49:21.660 --> 49:28.140]  I could say that the value is friend this would describe my relationship with people and then for the key. Amy
[49:28.780 --> 49:30.780]  The value would be wife
[49:31.020 --> 49:34.620]  And then I could look up amy and then print the value and say wife
[49:34.620 --> 49:40.060]  Um, very simple very popular used in you know has different words and all sorts of different languages
[49:40.060 --> 49:42.060]  But every modern language has something like this
[49:43.260 --> 49:46.940]  And then what I did and here's where I made the mistake is I thought well wait
[49:46.940 --> 49:51.820]  I want this i'm going to use this for years and years to come I post thousands of articles
[49:52.540 --> 49:54.060]  a year
[49:54.060 --> 49:59.660]  I think and I don't know how many articles I had posted to during fireball as of when I wrote this 10 years ago
[49:59.660 --> 50:06.300]  But as of now, I think i'm close to 30 000 or just cross 30 000 total articles posted to daring fireball
[50:06.300 --> 50:12.300]  This is going to be thousands and thousands of articles tens of thousands of articles seems like that would be slow
[50:13.100 --> 50:20.380]  So I use something in pearl called the tie tie and let you tie hash to a database file
[50:20.940 --> 50:27.340]  It's like berkeley db or something like that. You give it a file name and then once you've tied it it acts a little bit
[50:27.340 --> 50:35.180]  From at least in my opinion. It's sort of like the object database in frontier where you've got this hash
[50:36.380 --> 50:39.420]  And every time the script runs the hash
[50:40.380 --> 50:45.020]  Springs back to life and has all of the keys and values and when this ends
[50:45.660 --> 50:48.220]  They're all written to that one database file
[50:48.220 --> 50:54.220]  and so I don't have to deal with a lot of open and read and read all the lines and close the file and
[50:54.220 --> 50:59.740]  Worry about all the file stuff once you have it set up and you run the script. It just runs and it's magic, right?
[51:00.300 --> 51:02.300]  Sounds great
[51:02.300 --> 51:04.620]  Well, it turns out I don't know if it's an endian thing
[51:05.260 --> 51:10.380]  I don't know. I think it's more of a vert, you know old version of the the pearl module that does it
[51:10.940 --> 51:15.660]  When I copied that back to my mac, I was just in the meantime. I was just going to run it manually from my mac
[51:15.660 --> 51:17.660]  And in fact, that's what I am doing
[51:18.220 --> 51:22.860]  It the version of pearl on my mac, which is a lot more magical than the version that I'm doing
[51:22.860 --> 51:28.460]  My mac, which is a lot more modern than the one on this 10 year old server could no longer read that dbm file
[51:29.020 --> 51:29.980]  Yeah
[51:29.980 --> 51:31.980]  and the dbm file
[51:32.060 --> 51:35.580]  When I opened it in like bb edit and then tried opening it in like a hex editor
[51:36.460 --> 51:42.060]  Um, I could see some of the text but you know when you open like a binary database
[51:42.140 --> 51:46.140]  It's like just a bunch of it's not human readable. It's a bunch of gibberish. So
[51:46.780 --> 51:48.220]  There's probably some way around it
[51:48.220 --> 51:55.340]  There's probably some archaic way that I could write more code and force pearl to use the old version of the db file format
[51:56.060 --> 51:59.500]  But anyway, I sat there thinking that sounds like setting yourself up for you know
[52:00.140 --> 52:05.900]  Future right problems. Well, why didn't I just write it in a simple human readable format?
[52:07.180 --> 52:11.500]  And so I started thinking about it and I actually broke the seal on it today because I want you know
[52:11.500 --> 52:12.780]  I knew you were going to be on the show
[52:12.780 --> 52:15.740]  I thought I got to write this and see it because I want to talk to brent about this
[52:15.740 --> 52:19.580]  And I thought well, what's the stupidest easiest most obvious way?
[52:20.540 --> 52:24.620]  That I could do it and I thought well I could do json that's superhuman readable
[52:25.340 --> 52:28.140]  but then I thought why why even why even
[52:28.940 --> 52:34.460]  Why even do json but then I thought ah, but then you're using a json library and you have to read everything into a data structure
[52:34.460 --> 52:39.260]  And if there are 30 000 things why even have a 30 and then I just sat there thinking but you know
[52:39.580 --> 52:44.780]  Thinking and thinking and thinking I thought well the dumbest thing I could possibly do is just write them to a log file
[52:44.780 --> 52:50.380]  And don't even read the whole thing into a data structure just every time there's a new thing run the whole script
[52:50.860 --> 52:52.380]  Go through the whole
[52:52.380 --> 52:54.380]  log file line by line
[52:54.940 --> 52:58.780]  And see if it's already been posted and even if it's 30 000 lines long
[52:59.100 --> 53:04.780]  Maybe you have to if you get unlucky you have to go all 30 000 lines to find the one you up yet. We already posted it
[53:06.380 --> 53:09.580]  Don't even read it into a data structure never read more than a line at a time
[53:09.580 --> 53:14.460]  And so I wrote like a test file and I loaded it up with a million lines
[53:14.780 --> 53:19.340]  That would be the equivalent if I had a million posts on daring fireball, which I think would take me somewhere around
[53:19.900 --> 53:21.900]  At my pace like 300 years
[53:22.460 --> 53:26.380]  So it seems like enough and i'll still be a reader and the whole thing runs in a second
[53:27.820 --> 53:33.360]  Yeah, like even in the worst case scenario where it has to get to the 999,999
[53:33.980 --> 53:35.580]  log of the line of the file
[53:35.580 --> 53:43.180]  It it runs in less than about a second and the actual posting of the tweets to twitter takes like two seconds anyway
[53:43.180 --> 53:50.060]  So the whole script always took two or three seconds and i'm only running it every five minutes right and there's no user interface, you know
[53:50.780 --> 53:53.980]  Relying on this so it's yeah, that's perfect. Yeah
[53:55.020 --> 54:00.380]  And it's it's literally the stupidest way you could possibly do it and it's fine
[54:00.380 --> 54:05.660]  When I was at userland, uh, dave wiener, um
[54:07.020 --> 54:12.700]  Would have a preference for what he called low-tech solutions, you know, and and it was exactly things like this
[54:13.180 --> 54:18.940]  You know, it turns out this is way way faster than you think it is and it's just simple human readable
[54:19.420 --> 54:21.420]  Um, yeah, that's the way to go
[54:22.300 --> 54:27.660]  I I do think that one of the ways that the computing world has changed from the 90s until now
[54:27.660 --> 54:32.460]  And it's a way that the unix world has won out
[54:33.400 --> 54:34.780]  philosophically
[54:34.780 --> 54:35.980]  is
[54:35.980 --> 54:37.980]  that whenever possible
[54:38.300 --> 54:45.340]  Make things human readable whether it's a file format that you're writing or or a network api
[54:45.660 --> 54:47.660]  That you're sending over the wire
[54:47.980 --> 54:51.660]  In the 90s. Everything was custom binary stuff and
[54:52.620 --> 54:54.620]  I mean there were I don't remember any apps
[54:54.620 --> 55:00.700]  Other than literally a text editor like bbedit, but like in the early 90s. I don't remember any apps who had a file format
[55:00.700 --> 55:02.700]  That was text
[55:03.260 --> 55:06.460]  Like you couldn't open a mac write file in a text editor
[55:07.980 --> 55:11.100]  Everything was binary and network stuff was binary, right?
[55:11.100 --> 55:15.820]  Like it wasn't like when you know, like apple talk was speaking in plain text that if you wanted to debug it
[55:15.820 --> 55:19.980]  You could just look at what's going over the wire and read it. Whereas the unix philosophy has always been
[55:20.540 --> 55:22.540]  when and when it's
[55:22.540 --> 55:25.980]  At when it's feasible make it as human readable as possible
[55:26.540 --> 55:29.020]  And I feel like the whole industry has come back around on that
[55:29.500 --> 55:33.420]  Like json is a perfect that the rise of json is a perfect example of that
[55:35.740 --> 55:41.500]  I remember being so surprised when I first saw the web and learned that it's just a text file
[55:41.900 --> 55:46.620]  Behind that page and like and you could even figure out what things meant, you know
[55:46.860 --> 55:51.420]  If you know that h stands for header then h1 is like, oh that's got to be the big one. I mean
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.220]  No, like holy cow. Yeah coming from the
[55:55.180 --> 55:57.180]  computing world before then
[55:57.180 --> 55:59.260]  Yeah, nothing was that transparent or simple?
[55:59.340 --> 55:59.820]  Yeah
[55:59.820 --> 56:06.860]  Well, I remember when I figured out how email worked that you could this is before everything was encrypted. You could just log on to
[56:07.260 --> 56:09.740]  the smtp server for your host
[56:10.380 --> 56:16.860]  And you would just type email commands and then you can just type the headers you would just you could just instead of using an email
[56:16.860 --> 56:21.820]  Client, you could just talk right to the smtp server and just write two colon space
[56:23.580 --> 56:29.340]  Brent I think I yeah, I think I did that exactly once just to prove that like wow. Yeah. Hey that really works
[56:29.500 --> 56:31.500]  well, I did it to send like like
[56:31.900 --> 56:36.620]  prank messages to other drexel students from like the provost saying that they were on academic suspension and
[56:37.660 --> 56:39.340]  See what I did
[56:39.340 --> 56:39.980]  I did like that
[56:39.980 --> 56:45.980]  But what I do is I would you couldn't manually do it, but you could use apple script to make you dora use a different
[56:45.980 --> 56:50.460]  Yeah going yeah email address, right? Yeah, but then when I did do it
[56:50.460 --> 56:57.100]  I I in those days everyone had email signatures, which you dora would automatically apply. So I forgot to turn that off
[56:58.460 --> 57:00.460]  That was the kind of confusing
[57:01.420 --> 57:03.420]  Thing but yeah
[57:06.220 --> 57:08.380]  But it was a revelation it really was though
[57:09.180 --> 57:13.200]  I think it not only was a good practice in terms of debug ability and maintainability
[57:13.200 --> 57:15.920]  and hey this you know, uh,
[57:16.560 --> 57:17.840]  like
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.400]  I learned this lesson before I should I this is why i'm mad at myself that 10 years ago
[57:22.480 --> 57:28.480]  John rupert used this stupid database file for a thing that didn't need to be optimized at all for
[57:29.440 --> 57:35.200]  Literally up to a million on a million entries let alone the tens of thousands that I would ever get to in practice
[57:35.680 --> 57:37.680]  I can't believe I didn't try the obvious thing first
[57:37.680 --> 57:44.240]  um, and by the 10 years ago, I knew that like I I knew better than that that that the
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.840]  The person to write comments for when I write scripts and code is not
[57:50.160 --> 57:57.360]  Some hypothetical dummy who might be reading my code and it's me in the future because i'm going to forget everything about why I did
[57:57.360 --> 57:58.560]  It this way
[57:58.560 --> 58:00.560]  yes, yeah, uh
[58:00.720 --> 58:03.760]  I don't you know, I don't really tweak markdown often but markdown is
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.960]  My markdown script is fairly complicated
[58:08.320 --> 58:14.320]  But I I still think it's very well commented because at least when I do want to change something or add something
[58:15.520 --> 58:16.960]  And I go in
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.720]  I'm like the only way I can figure out what the hell is going on is by reading the comments and the comments were all written
[58:24.480 --> 58:30.480]  For me to read in the future, you know, right which so they're written with respect for what I think will be my intelligence
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.800]  But they're also written knowing you're going to forget everything about how you did this or why this thing that looks like it doesn't
[58:37.520 --> 58:39.360]  Like it's why are you doing all this work here?
[58:39.920 --> 58:47.040]  That doesn't look like it needs to be done. And here's the comment explaining what happened when you didn't do this. Yeah, right
[58:48.800 --> 58:52.640]  Uh speaking of apple script net newswire 5.0 apple scriptable
[58:53.280 --> 58:54.240]  Yeah
[58:54.240 --> 58:58.880]  You know, I had a much longer list of things that were going to be in 5.0. Of course
[58:58.880 --> 59:00.880]  Most of the time I thought it was a 1.0 app
[59:01.200 --> 59:07.200]  And there were a lot of things that got cut but one thing I was adamant about was that apple script support had to be
[59:07.200 --> 59:11.200]  in there on day one people need to know it's there and to expect it and
[59:11.920 --> 59:16.560]  Friend of mine named olaf helman did did all of that work and did a great job
[59:17.840 --> 59:25.280]  One of the it is i'd like to talk about that because you know, it's it is in some ways a 1.0 app
[59:25.280 --> 59:28.320]  Yeah, it's a 1.0 app in disguise as a 5.0. Yeah
[59:30.160 --> 59:32.740]  It's you know, sort of like a reboot of the franchise
[59:36.400 --> 59:44.320]  And you know, it's it's the the the only real complaints i've seen people writing about are the obvious things which is obvious for every
[59:44.560 --> 59:51.520]  1.0, which is that well, here's some feature requests x y and z and some of them are things that are certainly on the list
[59:51.520 --> 59:55.520]  You know, everybody has every app has feature requests that you can't get to all of them
[59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.100]  But some of them, you know, like the obvious one is that right now net newswire 5.0
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.080]  Only has one syncing service option, which is feedbin
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.600]  Right, if you are a long time or current user of a different feed syncing service
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.600]  And there are several and they're a bunch of good ones
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:23.840]  That's obvious. I wouldn't I guess it's not a non-starter. You could you could decide to just switch over but it's probably a non-starter because you want to keep using
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.320]  Your iot the ios app of choice that you're using for feed reading or something like that
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.560]  But you have to draw the line somewhere right? I mean this app has been in the works for five years
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.400]  So, you know shipping is an art, right? Yeah
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:47.200]  Yeah, yeah, and so yeah, there are so many decisions and calls to make and luckily i've been doing this a long time
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.600]  So I have some practice at it
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.920]  so my thinking when it came to to
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:01:00.000]  Feedbin and other syncing systems was I had to have one I couldn't ship without anything because if I have one it tells the people
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.720]  Even if I didn't do theirs
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.840]  It's the kind of thing that will do right, you know, but it's it's it's the kind of thing that will do
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.920]  It's the kind of thing that will do right, you know that we care about it and you know
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.480]  It's a it's a matter of adding more rather than doing syncing at all
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.160]  And it's a pretty easy call to say yeah
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:26.240]  we want to add feedly syncing and fresh rss and inoreader and you know, basically all of them because
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.960]  You know, there's there's no reason not to
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920]  The hard work was getting syncing
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.080]  the infrastructure
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.700]  In the first place and then after that, it's really kind of just plugging in the details of the different apis
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.600]  So we'll be able to do the rest with less less effort, but then there are so many feature requests that
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.160]  I'm not sure if they belong in the app or not or
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.280]  Like yeah when you get to that, I think 10 roughly if people probably would like that
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.360]  So where does that go on the priority list?
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.240]  Um, there's all kinds of stuff like that. So a lot of decisions still to make in the future
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:12.480]  well, the other big difference between net newswire this net newswire project and previously is that it is
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.240]  an open source project both in
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.280]  in terms of licensing and in terms of actual practice where you actually have
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.280]  uh
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.440]  a community of contributors who are actually writing
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.240]  Lots a lot of the code
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.400]  Right. So in theory you can have an open source app where you just say here's my source code
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.040]  Here's a you know, an open source license
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.760]  You can download the source code and do what you want with it, but there may not be a actual
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.220]  community
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.220]  contributing to to the app
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:54.540]  Yeah, so that's a whole new thing for me learning how to manage that kind of community and it's really
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.500]  Tons of fun i'm enjoying it hugely. Um
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.220]  And we've been taking it slow. We we have
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.060]  You know
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.460]  Maybe a half dozen contributors or so by now
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.500]  You know, I don't have to manage, you know, 40 people or something working on this all at once
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.580]  But yeah, it's interesting and um
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:19.340]  So one of the things of course that can happen is, you know, I might think to myself. Well, i'd like feedly syncing next
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:26.300]  But then someone comes along and says long. I want to do whatever other system first and then
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.860]  I'm, like, okay go for it start work
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:35.580]  We'll answer any questions help you out do it, you know, and they meant that might happen before feedly happens for instance
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.460]  So some things really depend on you know who comes in and what they feel like working on
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.980]  The ultimate calls of how things work and what goes in the app or not are are still mine, obviously
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.980]  but there's an element of
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.980]  Serendipity, I guess I don't know what to call it. Um, just based on who shows up and who wants to do stuff
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:00.460]  One of the interesting technical decisions you made and I say this I do most of my computing for long
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.740]  I won't go into the details
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.700]  But lately I do almost all of my mac computing on my macbook and that is running mohavi
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.140]  Dot latest, um, but my iMac
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.660]  Just because of the distance I sit from it and where my eyes are. I don't see it as well. Um,
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.020]  So it's sort of my podcast station
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.740]  I'm actually using it right now to podcast
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.820]  But i'm actually very conservative about updating i'm still running
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.460]  10.13 i've already forgotten. What's what's the name? I I hate that high sierra
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:37.420]  High sierra. Um, I hate the names. I I really wish they would stay
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:43.580]  I like that ios uses numbers because I can I I can always tell which one you know, guess what comes after 13 14
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:51.820]  Right, I really but anyway, i'm running high sierra net news wire 5.0 requires, uh, 10.14.6 or later
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.660]  Yeah
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.860]  And i'm curious of your thinking behind that
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:04.700]  Well, we do have to draw the line somewhere. There has to be you know, a baseline and I think it's actually 10.14.4
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:10.380]  Whatever, uh, it was the first release where you didn't have to embed the swift libraries in the app
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:16.300]  And I think the swift libraries were bigger than the whole rest of the app combined, you know
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.020]  Including the app icon and everything and you know
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:23.100]  That's like a pretty good place to start like, you know, we can be a little bit more efficient
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:28.300]  You know, that seemed like a pretty good place to start like, you know, we can be one of the first apps that you know
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.380]  You don't need all that. So
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.340]  It's like a five megabyte download. I just I just wonderful. I just double clicked it here on my
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:41.260]  High sierra machine and is it you're correct. It is indeed 10.14.4 is the required version
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.780]  So that to me is also so I get it at a technical level that now
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:51.500]  Where I just mentioned that before that you no longer have to embed all these swift libraries. Um
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500]  You can make the download smaller
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.660]  It's just is that's just more elegant, but it's also clearly
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.500]  a
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:06.620]  Privilege of being a free and open source project that you probably if you were intending to sell this for forty dollars
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.700]  I don't think you would have drawn the line there
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.540]  Probably true. Um, that's a that's tough though because
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.260]  In previous years, I always
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:19.660]  Tended to become more aggressive about requiring the latest os and the reason is
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.620]  If supporting the previous version, uh, it's more work. It's more testing
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:30.060]  It's it's not nearly as as inexpensive as people might think
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.660]  And so one of the big deals here with net newswire is you know, it is free and open source
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:39.500]  We make no money. Everyone's a volunteer. I've got a day job. I need to
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.740]  I need to be pretty ruthless about what the priorities are and
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.060]  Supporting an older os just isn't a priority
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:53.260]  OS just isn't a priority because that's a problem that kind of solves itself
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.520]  Right every day. There are fewer people still on 10.13
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.380]  And so it just didn't and it hurts because I want hey I want everyone to use the app
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.940]  But it just didn't make sense to make that
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.780]  um
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.620]  Make that a priority
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.660]  so
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:18.300]  I wanted to draw the line at 10.14 and then 10.14.4 really ended up being the perfect spot. Yeah
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.100]  I do think that's one way
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.140]  that
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:27.420]  The mac world i'm not going to say it's worse. It's different though, and I feel like in the old days
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.140]  A well-written mac app would run
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.580]  Further back and further forward
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.060]  without
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.060]  changes and I feel like
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.060]  It for various reasons
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:46.940]  Developers are more on the treadmill of requiring across the board and you know for people who don't know your day job
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.940]  You work at the omni group
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:55.580]  But you're not a developer there anymore. You are what you do. You have a title or you just unofficially product marketing director
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.180]  My title is marketing human marketing human. Yep
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.620]  And basically my job is I write for the blog I do the podcast
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:10.460]  Right, you know add sponsorships various stuff like that interact with users. Yep
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.460]  But the omni group
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.540]  Do you guys have a hard and fast rule?
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:21.100]  I mean, I guess it depends on how old the app is that you've got apps that you know new ones that are more recent
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:27.260]  And probably cut move the cutoff date and ones that are a little you know, none of them are old. That's one of the
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.100]  great
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:32.060]  achievements of the omni group that they've sort of
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:39.580]  been doing this for 25 years and have never really had like a down cycle or let something languish too long
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.060]  But how far back do you guys tend to go at the omni group?
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.700]  So I think in years past omni group would go back maybe
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.100]  A couple releases the os I think these days it's more likely to be
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:57.260]  Back one. Yeah, I don't know. It's not all in my head
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.140]  But I think omni has moved along with the rest of the industry to be a little more aggressive about that
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:07.820]  And frankly, you know, it's easier now back, you know back in the hmm. I mean you had to go buy
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:15.740]  Jaguar right right 10.2. I mean, I remember people lining up outside the app store, you know to get the new mac
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.740]  Os release these days, you know, it's just
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:24.700]  It was also software update. It was also expensive. Like I I believe the first few updates to macos 10 were like 120 bucks
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.700]  Absolutely, right, right
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:33.180]  Yeah, and people would like line up. Yeah, I totally would. Yeah 120. Could you imagine if they could you even imagine if like
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.820]  Next month that the you know apple
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:42.700]  Phil sheller comes on stage and and he's proud to introduce, you know, we told you about it at wwdc
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.900]  Here's macos catalina and it's 120 dollars
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:52.140]  Yeah, right like and it ships on dvds. I I think people would like even if he didn't say dvd
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:57.340]  Even if you just said it was gonna be 120 in the app store. I I think the audience would laugh
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.140]  I don't even think they would believe him, you know, like I think it would play as a gag even if they were serious like
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.420]  and I think that there's such a high percentage of
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:10.140]  Apple customers across all the platforms including the mac
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:16.540]  Which is neat in my opinion when they talk about how many new to the mac customers they still have every quarter
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:21.580]  Who I don't think I think you would have a hard time convincing them that 10 years ago we paid
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.940]  120 dollars to get the new version of macos 10. Yeah, and not only that people lined up
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.140]  Long lines around the block to get the new macos. Yeah. Yeah
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:39.740]  The other another long-standing developer. I know you use and love the app but bbedit from barebone software
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.980]  Has also and it's just why i've been doing this for a long time
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.580]  Another app that i've noticed the trend where bbedit is required. I don't know what its current requirements are
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.980]  But it's I think somewhere like you said, I think it's pretty much like current minus one
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.580]  And for similar reasons, it's just too hard to test too hard to
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:08.460]  It almost put your name behind right like if you're yeah if you've tried to support further back you don't want
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:15.980]  You're not trying to anger like if you have a customer who is very conservative about updating their their system software
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.860]  And they have a mac running iowa or macos
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.580]  10.12 say or
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.980]  You know, I don't know my parents imac is probably running like 10 12 or something like that
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.780]  You know
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.220]  whether through
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:34.540]  Apathy or whether through just a very conservative nature, which is very
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:40.060]  Reasonable, right, especially if you're using machine for this, you know some kind of important production stuff and you've got everything working just right
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.060]  And you know, it all just works, right?
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:48.060]  Uh, and you just don't want to take a chance that updating the system, you know, and all sorts of stuff does break
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.060]  You know, there's there's uh
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:55.100]  Uh, I believe catalina is gonna finally break 32-bit
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.620]  Compatibility, so if there are any apps that people depend on
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.500]  That are 32-bit mac apps. Uh, you better not update to catalina
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:12.220]  So it's real after all these years userland frontier. This is the last right because it's os it runs on yeah
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:17.820]  That's it because it's a 32-bit app and the work the work to 64-bit eyes. I don't know what the verb is
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.100]  I don't know how to verb for bid eyes that works. 64-bit eyes is uh
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.300]  I'm, not gonna say impossible, but it's it can't be
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:31.500]  Rewriting it. I would I would guess knowing. Yeah, knowing how old that c code is and how many assumptions there are
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:39.900]  Well, and that that c code is using carbon apis and right yeah, so you just start from scratch. Yeah
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.220]  But you you know, so you want to respect those customers and you would like to make them happy
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.580]  But there's a part of there's a part two that you'd want to say to them you would just say
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:57.420]  To be honest with them and say uh, I get it I get why you're still running an old version of mac os
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.620]  And I respect that we respect that as a company or whatever
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.980]  But we can't stand behind the latest version of our app running on that because we don't have the resources to test it adequately
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.900]  Yeah, that's right. Right. So keep running our old version of our app
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.740]  Yeah, and and that's what I you know, people have asked me about menus or quite a bit and so I say yeah
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.020]  Yeah, I wish I could do that. I wish I could do that. I wish I could do that
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.460]  And that's what I say. Yeah, I wish I had a better answer for you
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:25.500]  but our priorities are with new features rather than
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:32.380]  The great amount of work that that would entail right and you know sooner rather than later 10.14 is going to be old
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.060]  Another thing people have commented on with net newsware five
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:47.500]  Is that there as of this moment there's no theming options at all
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:54.780]  Well, it's, you know, articles all render with this default article theme, modern, generous
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:01.940]  font sizes, but very, very, I think it's very appropriate as the default theme and I find
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.780]  it very readable and I read a lot of stuff with it every day, but it's also very generic.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:15.220]  It is very much along the lines of, you know, it's using the system font, so it's San Francisco
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:24.160]  it's very plain, which I think is great as a default, but obviously some people would,
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.420]  you know, and NetNewsWire has a history of supporting themes that you could customize
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.300]  to the full extent of what CSS and HTML allow.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.220]  Yeah, so that's something I'd like to get to fairly soon.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.140]  When that feature first came out in NetNewsWire 2, people really loved it and people would
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.460]  make new themes and send them to me and some of them I would actually include in the app.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.460]  Did you include mine?
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.460]  I think you did.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.620]  Yeah, was yours the one that looked like mail, basically?
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.620]  Yeah, sort of.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.100]  Yeah, I think I did, yeah.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.380]  Yeah, it looked like a cross between mail and Mailsmith.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.380]  Yeah, okay.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.940]  Yeah, that was in there.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:02.940]  Yeah.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:06.300]  And so that was tons of fun and so people really, that was just a way to have fun with
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:13.740]  the app and I, you know, I love that, so there were, yeah, that was just a great thing and
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:17.740]  I get why people might not want the, you know, plain kind of default theme.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.300]  Yeah, I totally do.
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:25.740]  So I would like to not only make, do that feature, but make the old NetNewsWire themes
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.740]  compatible.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:32.340]  So you could use an old theme file and just, I don't know, I don't know how that'll turn
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.860]  out, but I don't know, I'm going to give it a try.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:39.260]  That's an interesting idea, but I don't know about that.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:43.100]  It shouldn't be difficult to find out if it's cool or not, so that's like an evening's work,
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.100]  I suspect.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.380]  Do you read more, do you subscribe to more feeds now than you used to, about the same
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.380]  or fewer?
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.820]  In the old days, I used to have around 150.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:56.220]  These days I have double that.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:05.180]  I read fewer, but the ones who I, because, and what I've, but I, what I do is I've unsubscribed
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:17.740]  or stopped subscribing to feeds from bigger publications, like, because they don't, they
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.180]  don't put the, you know, if they don't put the full article in the feeds, I just don't,
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.380]  I don't want it.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.380]  I don't want it.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.380]  I don't want it.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.460]  I don't want to use NetNewsWire just to know that there's something new there.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.700]  It's I really do want to do my reading in the app.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.260]  Right.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.660]  A lot of my feeds are from people who blog like once a month or whatever.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:40.620]  I mean, there are plenty like yours that are more frequent bloggers, but there are people
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.180]  who don't write that often, but when they do, I sure want to see it.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:49.940]  The old NetNewsWire had a feature that I loved where I forget what the cutoff was, but if
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:58.860]  a feed hadn't been updated in X days, it would turn the name of the feed Brown.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:05.020]  And people would say, Oh God, my blog has turned Brown in NetNewsWire.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.340]  Any thought to bringing that back?
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.340]  Yeah.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.340]  I've thought about it.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:15.940]  I, I, I intended to at least have the the old dinosaurs window in, in the new NetNewsWire.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.340]  And I, you know, I still might, but it got cut for the shipment.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.760]  But so that was a related feature where you could open up a window that would show you
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.820]  all your dinosaurs and you could pick whatever last hasn't been updated in 30 days or nine
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.820]  days or whatever.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:35.460]  And you could see which ones were apparently dead and you could unsubscribe right from
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.460]  there.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:42.460]  But yeah, that, that was related to the Brown feeds feature.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:47.680]  One of my favorite little things, and it was funny because I didn't, I guess I noticed
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:55.320]  it, but I only noticed it subliminally because I didn't complain about it.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:02.380]  But in it was Josh, Josh Ginter who wrote the sweet set up review of NetNewsWire.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.700]  I linked to it yesterday when I linked to the NetNewsWire announcement.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.620]  But he pointed out explicitly that right now there's not a lot of smart feed options in
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.840]  NetNewsWire, but one of them is last day, which is to me super useful.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.460]  But he observed, and it's something I, like I said, I noticed it subliminally cause I
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.340]  hate when software works the other way.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:29.020]  But last day doesn't mean like from midnight on, it means like whatever time it is, it's
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.740]  like a rolling 24 hours.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.740]  Yeah.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.300]  And it's called actually called today.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.300]  Yeah.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:38.180]  Like, yeah, we're, we're stretching the meaning, but yeah, I mean, come on.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:44.300]  I only had a couple of complaints as a, as a night owl who does often does read after
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.300]  midnight.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:50.980]  Uh, you know, like I've, I'm trying to think what apps, like I feel like there's a way
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:51.980]  that I set up a smart.
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:55.060]  I have a similar smart mailbox in apple mail.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:19:00.500]  Um, but I think that like on iOS where you can't, I could be wrong if I'm wrong, forgive
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:05.860]  me, but I think that on iOS where you can't, you don't customize your smart feeds.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.740]  You only get the ones that are built in.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.900]  There is no customization.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.620]  You the today feed cuts off at midnight and I hate it.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.900]  Oh, it makes me mad all the time.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:17.900]  Yeah.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.220]  Where I like check and I'll be like, I mean, make sure I don't have an email.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.940]  I'm like, I don't have two unread emails today.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.940]  That's great.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:29.420]  And then I realized it's 1205 and I have like 98 from yesterday and I have to fish about,
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:36.180]  it's just little things like that that make me happy about apps.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:42.220]  Like you said, it should be fun to, to use an app and I kind of feel like in some ways
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:47.040]  we've gotten away from that even though, uh, ourself, you know, computers are more powerful
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.140]  than ever, but I feel like we're not using them for fun.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:54.580]  We're using them for stuff that's not fun, like sandboxing.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:59.180]  And one of the things that kills me about so many apps these days is despite these amazingly
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.660]  fast computers, they've gotten so slow.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:07.700]  The apps have gotten so slow and I'm just like, it just feels like a slog sometimes.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:13.340]  So my design goal here was, you know, make it just freakishly snappy.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:16.100]  Well, I think you succeeded.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.100]  Thank you.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.100]  One of my favorite things, and it is a hallmark of net news wire.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.340]  I would have told you as a friend, I would have taken you aside at an intervention and
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:33.320]  told you, you cannot ship without it is arrow key navigation through the app, uh, which
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.420]  I really, I wish could have, like, I don't understand.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:43.000]  I want to go around it Cupertino and bang Apple people's heads and you know, just slap
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.300]  them upside the head and say, look at how in this app you can just use these arrow keys
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:51.460]  and move between pains and everything happens very fast.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:55.260]  And when you go down in the list, you don't have to wait for the next thing to load.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.300]  It's just, as soon as it takes more time to press the button, the arrow key button than
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:06.060]  it does for the view to render, uh, it feels, I always said it makes net news.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.620]  It makes it feel like you're playing a game to go through net news wire.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.180]  It has like the, the low latency of a game to just move around your articles.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:15.180]  Yeah.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.180]  Yeah.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.180]  Those are the actual key shortcuts.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:21.420]  Um, my favorite new one, I don't, I can't believe I never thought of it before and someone
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:25.020]  actually suggested it is to use the end key for next on red.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.940]  Oh, I just never had that, but that's new in 5.0.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.340]  Oh, I like that.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:32.340]  I use that all the damn time.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:37.660]  So one of the things that another hallmark of net news wire and it works, it sounds crazy.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:42.340]  And I think back in like whenever you first started doing it, 2002, 2003, it was early
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:52.600]  on, but you, you, you use naked alphabet keys, uh, or I should say unmodified alphabet keys
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.640]  as shortcuts.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.060]  So you don't have to press command K to mark a feed.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.060]  All the articles is red.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.040]  You can just hit K. Yeah.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.720]  And so to get to the next article, you don't have to hit command N because command N would
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.720]  be new.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.700]  I don't know what that would do in that news wire, but new feed.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:09.700]  Oh yeah.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.940]  So it's already used, but you can hit just plain end, no modifier, which when I first,
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.180]  when you first started, when you first implemented that, I, my, the, the traditionalist in me,
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:26.780]  the, the, the, the almost religious, I know what idiomatic Mac software is supposed to
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.260]  be like.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:34.740]  And part of the reason I love Brent Simmons's work is that he clearly gets it too.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.000]  I remember thinking, did this guy have a stroke?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  What is wrong with him?
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  You can't that you can't do that.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.840]  But then I tried it before I complained and I was like, you know what, you can do this
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.820]  because it's not really an editing app.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:53.520]  And if you are editing like the name of a feed or that brief era when net news wire
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:59.660]  actually had a blog editor built into it, which eventually was spun out and is still
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:06.140]  live today as Mars edit with our friend Daniel Jaffa at a red sweater.
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:10.640]  If you were in an editing view, of course hitting K didn't mark the current feed unread
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.180]  at type decay.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.180]  It doesn't, it, it somehow seemed wrong to me.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:21.860]  And then I realized in practice there's as long as they're only active when it makes
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:28.340]  sense in terms of what currently has the input focus, it'll never get in the way.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.340]  And I love it.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.340]  Yeah.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:36.540]  I mean the, the app is basically in a generic sense, just a database navigation app.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.780]  So yeah, why not make it fast and simple?
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.700]  I would really like that feature in mail.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:48.300]  I guess it's one of those things where I, I, I could probably, well, I see, I, there's
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.660]  a lot of things you can do with like keyboard maestro or Apple scripts or something like
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:52.660]  that.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.740]  And a lot of times where I think of features where I want to request to somebody and then
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.540]  I think, well, let me see if I can hack it together with keyboard maestro and it works
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.540]  perfectly.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.860]  And then I think, well, then I won't bother them.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.060]  I wish mail had a next unread command.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.060]  I do too.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.060]  That's exactly what I'm thinking.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.380]  Boy, that would make my life easier where I could just skip through and I don't want
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.280]  to have to scroll because you know, it's like sometimes you get these marketing emails and
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.900]  it's like just a scroll to the bottom is like six hits of the space bar, you know?
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:19.900]  Right.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:20.900]  Yeah.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:21.900]  I don't want to do that.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.900]  I know I don't want to read this.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:26.020]  I just want to go next, next, next, next.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.900]  And maybe another key that deletes it and then goes to the next.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.900]  Yeah.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.740]  Archives or whatever you kids do today.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.740]  I like deleting.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.740]  No, deleting is great.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:39.420]  I ever tell you about, I think I actually let the domain expire so I can, I can tell
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.420]  the story.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:48.420]  Uh, I've tried to give up on, on my, my terrible collection of domain names that go unused.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:54.180]  Uh, remember this is back in the same era, that early two thousands era.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:01.500]  Remember when, uh, our friend Merlin Mann, uh, was, was talking about inbox zero and
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:07.460]  inbox zero was, uh, like a philosophy, a way, uh, uh, uh, philosophy combined with a series
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:12.820]  of strategies to keep your, your email inbox at zero on reds and it would make you feel
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.720]  better about your life.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.180]  You know, I do it every single day.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.100]  I don't, I, I have, uh, let's, let's see how many on reds I have.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.740]  Uh, I wish I could, I would make me feel better.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.420]  It actually is a source of anxiety.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:33.340]  So my, my four main email accounts have 37 on red.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.340]  That's not bad.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:40.180]  Uh, 1,228, uh, 6,408.
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:41.380]  Nope.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:51.700]  It just went up cause I launched at 6,914 and then, uh, 13,000, nope, 13,000, 600.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.260]  And the one, the one with, nope, nope.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.500]  The one was 6,000.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:59.100]  This is, tells you how long it's been since I launched mail on, on this iMac.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.100]  What did I say?
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.100]  It was at 6,900.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.940]  It's actually at 70, 7,800.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.900]  I just downloaded 900 emails while we're talking.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:13.740]  Um, and I actually declared bankruptcy on that one earlier in the year where I, uh,
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:17.220]  I couldn't bring myself, couldn't bring myself to Markham as red.
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:23.400]  So what I did is I created a new mailbox and then selected them all, left the red state
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.340]  as it was, and just moved them to that mailbox out of the inbox.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:34.060]  But anyway, there was this inbox zero and it was a popular thing and I think it was
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:41.020]  fine idea, but I, I registered the, uh, the domain name select all delete and I was going
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.580]  to make a single page website with my,
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:48.020]  you've heard of inbox zero.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.780]  Let me tell you about a better way.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:53.260]  It's called select all delete.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:27:06.580]  Step one, select all messages in the mailbox tip command a step to hit the delete key easier.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:11.620]  Step three, we'll walk away.
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.740]  Select all delete.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:18.420]  I'll tell you what, my feeds, my feeds stay close to zero for the most part.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:23.580]  I find it very, you know, and it's very different cause there's no spam, there's no email marketing.
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.460]  I don't get marketing messages in, uh, in RSS.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.060]  I don't get pitches from PR companies in RS, RSS.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:36.020]  Um, but I, you know, and there's other people who, you know, everybody to each their own,
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:42.140]  I'm sure some people subscribe to 500 feeds and never, never ever catch up.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:46.420]  I know Dave Weiner, uh, who co-invented, you know, who you worked with and you mentioned
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:52.100]  before and has done so much work and in terms of actually literally creating the RSS formats
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:58.420]  and popularizing the use of them for blogging and helping to create podcasting, et cetera,
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.940]  et cetera, is a believer in what he calls a river of news where you just subscribe to
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:06.820]  stuff you're interested in, put them all in one stream and just, you know, read till you
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:11.100]  get bored, scroll down till you get bored and then come back later and there'll be new
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.540]  stuff at the top side, which is sort of, I think how most people read Twitter, right?
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.780]  Yeah, I think so too.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:19.820]  I realized that, you know, I don't know how many other John Syracuse is there are who
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:25.460]  are our Twitter completionists, but I subscribed to way too many feeds and Twitter.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:31.220]  Um, to me, Twitter, the success of Twitter, popularity of Twitter is validation of the
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.020]  Dave Weiner river of news theory.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.020]  Yeah.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.940]  And I think Facebook's similarly, yeah.
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:40.660]  People just kind of read through the stream until they're bored or whatever.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.220]  But that's not how I use RSS.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.820]  It's how I use Twitter and I'm happy to use Twitter that way.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.260]  But I use Twitter where if there's a feed where I feel like I've got like a lot of unreads
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.540]  and I feel like I don't feel like reading this, I just unsubscribe.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.640]  I ruthlessly unsubscribe to RSS feeds these days, whereas in the early days I would just
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.660]  keep adding and maybe just like drag them to the bottom or something.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:06.180]  I'm pretty ruthless about just marking stuff as red, um, you know, without really looking
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.180]  at it either.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:10.140]  I mean these things, it's not email, it's not addressed to me.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:14.100]  I don't have to see it and I can trust the universe that, you know, if there's something
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.780]  really important, I'll see it somehow some way.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.260]  So the K, the K button, that's what K stands for.
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.260]  I love it.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.260]  All right.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:29.340]  Let me take a break here and thank our second and final sponsor of this episode, uh, which
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.420]  because it's the end of August is a little abbreviated.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.140]  It's our friends at Express VPN.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.860]  Look, VPN, virtual private network.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.780]  You ever use a public wifi network at an airport or a coffee shop and maybe like your iPhone
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:47.980]  will warn you when you connect, it'll say, Hey, this network is not secure.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:52.420]  Uh, maybe you look around like a good way to tell you're on a public wifi network is
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.780]  you go to the sharing sheet and everybody else in the airport terminal where you are
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:00.980]  or maybe on the plane, like when you're on the go-go thing and the plane and you see
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:06.180]  all of these random strangers in the, the airdrop list, that's cause you're all on the
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.820]  same network and it's not encrypted.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:12.180]  A VPN is a secure encrypted way.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.960]  You connect to a VPN, you can use a public network.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:20.180]  Your connection to the internet is over SSL directly to the VPN provider and then everything
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.220]  else goes through there.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:26.980]  It's all encrypted on the local network and you won't have that problem.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.900]  Uh, much more secure.
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:37.100]  Some companies require VPNs for obvious reasons to do company work because it's, that's that
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.100]  much that difference.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:42.920]  The difference between insecure and secure, uh, but you could use one and for your own
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:47.180]  private use and express VPN is a great way to do it.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:51.820]  It secures and anonymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data and hiding your public
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.380]  IP address from the sites you limit you visit.
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:58.620]  So they, it also helps reduce tracking because sites don't see your IP address.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:02.060]  They see express VPNs IP address.
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:06.660]  They've got easy to use apps that run seamlessly in the background of your computer, your phone,
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:11.740]  your tablet, and turning on express VPN protection only takes one click.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:17.280]  You don't have to be a network administrator or a computer expert or security expert to
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.380]  configure weird things.
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.940]  Simply one click, one tap on the phone app and your boom, you're connected to express
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:28.580]  VPN and you can safely surf on public wifi without being snooped on or having your personal
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:34.420]  data stolen and it costs less than seven bucks a month to start using it.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:38.500]  It's the number one rated VPN service by tech radar and it comes with a 30 day money back
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.500]  guarantee.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.900]  So if you don't like it, cancel it, get your seven bucks back, protect your online activity
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:47.780]  today and find out how you can get three months free.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.380]  So in addition to just being seven bucks a month regularly, you can get three months
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:32:00.500]  free by going to express vpn.com slash T T S that's express vpn.com slash TTS, TTS for
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:05.540]  the talk show and you'll get three months free when you sign up for a one year package.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:08.100]  Let me do some follow up.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.220]  I got to, I got to get this off my chest.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.500]  I don't want to bore you.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.220]  Uh, do you listen to the show with down ripple?
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.220]  I think you did.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.220]  Cause we talked about net news wire.
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:17.220]  Yeah, I did.
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.620]  I kind of spaced out during some of the apple card gets, well, guess what?
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.940]  That's what the followups about.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.940]  Excellent.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.740]  All right, here's a problem I had with apple card and I talked about it with Jim, which
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:34.300]  was that I signed up for apple card and the signup was just as easy as promised and boom,
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:37.540]  there it is in my, in my phone's wallet app.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:44.220]  Uh, the day after I recorded with Jim, uh, doorbell rang and FedEx or ups or somebody
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.980]  put an envelope through the mail slot and there was my actual card.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:50.220]  I had the actual physical titanium card.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:56.700]  Um, but the one thing I didn't have was an easy way to switch my apple stuff to use apple
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.700]  card.
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:01.300]  And that was one of the reasons I signed up for the card because you, you get your itunes
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:05.980]  purchases or like a, I pay 10 bucks a month for a iCloud storage.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.460]  I want all that stuff on the apple card.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.660]  I get 3% cash back.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:10.820]  There was no easy way to do it.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:14.340]  What I had to do, and I talked about it last week, was the only way I could see to do it
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:21.020]  was to go in and enter the credit card number, the 16 digits and the expiration and the secret
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:25.100]  CVV code all manually like a, like an animal.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:29.420]  And then it just showed up in my list as a quote mastercard with a generic mastercard
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.700]  logo instead of apple card.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:38.140]  Uh, I can verify that while I was in that state, uh, I was still getting 3% cash back
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.220]  on apple purchases, but it didn't seem right.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:48.340]  Anyway, long story short, I reached out to apple and top people on the apple app, hard
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.900]  table, uh, looked into it.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:57.660]  And the problem was that I'm one of the old, old farts who has two apple IDs in active
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.660]  views.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.660]  I actually have a bunch of apple IDs.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:04.740]  Mike, my apple developer connection, one's a separate one, but I've got an iCloud account,
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:08.740]  which I use for like iCloud storage and I message and all of that.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:14.380]  Uh, it's a, a mac.com address, but I don't use that for iTunes.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:22.260]  I signed up for iTunes way back when using a daring fireball address and I suspected
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:29.620]  that might be the problem, but the real problem is that I didn't have two factor authentication
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:30.620]  on the store account.
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.780]  I only turned on two factor for the iCloud account.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.580]  Oh God, this is tedious, John.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:37.580]  It is tedious.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:42.580]  It's probably a bad idea, but my thinking was, what do I really care about with two
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:43.580]  factor?
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.580]  I don't want to get hacked.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:46.700]  I don't want anybody hacking my email.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:50.020]  I don't want anybody hacking my iCloud backups.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.860]  You know, I've got important data in iCloud.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:56.140]  I don't really care if my iTunes account gets hacked.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.220]  What are people going to do?
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.340]  Watch the movies I've already bought?
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.300]  No, I don't care.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.300]  What are they?
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.500]  Are they going to buy a movie that I don't want?
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.940]  Well, then I'm going to get the notification from my credit card and I'm going to see that
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.080]  it was fraud and they'll take care of it, right?
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.020]  Like there's not as much downside, so I, and I felt very confident that my password was
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.660]  adequately secured.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:23.020]  It's a unique password that I don't use anywhere else, but anyway, apple pay doesn't work without
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.020]  two factor.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.060]  And so the fact that I had this split account was the thing.
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:33.860]  And once I turned two factor on, on the other account, I was able to add the apple card
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.660]  magically the way you're supposed to.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:36.660]  So there you go.
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.780]  Nice, nice update on that story.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:44.540]  The other thing is I said, Hey, wouldn't it be nice if you could use your apple cash to
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:48.340]  pay your apple card credit balance?
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.100]  Turns out you can do this, but I didn't realize it because the only way it's exposed is when
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:59.580]  you go into the wallet app, you click your apple card and you click like pay early, right?
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.900]  Instead of waiting for your bill to be due and getting a notification, you could, you
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.140]  can just pay it off whenever you want.
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:08.540]  If you pay now, you get like the little slide up sheet from the bottom that says here, confirm
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.540]  it.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:14.980]  You can switch your, the source of your payment in that sheet from your bank account to your
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.340]  apple cash card.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.980]  And you can put, you know, even if you only have five bucks on your apple cash card, you
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:23.180]  could just put it right towards your apple credit card.
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:26.020]  I didn't realize it cause I hadn't tried to pay the card.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.660]  So I didn't realize that it was there.
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:30.780]  I was just looking at the section where you can add bank accounts.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:34.580]  I thought, wouldn't it be nice if you could add your apple cash card?
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.680]  So anyway, you can do that.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:43.260]  And then last but not least, I was talking to Jim about a guy who I remember fondly from
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:49.060]  the nineties on the home shopping network who would yell and scream at you to buy baseball
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:54.100]  cards and tell you you would regret this for the rest of your life.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:59.420]  A couple of people also, a couple of listeners remember him fondly as well and they have
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.420]  better memories than me.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.420]  They remember his name.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.060]  His name was Don West.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:07.540]  He apparently was also involved with pro wrestling up in Canada, which tells you a lot about
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:08.540]  his attitude.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.960]  So I'm going to put a link in the show notes to a YouTube video.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:19.420]  You can watch him doing his thing and you're going to think I was drunk and high to have
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:24.780]  enjoyed watching this on a nightly basis and you'd be right.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:26.380]  And then also, Will Ferrell.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.460]  This deal makes no sense.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:29.460]  Exactly.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:32.420]  You're going to regret this for the rest of your life.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.980]  SNL had a series of skits in the nineties where Will Ferrell played him and they're
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:43.380]  hilarious, including one where instead of selling baseball cards, they're selling Star
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:51.620]  Wars memorabilia and then they're trying to sell Mark Hamill for $80,000.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.420]  Well, that's a discount.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:55.420]  Yeah.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:01.060]  So there's, that's it for follow-up.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.980]  Trying to think what else is going on here.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.260]  I still can't get Apple cash set up on my phone.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:06.260]  Why?
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.260]  I don't know.
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:09.300]  I, you know, there's a big button to press.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:14.060]  I press the button, turns into a little spinny spins for a while, then turns back into a
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.060]  button.
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.060]  Do you have two factor on?
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.060]  Yeah.
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:18.060]  Well, probably.
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:19.060]  I don't know.
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.340]  That would be my thing though.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:22.340]  I know.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.760]  But yeah, I'm pretty sure I do.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.680]  You would think at some point it would tell me there was an error and what it was now
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.460]  just spins, gives up.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:36.980]  Do you see that breaking news before we started recording that Jack Dorsey's Twitter account
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.380]  was hacked?
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.820]  I just saw the headline, but no, no details.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.420]  I'm I'm delighted wrongly.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:49.500]  It should, you know, that's a terrible thing because it could be, it could be anybody.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:54.060]  Well, there's one, there's one particular person who, and I even, when I wrote about
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:58.180]  it on during fireball, there's one particular person who I'm terrified of having his Twitter
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:04.220]  account hacked because I believe it could literally lead to like a shooting war.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.220]  Sure.
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.220]  Yeah.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.220]  Yeah.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:13.180]  And so if we know that is Jack Dorsey's Twitter account could be hacked, I, I worry, I sincere,
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.660]  I don't think it's an overblown concern.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:19.860]  I mean, Jack Dorsey, I think understands how Twitter works a lot better than the other
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.220]  guy I'm thinking of.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.900]  Yeah.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.020]  And so he could be hacked and somebody could spew a bunch of racial nonsense or whatever
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.020]  they were posting.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:33.420]  I think it'd be pretty, it's, it's, you gotta think, you gotta worry that it's possible
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:38.740]  that you know, whose Twitter account could be hacked and somebody could post something
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.100]  truly dangerous.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:42.380]  So I, I want to laugh.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.380]  Yeah.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.180]  But I, and I kind of am laughing.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.820]  I would, I would be delighted.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:52.540]  This should not happen if the president's account were hacked and somebody came on and
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:40:00.020]  started like posting rational, non-racial nonsense, just seemed like presidential and,
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:02.020]  and good.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.180]  I would salute that.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:07.160]  I mean, yeah, that would be, honestly, no, don't do it.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.160]  Don't do it.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.220]  But I, you know, trying to think, you know, it's the end of August, there's not a lot
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.220]  of news.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:20.460]  What about the, I know everybody's talking about, Jim and I talked about these rumors
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:24.380]  and I'll bring it up with you and then I'll leave it alone until we find out if it actually
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.380]  ships.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:31.140]  But the, the whispers on the street that Apple might be in some way with some products returning
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:32.700]  to the six color Apple logo.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.140]  Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I, I do walk the streets a lot and I hear people talking as they walk
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:39.140]  by.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.460]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:46.180]  I saw that, I saw the events and that would be cool, but weren't there only five colors
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.180]  in that?
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.180]  No, it's six.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.180]  It is six.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:50.180]  Okay.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.180]  Yeah.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:54.500]  And that's actually where our friend Jason Snell's sixcolors.com comes from.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.500]  Yeah.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.500]  Right.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.500]  Sure.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.500]  Right.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.500]  Yeah.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.260]  It's the, and they do go in, in rainbow order.
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.260]  It's just that they like bit shifted by two.
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:14.060]  And so instead of starting at like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, they starts with
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.020]  green at the top and then it's got blue at the bottom.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:22.420]  I would like to see Apple just kind of return to more color in general.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:27.580]  Like I have mail open in one of my computers right now and I'm looking at the sidebar,
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:34.340]  which is gray on corpse blue and like, yeah, they used, they used to be able to use colors
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.740]  for things and that it was actually really nice.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:37.740]  Yeah.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.940]  I mean, it's been this, like, it seems like that the post linen era where everything has
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:45.380]  to be just kind of blue, gray and monotone.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:46.380]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.380]  Right.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.420]  And even when they use a different color, like in the notes app, everything is yellow.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.420]  Yeah.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:54.420]  I hope so too.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:58.420]  I feel like the pendulum has to swing back on that and I actually think it's interesting
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:02.020]  and you know, you, you've always been, I'd mentioned this, but like net news wire five
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:08.900]  looks very, very much like a 2019 Mac app should, but there's a little bit, a little
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:12.660]  bit of color in those toolbar icons, right?
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:17.160]  And it goes out of its way to highlight the feet icons coming from all over and that adds
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.380]  an awful lot of liveliness to it too.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:26.340]  But I think it's sort of telling about how far to the extreme the current aesthetic is
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:29.740]  that net news wire five counts as a colorful Mac app.
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:30.740]  Right.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.740]  True.
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:32.740]  Yeah.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.740]  All right.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.740]  Yep.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.700]  Uh, you know, and I don't want to blame everything on Johnny Ive, but I blame Johnny Ive.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:44.220]  Well, cause it's his fault.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.220]  I can't help it.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:50.100]  You know, and I, you know, I don't know how far in advance is, is, you know, exit from
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.420]  the company retirement, whatever you want to call it was known.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:58.420]  Uh, you know, how much of this was still up in the air when they were making the decisions
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:06.580]  for what iOS 13 and Mac OS 10 point 15 Catalina seat that I can't even remember the goddamn
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.580]  numbers.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:13.060]  Um, but I can't help but feel that if, if there's going to be some kind of post Johnny
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:17.740]  Ive pendulum swing in the other direction, it wouldn't have been this year.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:19.540]  It'll be, it'll start next year.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.540]  Oh, sure.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:22.540]  Yeah.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.540]  That makes sense.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:28.060]  Uh, anything else that you wanted to talk about before we, before we sign off for this
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:34.340]  labor day weekend now, I guess there's an apple event coming up.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:39.080]  We've gotten new, new OS is people seem to be having a rock developers are having kind
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.080]  of a rocky summer.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.080]  Yeah.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.340]  And I don't know what to say about that.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.540]  Some summers are easier than others.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.540]  That's kind of the thing I keep hearing about most though.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.660]  I guess my friends are developers.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:49.660]  Yeah.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:50.980]  Uh, yeah.
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:53.780]  And I, I feel like the Mac is in an interesting state.
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:57.000]  Um, and without getting, I don't want to make it political cause I don't think it should
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.880]  be political, but with Catalina, Catalina catalyst, which is the UI kit, you know, bring
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:10.940]  your iPad apps to the Mac technology that they sort of preannounced last year so that
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:16.340]  they could ship their own, uh, home and news and voice recorder apps.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:23.260]  And now it's, it's going to be part of Mac OS 10, 15, uh, as sort of weird.
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:27.260]  And there's people arguing, uh, you know, on Twitter about whether that's the future
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:31.060]  of the Mac and whether Swift UI is the future of the Mac.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:36.060]  And in the meantime, app, app kit, AKA good old fashioned cocoa just keeps rolling along.
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.060]  Yeah.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:39.540]  I mean, I just wrote a app with it.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.500]  It's really, really good.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:46.220]  App kit is super, uh, you did mention, you mentioned that, that one of the reasons for
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:51.300]  drawing the line, the line in the sand at 10.14.4 was that's where you didn't need to
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.620]  embed the Swift libraries.
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:58.620]  That means of course that you use Swift to write either all or most of net news wire
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.620]  five.
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:00.620]  I actually don't even know.
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:06.320]  I know you used it some degree, but pretty the actual application user interface code,
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.740]  much of what's in the frameworks.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:10.140]  Um, there's some really, really old stuff.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:15.020]  Like the stuff I started with, um, the RSS parser, like whatever four years ago that
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:19.660]  that's written in, in objective C, but pretty much everything else is Swift.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:24.380]  And what, what are your opinions on it after at now having dug your teeth in and used it
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:30.180]  to write a real app that is actually shipping?
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.940]  Swift is, it's a lot of fun.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.860]  Sometimes it's like driving a hot rod, but then you just like run into a brick wall at
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:40.100]  80 miles an hour.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:45.260]  Um, so that's kind of fun until that moment, but the, but you know, you get up, shake it
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:48.580]  off, go, go back down at 80 miles an hour or whatever.
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.860]  Um, so it's a lot of fun.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:56.980]  I still, it, it's a lot prettier to look at than objective C, but I still find objective
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:05.360]  C's philosophy, the way it works under the hood, um, to be beautiful in a way that, um,
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.140]  that I don't find in Swift.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:14.980]  Swift's amazing, but objective C not on the page, but under the hood is, is lovely.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:19.480]  And not even its implementation necessarily, but the concept, you know, message passing
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:25.060]  and all that kind of stuff inherited from small talk, I think, yeah, that just really
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.060]  appeals to me.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:33.340]  It's a completely dynamic runtime that you can sort of mess with in unforeseen ways,
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:38.760]  or could at least in the old days, um, you know, which was definitely what small talk
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:39.760]  was all about.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.760]  Yeah.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760]  And the idea wasn't,
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.900]  Says me who never wrote a line of small talk in his life.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:45.900]  Yeah.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.340]  And it's not about, you know, you could use it for like evil, stupid hacks.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:55.540]  It's actually about, you know, it's really about writing applications, um, um, in the
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:56.940]  most elegant way possible.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.460]  And objective C was such a compromise, right?
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:05.620]  Cause it's that kind of small talky stuff, but with C, which is such the opposite thing,
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:08.380]  um, all combined into one.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:15.220]  Um, and that, you know, that made for a deeply strange language, but the objective C part
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:17.260]  was really, really, really cool.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.460]  And it was great for writing apps.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:23.220]  I mean, you know, we talked earlier about 2002, I'm working on that news wire and the
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.900]  thing was the cocoa framework was amazing and so far beyond anything that, that I'd
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:29.900]  ever seen.
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:35.140]  And it was, and it was built on the capabilities of objective C. And in fact, all our apps
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:39.440]  still are even though even the ones written in Swift, you know, we're still using app
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.860]  kit and UI kit and whatever.
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:48.900]  And those are, those are objective C frameworks until Swift UI has years to sort of, I'm not
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.860]  saying you can't use it now, but it's, you know, it's early days.
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:48:00.100]  And it's such a massive undertaking until Swift UI really can supersede app kit and
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.100]  UI kit.
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:03.300]  It, that, that's still going to be the case.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.380]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.380]  And that's going to be wild.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:07.540]  It looks to me like Apple's got the right attitude.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:11.860]  You know, you, you still have a host of app kit or UI kit, and then you can use Swift
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.740]  UI where, where it makes sense to and where it actually works.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:16.780]  And so that's what we'll be doing.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:23.180]  And so gradually over time, we'll have a more and more Swift UI universe.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:24.180]  That's cool.
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.180]  I like that.
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:30.340]  It's a testimony to the genius of the original next frameworks, you know, which date back
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:33.820]  to 1989, 1990.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:38.300]  Just how, how philosophically they're still aligned with the way that, that things still
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.300]  work and are useful and feel modern today.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:48.100]  I mean, how much, how many ways of making computers do X, Y, and Z in 1990 are still
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.100]  applicable today?
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:50.100]  Yeah.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:51.100]  Right.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:52.100]  Good point.
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:55.860]  I mean, maybe there's some command line stuff, you know, at the C level, you know, that's,
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:01.180]  that still hasn't changed much, but in terms of building rich applications, boy, there's,
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:02.180]  there's not a lot.
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:10.180]  I mean, I'm sure Adobe has frameworks that probably go back that far internally, but
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:13.740]  it's, it's really remarkable.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:16.060]  Before we sign off, Brent, got any plans for Labor Day?
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.240]  I guess that hopefully this episode will come out tomorrow.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.500]  People can listen to it as they barbecue.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:25.220]  What better way to enjoy fun with your family than listening to us talk about RSS reader?
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.820]  I mean, that's what the holidays are for, RSS.
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820]  Gather the kids.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:33.860]  Me, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go drink and eat with some family
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:34.860]  members.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:36.420]  So yeah, I've got a good day.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.420]  Yeah.
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.820]  We've got a good forecast here.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:39.820]  Beautiful weather.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.780]  It's sort of, if it was technically, well, I guess it is technically feasible to podcast
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:44.780]  from outside.
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:51.840]  If it was acoustically pleasing to, to record a podcast while outside, I'd have done this
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:58.140]  from my deck because it is absolutely positively peak Philadelphia weather.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.620]  Nice and warm, nice and sunny.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:02.620]  Not too muggy?
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:03.780]  No, it's really nice.
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:04.780]  It's really good.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:09.140]  Yeah, it's, it's, I don't know what happened to the humidity, but it's like September came
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:10.140]  early.
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.140]  Cool.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:12.140]  Anyway, enjoy the holiday.
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:16.020]  My best to Sheila and it's always good to have you on.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.620]  I'm going to make sure that we don't go another full year.
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:22.060]  I'm going to make sure Skype never tells me it's been more than a year.
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:42.580]  I've turned Brown in your Skype.
