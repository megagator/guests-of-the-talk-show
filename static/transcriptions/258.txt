[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  John Moltz, my friend. How are you on this? How are you on this Friday, late July?
[00:08.080 --> 00:14.640]  Sweaty. I had to turn the air conditioning off so I might be profusely sweating by the time this
[00:14.640 --> 00:18.960]  is done. If I was smarter man, if I was if I were a much smarter man, I would have turned the AC down
[00:20.240 --> 00:24.960]  hours ago. And then instead left it at 73. So
[00:24.960 --> 00:30.320]  Oh yeah, so it's not like super, it's not, yeah, it's not gonna last you.
[00:30.320 --> 00:37.120]  And as I sat here waiting for this to start, the weather outside went from overcast to
[00:37.120 --> 00:43.920]  sunny. It's beating right down on my desk. That's no good. Just thinking about it is making me
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.040]  sweaty. But it cooled off there, right? Yeah, it did. We had like a stretch of about eight or
[00:49.040 --> 00:57.440]  nine days where it was mid 90s with really high humidity. I don't know if it's the same thing.
[00:57.440 --> 01:03.200]  There's the heat index and then there's the quote unquote feels like, which I'm a big believer in.
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.480]  I actually almost wish that I could change some of my weather apps to prefer the feels like as
[01:08.480 --> 01:12.960]  opposed to the official here's what a thermometer says the temperature is because I feel like it's
[01:12.960 --> 01:18.640]  a much more accurate gauge. We were down in Orlando at the beginning of the month for
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.520]  some time at the Disney parks and the universal and et cetera, et cetera. You know, July
[01:23.520 --> 01:28.560]  down in Orlando, it's perfect time to go. Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful.
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.280]  Well, well, you know what? We time it right though. We've, we do this every year and we,
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.240]  we have it scheduled so that like the last two days, last two or three days, even we spend a
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.400]  lot of most of the time at the pool and it's, that's actually kind of nice. So you like,
[01:42.400 --> 01:47.840]  you like kill yourself going on all these rides for a couple of days and then spend some time at
[01:47.840 --> 01:55.600]  the pool. Um, but anyway, it was general and this is Orlando, Florida in July. It was generally like
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.440]  plus eight on the fields like index. So if it said it was 94, it would be like, feels like 102.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.800]  The other, at the end of this heat wave in Philly, it was plus 13. It was like,
[02:06.800 --> 02:13.840]  I swear to God, it was like 93 degrees and it was like, feels like 107. It was that thick and humid.
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.960]  It was, man, it was pretty bad. Nothing wrong with the climate though. I'll tell you. No,
[02:18.960 --> 02:21.520]  no, that's fine. That's fine. It's all going to work out.
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.320]  You know this cause we're on a slack together. Amy and I went to see the, uh, the rolling stones
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.440]  here in Philadelphia, uh, Tuesday night at the, uh, the Lincoln financial field. Now that was
[02:35.440 --> 02:40.480]  after the heat wave broke. So it was actually pretty pleasant. We actually had rain during
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.640]  the concert, but it was sort of a light rain. Wasn't a heavy rain. So it was, it was all
[02:44.640 --> 02:52.000]  very pleasant. Uh, but it could have been melted. None of the mouth had Keith, maybe almost
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.360]  they got a little soft, but they didn't melt. Can I just say, I would just like to say to start the
[02:59.360 --> 03:06.240]  show that I, it's like the jokes about the rolling stones being old started when I was a kid, you
[03:06.240 --> 03:11.120]  know, like in the eighties, you know, like I've always been a fan of the rolling stones. It's a,
[03:11.120 --> 03:19.440]  it's a band. My mom, God bless her, turned me on to, although my mom, uh, like, I don't know if it
[03:19.440 --> 03:26.720]  was a sign of the times or what, but my mom like tuned, completely tuned out of popular music as
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.760]  soon as I was born. So every, she didn't buy any, like she had like no records after 1973.
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.640]  So I think that's a sort of typical parent thing. Yeah. Oh, I, you know, I'm probably as guilty of
[03:38.640 --> 03:45.040]  it as anybody. I probably tuned out before, before this was born. Um, but like, so my childhood,
[03:45.040 --> 03:51.200]  I loved listening to her Beatles and stones records. Uh, she was, you know, had a big on
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.480]  both, but they were all sort of like mid sixties. And so it was older stuff. Uh, always a fan of the
[03:56.480 --> 04:00.720]  stones, you know, for most of my life, probably if you press me to say, who's your favorite band,
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.200]  I probably would have said the rolling stones from 10 years old through today.
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.760]  Uh, but the jokes about them being old started, you know, like in the eighties.
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.040]  And I feel like they've gotten so old and have still, still the same thing that nobody even jokes
[04:15.040 --> 04:18.960]  about it. And you know what I mean? Like they've looped around and everybody, I honestly, I just
[04:18.960 --> 04:25.360]  think people are like, uh, they're just in awe. It was funny. We had seats, it was at the football
[04:25.360 --> 04:32.160]  stadium, the Lincoln financial field. And don't, don't get me started on stadium. Number one,
[04:32.160 --> 04:35.520]  it's been the Lincoln. We've already talked about that. It has been the Lincoln financial
[04:35.520 --> 04:41.120]  field ever since they built the damn thing. Uh, I still have, I have no idea what Lincoln financial
[04:41.120 --> 04:48.080]  is. I don't know. It's really working. I really don't. I don't think it's a bank. Uh, I think,
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.720]  I don't know what it is, but yeah, the, the money, money well spent. But anyway, we had seats
[04:52.720 --> 04:57.520]  probably at like the equivalent of the 50 yard line, maybe a little bit closer, more like the
[04:57.520 --> 05:03.120]  45 yard line, but they were on the aisle and the stones, there's a big stage upfront with some of
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.600]  the biggest, brightest displays I've ever seen in my life. I, it's unbelievable that these things
[05:07.600 --> 05:13.440]  get like trucked around the country for the concerts. I mean, they're way bigger, taller,
[05:13.440 --> 05:20.000]  brighter than most of the similar type signage on like the Las Vegas strip, which is like permanent
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.360]  permanent three 65 days a year. Just unbelievable. But they had like this sort of, uh, like a catwalk
[05:27.360 --> 05:34.640]  that came out from the stage to maybe like the 50 yard line and Mick would sometimes run out there.
[05:34.640 --> 05:38.560]  And then they, they, the whole band came out for an acoustic set, like how, you know, two or three
[05:38.560 --> 05:41.920]  songs halfway through the show. And we were really close to that part of the stage. It was really
[05:41.920 --> 05:48.480]  cool, but we're right on the aisle and, um, it's sort of an aisle between us and this catwalk that
[05:48.480 --> 05:55.440]  comes out 40 yards from the main stage. And we're waiting for the concert to start and the, uh, you
[05:55.440 --> 06:00.480]  know, as people are wanting to do at a concert, people, people with, you know, tickets in the
[06:00.480 --> 06:06.320]  back might try to wander up to the front. Uh, and the security people were right on top of it.
[06:06.320 --> 06:12.160]  We're very clear. And at one point it made Amy laugh out loud. I see somebody came up and was
[06:12.160 --> 06:15.840]  like, you know, saying like, I just want to come up here and dance. And, and the security guard said
[06:15.840 --> 06:19.920]  to her, ma'am, this is an older audience. You never know. We might have a medical emergency.
[06:19.920 --> 06:29.040]  We need to keep this aisle clear. I swear to God, Amy almost died because, and it was,
[06:29.040 --> 06:34.880]  we could, somebody might break a hip. Somebody might break a hip and it's wet, you know,
[06:34.880 --> 06:41.200]  somebody might, it might be a slip and fall. So now the jokes are about the fans.
[06:41.200 --> 06:48.160]  Yeah, exactly. And it is, it is so true. Like if you, if you're, you know, mid forties,
[06:48.160 --> 06:52.800]  maybe even, you know, maybe 50, maybe up to 55, you want to feel young. You want to feel good
[06:52.800 --> 06:59.920]  about yourself. Go to a Rolling Stones concert. Wow. Yeah. That's, that's probably, that's better.
[06:59.920 --> 07:03.360]  Yeah. I mean, I've done, I've done the opposite, which I think is about when I stopped going to
[07:03.360 --> 07:10.880]  to live music because I was with a friend and we were looking around like, Oh my God,
[07:11.600 --> 07:18.640]  we're the oldest people here. We're the old guys. Oh man. We got to stop coming to these.
[07:18.640 --> 07:23.120]  I, it is amazing. Mick Jagger. I looked it up. I did the research. He's 76 years old,
[07:23.120 --> 07:29.120]  which is stunning. He looks absolutely fantastic. I really, I mean, I can't say I got super close
[07:29.120 --> 07:36.160]  to him and, you know, but I mean, he certainly fit. Uh, I think he has done an incredible
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.880]  service to himself. I mean, he's obviously, you know, coloring his hair is, you know,
[07:40.880 --> 07:46.240]  hair still brown, but he's not doing, you know, but he's not doing the plastic surgery thing,
[07:46.240 --> 07:51.280]  you know, I mean, his face is craggled and, and, you know, it's his, you know,
[07:51.280 --> 07:55.680]  he's doing it the right way. I think their, their initial aging was, you know, as the Indiana Jones
[07:55.680 --> 07:59.520]  thing, it's not the years, it's the mileage. Right. Yeah. Yeah, totally. And then that's why
[07:59.520 --> 08:04.640]  they probably mostly stayed the same since then. Right. Uh, the other, you know, Ron Wood looks
[08:04.640 --> 08:10.320]  great. Charlie Watts is the drummer. It looks amazing. And, and also just is like the least
[08:10.320 --> 08:15.120]  rock and roll guy you'll ever see. He just, he was just wearing like a green Oxford shirt.
[08:16.640 --> 08:21.120]  I said, maybe I was like, he's dressed like I dress. It's just wearing a plain green shirt.
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.840]  It looks like it came from the gap or something. Uh, Keith, you know, Keith is doing something
[08:25.840 --> 08:30.160]  with his hair now that I have to say I would, I would probably advise him against just sort of
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.640]  got like a shoe Polish look. Uh, I think it looked a little better when it was sort of gray and wiry
[08:36.640 --> 08:41.200]  and, and, but you know, he sounds good. The sound stone sounded amazing. It's a great,
[08:41.200 --> 08:46.240]  it was a great concert. You have to say, and God almighty, I hope I'm still doing what I do when
[08:46.240 --> 08:56.880]  I'm 76 years old. God bless him. Doing the talk show live and a security guy says, this is an
[08:56.880 --> 09:11.120]  older crowd. We need to keep these aisles clear. Um, anyway, my idea for this is that we would do
[09:11.120 --> 09:17.040]  a Q and a episode. And so thinking ahead, uh, two or three hours ago, I asked, you destroyed
[09:17.040 --> 09:23.120]  my mentions. I asked, uh, people on Twitter for their questions. Uh, I think this should be fun.
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.360]  I think there's a lot of stuff in here. I, I'm not going to organize these in any sort of topical
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.720]  way. So we'll skip around, uh, unless you object. No, but it seems, it seems like too much work to
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.880]  actually exactly. Yeah. We, we, and we should have done it beforehand. Oh, obviously we did not do.
[09:36.880 --> 09:44.000]  Yeah. I gave my intern the day off. Okay. Yeah. Well he deserves it. Yeah. Uh, all right. Here's
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  the first question from Lincoln Roselle. He asks, who do you think the next bond will be and who do
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.440]  you want it to be? Do you care about James Bond? Everybody knows I like James Bond. I do. I probably
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.880]  don't care as much as you do, but, um, I do care. Uh, and didn't they, they announced something
[10:00.880 --> 10:06.960]  like someone's going to be the next double Oh seven, right? Uh, yeah, I'm trying. Is that a rumor?
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.040]  No, because I didn't read that whole thing. Yeah. I'm trying to remain, you know, I'm doing my
[10:11.040 --> 10:17.200]  spoiler free thing with this, uh, still, still on titled bond 25 film, but something, I did see
[10:17.200 --> 10:22.640]  something to the effect of that. So I don't know if it's true or not, but that some, uh,
[10:23.280 --> 10:29.440]  I think it's a woman is already, you know, somehow it's leaked that in this next film,
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.720]  she's double Oh seven. And so I guess the assumption there is not James Bond, right? But
[10:34.720 --> 10:39.680]  that somehow James Bond has either lost his double Oh status or retired from his double Oh status.
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.360]  And he's been, uh, replaced in the ranks as double seven by, by a woman, which would be an
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.720]  interesting twist, I suppose. Uh, I guess it depends on, on how they want to play the
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.360]  continuity game going forward. Um, it is funny. I was thinking about this. I forget where somebody,
[10:57.360 --> 11:04.480]  somebody was tweeting something about bond. Oh, I, I think I linked it up on during fireball
[11:04.480 --> 11:11.520]  where somebody ranked all of the bond villains from all 24 films and ranked them from, uh,
[11:12.560 --> 11:18.240]  worst to best, which was, I didn't necessarily agree with his rankings in a lot of ways,
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.160]  but I thought it was just, it's just an enormous amount of work because it's an awful lot of
[11:22.160 --> 11:27.760]  any villain or henchman who was worthy of a name, you know, as opposed to like henchman too,
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.360]  was, was in the listings and ranked. Um, but one of the things he pointed out, and I think
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.800]  back in the day when Dan Benjamin and I were doing the, uh, let's go through one at a time and,
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.400]  and at the end of each show, do a review of, of the bond movies. I think we touched on this
[11:44.400 --> 11:48.400]  because we did them in chronological order, but when you look at them in the aggregate,
[11:48.400 --> 11:54.880]  and especially when you look at today's blockbuster movie world, um, especially,
[11:54.880 --> 12:01.440]  I would say most especially with the Marvel quote unquote cinematic universe, uh, where these films
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.960]  tie together almost like TV episodes, you know, you kind of need to watch them in order
[12:06.960 --> 12:13.520]  and the characters from the various films, good guys and bad guys pop up in the other ones. And
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.360]  then they have the Avenger ones where they're all supposed to be there. And it's, it's
[12:17.360 --> 12:23.920]  the tons and tons of continuity. The bond movies in the early decades, the sixties and seventies
[12:23.920 --> 12:32.240]  had like the most ridiculous lack of continuity. Like the only, the only actor coming back playing
[12:32.240 --> 12:40.880]  do different, two different characters, right? They, they had a guy, uh, uh, in you, you only
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.120]  live twice, which is the one where bond goes to Japan. Sean Connery goes to Japan and he
[12:47.120 --> 12:54.000]  meets, uh, somebody from MI six who's been like the station chief in Tokyo for a long time. And
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.520]  he's, you know, even though he's very British, he's like dressed up in like a Japanese kimono
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.480]  and losing a very Japanese house. I didn't get stabbed in the back. Oh, and that was the scene.
[13:04.480 --> 13:12.560]  It's a famous scene where, uh, he offers bond a martini and says, uh, stirred, right. Or stirred,
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.440]  not shaken, which of course is backwards from his preference. But bond being the gentleman that he
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.480]  is says, yes, that's perfect. Uh, it was a, it's a very nice little scene of sort of British, uh,
[13:23.280 --> 13:30.480]  politeness. Um, but anyway, that same actor played Blofeld in diamonds forever, like, which is like
[13:30.480 --> 13:36.320]  four years later and they did no makeup. There's no makeup. He has the same hairstyle. It's the
[13:36.320 --> 13:45.680]  same guy. So not only did they not, I think it's, I mean, you know, back then it might show on TV
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.320]  every once in a while, but nobody had video, you know, VHS tapes floating around of it or
[13:50.320 --> 13:56.320]  anything like that. So it's like you wouldn't remember. Right. Right. Right. It just was so
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.440]  they could get away with it. Right. The only, the only characters who they consistently cast the
[14:01.440 --> 14:09.280]  bond of course, and then money, penny and M, uh, thank you. And Q, uh, that was it.
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.000]  Other than those four, they would just, they would recast anything goes, anybody and everybody.
[14:15.600 --> 14:22.320]  One movie, the first movie, uh, Felix lighter is Jack Lord and he looks cool AF, you know, looks,
[14:22.320 --> 14:28.240]  you know, to me, any good Felix lighter should look like a guy who should have his own series
[14:28.240 --> 14:35.040]  of films. Uh, and then like two movies later, he was like an old man going to KFC,
[14:36.960 --> 14:43.920]  like a old man. It's so bizarre. Anyway, who do we want is the next bond. I don't know. Everybody,
[14:43.920 --> 14:50.800]  the name at the top of everybody's list is Idris Elba, uh, of various fame, including the wire
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.440]  and a bunch of other great movies. Uh, I certainly wouldn't object to it. He's certainly cool. Uh,
[14:57.440 --> 15:03.520]  yeah. You know, the fact that he's black doesn't matter to me at all. I think that would be sort
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.400]  of a cool thing to do actually. And of course, you know, there's some weird corner of the internet
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.600]  that would go crazy the way that, of course, you know, th th there's people who've gone crazy
[15:13.600 --> 15:19.680]  cause they're going to make a live action, uh, uh, little mermaid Disney, you know, Disney's take,
[15:19.680 --> 15:25.600]  Disney's taking all of these classic animated cartoons and then making live action ones for
[15:25.600 --> 15:31.120]  absolutely no good reason. Very, very, very strange. Like that was my take on them. I didn't
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.480]  see it. I think it's, I think it's to make money. That's the reason, right? That you can somehow
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.640]  make more money by spending a hundred million dollars to make a live action lion King that
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.080]  just remakes the animated version. But you make 500 million in worldwide box office that I guess
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.360]  they wouldn't have made if they just put the animated version back in. But anyway, apparently
[15:53.360 --> 15:59.120]  they've cast a young African American woman as the little mermaid. And of course there's,
[15:59.120 --> 16:05.280]  they're not racist at all. They just, you know, they're just pointing out how a black person
[16:05.280 --> 16:10.960]  could not be a mermaid. Right. And I, this news, bro, and typically speaking, right,
[16:10.960 --> 16:16.160]  right. That's the thing you guys realize that the, if there's a realism
[16:16.160 --> 16:23.360]  problem with the character, it's sort of went away at fish person.
[16:23.360 --> 16:23.360]  Right.
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.240]  You don't think a black mermaid is realistic.
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.320]  You really might want to, I'm out. Forget it. I can't believe this anymore.
[16:38.320 --> 16:46.240]  Uh, so anyway, I was fine at singing mermaid.
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.760]  Who also turns into a real woman, right? There's a lot of scientific problems with the,
[16:56.480 --> 17:03.920]  but I'm out at black. Count me out. Yeah. Uh, so it would almost be worth it if they cast
[17:03.920 --> 17:08.720]  it yourself, but just to see those reactions and watch people's heads show up and then watch the
[17:08.720 --> 17:14.640]  movie still go on to make $600 gazillion. Yeah. People have already flipped out when he was in
[17:14.640 --> 17:21.280]  the Marvel movies. Yeah. Yeah. Playing Heimdall. Yeah. And I have to say the way that Hollywood,
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.160]  uh, works and that they, the way that it, there's sort of a hive mind mentality,
[17:26.960 --> 17:32.240]  you know, that when something works like, uh, you know, I don't know how long it was before
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.320]  there were big budget space shooters, but then star Wars comes out and then every other movie
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.760]  in the late seventies, you know, even the James Bond movie moonraker, all of a sudden they're
[17:39.760 --> 17:45.760]  going into outer space, shooting lasers at each other. Uh, I would have to think that the phenomenal
[17:46.320 --> 17:52.560]  critical and box office success of black Panther, uh, certainly would motivate people to cast,
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.560]  you know, uh, someone like get this role, but in a, in a big, big role like that.
[17:57.440 --> 18:00.960]  Um, and it's a shame that you have to have somebody, you know,
[18:00.960 --> 18:06.240]  they're just following the lead, but it's, I think it's a good thing for, uh, just the overall
[18:06.240 --> 18:11.600]  diversity of, of the casting in these big budget action movies. So that would be great. I think
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.400]  he would be fantastic in a while. I think he's, you know, certainly got the gravitas,
[18:14.400 --> 18:19.680]  he's got the voice, he's got the cool. You can absolutely positively see him and just imagine
[18:19.680 --> 18:27.920]  him in a nice tuxedo ordering vodka martini. Absolutely. The downside to Idris Elba is that
[18:27.920 --> 18:35.440]  he's already 47 years old. Right. And people have been talking about it for 10 years. Right. And so,
[18:36.240 --> 18:44.080]  uh, you know, presumably, you know, if this is the last movie that, uh, Christ, what's his name,
[18:44.880 --> 18:50.160]  Daniel Craig, Craig makes, which it's, you know, he's had a good run. It was rumored that the last
[18:50.160 --> 18:55.040]  one was going to be the last one that he would do. Uh, five movies is a hell of a run in the
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.200]  role and he wants to go on to other things. Certainly makes sense that this is probably
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.040]  going to be his last one. You would think though, they'd want to recast it with someone who
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.840]  himself could make five movies and maybe at 47 Idris Elba is a little too old. One of the things
[19:09.840 --> 19:15.360]  that people like when they cast Roger Moore, well, one of these sort of ran into a problem
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.040]  toward the end, definitely ran into a problem at the end. And one of the things that it was
[19:19.040 --> 19:24.720]  curious about casting Roger Moore is Roger Moore was actually a year or two older than Sean Connery.
[19:24.720 --> 19:32.880]  Um, so he was already older than Sean Connery when he took over the role. Uh, I think did very,
[19:32.880 --> 19:41.280]  very fine through the seventies and then by the eighties, definitely. And he had the old man run
[19:41.280 --> 19:49.520]  by that. Yeah. Uh, his last was a view to a kill in 1985 and it's, it's a funny little, you know,
[19:49.520 --> 19:57.440]  uh, Bond trivia thing that 1985 was also the year that never say never again came out,
[19:57.440 --> 20:03.120]  which was the only Bond movie that was not from the same production team because of a
[20:04.240 --> 20:12.320]  very long running legal squabble over the rights to the novel thunder ball.
[20:12.320 --> 20:20.080]  Where there was this other guy who apparently had worked with Ian Fleming on a television play or
[20:20.080 --> 20:26.480]  script. And they, you know, it was basically the story of thunder ball. What if, what if
[20:26.480 --> 20:33.280]  terrorists could, could hijack a nuclear, uh, missile on a jet, you know, by, by,
[20:33.280 --> 20:39.840]  by getting a pilot to be a double actor. Um, they, it never came to fruition. And then Ian
[20:39.840 --> 20:45.200]  Fleming when I went ahead and just made a novel with the basic plot called thunder ball long run,
[20:45.200 --> 20:48.960]  you know, they ended up making that movie. Um, but this guy, I forget his name. It doesn't
[20:48.960 --> 20:55.520]  really matter, but he eventually won the legal rights to, to co-own the plot and the name James
[20:55.520 --> 21:01.120]  Bond. And so never say never again is very strange movie cause it doesn't have the same theme song
[21:01.120 --> 21:06.800]  cause that obviously belonged to the Eon productions. The credits were very strange,
[21:06.800 --> 21:12.080]  but they did convince Sean Connery to take the role, which is really the only way it got made.
[21:12.080 --> 21:19.040]  And Connery did it just cause he had a falling out with the Albert Cubby from Eon and just wanted
[21:19.040 --> 21:25.520]  to stick it to him. But so in 1985 there were two bond movies. There was never say never again,
[21:25.520 --> 21:32.400]  starring Sean Connery and a view to a kill with Roger Moore and view to a kill actually did better
[21:32.400 --> 21:39.120]  at the box office. But uh, I think Sean Connery clearly better looked to the part and yeah,
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.000]  and it was interesting cause at least in never say never again at the beginning they sort of
[21:44.720 --> 21:50.160]  acknowledged that he's old bond, you know, and there's, he, there's a new M who is clearly,
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.200]  you know, like maybe 15, 20 years younger than bond himself and does the famous scene where
[21:55.200 --> 22:01.840]  he tells him he's got too many free radicals, free radicals, sir. And he goes, yes, it's
[22:02.720 --> 22:07.920]  from uh, too much red meat, too much bread, too many vodka martinis. And
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.520]  Connery without missing a beat says, then I shall endeavor to cut down on my bread.
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.560]  But anyway, they at least acknowledged that he was older and sort of at the end of his career,
[22:22.560 --> 22:27.120]  whereas never our view to a kill, there's no acknowledgement whatsoever that Roger Moore,
[22:27.120 --> 22:31.760]  yeah, 60 year old man who can't really run up a flight out there. Yeah. Just like fighting people.
[22:32.880 --> 22:36.720]  And I don't think the makeup team or the cinematographer really did him any,
[22:36.720 --> 22:45.360]  any, no, any justice either. He didn't really get a lot of help. Yeah. Anyway. Uh, so anyway,
[22:45.360 --> 22:50.080]  Idris Elba, I would give a thumbs up too with the provision that, uh, who knows, you know,
[22:50.080 --> 22:54.480]  can he go for, you know, and especially nowadays these bond movies, even if they, you know,
[22:54.480 --> 23:00.000]  start, there's such major, major blockbuster productions that, you know, they come three,
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.960]  four years apart. So if he's going to do five, you know, you're talking maybe 20 years, you know,
[23:04.960 --> 23:09.040]  I really, I don't, I don't care what kind of condition. I mean, it could be Mick Jagger,
[23:09.040 --> 23:16.000]  right? But you don't want bond as a 67 year old. No, I think we learned that. We learned that
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.560]  lesson unless it's less. It's a very different movie. Uh, anybody who's got an English accent
[23:22.560 --> 23:29.600]  and is handsome and vaguely tall is often mentioned, uh, as a bond. Tom Hiddleston,
[23:29.600 --> 23:38.400]  Hiddleston, Hiddleston, who probably is best known as Loki in the back to the Marvel universe.
[23:39.040 --> 23:43.120]  Um, he's often mentioned and he did a, uh, I'll recommend this here. I don't know if you ever
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.280]  watched it. There was a TV series, I forget what network it was on. It was like a eight or 10
[23:47.280 --> 23:54.880]  episode TV series called the, uh, the night manager. Uh, and he plays, you know, a vague,
[23:54.880 --> 24:01.040]  you know, a sort of a spy, you know, it seems sort of like his Remington steel. Uh, yeah.
[24:01.840 --> 24:05.280]  You know, that was, that was the comparison I was going to draw too. Cause he seems like a
[24:05.840 --> 24:11.680]  more Pierce Brosnan. He, yeah. Like he would be a more Pierce Brosnan bond. And I, I like
[24:11.680 --> 24:16.640]  peer Pierce Brosnan has been a lot more than I thought I was going to for sure. And I think he
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.280]  did a fair job. I think he was in some bad movies, but yeah, he was in some really bad movies. I, I
[24:21.280 --> 24:27.760]  think he, he got, I think he was born for the role. I think he was absolutely fantastic at it
[24:27.760 --> 24:34.400]  and really got stuck with, uh, just some God awful movies. If you just watch golden eye, you, you,
[24:34.400 --> 24:43.200]  you can really appreciate what a great bond he was. Well, my favorite thing is I was watching
[24:43.200 --> 24:47.600]  some documentary at one point, I don't know, it was like the commemorate the 50th anniversary
[24:47.600 --> 24:51.040]  of bond or something like that. And they talked to a whole bunch of the actors. Of course,
[24:51.040 --> 24:58.320]  Sean Connery wouldn't, wouldn't participate. Um, but even, even Pierce Brosnan got mixed up
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.480]  between the titles of his movies and he totally, he totally acknowledged that he forgets which
[25:02.480 --> 25:09.280]  ones, which, yeah, I don't remember. I don't remember either. No, it doesn't. So it doesn't
[25:09.280 --> 25:12.960]  sound like this woman is going to be James Bond, but if they were going to cast a woman,
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.360]  I was going to throw out Frankie Adams, who is, um, she's from New Zealand, so she's not
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.280]  British per se, but, um, she is in the expanse, uh, and she plays Bobby Draper in the expanse
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.600]  and she's just a, she's a bad-ass Frankie Adams, Frankie Adams. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. I
[25:29.600 --> 25:35.600]  mean, you know, maybe, you know, like I, if they wanted to cast a woman, I, I, I think it's,
[25:36.240 --> 25:42.160]  I think that's probably better served to create a new character. Like, and you know, maybe I'm,
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.160]  maybe I'm on the wrong side of this, you know, maybe this is me being, you know,
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.000]  on the spectrum of saying, I can't, I can't imagine a black guy is James Bond,
[25:52.720 --> 25:59.360]  but I don't know. I, I sort of, it depends on how much you define misogyny as part of the
[25:59.360 --> 26:07.200]  role. Exactly. Right. Uh, I, you know, I do, I like the trend of putting women in
[26:08.880 --> 26:14.880]  serious action roles in, within the movies, you know, the new money penny is a bad-ass,
[26:15.520 --> 26:23.040]  um, as opposed to all of them being damsels in distress type characters. Uh, but we shall see,
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.680]  I don't know. I also feel like the best thing they could do is go in a different direction,
[26:29.680 --> 26:36.800]  pick somebody who in some ways is not Daniel Craig, you know, just to, and it's part of what
[26:36.800 --> 26:45.520]  made the Roger Moore transition work is that he didn't try to do Sean Connery at all. He was just
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.240]  very, very comfortably Roger Moore for better or for worse, you know, and I think in some ways
[26:50.240 --> 26:56.880]  better for the seventies. Yeah. But in a way that didn't age as well, there's not as much retro cool
[26:56.880 --> 27:02.400]  to, to his movies to me. I think in general, I like a bond who seems like he's believably a good
[27:02.400 --> 27:10.640]  fighter. And I don't, I mean, I don't think Roger Moore really pulls that off that well. Maybe,
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.160]  maybe early on he can, he, he, uh, he gets by, but unless so Pierce Brosnan as well. But even
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.440]  though I like him, I always say, I always thought that rewatching the Moore movies,
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.880]  and I think it was to his credit that, that he turned bond into a little bit more of a superhero.
[27:27.600 --> 27:35.200]  Um, and he always came across and somehow made it feel right. Like he came across as a bond who had
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.360]  already read the screenplay and knows that he's going to survive and wind up, you know, wind up
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.800]  in a floating spacecraft with making out with a beautiful woman at the very end of the movie.
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.520]  Like, and so no matter how dire his circumstances, he, he really was like,
[27:51.520 --> 28:01.840]  eh, I'm not going to worry about this. I got it. Yeah. Uh, I don't, I don't have nothing more on
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.520]  the bond thing. Anything, anything else on that? We're not going to make too many questions at
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.960]  this pace, but it was a big topic. Uh, let me take the first break here and thank our first sponsor.

[29:39.840 --> 29:42.480]  What about you? Any questions pop out to you so far?
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.120]  Matt Howie asked about a dream laptop basically.
[29:47.120 --> 29:53.520]  John That's a good question. I got that. That was him. Yeah. Well, you want to go first?
[29:53.520 --> 30:00.960]  Matt I think well, the best laptop I feel like I've had the best Mac laptop I feel like I've had
[30:01.680 --> 30:08.880]  was the 11 inch air for me. He was saying something about building it from scratch. So
[30:09.520 --> 30:16.640]  but I'm not sure I can do that in my head. And I feel like looking back, I feel like I maybe
[30:16.640 --> 30:22.400]  would have been happy with a 13 inch like maybe more even though I stuck with the 11 inch and
[30:22.400 --> 30:27.200]  loved it for so long. I do like a slightly bigger screen. So I think I'm kind of thinking like
[30:27.200 --> 30:34.960]  something that would be the current 13 inch MacBook Air. But with a you know, a keyboard
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.360]  that actually, you know, a scissoring keyboard instead of a butterfly. Yeah,
[30:39.360 --> 30:47.920]  both for feel and for reliability. Yes. Right. And and no, yeah, no, no touch bar. But But yes,
[30:47.920 --> 30:57.120]  with the touch ID. Hmm. I would say I'll start out by saying this. I bought I own two computers
[30:57.120 --> 31:02.960]  right now. And I Mac, which I'm on front of right now, and a 13 inch MacBook Pro, and I bought both
[31:02.960 --> 31:08.640]  of them in 2014. So they're now both five years old. I've been thinking about this a lot. I should
[31:08.640 --> 31:12.960]  write it up for during fireball. I'm not even sure which one I would rank first or second. But they're
[31:12.960 --> 31:18.800]  clearly the two best max I've ever bought in my life. And they have both served me incredibly
[31:18.800 --> 31:25.840]  well with incredible reliability. They both still feel fast to me. I suspect the MacBook Pro in
[31:25.840 --> 31:33.280]  particular. Like when I last summer, I spent six weeks on a review unit of the then new 15 inch
[31:33.280 --> 31:43.440]  MacBook Pro, and I definitely could feel that some things were faster. So I suspect I'm, it's my lack
[31:43.440 --> 31:47.360]  of, you know, once you go to a faster machine, it's not so much that it feels faster. It's that
[31:47.360 --> 31:51.840]  when you go back to the old one, it feels slow. So I suspect that there, you know, I'll probably
[31:52.480 --> 31:57.040]  replace that MacBook Pro first, but my iMac, I can't think of anything that slow. It's just
[31:57.040 --> 32:05.120]  unbelievable machine. I love that MacBook Pro. It's a 13 inch 2014 MacBook Pro. It's a little
[32:05.120 --> 32:11.520]  thick by today's standards compared to the current 13 inch MacBook Pro, but it's got I the SD card
[32:11.520 --> 32:20.240]  slot I use, I use rarely, but when I do use it, like on vacation, to offload photos from a
[32:20.880 --> 32:25.840]  quote unquote, real camera to keep the SD card on the camera free for shooting more photos and
[32:25.840 --> 32:32.240]  video. You know, do I have, could I put a dongle in my backpack? I think I have one that's USB-C
[32:32.240 --> 32:35.840]  so that I can connect it to like an iPad or something. I don't know. I've got a lot of
[32:35.840 --> 32:41.680]  dongles in my backpack, but it's nice not to have to fish around for it. It is nice to have
[32:41.680 --> 32:50.160]  more USB ports than I need. It is nice. I love MagSafe. I really find that in hindsight to be
[32:50.160 --> 32:59.840]  such a curious regression. I like, I like MagSafe too, but I am probably just as happy with USB-C
[32:59.840 --> 33:04.000]  for power because, well, for several reasons, I do like switching, being able to switch sides,
[33:04.000 --> 33:07.920]  you know, any port, I mean, like if I'm in a hurry, I can, I can fumble around and find a
[33:07.920 --> 33:13.280]  port and I don't need to care which one it is, which was not really that much of a problem with
[33:13.280 --> 33:19.040]  MagSafe obviously, because it would find it pretty much on its own. But the thing that I like the
[33:19.040 --> 33:26.960]  most is being able to get other chargers that I can rely on because getting MagSafe, getting,
[33:26.960 --> 33:33.360]  you know, non-Apple MagSafe chargers is, was not a good idea. And so you were basically stuck
[33:33.360 --> 33:37.840]  getting, getting an Apple branded one and, you know, and they're like 70 bucks or something.
[33:37.840 --> 33:40.880]  Right. You're always worried that it's going to be like one of those sparking space guns.
[33:40.880 --> 33:46.640]  Yeah. It's going to blow up in your face. So it's nice being able to get other power options for
[33:46.640 --> 33:51.360]  like, you know, you can get a good one for 40 bucks at most. Yeah. I totally accept that there's
[33:51.360 --> 33:58.240]  a trade-off there on universality and, you know, and being able to share a charger between iPad
[33:58.240 --> 34:04.000]  and MacBook, you know, like on vacation just earlier this month, Amy didn't even know she,
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.360]  I mean, she's a normal person, so she doesn't pay attention, but she was very, very pleased that
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.120]  Jonas's MacBook Air from last year uses the same charger as her iPad Pro. So
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.840]  he could charge overnight and then she could just plug it in while we went out for the day,
[34:19.840 --> 34:27.520]  you know, and it's just one last plug littering your hotel room. Yeah. So I accept the demise
[34:27.520 --> 34:33.440]  of MagSafe. I miss it. But what I would want in a new laptop is first and foremost, I would want
[34:33.440 --> 34:41.200]  a keyboard that has a good feel. I want, and I, I just write so much on my MacBook. I just want
[34:41.200 --> 34:46.800]  the keyboard to feel great. And I don't like the feel of the butterfly ones. And I know some people
[34:46.800 --> 34:54.240]  do, but I know I want more travel. Yeah. Other than that, I guess the other thing he asks about
[34:54.240 --> 34:59.920]  is touchscreen or no, no, I don't want to touch. I thought that's what you're saying. No, I really
[34:59.920 --> 35:06.000]  don't fence. I guess I'm on the fence. The only reason I think yes, maybe is because every once
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.520]  in a while after using my iPad, I will, I will have to resist the urge to touch the screen,
[35:11.520 --> 35:16.960]  to do something on the, on the MacBook. Well, I, I mean, we could do a whole episode on it,
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.120]  but I don't want a touch screen and I realized, and you can't just put the touch screen on,
[35:21.120 --> 35:25.440]  like you have to, you have to redesign the operating system, right? Just the,
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.000]  just the red, yellow, green buttons alone, just to name the most obvious thing. They're too small
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.280]  and too close to each other for touch. And I don't want the interface. I don't mean to be too
[35:37.280 --> 35:42.400]  dismissive of the iOS looking field, but I don't want it to be Fisher priced just to accommodate
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.400]  touch that I, I won't even use, you know, I like the density and the smallness of the controls
[35:48.400 --> 35:55.520]  of a mouse driven interface. So I would say no to a touch screen. Um, I hope I really, really hope.
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.160]  So I want a better keyboard. I think I want better battery life than what
[36:00.800 --> 36:06.960]  Apple's current MacBook pros are offering. And that might just be waiting for arm as
[36:06.960 --> 36:13.520]  opposed to Intel. I don't know. Um, I have no complaints about the display,
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.160]  especially now that they have true tone across the board, I guess if they shrunk the bezels,
[36:18.160 --> 36:22.560]  which I think is what they're doing with this rumored 16 inch MacBook pro, I'm guessing
[36:22.560 --> 36:27.680]  that I've said this before, I'm guessing that that's just a replacement for the 15 inch and
[36:27.680 --> 36:33.520]  that they're just keeping the footprint roughly the same and making the display go more closer
[36:33.520 --> 36:39.680]  to the closer to the corners, making it 16 inches instead of 15. And it's like already 15.4 inches
[36:39.680 --> 36:46.320]  or 15 point something inches. So it's actually not even like a full inch to make it. Um, yeah,
[36:46.320 --> 36:51.600]  I guess, you know, yeah. But the other thing that I really hope Apple is doing is I really
[36:51.600 --> 36:59.840]  hope that they are taking to heart the, I would say the consensus on the touch bar is ambivalent
[36:59.840 --> 37:08.160]  at best. And I suspect the people who like it the most are generally silent and it's the people who
[37:08.160 --> 37:15.360]  really dislike it who are vocal. But at least judging from the comments I see, it is not,
[37:15.360 --> 37:22.640]  it has not been well received. I don't hate it. Like I said, I spent 64 weeks with it either.
[37:23.200 --> 37:27.200]  But I don't love it. So I really would do you how do you have it? How do you have your set?
[37:27.200 --> 37:31.040]  Do you have it? Well, I don't have one in front of me. I'd like the last time I used it was,
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.120]  like I said, six, the six weeks I spent on a MacBook Pro a year ago, and I I more or less
[37:35.120 --> 37:39.520]  used it as it was factories as it was designed. See, the thing that the thing that I don't,
[37:39.520 --> 37:45.440]  I can't get in on is the idea that you're going to go into every single app that you have and
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.560]  customize the touch bar. I mean, I can see that there are some people who probably use certain
[37:50.560 --> 37:58.640]  apps, professional digital editing apps all the time who might do that. I don't work that way.
[37:58.640 --> 38:04.400]  And the, you know, the writing apps that I use don't have that many special features that I feel
[38:04.400 --> 38:10.720]  like I need special buttons for them. Right. So I basically turned it into, you know, just it's
[38:10.720 --> 38:18.080]  just the regular function buttons that what the functions were were for on a Mac. So instead of
[38:18.080 --> 38:24.960]  having, you know, the F numbers, it's just the icons for, you know, volume up and down and that
[38:24.960 --> 38:31.200]  kind of thing. And that's, I like that. I mean, and there's in I can, the nice thing is I have a
[38:31.200 --> 38:42.000]  key cron keyboard that I use. And I basically now have that the function keys on that are similar in
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.920]  that they are dedicated Mac style function keys. And I can set up the touch bar basically to look
[38:49.920 --> 38:53.760]  exactly like that. So now I, you know, when I have the keyboard plugged in, and I'm using it,
[38:53.760 --> 39:00.240]  it's the same thing. I just basically I sincerely hope that Apple is has internalized the public's
[39:00.240 --> 39:07.040]  the public's ambivalence towards the touch bar and is working on a, a major rethinking, like,
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.920]  I think as a fundamental idea, it's a brilliant idea. And I think the idea of having all of our
[39:11.920 --> 39:20.320]  keyboards lined up with 12 of these f f keys from 1978 is is odd. And I think it's very odd that
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.680]  that we we collectively, but led by Apple have sort of repurpose them with these icons,
[39:27.680 --> 39:35.440]  and they're all sort of, it's just, it's fiddly, and just seems outdated. And so I think the idea
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.880]  of making it a touch little touchscreen integrated above the keyboard is great idea. But I really
[39:40.880 --> 39:48.080]  think that it it's, it needs like a huge 2.0. Like a Yeah, I agree. Just a serious rethinking.
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.640]  And I don't even know what that is. I'm not creative enough to think of it. But I would
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.600]  know it if I saw it. I kind of feel like the other thing too, is I feel like they made a mistake by
[39:57.600 --> 40:04.400]  not keeping the escape key as a hardware key. And it's a little thing, but because like, maybe a lot
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.840]  of people never never ever use the escape key, but people who do use the escape key use it a lot and
[40:09.840 --> 40:14.880]  making it this thing that doesn't actually click is, you know, leads to people touching the wrong
[40:14.880 --> 40:23.600]  thing. And I think that symmetry wise, it could work by being symmetric with the touch ID button
[40:23.600 --> 40:30.080]  that's on the other side. Maybe wider. Yeah. But basically, I would just want a something like the
[40:30.080 --> 40:36.080]  13 inch MacBook Pro, maybe with a display that goes closer to the edges, better keyboard,
[40:36.080 --> 40:44.560]  at least four USB C ports and an improved touch bar. Yeah. That's about it. It's not very,
[40:44.560 --> 40:50.400]  I kind of feel like the form factor is basically, you know, doesn't need to radical change. Yeah.
[40:50.400 --> 40:56.480]  What else do we have here? Let's see. You see the story that came out today where
[40:57.120 --> 41:01.760]  Apple contractors quote, regularly hear confidential details on Siri recordings.
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.400]  The Guardian had a story. Oh, no, I did not. I was outside. Yeah.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.960]  I was outside when you contacted me. Well, it's just, you know, it sounds bad, but it's,
[41:12.960 --> 41:20.240]  I don't think, I don't think anybody does that. I don't think anybody has their recording sent
[41:20.240 --> 41:25.360]  to Apple without opting into it. Uh, like I regularly, I regularly, but I think it is
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.480]  the kind of thing that everybody has been saying about Amazon and Google and had not come about,
[41:30.480 --> 41:40.480]  come out about Apple and Apple is making much more of a marketing angle on privacy than the
[41:40.480 --> 41:45.600]  others. You are. Yeah. I kind of feel like they need to come clean about it, uh, and be as
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.080]  transparent as possible, but I don't think there's any way to, to get those improvements without
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.920]  somebody listening to it. And I just think they, they just need to make sure that they're
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.480]  like, if there is some path, I don't know the details enough to really comment at length here,
[42:00.480 --> 42:08.800]  but if there's a path where somebody goes in to the Apple store, buys an iPhone, sets it up,
[42:08.800 --> 42:18.880]  sets it up and really on, you know, just without any sort of could, could very easily not understand
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.560]  that the, the okay buttons that, and continue buttons that they've pressed are allowing their
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.400]  anonymized Siri recordings to be sent to Apple. I think that's a problem. I just think it needs
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.360]  to be as crystal clear as possible that if you, you know, if you click this, your recordings
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.440]  might be sent in a completely anonymized fashion to Apple. And here's a learn more button where you
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.760]  can go and get the full Craig Federighi differential privacy, mathematical explanation of how they're
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.360]  ensuring that they're anonymized and can't be re you know, you know, give people a way to,
[42:51.360 --> 42:56.080]  if you really want to go deep on it and figure out how we're doing this in a way that is private,
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.200]  we'll get, we'll tell you everything. But if you just want to take our word for it, hit this
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.600]  button. And if you know you want to opt out, hit this button. And as long as that's going on,
[43:03.600 --> 43:08.880]  I'm okay with it because I don't see how it's possible. And I think I've been fairly consistent
[43:08.880 --> 43:14.480]  on this, that I haven't really criticized the Amazon or Google so much for this. Although the
[43:14.480 --> 43:22.800]  stories about Amazon seem a little fishier about the degree to which the employees are listening
[43:22.800 --> 43:28.320]  and maybe can even reverse, you know, figure out, you know, that this was John Gruber in the,
[43:28.320 --> 43:34.720]  you know, one nine one four seven zip code in Philadelphia. You know, who said this goofy thing?
[43:35.600 --> 43:43.520]  You got to come over and listen to this guy. But I, you know, I don't think it's possible
[43:43.520 --> 43:50.640]  otherwise. I just think they just need to be transparent. Here we go. How about this? Somebody
[43:50.640 --> 43:58.400]  can't find it. Somebody was asking about the the leaks of the new iPhone supposedly coming
[43:58.400 --> 44:03.840]  out in September. And do we think they're horrible? The look of them? Yeah, well,
[44:03.840 --> 44:10.000]  and presumably this is all based around the the big square camera back as opposed to the
[44:11.120 --> 44:15.120]  what would you call it a pill capsule sized one that we've had for the last few years.
[44:15.120 --> 44:22.560]  Right. But the most but everything that we've seen so far is basically a mock up based on
[44:22.560 --> 44:27.120]  case designs, right? Yes, very much. So we don't the thing that we don't really know
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.040]  is the sort of fit and finish of the whole thing. Yeah, because I've seen a whole bunch of these
[44:31.040 --> 44:36.560]  things. And it looks terrible in certain circumstances in certain, you know, depending on
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.920]  how you render it. This is Santiago, Santiago Dawson, the leak design for the iPhone 11 seemed
[44:43.920 --> 44:50.800]  hideous. No. He calls it the iPhone 11 with Roman numerals. God Almighty, I hope they get rid of the
[44:50.800 --> 44:58.000]  Roman numerals. Here's my thing. I will admit that I don't think it looks good to have a big square
[44:58.560 --> 45:07.520]  camera thing on the back. But the camera is so essential and so useful. And I rely on it ever
[45:07.520 --> 45:15.520]  more and more as my primary camera that I'm okay with it. And I kind of feel like it's the
[45:15.520 --> 45:22.880]  inevitable consequence of the the the first step towards this was just making the what was it the
[45:22.880 --> 45:28.320]  iPhone six that had the first camera bump? I think so where it was still just a little,
[45:28.320 --> 45:34.160]  little tiny circle. Like, like, even now with the iPhone 10 and 10, our antennas and these cameras,
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.960]  it's like to think that we that including me, I have to admit, I gave that camera bump an awful
[45:38.960 --> 45:48.240]  lot of snark just because it bothered me, because, you know, it should be flush. But the the way that
[45:48.240 --> 45:53.840]  photography works, having more distance, even a little fraction of an inch from the front of the
[45:53.840 --> 46:02.480]  lens to the sensor, you know, makes things better. Right. So, and so the only alternative is making
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.600]  the whole thing thicker, right? And I don't think that's worthwhile. I really don't. And I think
[46:07.600 --> 46:13.440]  it's in the real world, when you when you appreciate the enormous percentage of people
[46:13.440 --> 46:20.240]  who keep their iPhones in a case, at all times, the bump isn't a bump. So I feel like the bump,
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.080]  it's time to get over it, I'm over it, because I know that it makes the photography better,
[46:24.080 --> 46:30.560]  I get such amazing photos from my iPhone, even when I go on vacation, and I take a quote unquote,
[46:30.560 --> 46:35.520]  real camera, and then I come back and I do like the sort of triage of just at least getting rid
[46:35.520 --> 46:39.520]  of the garbage shots, or if there's like, if I took four shots of the same scene, figure out
[46:39.520 --> 46:45.120]  which one's the best and get rid of the other three. I am still occasionally like, Oh, I must
[46:45.120 --> 46:49.200]  have taken this one with my Fuji. And then I'm like, Oh, nope, I was the iPhone. Unbelievable.
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.200]  I'm blown away by it. I think it's necessary. I think adding a third lens, which is what they're
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.280]  rumouring, you know, rumors are saying why that the camera unit on the back is getting better,
[47:01.280 --> 47:07.200]  is a good thing, I think, because I, it's just a, you know, the funny nature of trying to make
[47:07.200 --> 47:15.920]  these incredibly slim devices by the standards of cameras into serious cameras, you know,
[47:15.920 --> 47:22.960]  when you buy a point and shoot camera that has a zoom feature where you can go wider or long,
[47:22.960 --> 47:29.200]  the lens, it comes out like two inches from the camera, like, you can't do that with a single
[47:29.200 --> 47:37.360]  lens at this at a phone device thickness. And so using multiple lenses, wider to longer,
[47:37.360 --> 47:43.040]  and then having the software switch between them as you zoom is ingenious, but it necessitates
[47:43.040 --> 47:47.760]  making this a little bit more awkward. But I think it's a trade off well worth making. And I think,
[47:47.760 --> 47:53.200]  you know, we've seen leaks of like Google's upcoming pixel four, which has a very, very similar
[47:53.200 --> 47:59.600]  design where the camera unit is a big square with three lenses. It's a trade off worth making for
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.280]  better photography, whether it makes the device look uglier or not, but we'll get used to it.
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.520]  The Yeah, it's like he says that most everybody puts a camera in a case. The only thing I can
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.640]  think of was what, what if they made an iPhone where the case was already on the iPhone?
[48:14.640 --> 48:21.200]  Hmm, where everything would be flush, but it's, it's not like, it's protection rather than
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.240]  Yeah, I can't, I can't, the only reason I think that they couldn't,
[48:26.240 --> 48:29.120]  well, I mean, like the Emily, they want to do that in the first place, because they want,
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.400]  they want to ship a device that's as slim as possible. But the other reason I would
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.240]  think is that the materials, right, that are protective are not going to last as long.
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.920]  Right. And then, and then you have an iPhone that looks like crap.
[48:41.920 --> 48:48.960]  Yeah. And, and I think people would still put cases on them. I really do. I know I really do.
[48:48.960 --> 48:56.320]  And it's, you know, it's very reasonable. I, I generally, I was thinking they would sell it that
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.880]  way. You know, they would sell it as like, we put the case on for you. Yeah. And people wouldn't
[49:00.880 --> 49:07.120]  believe it, or they wouldn't trust it. And they, and they really want to keep their 800 $900
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.640]  purchase pristine. Right. And so they're still going to want to put a case on the case if,
[49:12.640 --> 49:17.280]  especially if they can do it with a $10 case, right, that, that they don't care if it gets
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.960]  scuffed up. And then if it, if it gets like, really, really scuffed up, you just snap it
[49:22.960 --> 49:28.400]  off and buy another $10 case. Yeah, I guarantee you, if Apple did that, people would put cases
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.480]  on them. And it would just be way thicker. And Johnny Ive on his island in retirement,
[49:34.480 --> 49:42.240]  it would just sob, sob silently. People would just keep putting cases on them.
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.560]  And turning in his bed of money. Hmm. Anything that pops out to you?
[49:48.400 --> 49:55.440]  Cletus fetus. Okay. I didn't want to say the name, but I have to give him credit. Asked
[49:55.440 --> 50:05.520]  about pricing, that there is a $329 iPad, but Apple does not make a $329 phone.
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.080]  And why not make a $329 phone with bezels or whatever you have to do?
[50:14.880 --> 50:20.400]  Yeah, I wonder about that. I, I, I, I mean, I find it interesting that the iPad, because we,
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.920]  we got my father in law an iPad for, you know, the cheap iPad for Father's Day,
[50:25.920 --> 50:33.440]  because his old one was acting funky. And it's a really nice device. It is not very much.
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.360]  It is a really, really nice device for $329. Yeah. And it was on sale at Costco for like
[50:39.360 --> 50:45.280]  250 or something. When, when they came out with that, when was that? October? I forget.
[50:45.280 --> 50:49.840]  Uh, or maybe it was, I thought it was like a year. I thought it was more like a year.
[50:49.840 --> 50:54.800]  Yeah. And maybe like off. Yeah. And maybe like, like March or April or something like that.
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.680]  Yeah. And they had, they didn't have an event. They just had like press briefings. And I went
[50:59.680 --> 51:05.440]  to the ones in New York and talked to people from the iPad team. And basically that's,
[51:05.440 --> 51:08.480]  that's kind of what it came down to. And they, you know, they added pencil support.
[51:08.480 --> 51:16.800]  Uh, and basically what it came down to is this is a, this is definitely not the best iPad. The
[51:16.800 --> 51:22.160]  iPad pros absolutely hold their own justify, you know, they're much higher prices, but this is a
[51:22.160 --> 51:28.960]  really nice $329 device. Like really, really nice. And, and really plenty fast. The only
[51:28.960 --> 51:34.080]  complaints, everything, it just, it just has, you know, an older look. Yeah. Yeah. The only
[51:34.080 --> 51:39.040]  complaints you can really have about it are the basic fundamental complaints about the iPad iOS,
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.640]  which, you know, Apple has, has hopefully tackled, you know, with iPad OS 13 this year.
[51:45.280 --> 51:50.240]  Um, but really every, uh, the only serious complaints you can have about this device
[51:50.240 --> 51:56.800]  come down to the OS. And I think for typical users who really do use it in, you know, I think the
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.720]  people who really care about multitasking and two documents at once and doing things side by side
[52:00.720 --> 52:05.760]  are all sort of the sort of people who are going to lean towards an iPad pro. Uh, I think the sort
[52:05.760 --> 52:13.200]  of typical people like my dad, uh, my mom who both really, really, really get along well on their
[52:13.200 --> 52:17.600]  iPad, right? They, you know, they'll call me every once in a while with weird problems with their
[52:17.600 --> 52:22.320]  Mac, even just the stupid things like, you know, the mail icon isn't in the dock anymore. Although
[52:22.320 --> 52:25.920]  the Apple sort of fixed that a few years ago where they made it like you have to drag like
[52:25.920 --> 52:30.480]  a couple inches off the dock to get an app out of there. Um, but just, you know,
[52:30.480 --> 52:34.880]  they get confused by the Mac sometimes. Whereas I, they never ever call me with anything to do
[52:34.880 --> 52:39.440]  with their iPad and they'd, you know, they just use it the way, uh, you know, it was used from
[52:39.440 --> 52:45.760]  2011 on where it's just one, one app at a time. Uh, boy, that three 29 one is so nice. It just
[52:45.760 --> 52:52.480]  has just about everything you could want. Yeah. Uh, why don't they, why no phone? I don't know.
[52:52.480 --> 52:57.280]  I was listening to ATP. Uh, I don't know if it was the most recent episode or the second most
[52:57.280 --> 53:04.480]  recent. And Marco was talking about wanting a, uh, this is right up your alley, a, uh,
[53:05.680 --> 53:15.040]  a four inch iPhone for testing overcast layout. And, uh, you know, Marco being Marco,
[53:15.040 --> 53:18.560]  I think he was at his beach house and so he didn't want to go home and get one that he already had.
[53:19.120 --> 53:24.400]  So he wanted another one. He wanted a beach house one and a house house. Well,
[53:24.400 --> 53:28.640]  and I think the other angle was that his four inch testing device was like an iPhone five S
[53:28.640 --> 53:34.320]  and the five S is dropping either has dropped off or is dropping off this year from the
[53:34.320 --> 53:41.040]  still supports the latest OS chain. And so he wanted to get an iPhone S E as the last,
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.960]  you know, latest and greatest four inch phone and would have at least another year or two ahead of
[53:46.960 --> 53:51.760]  it, you know, for, uh, keeping up with the OS. And so we went on Amazon and bought a,
[53:51.760 --> 53:57.600]  I don't think it was refurbished. There's a different word. Uh, but you know, basically
[53:57.600 --> 54:05.200]  he got like a used iPhone SE. Uh, and it was, it was like, I forget what he paid, but it was
[54:05.200 --> 54:10.400]  really cheap. It was like $200 or 220 or something like that. And he said, and it's great, you know,
[54:10.400 --> 54:15.200]  and it's, it's, you know, all the ways that you could, you, John Moltz could wax poetic about
[54:15.200 --> 54:19.840]  the thinness, lightness, pocket, pocketability, and just pleasure, the straight, straight,
[54:19.840 --> 54:25.120]  everything. He was like, you know, this is just really, really nice. So I kind of feel like Apple's
[54:25.120 --> 54:33.040]  strategy for years, really almost, you know, dating back to the, you know, when people first
[54:33.040 --> 54:37.760]  started upgrading iPhones in the first place around the three GS or the iPhone four, it's
[54:37.760 --> 54:45.760]  always sort of been the cheap iPhone is just an older iPhone. And, uh, what the fundamental
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.600]  thinking behind that strategy is, I would love to know, I would love to get Tim Cook to open up
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.880]  about that, but, you know, good luck, good luck getting them to explain what they're thinking
[54:56.880 --> 55:01.120]  there. I guess Schiller would probably be the better person to, you know, if we could drug him
[55:01.120 --> 55:08.000]  and get some bond, James Bond, true serum into sure. Yeah, Bill Schiller and figure out what
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.960]  their strategy is there. But I really do feel like, you know, if you're, if you're going to
[55:12.960 --> 55:19.040]  talk about what their strategy is there, but I really do feel like there are $329 iPhones to be
[55:19.040 --> 55:25.360]  had that are really good devices, but they're, you know, iPhone sevens and iPhone SEs and stuff.
[55:25.360 --> 55:30.960]  So the seven, yeah, the sevens four 50, but I think you could get a refurbished one for 300
[55:30.960 --> 55:37.760]  bucks with a trade in, right? Which most people probably have maybe. I don't know. Yeah, I don't
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.080]  know. I mean, it's not, if you look at it like that, it's not terribly far off, but that's an
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.160]  iPhone now, right? That's a pretty old phone, right? Whereas that iPad is brand spanking new,
[55:48.160 --> 55:53.360]  really, right? And has like, not top of the line, but but real new and has a recent a series
[55:53.360 --> 55:59.600]  processor that has a healthy number of years of iOS updates ahead of it, which is something
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.680]  you're not going to get if you buy an iPhone SE. I think the iPhone SE really is I think
[56:03.680 --> 56:09.520]  iOS 13 is probably it's probably the last one. Yeah, I would think so. You know, so who knows?
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.480]  I don't know. It's an interesting difference between the iPad and, and the iPhone. I mean,
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.960]  the iPads different in a lot of ways the Mac is sort of in the same boat or you know, why doesn't
[56:18.960 --> 56:28.240]  why is the cheapest Mac? It's now $1100 because they they didn't completely get rid of the 999
[56:28.240 --> 56:33.600]  MacBook Air, the non retina one, it's but it's no longer sold at retail. It's only available
[56:33.600 --> 56:38.160]  like through education and like the the quote unquote channel. So I think you could still buy
[56:38.160 --> 56:43.440]  them at like Best Buy or something like that. But you go into an Apple store, the cheapest Mac is
[56:43.440 --> 56:50.320]  the $1100 MacBook Air. So why don't they make a $400 Mac? You know, I guess the what do you call
[56:50.320 --> 56:56.400]  it? The Mac Mini is a little cheaper, but you have to get a display. Yeah. Yeah, it's in some
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.280]  ways. It's not in some ways. It's not the iPhone that sticks out for not having a quote unquote
[57:01.280 --> 57:08.240]  cheap the iPad version. It's the iPad because yeah, because it does. Right. The iPad, the 329 iPad is
[57:08.240 --> 57:14.400]  the one that's abnormal. Yeah. I mean, I wonder if they are just they wanted to move more units of
[57:14.400 --> 57:20.640]  iPads. Maybe and I know because the because they had I mean, they had a definite problem for a
[57:20.640 --> 57:26.400]  while moving iPad units. Yeah, never really. I mean, you know, iPhone units have topped out.
[57:26.400 --> 57:37.920]  Sure, but they've always been fairly consistent. Yeah. Chris Lakata asks, Will we see AMD CPUs in
[57:37.920 --> 57:44.640]  Macs before the arm transition? That's an interesting question. So the basic premise
[57:44.640 --> 57:50.880]  behind this and I'm I don't think you're in the same boat as me. You know, I long ago years ago
[57:50.880 --> 57:58.160]  stopped keeping up with the intricacies of Intel's roadmap. Yeah. I just can't be bothered. I'm too
[57:58.160 --> 58:04.400]  old. It's too, too boring. All I know is that Intel has been slow. And I know I know there's
[58:04.400 --> 58:11.120]  nobody going nobody going to a stones concert keeps up on Intel. I do know though that, you
[58:11.120 --> 58:16.000]  know, and I just can't be and their names confuse me. You know, like you can get a core i five that
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.040]  might be faster than a core i seven. And I don't know how that's possible. Who gives a crap? I just
[58:21.040 --> 58:28.560]  want good CPUs that are power efficient. I know that thinner fab fabrication is better. And it
[58:28.560 --> 58:34.480]  makes things more, you know, it's just better in every way. So going from 11 nanometer to nine
[58:34.480 --> 58:40.640]  nanometer to seven nanometer, it's all good. It's all you know, an Apple's A series chips are doing
[58:40.640 --> 58:47.520]  a tremendous job at that. And Intel is just ever slipping behind on this. And that in the x 86
[58:47.520 --> 58:52.560]  world, where there's really only two, two competitors, Intel and AMD, AMD is apparently
[58:52.560 --> 58:58.000]  kicking Intel's ass. And like a lot of people who care about, you know, the gamers, you know,
[58:58.000 --> 59:06.000]  the gaming PC thing is AMD is apparently doing very, very well in that arena. I just would be
[59:06.000 --> 59:14.880]  very surprised to for them to come out with AMD CPUs. And even even if they Well, I don't know,
[59:15.600 --> 59:22.160]  I think the arm transition is inevitable. But at some point, it we all become Gene Munster
[59:22.160 --> 59:27.600]  talking about Apple making a TV set, right? We're all on these podcasts for years now,
[59:28.400 --> 59:34.320]  saying, I think Apple is going to, you know, Apple's a arm team is obviously kicking ass,
[59:34.320 --> 59:40.640]  they're doing an amazing job, they're keeping the phone somehow, years ahead of their top competition
[59:40.640 --> 59:48.480]  in the Android world. And they're doing it year after year, every single year, Johnny Suruji's
[59:48.480 --> 59:55.920]  chip team is coming out with new A series chips, right on time, ready to be announced in early
[59:55.920 --> 01:00:01.920]  September, ready to ship mid to late September. And every year, they're showing some sort of
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:12.480]  terrific gains in CPU, or GPU, or power performance every single year, like clockwork. It is, yeah,
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:18.880]  not just one of the best teams at Apple, but I would say, one of the best teams in the entire
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:25.040]  world of technology period is Johnny Suruji's chip team. And so it does seem inevitable that
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:32.480]  they're going to switch the Mac to them, especially now, you know, like the rumor mongering,
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.440]  or just the pure speculation with no birdies or anybody telling us anything, just this sort of
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.360]  lick your finger, stick it in the wind and see what you think is going to happen.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.800]  Like when the iPad started creeping up on the MacBooks in benchmark performance, we, you know,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.840]  it seemed like, well, this is inevitable, but now they're smoking them, right? Like an iPad Pro
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.840]  is as a computing device way faster than like MacBook Pros, or maybe not the 15 inch. I don't
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.880]  know. I guess you can probably max out a 15 inch, but for the most part, most iPads are faster than
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.920]  most MacBooks being sold. So why wouldn't they switch? It's complicated, but I don't see them
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.320]  switching to AMD. I feel like they've kind of got like a relationship with Intel and until they make
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.520]  that switch, you know, that's what we got. Yeah. If they're going to work on one thing,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.320]  then they would probably work on that rather than spend a bunch of time doing something else.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:35.920]  Here's a guy named Bop Bop Bop. His username is DiscoHoody. He asks us to choose. I'm not sure.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:43.120]  This is a weird question. A, a desktop and a laptop. B, a desktop and an iPad.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:52.240]  C, a laptop and iPad. Or D, desktop, laptop, and iPad. I feel like D is cheating and should be
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.640]  removed. Yeah, exactly. I know. I think that's what I'd pick because that's what I have.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.360]  Yeah. Why not? And why not give us an extra choice of having both an iPad and an iPad mini?
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:09.520]  Right? Just, just, you know. We're going to do this. Do you ever hear the story about Frank
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.480]  Sinatra's rider late in his career? Frank Sinatra's rider, or at least one of the,
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.480]  I don't know who knows how long it was probably like 13 pages, but one of the details of Frank
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:28.000]  Sinatra's rider was that he wanted in his hotel room. There's probably a suite. Forget his brand
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.440]  of cigarettes, but he wanted, just to say they were Winston's. He wanted a complete fresh pack
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:40.960]  of Winston's already opened with one of the cigarettes popped out and a, and a complete
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:47.360]  matchbook next to each one, all no further than five, five feet apart from each other. So that
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.040]  wherever he was in the hotel suite, he was within five feet of a fresh pack of Winston's
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.400]  cigarettes with a complete matchbook. That's, you know, we could do that with our iPads,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.000]  right? We could just, you know, just, why don't we have, why don't we have one every
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.080]  where in the house, put them five feet away from each other, all signed into your iCloud account,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.800]  pick it up, leave where you were. So I kind of feel like you have to,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.680]  The thing that I've, the thing that I've struggled with over my entire computing
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.800]  lifetime has been the question of whether you get a, a powerful desktop and a, like a
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:27.760]  really lightweight laptop that can't do everything the desktop can, but can go play everywhere you
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:35.680]  want it to go. Or you get maybe two that are more comparable, whether you need the desk,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.240]  whether you need the desktop or not, maybe you don't need the desktop. Maybe you just get a
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.920]  super powerful laptop. And I keep going, I go back and forth on that, depending on
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.160]  what's available, I guess. And I like when I, so I bought this MacBook Pro in 2016,
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.080]  when the first one of those came out. And I still don't know the, I still don't have a good answer.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:06.240]  I, my answer is complicated and highly personal to my specific needs right now, where,
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.160]  and I don't want to go into the details of it and it's all going to be fine, but my eyesight
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:20.240]  is, is a bit in a strange place and I can see up close perfectly. And I really,
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.680]  struggle to see at arm's length distance. And so I use my iMac right now very little,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:32.080]  cause I really have trouble seeing the screen. So for me personally, right now I would go
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:40.960]  laptop and iPad because I, the iPad for me is as somebody who really needs to hold, you know,
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.520]  hold the screen really close to my face to, to read right now, or at least to read comfortably
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:54.000]  is absolutely fee nominal. It is, I, if I had, if I had run into this same vision problem 10
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.280]  years ago, I don't know what I would do. I guess I would make do with a laptop and get really close
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:07.360]  to the screen, but, uh, without even getting into the software sides of accessibility,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:13.520]  the, the hardware aspects of accessibility for someone who needs to get close to a screen of a
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:21.040]  iPad that's so lightweight, it's just absolutely phenomenal. I, I, so I would pick that right now.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:28.720]  If my, if and when my eyesight goes back to working better at arm's length, I would go
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.120]  desktop and laptop and skip the iPad if I only had to have two. Yeah. I think I have to have an iPad.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.880]  See, I don't have to have an iPad, although I kind of do right now, just be for the vision
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.360]  reasons, but not for usability. I do. I do all my reading on an iPad. Yeah, I do almost all of it.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.960]  And especially if it's longer and I use that, that continuity feature where if I encounter a
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.920]  longest article and this is good, I do that, you know, share and then you just turn your iPad screen
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:04.320]  on and jump it over there and it just opens up, which I love. Um, I do a tremendous amount of
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.880]  reading on the iPad. Well, uh, good news though. Your, your vision may get better.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.600]  Cause that's, that happened to me. Oh, it's definitely my farsightedness got better.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.200]  And, uh, and it was weird because I was, I was having a lot of trouble seeing things up close
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.000]  and I was thinking, Oh no, my, my near vision is getting worse. And I was like having to take,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.640]  uh, reading glasses with me to, you know, to mostly to like restaurants and bars and stuff.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.720]  Cause I couldn't read the bill at the end. And so I'm like, you know, come in the end of the night,
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.200]  I got to pull out my, my grandpa glasses and look at the bill. And then they go to the,
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.040]  the eye doctor and she said, oh, that's because your prescription's not working for you anymore
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.600]  because your farsightedness is getting better. So now you're, it's overcompensating. Right. So,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.160]  um, I got a new prescription and now I don't need the cheaters anymore.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.640]  Uh, yeah, I had the same thing for like two, two years. I needed reading glasses,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.120]  especially for bars and any, anything dark. Uh, but I really needed them for reading.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.720]  And now I don't, but it's a long story. But basically I haven't, I have a good eye and a
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.440]  bad eye and my good eye now has a cataract. So it's, it's actually not very good right now.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.280]  But the good news about cataract is that you can have cataract surgery and it's not perfect.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.840]  But, uh, you know, so then when I say that my vision might get better, it would be after I have
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:25.040]  cataract surgery, which I'm delaying as long as I can. But anyway, uh, very personal.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.680]  Uh, here's a football question over under for 10 wins for the Dallas Cowboys this year. That's
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.320]  from Richard Stovall. I'm going to go over, but I'm, that's for you. I have no opinion.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:40.640]  I'm not weighing in on that. I I've been optimistic on the Cowboys for 20 years now. And
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:46.320]  it hasn't worked out for him. I wouldn't, I wouldn't take this advice to Vegas, Richard.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.120]  I would actually, I would take this. You probably would. I would not advise anybody
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:57.920]  listening to me to, to do that. Uh, somebody asks, I can't really,
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.040]  it's a very strange username. Will Apple's design language change now that Johnny Ive has left?
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.920]  I think inevitably a little bit, uh, I, I've, there's some people on Twitter who seem to
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.040]  object to my, uh,
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:22.960]  uh, I think Apple is going to be fine without Johnny. I've take, you know, that accusing me
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.160]  of a sort of, it doesn't matter what happens to Apple. I'm going to, John Gruber is going to say,
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:34.160]  ah, that's fine. That's good for Apple. Um, and you know, I feel like it's,
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.440]  it, it misses a lot of new, I feel like most things in life that are interesting and worth
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.960]  talking about or writing about, there's a lot of nuance and, but it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:54.880]  there's a lot of nuance and, but long story short, I basically feel that I've inordinate influence
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:03.200]  in the post Steve jobs, Apple, um, it, you know, it's been a good, it, Apple's been fine
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.360]  without him, right? Where nobody's really, the whole Apple is doomed without Steve jobs thing
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.200]  is over now. It's, they're doomed without Johnny Ive. But, uh, even though we, even though we hated
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:21.440]  their design for the last eight years or whatever, I just feel though that, uh, his singular vision
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:29.680]  is a bit off in a couple of ways and it's been to the detriment of, of Apple's design. And again,
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.960]  you know, designed by committee is never good, but getting something with more of a consensus view
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.960]  is probably going to be good, uh, for Apple. So I kind of feel, and you know, the rumor,
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:47.120]  rumor chain is sort of suggest that this is already true, you know, that, that, that the
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.880]  rumors strongly suggest that either late this year or early next year, uh, true revisions to
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:01.200]  the whole Mac book line are going to bring back, um, uh, scissor key, a new scissor key designed
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.960]  to the keyboards, which will have more travel. And, you know, am I right? Do I know for a fact
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.920]  that the, the butterfly keyboard can be pinned on Johnny Ive? I, I can't verify that, but I mean,
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.720]  that's basically what I've heard. And knowing that his obsession with thinness and neatness,
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.920]  and maybe a little bit too much emphasis on the way things look as opposed to how they work,
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:31.440]  uh, it's hard not to think that it was, uh, you know, ultimately his decision, you know,
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.760]  and I, there's rumors too, that they're going to switch back to the upside down T for the arrow
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:43.040]  keys on the keyboards on the, you know, the small keyboards. Uh, which again, I, I will fully admit
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.800]  that the current keyboards, which have full height left and right keys and half height up and down
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.240]  keys to fill in the keyboard, it absolutely looks better. Like the gaps on the keyboard that were
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.560]  caused by the upside down T arrangement didn't look right, but they certainly worked better
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.760]  because you could feel, you feel your way around them better, you know, and I wrote this on daring
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.960]  fire bullets, I think maybe when, maybe when I've departure was announced, but somewhat recently,
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:18.000]  you know, that I feel like he's, he has violated Steve Jobs's design isn't how it looks, it's how
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.760]  it works axiom in a few ways. And I feel like both on the software and hardware sides in the last
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:32.240]  10 years or nine years, you know, however long it's been since John, since Steve died, I guess
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:39.920]  it was 2011. Yeah, it was 2011. I do think that Apple has veered a little bit to a little bit in
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:45.920]  the design is how it looks area. And I feel like that because I've got two of these key,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.040]  I've got two different keyboards are in front of me right now. And one of them is the upside down
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:56.160]  T and then the other one is the MacBook Pro 2016. And it's like, I think you really have to be
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:03.280]  looking at the upside down T too long to be like, upset about the fact that there's gaps
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.000]  right above the left and undeniably works better, in my opinion. Yeah,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.440]  completely. I mean, I still see that's one of the things I struggle with with this keyboard.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.160]  Yeah. All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor. And it's our friends
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:28.960]  at Express VPN. Look, public Wi Fi is a security hole. It really is you get on a coffee shop Wi Fi,
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.040]  and they don't have security. Somebody else who's on the network, whoever controls the network can
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.200]  actually see the network traffic that's going on. It's not exactly safe. And you can do all sorts
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.280]  of stuff over HTTPS. And that will ensure that the traffic between you and the web server is
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.760]  encrypted. But anything that's not is up in the air. A VPN is the way that you can get around
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:03.360]  this, it secures your network connection to the VPN provider completely encrypted. So all of the
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:10.320]  traffic, every single bit coming in going out of your device is fully encrypted. But you need to
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:18.160]  have a VPN provider that you can trust. Express VPN is the number one VPN service ranked by Tech

[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.400]  you can start using Express VPN. And it is you might think, well, how do I install this? Is it
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.240]  hard? Is it you know, I need to be like Unix system administrator to get this working? Nope,

[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.240]  What else? Here's a good question.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:31.040]  Uh, how close are you two to switching from Dropbox to iCloud drive? That's from R Stevens
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:39.920]  cartoonist extraordinaire. Uh, I have to say, I don't think I've gotten this Dropbox update yet
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.840]  that shows up in the doc. I don't have it in running in my doc, but there's apparently,
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.240]  I never saw it running in the doc. I definitely got a new interface in the dropdown menu though.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:57.440]  Yeah. Basically Dropbox is going to hell in a handbasket. It really is. And, uh, I, again,
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:03.200]  I'm stealing from Marco here from ATP, but basically, uh, you know, we, we collectively
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.800]  as users of Dropbox have, have, have granted Dropbox extraordinary access to our computers.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.320]  When you installed Dropbox, you're letting it right to your file system. You are letting it
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.440]  auto update itself like Dropbox just runs in the background. And when it wants to update to a new
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.120]  version, it just happens. That's an extraordinary privilege to grant an application. We, you know,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.600]  we collectively as Dropbox users, and I suspect most people listening to the show either use
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:36.320]  Dropbox or have used it extensively. Uh, we've, we've given them an awful lot of our trust and
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:45.680]  I feel like they've abused it and I get it that they are venture capital backed and that they're
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.560]  not just shooting to be a nice little business that collects a nice little bit of money from
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:56.640]  people to have a folder that sinks across devices and that they're shooting to be, you know, a
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:02.080]  multi gazillion dollar conglomerate, you know, that that's up there with the tech giants like
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:09.680]  Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon. Um, and that they've raised, you know, evaluation that
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.800]  makes just having a folder that sinks for 10 bucks a month or something like that. They're
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:19.040]  never going to get there. And so they're effectively, you know, all of these companies
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.680]  are effectively trying to build like an entire suite where like you're going to use Dropbox for
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.760]  like everything from your spreadsheets and your word processing and your collaboration. And it's
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.920]  like slack and video conferencing and file sharing all in one. I just want a folder that sinks. I
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.800]  really do. And I get it that they've, they've gone down this route and we've all sort of known
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.280]  that that's what they, you know, they were raising all this money and how long can this last as a
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.120]  nice little utility. Um, so I don't think anybody is shocked by this, but it is very disappointing.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:17:00.800]  So I hope that iCloud, iCloud's new, uh, shared folder feature, which is coming this fall
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.960]  on Mac iOS and iOS. I hope it works as well as you would expect it to, because if it does,
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.680]  then I'm, then that's when I'm leaving Dropbox. Cause the one thing Dropbox has right now that I
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:17.920]  need is the shared folder feature. And is that for, I mean, the only reason I use
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:24.320]  Dropbox now is for sharing podcast files, basically that same here. And so I guess I
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.640]  could do it another way. Maybe. So maybe I'll switch before that. Um, but I do also, but it's
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.800]  easy. It's easy for that. And I've used it for years and I used to use it. I mean, I used to
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:41.200]  have all my like text files on it as well so that I could access them from my iPhone and from my
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.240]  iPad and whatever device I was using. And then they cut back. So they said, no, you only get like,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.040]  and then I'm, you know, and I'm not paying. So, uh, I mean, I can't complain too much,
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.920]  but, but I would pay, I would pay a little bit if I was getting something that I really wanted.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.440]  Right. And I, they want more than what I feel like I would get out of it. And I can do the things
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.720]  that I need to do with iCloud. So I have moved, I have moved my Mac book. I have a weird, I have
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.760]  a weird setup. Admittedly, admittedly, I have a, I have an ancient Mac book here, a 2009 Mac book
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.800]  that I usually do the recording for podcasts on that just sits here to do that. And that one is
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.760]  still on Dropbox for sharing because, you know, the other people that I work with are still on
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.760]  Dropbox. And then I took Dropbox off my, my main machine, which is this Mac book pro. The other
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:36.560]  thing you can do, um, which is interesting is I use transmit from panic. Yes. Right. Right. And so
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.680]  I still have our transmit set up to use Dropbox. Yeah. Uh, I'm guessing that some other file
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.600]  transfer apps probably have the same thing, you know, but you can sign up, you know, sign in with
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.800]  your Dropbox credentials in transmit and then you can get your Dropbox that way and just treat it
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.920]  like an FTP server, FTP server. Right. And it's so you can still have shared folders and, and if
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.440]  somebody does share something, you can log in and still get your files. Um, you know, obviously more
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.600]  of a Mac thing than a iOS thing, but maybe there's a iOS solution for that as well. Uh, I guess you
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.720]  could just use the Dropbox app on iOS and you're not getting stuck with all the, you know, it's the
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.680]  Mac version that in windows version that everybody's complaining about the iOS version, thanks to the,
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.960]  you know, sandboxing rules and various other rules of iOS can't really interfere with your daily
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.960]  computing as much. So you can uninstall Dropbox from your Mac, but still remain in
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:39.040]  the Dropbox universe, which is my plan. Yeah. That's what I, that's what I did,
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:47.760]  what I mean, what I did. Yeah. The thing I don't like about iCloud, uh, for compared to Dropbox,
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.680]  I like the idea of trusting Apple more than I trust Dropbox, especially just in terms of like
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:20:02.640]  not being annoying, but I, I like the way that Dropbox, I guess they've added a couple of magic
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.840]  folders within your Dropbox folder over the years, right? Like they want you to have a photos folder
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.520]  inside your Dropbox, but there's not a lot. Right. And I think you can even opt out of that. So
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:19.520]  basically, you know, inside your Dropbox folder, it's all organized the way you want it organized.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:28.720]  Whereas iCloud drive at the root level starts with a folder for every single app that is using
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:38.640]  iCloud drive. And you know, I'm not going to go all John Syracuse, uh, but I, I do find it,
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.160]  I wish I had control over that. I wish, I wish that there was, uh, you know, just put them all
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.280]  inside an application data folder, right? Just to say inside iCloud drive, there's a folder called
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:56.800]  application data and an inside application data are all of these folders that get created
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.760]  automatically for every single app. I just kind of hate the fact that the root level of my iCloud
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.880]  drive has 33 folders. That's crazy. And it only like two of those are the ones that I've made.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:17.440]  Yeah. And there's two, two folders in the, out of 33 are the ones that I made. So I find that a
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.280]  little annoying compared to Dropbox, but for me, I cloud drive has been very solid, although,
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:27.280]  um, I'm not really using, I've been spooked enough by developer friends that I'm not even really
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:34.320]  beta testing the iOS 13 stuff right now, just because I've heard that stuff after I upgraded
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:39.360]  one of them. I mean, I have an old, I have an iPad air too, and I put it on that right so far.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.400]  I've been lucky, but right. But the betas this summer have been buggy enough and specific. I
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.960]  mean, they're doing really cool stuff with iCloud and every developer I've heard talking about this
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.280]  is saying like, what they're doing is great. And once they get the bugs worked out, iCloud is going
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.760]  to be better than ever. But right now in the middle of 2019 summer, uh, these betas can lose
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.520]  data in your iCloud folder, even if you're only using it on a secondary device, if you're,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:11.200]  if you're, uh, signed into the same iCloud account, like, so, you know, what you could do
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.600]  and probably should be doing if you're testing it as a developer or whatever is using like a
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.240]  secondary iCloud account, but that, that would make it, I don't have any need for that. I don't
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.800]  have any apps that I need to test. I, if I don't have my real iCloud account, the device isn't
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:32.480]  really useful to me. I guess it would help if I had signed into my, the talk show account on the
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:40.000]  iPad I was doing the show from, I had just gone through, uh, I was, yeah, I can get back. I can
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.840]  do it on my phone. I kind of like this question. You're at a fine cocktail establishment. This is
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.480]  David Smith. Okay. With all the Apple execs, you get up to buy your round. What does each
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:59.680]  person's drink order? Oh, interesting. Hmm. I feel, I feel like, uh, it's sort of like,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:07.280]  I'm maybe stereotyping to say that, uh, Tim Cook's is a mint julep. I can see that or,
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.720]  yeah, but that was the first thing that came to me. I could see that. I'm going to say
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:19.680]  Phil Schiller is a, is a white Russian, like a little nutty. Yeah. Johnny, Johnny,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.320]  what about Johnny? I, do we still count Johnny? I think just a, just a glass of cold water
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.840]  with no ice, just cold water. Well, but then that's not a cocktail. I was going to go with,
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.360]  yeah, true. I was going to go with like a gin martini, but yeah. So then maybe, but stern,
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:44.240]  stop stirred extraordinarily slowly. So as to keep it, keep it as crystal clear as possible,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:53.840]  right? Crystal. Great. How about Eddie? Oh, Eddie Q. Hmm. I don't know.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:58.880]  I, I, Eddie Q is a tough one. Hmm.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.560]  At a fine cocktail establishment. I'm going to say even at a fine cocktail establishment,
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.400]  maybe Eddie Q wants a six pack of beer.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.280]  I don't know. I was thinking Eddie would want something that was really difficult to make.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.800]  Yeah, maybe, maybe. I was trying to think of something that's really hard to make.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.240]  I think Craig, Craig Federighi would probably be like the opposite. He'd be like, whatever's the
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.800]  easiest thing to make. Yeah. Right. Right. Whatever you got is fine. Whatever you're having. Yeah.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.600]  Yeah. Like somebody ordered, whatever somebody orders right before him,
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400]  he'll just be like, make it two. That'd be nice and easy. Right. Go along to get along. Whereas
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.480]  there's this old Martin short movie. I can't remember the name of it. It was like a TV movie.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:54.720]  It was a comedy. And in the movie he, everywhere he goes, he orders this thing called a pouce cafe.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:03.920]  And, and every time the bartender is like, oh God, really? It's like, yeah, yeah. I want a
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.840]  pouce cafe. And you'd see the bartender in the back and he's like, he's got a blender and he's
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.520]  got all this stuff. And in the foreground, you know, he's just having a conversation
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:21.280]  with whoever he's talking to. That's a funny name. I never heard of it. Which is apparently
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.480]  is a real thing, which I didn't know at the time. I mean, it's like, this was like, came out in the
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:33.360]  eighties. I only saw it once. How do you, how do you think you spell that? P O U S S E dash
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.560]  C A F E. Something like that. Let's see if that's the fact comes up. Is it complicated?
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  Okay. So it's like a dessert drink. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's got multiple layers. Oh God. That's
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:53.040]  what it is. That's Oh my God. It's not even like the, the list. It sounds terrible. Really?
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:02.720]  It's grenadine maraschino liqueur, creme de menthe, creme de violet, yellow chartreuse and brandy.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.320]  But it's layered. That's the, that's the, you know, you have to create a stripe. It creates a
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.360]  striped effect, right? Yeah. Painstaking. You know what? That wouldn't be ridiculous. If, if,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.800]  as the question presupposes that we're at a craft cocktail facility, you're not really putting them
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:25.040]  out. It is a major pet peeve of mine. When you're at a busy bar, let's say standing room only,
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.680]  and you've got to order between standing, sitting guests at the bar, and you've got to order
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.200]  between standing, sitting guests at the bar. It's a pet peeve of mine. When somebody asks for a,
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:45.040]  a difficult to drink, difficult to, or not even difficult, but, but multi-step drink when the
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:53.600]  bartender is obviously over taxed by the number of requests coming in. Like, Hey, maybe wait,
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.080]  maybe you just get a glass of wine or a glass of beer, you know, a shot of something or something
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.640]  something on the rocks, you know, vodka and soda. You never go, you can't go wrong with a vodka and
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.600]  soda. Yeah. I find that the places that I usually go, I mostly just get shots of something, you know,
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:14.320]  like strip something neat because you go to a dive bar. You don't necessarily want to order a martini
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.920]  or an old fashioned, you might get old fashioned. Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:30.640]  Yeah. You don't want a fruit salad in there.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.200]  Is that a strawberry in there?
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.200]  All of a sudden there's a half of an orange and a strawberry and the guy's muddling it all up.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:51.200]  And then you're like, Oh God, now he's going to pour some kind of good bourbon in there, ruin it.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.880]  Let's see here. Jay mush asks before the newest iPhone only had to appeal to those who had two
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.960]  year old model for us to five S five to six, five S to success. Has Apple lost that a bit by using
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.560]  a three year cycle for their design language? Will the 11 excite 10 use iPhone 10 users,
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:20.240]  like a six excited five users? It's a good question. I kind of feel that it
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.640]  kind of has, but I feel like that's actually a good thing. And I know that from like a
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.800]  wall street perspective, the idea that the upgrade life cycle is getting longer
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:41.040]  from most typical users is not seen as a good thing. Obviously, like people who are invested
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.000]  in Apple on wall street would like everybody to get a new phone every year, you know? So like
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.160]  when those goofy stories come out and say like Apple's, you know, iOS updates purposefully slow
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.000]  down your phone. Uh, and everybody is, you know, most people are, you know, like people like me
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.360]  and you are like, ah, that's actually not true. Uh, people who believe it taken on face value
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:10.320]  are like, oh, that sucks. And then people on wall street are like, yeah, seems like a great idea.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:21.200]  Uh, I feel it, it, it it's multivariate. And I feel like one of them is that over the course
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:30.880]  of the last 12 years, uh, the, you know, iPhones have gone from like a very niche product, you
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.120]  know, I forget how many they sold in the first year, but it was like, I remember jobs wanted
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.240]  to sell 10 million in the first year and a half, you know, like 18 months. And they made it through
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:46.000]  the first, like the first 12 months, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was about, about 12 months and they hit
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.400]  the mark already, but 10 million is a joke. You know, there's, you know, there's, there's hundreds
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.920]  of millions of them in use and they sell, you know, 70 some million in the first quarter when
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:04.560]  new ones come out. Um, but it's inevitable as something goes from, uh, something for early,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:13.760]  uh, adopters to truly mass market, the mass market end of the market is going to hold on to them as
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:20.320]  long as they can. You know, my mom has an iPhone now. My mom thinks she likes it a lot, but she
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.720]  didn't get one until just like two years ago or something like that. Cause she just, you know,
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:30.160]  wow. She just thought it was crazy and she didn't think she would use it as much, you know? And so
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:35.040]  she just had like, you know, like, uh, she had a cell phone, but it was like a $20, you know?
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:41.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Candy bar type thing that God bless her. God, you know what she does? I'll tell you,
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.720]  this is honest. I don't want to throw my mom under the bus. I love my mom. I think she still does it
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.200]  with her iPhone even. I swear to God. She, when she's done using it, she turns it off.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.480]  Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to one up you because not only, not only is my mom,
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.520]  I don't think she, I don't think she does this anymore, but for a long time,
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.080]  not only did my mom turn it off, she would put it back in the box.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:12.960]  It's like, what are you doing? But like we go on a vacation with my parents and my, uh,
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:19.120]  it's actually very nice. And my sister's, um, husband's parents, uh, we all go together
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:25.120]  for a couple of days in August and everybody gets along. It's, you know, it's almost a miracle,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:31.280]  but, but you know, you, you go on vacation and you know, one of the things that's nice about
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:37.200]  the modern world is when you're, you're first getting to the destination, you can coordinate
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:41.680]  with each other by cell phone and to organize, Hey, where, how far, you know, we're only half
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.480]  an hour away. Oh, we were going to go out to eat. We'll wait for you. You know, if you're only 20
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:52.000]  minutes away, et cetera, it's, you know, you can, you can just coordinate the, the getting together
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.200]  initially aspect. My mom, you can't do it cause she she'll call and say something. And then you
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:03.600]  go to call her back and it says like this, this Verizon goes right to voicemail and it's like,
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:09.760]  mom, why'd you turn your cell phone off? She was like, well, I was done. But anyway, as,
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.880]  as people like that, uh, buy more iPhones, of course they're going to keep them. I really
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:21.840]  cannot imagine my mom getting a new iPhone until her iPhone breaks. I really, I don't think she
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.040]  would take one if I gave it to her, you know, she would say, take that back to the store. I don't
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.720]  need that. Yeah. So I think that's natural. I think, but I also think that Apple and to go
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.160]  back to Johnny I've, I do think that they have, they have taken the iPhone to where they see it as
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:44.160]  being very close to the platonic ideal of what an iPhone should be given the limits of today's
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.800]  technology, right? Like surely, you know, something that was just a piece of glass that could light up
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.800]  would be more Apple like and better. And if you could fold it up like a dollar bill, that would
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:58.960]  be even better. There's all sorts of hypothetical science fiction technology in years to come.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:04.400]  I'm sure that 10 years from now, we'll look back at 2019 iPhones and think that they're
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:11.200]  crude devices. Um, but given the limits of today's technology and the, the, you know,
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.640]  prices, which they've raised, right? I mean, they're already, you know, selling like 11,
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:22.720]  1200, $1,300 iPhones. Um, it, it's going there. I think it's natural that they change less year
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:28.160]  over year. And it's definitely a Johnny I've thing that he has said to me personally in like,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:34.640]  off the record briefings. And I know he said in interviews multiple times in public that Apple
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.960]  does not want to change things for the sake of change. They only want to change a design when it
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:47.840]  is clearly better. And so they're not going to do decorative changes year over year. I mean,
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.440]  it might do things. They do play with like the colors of the anodized aluminum and stuff like
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:59.360]  that. Um, but again, that's not really, I, that's not the sort of thing that people who think three
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.880]  years of the same fundamental design is quote, boring. That doesn't satisfy them either. Right.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.480]  If you suddenly find out there's a new shade of rose gold. Um, yeah, I think it's worked out. I
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:16.720]  think that's, I tend to think that the popularity of the iPhone 10 R is partially because it's
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.560]  different and it's definitely because it's cheaper. I think that's probably the bigger
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.960]  reason. Um, but I think also people are like, Oh, I can get this in a bunch of colors. Yeah.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.480]  And then I'm going to cover it with a case and then I'm going to cover with a case that's going
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:35.600]  to be a different color and it's going to be like, but you'll be able to see the color poking out
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.840]  at the lightning port just a little bit, just a little bit at the lightning port. Um, yeah,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:47.200]  I guess, but I don't think that I wouldn't be surprised if we have something that looks a lot
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:54.480]  like the iPhone 10, not just this year, but for several years to come. I really do. And I think
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.120]  it's a mature technology. I mean, and look at, look at the Mac books, right? The, you know,
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.600]  however much we want to complain about the new keyboards and that maybe there took them, made
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.440]  them too thin, that they should have been a lit all across the board, maybe a little thicker and
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.120]  just fill it up with battery. That's what we always want them to do, right? We, everybody
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.640]  always says we want them to make it just maybe a little thicker and fill it up with battery and
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:22.880]  then I get better battery life. Uh, but fundamentally the Mac book lineup, there's a
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:29.360]  direct lineage in industrial design from the titanium G four power book to all of today's
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.600]  models, you know, and titanium as a material obviously didn't work out that well. Um,
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:43.120]  but using metal instead of plastic. And then once they got to aluminum and then going to
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.080]  unibody, it's, you know, there've been definite breakthroughs and they've evolved, but it is,
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.520]  there's never once really been a radical change since the titanium G four power book really hasn't.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:59.760]  And, and it's just, uh, I, I, I feel like they've gotten to the point where this is, you know,
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.240]  I forget the exact Johnny I've words, but to, to reduce a product to its essence,
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.560]  I would say, I mean, I guess the air is kind of a radical change, but yeah,
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.640]  a little bit still, I know what you, I know what you mean. I mean, it's basically the same. Well,
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:18.000]  you know, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.920]  it's a screen and a keyboard, right? Right. But I feel like this round rectangle,
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:31.200]  the shape of, of the current law iPhone lineup is sort of given today's technology, this is it,
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.600]  you know, and it might change play with colors. I don't expect anything truly radical.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:42.480]  And I think if you really want to get excited by, and I always think it's, you know, for the large,
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.720]  in many ways, when people complain about that, uh, and I don't want to say the guy who asked
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.080]  this question is, is saying this, but, um, a lot of the, a lot of it is getting, trying,
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.320]  wanting to get excited about what it looks like before you even turn the screen on, you know,
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.760]  like, what does it just, does it excite you just as an object in your hand? Uh, and I get it. I
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.880]  mean, it would be nice if, you know, if something, you know, if you, if it was so different and new
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.640]  and clearly better that you were excited before you even saw what it looked like with the screen
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:17.040]  on, that would be better than, that would be good, but I just don't see how that can happen, you
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.600]  know, every two years. Yeah. Yeah. It's just natural for a maturing device. And we basically
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:32.000]  evolved it or they've basically evolved it to, we can take credit based on our demand into something
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.600]  that is really just, it's a screen. I mean, it's just a screen with a backing. Yeah. Well,
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.240]  and there's not much else you can do at that point. Well, and the other thing, you know,
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:53.040]  that they did with the iPhone 10 is I feel like it was a, an instance of measure twice, cut once
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:58.880]  of, okay, we're going to make this the single biggest change they've ever made to the iPhone
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.640]  from a, a, how does it work perspective? I mean, the only other thing I can think of would be going
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.760]  to retina screens, but that's sort of very much by definition, how it looks. But the big change
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.600]  is getting rid of the home button. And cause the home button was central to the whole paradigm of
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:20.720]  how you used it. It was, you know, how you woke it up. It was, you know, launch an app. How do
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:28.320]  you get out, hit the home button. And getting rid of the home button was truly a rethinking at the
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:34.080]  most fundamental level of the experience of how you use it. And I feel like they really took their
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:42.240]  time to get it right and decided, you know, is this actually a better overall experience than
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.920]  having a home button at the bottom of the screen? And, uh, I feel like now that they've done that,
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.960]  I feel like it's, it has panned out. I still feel, and I wrote this on daring fireball a
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.800]  while back. I still feel that maybe some of the perceived, uh, not even perceived the actual sort
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:07.280]  of slowness in iPhone sales in the last two years, I think to some degree can be attributed to people
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:15.520]  who, who are reluctant to get rid of a home button based iPhone because it's too new and different.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.360]  And they're the sort of people who are, they're just regular people and they're used to it and
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:25.840]  they know that it works. Um, and they know that touch ID works and face ID sounds like something
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  that maybe wouldn't work, you know, sounds too good to be true. Um, but maybe you think it's
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:37.680]  creepy or, you know, but it'll happen over time. And I'm personally a hundred percent convinced
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:43.200]  that it's, it's a better paradigm for using the phone. Um, but now that they've done it,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.080]  I really feel like it's even less likely that the basic shape or look at the phone is going to
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.360]  change. The only thing I can think of is, is, and I would, as someone who owns an iPhone se,
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.920]  I would actually like to see this as something that's more informed by the form factor or,
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.560]  you know, just the edges of the iPad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would,
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.280]  I would kind of like, cause I love the feel of that. Yeah. I would kind of like flat sides again.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.760]  Yeah. Um, I would also like to see them at a smaller model. I don't know how much smaller,
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:23.600]  but I would like to see, I think the iPhone 10 and 10 S size is too big to be the smallest iPhone,
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.280]  but by all accounts there, this year's phones are the same sizes as last year's.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.000]  There is no smaller iPhone coming in September, supposedly. I don't know. I would like to see
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.840]  them do that. Um, Lou Piper asks what product currently in Apple's lineup do you believe will
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.120]  be the most influential in shaping the tech industry as a whole over the next 10 years?
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.480]  Looking back, it seems like the iPhone was the answer for the last 10 years. I would say there's,
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:58.880]  it's undisputedly for the iPhone for the last 10 years. The iPhone is truly the most world changing
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.920]  computer product ever made by any company. And I, I, I can't even see how somebody could argue with
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:11.040]  it. Every single, almost every single person I know carries either an iPhone or a very iPhone like
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:21.200]  Android device. I linked to in, in, uh, in my, uh, retrospective links on looking back on Johnny
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:29.840]  Ives career, I linked to, uh, Walt Mossberg's 2007 review of the original iPhone, uh, which I thought
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:37.760]  rereading it 12 years later was incredibly spot on. Like, man, when you're writing an 800 word
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.600]  column for the, you know, the wall street journal mass audience explaining what this new iPhone is,
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:49.200]  it, it really almost seems like he cheated. Like he just wrote it now and like slipped
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.720]  it into the wall street journal, CMS. Uh, every single thing that was great about the iPhone,
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:42:01.920]  he got, he completely nailed it with the software keyboard and said, this is controversial. And a
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.680]  lot of people don't think it's work. He goes, I, after a couple of days, I got used to it.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:12.080]  It's not an issue. And I mean, how many thousands of words were wasted in 2007 and 2008 on the
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.680]  damn keyboard? Mossberg had it nailed after like six days with the iPhone, you know? Um,
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.520]  but the other thing that really stuck out to me about it was there was a comparison chart that
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.760]  they pushed on the, put on the article where it was like, here's the iPhone against the competition.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:32.320]  And it was like three, three other top smartphones and it was the Blackberry, whatever the Samsung
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:39.440]  Blackjack, which I always forget. I always forget just how it was such a, you know, Samsung being
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.480]  Samsung before they started ripping off Apple, they ripped off Blackberry and even named their
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:51.200]  product the Blackjack. So it would start with the word black, uh, and a Palm trio, something or
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:43:00.240]  another that had like a pencil pencil diameter antenna sticking out of the top of it, which
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:07.680]  they look, I mean, jobs himself compared, you know, put the similar products up on the slide
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:14.480]  at the iPhone introduction and, and talking about, you know, Hey, they put these, uh, you know,
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.840]  they all have these keyboards and they all have all of these buttons. And one thing with all these
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.240]  hardware buttons is you can't change them depending on the application context. We realized
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.720]  that, Hey, we could do this. It's called software and we'll just do it all in software, including
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.240]  a keyboard. And you know, even he put that slide, but when you looked at it in the wall street
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:37.360]  journal article, it's just, it's just preposterous how, how closely the entire industry followed the
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:44.560]  iPhone's lead within a handful of years. Um, so for the next 10 years, Hmm. And you can't even
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:49.120]  get a phone that looks like, I mean, does anybody make a phone like that anymore? No. You know,
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:54.240]  what's interesting is the only phones you can get that aren't iPhone like are flip phones. The flip
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.440]  phones, the flip phone has survived. And yeah, I, I see people not all the time, but sometimes
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.120]  surprisingly young, you know, I don't know if it's a hipster thing. I don't know if it's,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.120]  I don't know, you know, just not being the thing that's not being in the technology at all,
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:14.080]  but if you go into a convenience store and buy a burner phone, it's probably one of those, right?
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.840]  Yeah. But nobody sells a Blackberry style phone anymore that I know of. It's all you either go
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.040]  all the way back to just a simple flip phone with, you know, zero to nine keypad or you've got,
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.200]  or it's a blank screen. It's a blank screen. Hard to say for the next 10 years. I don't think
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.880]  there's anything like the iPhone on the market. Um, I mean, I th you can see a lot of people
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:43.600]  running around trying to copy AirPods. Yeah. I would say it's the wearables in general,
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:50.960]  the com some combination of AirPods and the watch where it's not about a device in your hands.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:59.760]  It's, you know, that it's wearable. Um, and I don't think that AirPods or the watch
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:06.160]  or AirPods combined with the watch would have the direct influence on the next 10 years,
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.080]  the way the iPhone has the way that we really know. Yeah. I mean, it's not going to be,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:16.720]  doesn't seem like there's anything currently shipping that, but they're leading the way
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:26.560]  of making tiny little gadgets that are actually Unix computers and doing things that you could
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:35.360]  only do with a full fledged iOS computer running in them. Um, that I think 10 years from now,
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.680]  we'll look back and say that the watch and the AirPods were the start of this,
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:44.000]  you know, the fact that we have like six, six different computers on us at all times,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.400]  you know, in front of our eyes, in our ears, on our wrists, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:56.240]  So I would go with the wearables. Yeah. I find it funny too, that the wearables,
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:02.880]  uh, get dismissed as a business, uh, in the, in the Johnny Ive, uh,
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:08.320]  Johnny Ive is leaving Apple, uh, trail of news stories. I know that, I think it was
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.000]  trip Mickel's piece for the wall street journal. That was the one that Tim Cook objected to
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.920]  publicly with an email. Like, did you see this? I didn't really do it on during fireball. Cause
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:23.840]  it seemed hard to get into without doing the full paragraph by paragraph take down.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.360]  And so it just, it, I punted on it, but I thought it was fascinating. Like the wall
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.960]  street journal ran a story by trip. Mickel more or less pushing the line that, uh,
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:42.880]  Johnny Ive has been checked out of Apple for years now. Um, and then at some point was like,
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:50.880]  they haven't had a hit since the iPad. Uh, and, uh, I, I think I'm, I'm almost certain
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.920]  that if you just take Apple's wearables, although it might be wearables plus services,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.920]  which is a little different, but just their wearables business and maybe wearables plus
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:09.120]  services alone would be a fortune 50 company. It isn't the iPhone, but the iPad wasn't the
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.840]  iPhone either. So somehow the iPad has been grandfathered in as a hit product at this point,
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.320]  even though like in its earlier years when it was actually selling better, it wasn't because
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:28.000]  it wasn't selling as well as the iPhone, but now somehow that the, the, the Apple bear line has
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.400]  includes the iPad as a hit, but that's because it was, I guess because it came out while Steve
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:40.720]  Jobs was still around and AirPods and, uh, the watch don't, even though everywhere I go,
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:47.680]  I see people with Apple watch and the watch has taken off as just as well as I think like iPods
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:52.560]  did in the air or the iPad. Yeah. Oh, I definitely like the first year. I mean, like, and I don't
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.200]  know if, you know, it's probably going to tie. It's not going to keep going like that necessarily,
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:05.040]  but it might top out, but it's, it's still doing extremely well. Uh, I think it was horse dead,
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:10.080]  you who, who made the case. He noted that he made it the case that the Apple watch is now bigger
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:15.520]  than the iPod ever was even at peak iPod. And I think it has much better legs. I think the watch
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:20.720]  is here to stay. I mean, I think it might, uh, you know, and again, naturally, so just like we
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.320]  were talking about with the iPhone, it might turn into something that people don't upgrade
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.800]  as frequently and, and as well, they should expect, I think when you buy a $350 watch,
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.920]  you should expect to get more than two years out of it. And I realize it's not just a watch.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.560]  It is different. It's, you know, it's more a thing on your wrist that can function as a watch, but
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.880]  you know, again, I'm sure wall street people would love it if people were buying a new watch every
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.320]  year, but it's 350 bucks, which is almost certainly the most expensive watch most people have ever
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.080]  bought in their life. You know, you should expect to get more than two years out of it.
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:06.080]  Yeah. But boy, Oh boy, I see. I see so many of them. And Oh yeah. Yeah. And across, I mean,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:13.040]  yeah, I don't want to stereotype people again, but, um, like across the economic background,
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.480]  see me too. Oh, I think so too. I definitely think so. I see. I mean,
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:22.560]  I see baggers at the grocery store wearing them. Yeah. Uh, and it's, it, people really like it.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.920]  And I think for people like that, I remember reading that there was a story. I probably
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:32.880]  never find the link, but, um, I specifically remember it is, and it was a great story,
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:40.960]  but service industry, people, bartenders, servers, grocery baggers, uh, it's super popular with them
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.720]  because they're not allowed to check their phone during work. Oh yeah. Um, and so they can wear
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:51.280]  the watch and still get notifications and still, you know, see what people are texting them and
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:57.440]  maybe do a quick tap thing to send a quick response or something like that. Um, so if
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:03.520]  anything, I would actually say, you know, in terms of like the demographics, it is, it, it is
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:08.720]  definitely not like an elite, uh, purchase or something like that. It's really dem, you know,
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.520]  democratic people really love it. And I've seen people complain about AirPods the same way that,
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:16.880]  Oh, it's, you know, they're so expensive that nobody, only the rich can afford them. And that's
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.400]  like, I see mail carriers with them. I see everybody with them. I actually was, I was
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.000]  out for a walk the other day when the heat broke and I actually was like, I got to get out of this
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.560]  house and go somewhere. I should have actually kept track, but I was just doing it like a
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.360]  rough estimate, but, uh, I I'm convinced, I don't think it was bias. I, I really, I didn't do like
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:43.920]  an exact tally, but I saw more people with AirPods than I saw with corded white headphones. And you
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.720]  know, of course, maybe, you know, and people who are cynical can argue, well, of course, because
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.680]  they took out the headphone port and if they hadn't removed the headphone port to, to convince people
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:51:01.360]  to buy AirPods, it wouldn't be that way. Um, but I, I suppose, I don't know. I, I, I, I cannot
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:05.760]  believe how many years of my life I spent tangled up with the cable between them. Yeah. I am
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.200]  way happier with AirPods so much happy. And I listened to so much more. I listened to,
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.880]  uh, I I'll just, even on a five minute errand, I'll, I'll go and listen to five minutes of a
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.760]  podcast, you know, let me get five more minutes. And, uh, whereas, you know, in the corded era,
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:24.880]  I would just wouldn't, couldn't be bothered. I was like, I can't even talk to my wife anymore.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:28.720]  She's got them in all the time. Same here. It's actually really improved my marriage
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:35.040]  simply on the grounds that a lot of what I say annoys my wife.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:39.440]  Like, I'm not saying that it's better because we don't communicate. It's just that a lot of
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:45.200]  the stupid stuff I say she doesn't hear anymore. And then we do, we do talk, we're talking,
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:51.920]  we always always talk about podcasts. Uh, all right, let me take one more break here.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:58.000]  Thank our third and final sponsor of this very special summer episode of the talk show
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.960]  Eero, E E R O. Look, the single router model just doesn't work for our increasingly high
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.800]  bandwidth world. It's simple physics like light waves. Wifi waves don't go through walls. Well,
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:15.120]  imagine asking a light bulb in your living room to light your master bedroom wouldn't work.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:20.160]  Maybe that's not a perfect analogy, but it's close. And the other thing is more and more
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.960]  what we want to do throughout our house is streaming high def video. It's not just about
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.600]  getting your text message or being able to send an email. If you want to watch high def video from
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:37.600]  Netflix or who iTunes, whatever it is, you need good bandwidth and we want to do it everywhere in
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.920]  the house. I take my iPad with me everywhere during the day when I'm reading and watching
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.640]  stuff. I want to be able to watch the Yankees and high def anywhere I go. I want to, I want to do
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:53.760]  it on my, on my deck. Uh, something like Eero, a distributed system with multiple devices that
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:53:00.400]  create a mesh network is the way to do it. And it's especially easy to do. You just get them,
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.600]  you plug them in, you set the one up, you connect it to your, your cable modem. You just plug the
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:11.760]  other ones into the wall. You use the Eero app and boom, they're all together. They're all talking
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:18.080]  and they saturate your whole home top to bottom, left to right with one distributed network.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:22.960]  It's really great. I use it here. You're listening to me talk to John Moltz right over
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.880]  an Eero network. Um, you can really install an entertainment grade wifi system in your home in
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.000]  just a few minutes. You just download the app and it's, they got an iOS version, which I'm guessing
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.400]  99.98% of you would use. They have an Android version too, and it'll walk you through each step
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:46.640]  of the process. Quick, easy, painless. They also offer absolutely incredible customer service. You
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.320]  can call and get ahold of a wifi expert within 30 seconds. So if you have any worries, whether
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:57.520]  you've got it and you're trying to set it up or you're curious, you want some help trying to pick
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:02.320]  how many hardware, how many Eero devices you want for your house based on the size of your house or
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.960]  the layout of your house, you can call them up 30 seconds. They'll walk you through everything
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.560]  and they'll tell you exactly how many euros are right for your home. Just call. Uh, it's a great
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:17.520]  product. I really love it. It never goes out. It is super reliable. You never have to think about
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:23.360]  it again. They've got a special deal for you. Listener of the talk show. Go to ero.com E E
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:32.080]  R O.com slash the talk show and at checkout enter that same code, the talk show, and you can get
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:40.640]  an Eero base unit and two beacons and one year of their Eero plus service with special code.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.200]  The talk show. That's a great package. By the way, the base station would be the thing you
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.680]  plug into your router. The beacons are the little nightlight type things. Put them around your
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.680]  house. That's a great package. That's probably all you need depending on the size of your house.

[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.680]  What else? Anything else that's that's on this list of questions?
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.480]  I want to check my biases. I looked up the average salary for
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:20.160]  mail carriers and it's $46,000 a year. There you go. That's not, that's not nothing.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:28.240]  No. Yeah. But still it's not like, yeah. Will we ever see, here's one from Dan Studnicky.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:34.080]  Will we ever see iMessage and FaceTime go cross platform? I would say maybe. I would say more
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:42.640]  likely for iMessage than FaceTime. I don't know why I would feel that way. I definitely,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.640]  I know for a while. FaceTime was the one that he said was going to be open source, but
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:52.480]  it was jobs just pulled that out of his ass. I've said this before. I know for a fact,
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.960]  I know someone who was on the, I'm on the FaceTime team and they, they learned of it
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.200]  going open source when he said it in the keynote and they were like, wait, what?
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.160]  And then they're like quick, like looking at the source code and they're like looking at
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.720]  the source code and like, well, we can't, we, this, we can't open source X, Y, and Z, you know?
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.000]  And yeah, right. It's no surprise that it never actually went open source. And then there was a
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.040]  lawsuit from some troll that had a goofy patent that never should have been granted. That made
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.080]  it even worse. Even without that though, I don't know that it ever would have happened.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:28.640]  I do know, I heard years ago, somebody, there was a rumor a couple of years ago,
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.400]  it was on the Mac daily news website, which when I linked to it, I wrote,
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:40.640]  you know, that site I'm talking about, right? Yeah. And I wrote, cause you know, I like to
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.680]  give credit to writers. I like to say, you know, I don't just say the New York times reports colon,
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:52.720]  here's the block quote. I'll say, you know, Jane Smith reporting for the New York times colon.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.200]  I like to give credit. I think bylines matter, but I Mac daily news has been around forever.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.280]  I think it's been around a lot longer than during fireball, but whoever it is who runs it has always
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.840]  been anonymous. And so I wrote from whoever the hell it is who writes Mac daily news.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.200]  But he apparently had a tipster like two or three years ago say that Apple was going to,
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.880]  right before WWDC was going to announce iMessage for Android. Obviously that was incorrect. It
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:26.560]  didn't pan out, but I don't find it incredible. I find, and I happen to know that they at least
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:34.720]  circulated designs within the company of what iMessage for Android would look like with the
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:43.760]  various designs sort of going on a scale of one to 10 of being the most natively Androidy to the
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:51.760]  most at the other end, the most direct copy of the iMessage app, even if it's not idiomatic, Android
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:59.440]  UI. I know that they circulated that, but whether that means that they were actually close to
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.520]  considering it, or it's just like, you know, this is just a sane thing to do in case the powers
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.560]  that be decide to do it. I don't know how close they ever got to actually doing it. You know,
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:16.880]  the counter argument would be that the cynical argument would be that Apple sees iMessage as
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.040]  platform lock-in. And I actually think, you know, I don't even think you have to be a cynic. There
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:27.280]  is definitely a lock-in angle to this that, you know, and if you switch from iPhone to Android,
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:35.120]  it's not just the superficial green versus blue bubbles thing, although that is a factor for some
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:41.040]  people. But, you know, group chats don't work as well when everybody's not on iMessage.
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.680]  You don't get end-to-end encryption, which is a very strong privacy thing. I mean, you know,
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:53.360]  there's a definite factor there. But I don't think that that really...
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:58.800]  I think that if Apple, in the hypothetical world where Apple does release iMessage for Android,
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:02.960]  I don't think it's going to adversely affect iPhone sales. I really don't. I don't think
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:07.760]  that there's going to be any, even a measurable... Yeah, not in any measurable way.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:14.400]  Yeah, I really think that maybe in, like, our sphere of tech writers, you know,
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:22.320]  there might be some people who do the, you know, write for a site like The Verge, say,
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:27.600]  that isn't really an Apple-focused site, but sort of treats Apple as one of several technology
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:33.040]  companies where there might be some people who maybe have been holding on to an iPhone as their
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:38.880]  primary phone and switch to a Google Pixel or something once there's iMessage for Android.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:43.920]  But I think that the number of people who that qualifies as that is, you know, a tenth of a
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:48.240]  percent rounding error overall. I really don't think it would. And I think that there's an
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:56.400]  argument for Apple doing it on the lines of, like, Apple Pay and Apple Card and sending payments and
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:01.600]  stuff like that, where, you know, they don't really monetize iMessage. There's certainly
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:10.320]  no advertising, thank God, in iMessage. But it's not entirely a loss leader at this point,
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:15.680]  because they do make some money whenever people do send money to each other using Apple Pay
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:21.120]  over iMessage. And so I could see that there might be an argument. That would be, to me,
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:27.200]  the argument inside Apple for doing it, is that the amount of money they can make by skimming a
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:34.000]  tenth of a percent off these credit card and debit card transactions of Apple Pay would more than
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.960]  compensate for the handful of people who might be tempted to switch to Android if only because of
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:50.960]  iMessage. I don't know why I feel differently about FaceTime. I guess it's possible. Maybe
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.840]  you know, and they are sort of, they're different apps, but they're clearly sort of hand in hand
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.160]  in terms of, you know, FaceTime is the video and audio component of iMessage, you know.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.400]  So I would say, I could see it going anyway. I could see, you know, 30 years from now when
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.080]  I'm Mick Jagger's age, and we're still doing the talk show, where there is still no iMessage for
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:19.600]  Android. Or I could see them doing it this fall, you know, as a surprise announcement. I really
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.480]  could see this one going either way. But I wouldn't put too much weight in the idea that
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:27.840]  Apple values the lock-in so much that they wouldn't even consider it. Yeah, I wouldn't
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:33.360]  either. I would think that they wouldn't do it just because it doesn't give them,
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.640]  what does it, I mean, like, I don't, I'm not convinced that that amount of money is worth
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.000]  it to them or that it's that much, I guess. I don't know. Or that they, I mean, but they
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:53.120]  don't know the spreadsheet, so. Yeah. Hmm. What else do we have here? Any other good questions?
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.360]  I'm scrolling down here. I feel like we're getting towards the end. Yeah. Here's a question.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.320]  Ferry Ploger asks, were there any subjects off-limits in your interview with Craig
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:10.320]  and Jaws? Although he spelled it Josh. I'm going to chalk that up to autocorrect. Although you
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.200]  would think if anybody could make sure Jaws gets through autocorrect, it's Greg Jaws.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.440]  Every once in a while, they find an Apple thing that it seems to screw up. I'm always
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:25.520]  surprised when that happens. Right. And even if it does screw up Jaws,
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:31.680]  Jaws himself might not notice because surely 90% of the people he iMessages have him in their
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:38.400]  contacts already. And so it would pick up the correct spelling from there. It's a lot simpler
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.680]  than you might think. There are no, I have never once in all the years, starting with
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:46.880]  Schiller's first appearance on my live show five years ago, whatever that was.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:55.440]  I do talk to Apple PR beforehand. I don't give them my questions beforehand, but I do
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:02.160]  talk about what I want to talk about. Basically, I think for the same reason that on like TV talk
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:08.800]  shows, the producers go through questions with the guests just so that they're ready. I don't
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.160]  want to surprise somebody and not just have them not be ready to answer something. But that's
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:20.400]  different than giving the questions in advance. But I've never been told X, Y, and Z are off
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.760]  limits. Nothing, not even one thing. You know, I would imagine there are certain
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:33.760]  that you're not going to ask, what are this false iPhone's going to look like? You're not
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:41.920]  bothering with stuff that you know that they're not going to answer. That's just like
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:48.000]  trying not to waste time. Exactly, because there's a limited amount of time. I also want it to be
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.320]  entertaining. You mostly asked them about me, right? Yeah, for the most part, especially this
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:02.080]  year. It was mostly about you. That's fine. I'm fine with that. The keyboards were an
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:07.600]  interesting omission this year. I didn't bring up the MacBook keyboards. Part of it, too,
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:14.560]  is that the nature of the live show every year after WWDC is often, and this year was a perfect
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:24.080]  example where there was so much stuff announced at WWDC the day before that officially the show
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:29.040]  is supposed to be an hour long. I think this year's was like 90 minutes. Even going half an
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:35.280]  hour over the allotted time, we still only covered some of the stuff that was announced the day
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:43.760]  before WWDC. What were they going to say about the keyboards? That's the thing. I know what they
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:50.320]  would do. They would repeat the talking points from the two weeks before WWDC when they announced
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:58.960]  the third gen keyboards and the new, quote, material and say that this only affects a
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:03.920]  small number of Mac users. I wouldn't say that would be a waste of time. It was something I
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:10.000]  considered bringing up and might have if there had been less WWDC news, but nobody said to me
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  before the show, don't talk about the keyboards. It never came up. I really think it's more or
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:21.200]  less a mutual trust that they trust that I'm not going to waste their time with questions they
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:29.040]  can't answer, but that I can ask questions that are hard or difficult. I feel like this year's
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.560]  show I did a good job. I hate to pat myself on the back, but I feel like I did a good job.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.560]  Because you have them then, you're more inclined to talk about the stuff that just happened.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:47.520]  And particularly in a year where there's a lot of pretty exciting stuff like this year,
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:56.400]  it just seems... I mean, maybe people want you to stick it to them more.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:00.800]  Yeah, that's what some people want. Some people want me to really, you know, to burn all the
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:07.680]  bridges and... Right. So they'll never come back. Right. Make them really uncomfortable for an hour
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:16.880]  with a bright spotlight on their face. You know, and it's different too than if I were writing a
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:23.040]  feature article and it was like, hey, you get to follow Jaws around for two days and write,
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.480]  you know, like a 5,000 word profile. I would be much more inclined to ask questions like that
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:34.480]  than in a live show where it needs to be entertaining and a bad line of questioning
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:40.080]  that I stick with could take the air out of the room. Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to remember,
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:44.000]  I can't remember exactly what it was, but it seems like if not at this one,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.120]  at least at previous ones, there have been questions that you've asked where they,
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:50.880]  you know, there's a lot of laughter from the audience and they smile and, you know,
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:59.040]  and then give you a pat answer to something that they don't really want to talk about that much.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:05.200]  Right. Very true. That's very true. Mike Fleagle asks, how did the two of you John's meet? I don't
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:11.760]  remember. I really don't remember. Probably Mac. I don't remember exactly either. I remember us
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.800]  having a, having like a drink and a burger or something at one of those, at the, at one of the
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:22.160]  bars down near Moscone. Yeah. That seems like one of the first times. Probably like a Mac.
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:26.320]  We spent any, any amount of time together, just like talking. Probably a Mac world expo.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.480]  Yeah, it was definitely a Mac world expo. Yeah. Cause I didn't go to, I mean, she's a,
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:37.680]  I've only been to one WWDC. I haven't been to many, that's for sure. Yeah. So that was,
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:47.040]  and that was the first, the first Mac world that I went to was 2007, which was quite the one to go
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:54.320]  to. Cause I said, I'm originally sitting next to Glenn Fleishman and after it was over, I said,
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:08:01.840]  after it was over, I said, wow, are they all like this? And they don't, I don't think,
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:09.440]  I can't remember if we, I went and saw you in Syracuse to do, um, the talk show, I guess.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:13.680]  No, it was cable Sasser. Right. Oh, cable. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Cable.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:17.920]  Yeah. It was cable. Yeah. Um, and what's funny was I hadn't met Merlin then I didn't even,
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:24.000]  I don't even know if I knew who Merlin was. And I did a little video like on like some crappy
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.600]  camera that I had. And as I, and I panned the audio, you know, like the people standing around
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:32.960]  watching and I watched like a few years later, I was like, Oh, there's Merlin. I remember that
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:37.760]  standard like five feet away from me. I forget if we were even calling them podcasts at the time,
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:44.160]  but Merlin was doing some short form audio stuff. Yeah. And so he interviewed me and Jason Snell,
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.120]  and this was the day of the keynote and then, but we were over in the expo hall. So, you know,
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  probably be like one o'clock and I think cable and I did our live show that afternoon.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:09:00.960]  That, you know, the very day could just, I just honestly, I've never, I couldn't get hired doing
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:08.480]  drugs than I was thinking about this iPhone. But Merlin did like a five minute interview with me
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.760]  and Jason Snell. I'll have to see if I can find a link to it, but it was amazing because we started
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:19.280]  just talking about the iPhone and within five minutes Snell and I had convinced ourselves that
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.400]  Apple has to do an SDK and there's, they've got to be able to, you know, like we, we just went to,
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.880]  we just like completely predicted the app store. It was absolutely within five minutes. It was like
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:37.280]  five dense minutes of, of really predictions that panned out very well. I have to see if I
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:43.920]  can find this. Yeah. And I care. So I can't remember if we managed to get, if that was
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.400]  when we probably drink probably. Yeah. It seems like maybe we knew each other. We knew each other
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:57.440]  through email before. Yeah. Right. I'm trying to think here. I'm running out of questions.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:04.080]  I thank everybody who asked them here. If I forgot, if I, if I've missed any good questions,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:07.600]  I'll save them up for the next one. We'll probably, I'll probably need to do another Q and A over the
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.040]  summer just to, just to fill, fill our time. Any others that really stick out to you or should we
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:23.520]  wrap this up? No. Yeah. All right. Well, thanks to everybody. Oh, here's, they're all wonderful
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:30.400]  questions. I want to thank everybody for here's, here's a, here's a good one. Just as a
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:35.760]  recommendation. Have you seen the movie, the general magic movie, somebody groots? Oh no,
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:40.000]  I haven't seen that yet. I don't think it's, I think the reason most people haven't seen it is
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.760]  I don't think it's out on video. I actually saw it at a, at a screening here in Philadelphia
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:53.680]  and it's okay. It's well worth watching if you're a fan of what you think the general magic movie
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:11:03.280]  might be like. I don't, you know what I mean? Like if you're a nerd who likes nineties nostalgia,
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.080]  right? It's, it's really great. I don't think my wife would have enjoyed it at all.
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:14.160]  Um, yeah, is what I'm trying to say. Like, uh, it was really interesting. I don't think that
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.640]  the general magic product was, I think the movie sort of oversells how far ahead of the time it
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:27.760]  was. I think they were on the right track, but, uh, I don't think, I think they lost fair and
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.160]  square to the Palm pilot and the same say, I've always thought the same thing about the Newton
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:36.560]  as well as much as I love the Newton and there were parts of it that were brilliant and way
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:41.040]  better than what Palm had. And there were parts of the general magic system that were better than
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.000]  what the Newton and Palm had. I think the one thing Palm got right in hindsight that people
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.640]  seem to overlook is that the thing could fit in your pocket. And it sounds stupid, but the Newton
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:12:01.120]  was too big to fit in a pocket. And so we're the general magic devices. Uh, and duh, right. I mean,
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:08.000]  even the name sense now, even the name Palm was, you know, kept them focused, you know,
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.160]  like where does this device go when you use it? It fits in the Palm of your hand. It's, you know,
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:19.040]  um, and I never owned a general magic device. Uh, I, I think the, I think their user interface
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:24.160]  was a little too cutesy real world where they, they actually took the quote desktop metaphor
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:31.120]  of the Mac and went like, it's not quite skeuomorphism in this sense of textures,
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.960]  cause it was still a black and white screen, but they literally had like a three dimensional desk
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.160]  and the desk had, it looked like a video game more, you know, it was in three dimensions
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:45.200]  and there's a desk and there's a telephone on the desk and you would tap the telephone on the desk
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.720]  to like open up the phone app. And yeah, that was a pretty common sort of thing. Cause that was like
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.840]  Microsoft Bob, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you know, in the general magic one, having been largely
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:01.760]  designed by former Mac team employees at Apple was obviously may more tastefully done than a
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:07.280]  Microsoft Bob. Sure. But just the idea that, Oh, you know, in order for people to understand it,
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.960]  it has to look like, yeah, things that they know. Yeah. Like you're literally playing a video game
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:18.960]  of being in, in an office, but like they, and nothing, I, it's not like leisure shoot Larry
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.920]  were funny things happen. It was literally, you're just calling your dentist to make an appointment
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.760]  and you're opening an actual book to find the dentist number and stuff like that.
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:34.240]  Oh, here's one. We can't go, we can't finish without Gus Mueller's question.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.840]  Molt's prediction of Apple made sex bots has yes to yet to come to fruition. What's up with that?
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:51.040]  Is the project still going on and what's the code name for it? I can't, I'm not allowed to say
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.440]  talk about predictions due to some legal troubles.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:01.920]  I am pretty proud that I, I, I, I, I'm not sure if I'm the first person. But
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:08.080]  I, I feel like I'm probably up there to say the word sex bots on NPR.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:17.280]  Cause I got interviewed, somebody interviewed, somebody from NPR interviewed me after one of
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:21.440]  those, one of those, I don't know if it was that, that one where we met or if it was the one after
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:26.480]  that. I think it was the one after, I think it was the 2008 Mac world called me and interviewed me
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:35.440]  about that. And she called me back later and she said, did you say sex bots? Yeah. Yeah. Robots,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:43.760]  you can have sex. Okay. Thanks. Just wanted to fact check. Right. Cause you don't want to screw
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:49.120]  somebody on that. My editor wanted me to call back. Yeah. You don't want to attribute that
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:52.960]  quote to somebody and have it turn out it wasn't what they actually said. Make sure I know what
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:56.400]  you're talking about here. Right. Although it would make for one of those really funny,
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:59.680]  like corrections of the year and earlier version of this.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:06.080]  See, I always just thought that, you know, if anybody is going to make a robot that you're
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.080]  actually going to want to have sex with, it should be Apple because nobody else is going to do it
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:17.920]  well enough. Nobody else. Can you trust anybody else to keep you private at all? Also privacy,
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:28.080]  also privacy. It all stays on device. Oh God. Oh, John Moltz. It's a pleasure having you on
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:35.840]  as always. Hope you have a good rest of your summer. People can, uh, our mutual pal Dan
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:40.240]  Morin just got married. You were, you were there a lot with a lot of our friends. So congratulations
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:44.880]  to Dan. If you're listening and you've got a, how many podcasts do you have with Dan Morin?
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:49.920]  I have, uh, two podcasts with Dan Morin. I have, uh, the rebound, which we talk about similar
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:55.760]  stuff to this podcast. And then I also have Biff, which we talk about superhero TV shows and movies.
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:58.160]  Yeah. You renamed that one, right? That was used to be called.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:01.440]  Well, it's a, yeah, we shut, well, we finished the, well, we shut down the old one,
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:06.480]  which was, uh, the speedy arrow cast because arrow is ending, uh, this year and, um,
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.400]  started up a new one. Yeah. There you go. But it's the same crew. It's,
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:18.160]  it's me and Dan and guy English. Yeah. Mostly you and Dan last week. Yeah.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:27.360]  Everybody drinks guys had, uh, my thanks to you. My thanks to our sponsors. Let me see
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:34.480]  if I could do them off the top of my head. We had ERO and express VPN and Jamf. Now three
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:41.520]  great sponsors. Uh, my thanks to them. Have a great, uh, have a great rest of your summer, John.
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:17:09.520]  Okay.
