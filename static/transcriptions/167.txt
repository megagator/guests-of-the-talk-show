[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  Oh, I haven't done a show since the event,
[00:02.200 --> 00:04.120]  so we probably ought to talk about the event, really.
[00:04.120 --> 00:04.960]  Start with that.
[00:04.960 --> 00:05.780]  All right.
[00:09.240 --> 00:10.080]  What did you think?
[00:10.080 --> 00:12.360]  I thought it was a really good event.
[00:12.360 --> 00:16.760]  I thought it was a great event up until the end.
[00:16.760 --> 00:18.680]  Even then, you're talking about Sia?
[00:18.680 --> 00:20.020]  Yep.
[00:20.020 --> 00:21.520]  Even then, it wasn't bad.
[00:21.520 --> 00:22.900]  I've seen her before.
[00:22.900 --> 00:23.840]  I saw her on Saturday Night Live.
[00:23.840 --> 00:25.160]  Her music is amazing.
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.600]  I just have to say that the performance made me feel weird.
[00:29.600 --> 00:32.040]  You know what?
[00:32.040 --> 00:36.240]  People misunderstood my comment, because you
[00:36.240 --> 00:44.800]  said during the thing, I miss you, too.
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.480]  And I was sitting just down in front of you,
[00:49.480 --> 00:53.000]  and I started laughing when I saw your comment.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.280]  And she is a talented artist.
[00:56.280 --> 00:57.960]  There is no doubt about that.
[00:57.960 --> 01:00.880]  She's a talented artist.
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.560]  I understand that a lot of people really like her,
[01:05.560 --> 01:13.680]  but it kind of took the whole up of the keynote
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.240]  and brought your way down.
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.400]  It was a weird note to end on, because even if I would have
[01:22.400 --> 01:24.160]  to think, even somebody who's a big Sia fan
[01:24.160 --> 01:30.080]  would have to say that they weren't really upbeat songs.
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.320]  I left to go into the hands-on.
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.120]  And when Tim ended his keynote segment,
[01:36.120 --> 01:39.200]  I thought, all right, is there hands-on?
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.240]  I mean, there usually is.
[01:40.240 --> 01:40.740]  Is there?
[01:40.740 --> 01:41.240]  Is there?
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.060]  And then I was excited.
[01:43.060 --> 01:45.200]  I wanted to get my hands on the products.
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.360]  And then she came out, and I was like, ugh, doo, doo, doo.
[01:50.360 --> 01:51.080]  Wow.
[01:51.080 --> 01:54.240]  If I had a knife, I'd cut my own throat right now.
[01:54.240 --> 01:56.480]  This is so depressing.
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.560]  But I didn't think it was depressing,
[01:59.560 --> 02:03.160]  although the video took place in squalor, right?
[02:03.160 --> 02:05.680]  I don't know.
[02:05.680 --> 02:06.840]  I had to look away before.
[02:06.840 --> 02:08.560]  I was afraid I was going to go jump out
[02:08.560 --> 02:10.760]  in front of a bus or something.
[02:10.760 --> 02:11.840]  I felt overwhelmed.
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.400]  I don't know.
[02:12.400 --> 02:14.600]  It was a bombarded.
[02:14.600 --> 02:15.080]  I don't know.
[02:15.080 --> 02:21.320]  Sometimes it seems like the music side of Apple
[02:21.320 --> 02:23.920]  is just trying too hard.
[02:23.920 --> 02:26.000]  And that's kind of what that seemed.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.160]  I mean, if they ended it with an upbeat artist,
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.200]  and everything was great and cool, then the only people,
[02:34.200 --> 02:36.480]  I looked around, the only people that
[02:36.480 --> 02:44.040]  stood and co-oped for the performance were from Apple.
[02:44.040 --> 02:47.760]  All the reporters, even the ones around me,
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.600]  were sitting there with their jaws open like, what was that?
[02:52.600 --> 02:55.480]  What just happened?
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.640]  I don't expect Apple to pick music from my iTunes library
[03:00.640 --> 03:01.880]  every time.
[03:01.880 --> 03:04.200]  Once in a while would be nice, though.
[03:04.200 --> 03:06.560]  Well, The Foo Fighters was my favorite of all time.
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.120]  That was amazing.
[03:08.120 --> 03:09.480]  I love The Foo Fighters.
[03:09.480 --> 03:11.100]  I don't even like going to concerts.
[03:11.100 --> 03:11.680]  I really don't.
[03:11.680 --> 03:12.720]  My wife does.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.280]  I don't.
[03:13.280 --> 03:15.240]  I find, I don't know, it's too loud.
[03:15.240 --> 03:18.120]  But if you reach a certain threshold, though,
[03:18.120 --> 03:19.000]  then I will go.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.080]  And I love it.
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.840]  I've seen The Foo Fighters many, many times.
[03:21.840 --> 03:24.680]  And not only do I love their recorded studio music,
[03:24.680 --> 03:26.240]  Foo Fighters, I don't know if you've ever seen them live,
[03:26.240 --> 03:27.840]  they are a fantastic live app.
[03:27.840 --> 03:29.680]  I know you saw them live at the Apple event.
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.920]  I saw them at the Apple event.
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.600]  And they were fantastic there.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.600]  And you left feeling really good.
[03:35.600 --> 03:37.640]  I mean, you left that event feeling good.
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.600]  But for years, Apple was not new to having musical acts
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.120]  on their events.
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.200]  That's nothing new.
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.200]  But it was always, here are our great products.
[03:54.200 --> 03:55.720]  And focus on the products.
[03:55.720 --> 03:57.680]  The focus was always on the products.
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.260]  And then at the end, oh, yeah, here's some band from Ireland.
[04:01.260 --> 04:02.720]  Yeah, here's you, too.
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.280]  And sure, it was a big part.
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.320]  It was an exciting thing to have a big band here.
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.720]  Here's The Foo Fighters.
[04:13.720 --> 04:16.200]  But it was never the focus.
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.160]  It was never the focus.
[04:17.160 --> 04:19.520]  The products were always the focus.
[04:19.520 --> 04:22.000]  Well, arguably, the YouTube one, the U2 one,
[04:22.000 --> 04:22.960]  I called them YouTube.
[04:22.960 --> 04:24.400]  Oh, boy.
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.480]  The U2 one was arguably distracting from the products
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.800]  because of the whole pre-album thing and the awkward
[04:33.800 --> 04:37.040]  interaction between Tim Cook and Bono.
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.960]  And the 3-2-1 Countdown were pulling a switch.
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.720]  And it was seemingly under-rehearsed
[04:44.720 --> 04:46.080]  and ill-considered.
[04:46.080 --> 04:47.960]  And it ended up being a distraction
[04:47.960 --> 04:51.480]  because everybody gets the album.
[04:51.480 --> 04:54.900]  But instead of clicking a button to say, hey, I want the album,
[04:54.900 --> 04:59.280]  they just forced it into your iTunes library, which
[04:59.280 --> 05:01.800]  went over like a lead balloon.
[05:01.800 --> 05:04.040]  So arguably, I would say that one was distracting, too.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.320]  But here's the thing for me.
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.780]  It's not like, hey, Apple, you have
[05:06.780 --> 05:09.480]  to pick an artist who I like personally every time
[05:09.480 --> 05:11.920]  because that's never going to happen because different people
[05:11.920 --> 05:13.120]  have different musical tastes.
[05:13.120 --> 05:16.480]  But the previous ones were always just about the music.
[05:16.480 --> 05:19.400]  So here's an example of somebody who I'm not a particular fan of,
[05:19.400 --> 05:22.960]  but I appreciate that he's a super talented musician, John
[05:22.960 --> 05:23.460]  Mayer.
[05:23.460 --> 05:24.540]  Oh, yeah.
[05:24.540 --> 05:28.840]  Now, you're the guitarist, but I think
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.480]  most people consider him one of the best
[05:30.480 --> 05:33.320]  guitarists in the game today.
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.040]  Super talented, good songwriter, has an interesting voice.
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.800]  I'm just not a fan, but when he was there,
[05:38.800 --> 05:40.640]  it was just John Mayer and a guitar
[05:40.640 --> 05:43.240]  and a mic and the music, right?
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.720]  Brilliant.
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.040]  One that I really loved, I forget which year it was,
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.360]  but I think it was Apple Town Hall,
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.840]  was when Elvis Costello played.
[05:50.840 --> 05:52.280]  Yes.
[05:52.280 --> 05:55.400]  And I know it was Town Hall because I
[05:55.400 --> 05:56.480]  have a vivid memory of it.
[05:56.480 --> 05:58.880]  I was like, holy shit, am I close to Elvis Costello.
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.880]  Now, I'm a big Elvis Costello fan.
[06:00.880 --> 06:02.240]  Maybe I'm showing my age.
[06:02.240 --> 06:03.200]  Love the guy.
[06:03.200 --> 06:06.240]  But I think even if you're not an Elvis Costello fan,
[06:06.240 --> 06:08.960]  it's not like him being up there for two or three songs
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.880]  was distracting because it was literally just Elvis Costello,
[06:11.880 --> 06:13.200]  a guitar, and a microphone.
[06:13.200 --> 06:14.560]  And it was really cool.
[06:14.560 --> 06:16.520]  The thing about the Sia show was that it
[06:16.520 --> 06:19.720]  was like this whole production.
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.640]  There's a big video screen, and there's these dancers running
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.440]  around doing weird stuff.
[06:24.440 --> 06:27.920]  Well, that's like WDC, not this year.
[06:27.920 --> 06:30.760]  I don't think it was this year, last year maybe,
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.360]  where they had The Weeknd.
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.360]  It was just weird, lasers and everything going.
[06:36.360 --> 06:37.360]  It was just weird.
[06:37.360 --> 06:38.360]  And that's what I say.
[06:38.360 --> 06:42.480]  It's almost like whoever books these acts,
[06:42.480 --> 06:45.240]  whether it's Jimmy Iovine or whatever,
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.840]  is just trying too hard.
[06:47.840 --> 06:50.280]  I think whoever they pick ought to just be somebody
[06:50.280 --> 06:51.480]  who's focused on the music.
[06:51.480 --> 06:54.560]  And that fits with Apple's message that we love music,
[06:54.560 --> 06:58.440]  whereas the Sia thing is way more than about the music.
[06:58.440 --> 07:01.680]  It really is like an interactive production.
[07:01.680 --> 07:02.280]  I didn't find it.
[07:02.280 --> 07:05.760]  I think you objected to it more than me.
[07:05.760 --> 07:06.600]  It was a weird no-no.
[07:06.600 --> 07:07.400]  I did object to it.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.560]  I don't object to her talent.
[07:11.560 --> 07:16.080]  I never would expect that Apple would have somebody
[07:16.080 --> 07:21.520]  in my iTunes music library, like Ozzy or Metallica
[07:21.520 --> 07:22.080]  or something.
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.720]  I know that that's not going to happen.
[07:23.720 --> 07:25.480]  I can hope.
[07:25.480 --> 07:27.560]  But I know that that's never going to happen.
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.000]  And I get that.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.720]  But somebody like Sia, I think a lot of us,
[07:35.720 --> 07:37.320]  and people that I talked to afterwards,
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.120]  people that saw the thing live and on video,
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.200]  were just saying, what the hell was that?
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.240]  I just, it didn't send a good message to me.
[07:50.480 --> 07:52.480]  What do you think of the opening with Tim Cook
[07:52.480 --> 07:53.320]  and Carpool Karaoke?
[07:53.320 --> 07:54.760]  Hilarious.
[07:54.760 --> 07:56.200]  I thought it was super funny.
[07:56.200 --> 07:56.760]  I liked that.
[07:56.760 --> 07:59.360]  I really liked that a lot.
[07:59.360 --> 08:04.080]  It shows a side of Tim that we don't often get to see.
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.440]  And I thought it was great that they have Carpool Karaoke,
[08:09.440 --> 08:13.120]  and they put Tim in there.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.720]  I could have done without Pharrell.
[08:14.720 --> 08:21.200]  I have zero respect for Pharrell because he's a thief.
[08:21.200 --> 08:23.640]  So I could have done without that.
[08:23.640 --> 08:28.360]  But Tim and James were awesome.
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.080]  Siri, how was Tim Cook?
[08:30.080 --> 08:32.480]  Or what do you think of Tim Cook?
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.400]  Have you heard the back story on Pharrell in that video?
[08:37.400 --> 08:39.960]  That they wanted to do a different song?
[08:39.960 --> 08:41.960]  Yeah.
[08:41.960 --> 08:43.080]  I'm going to tell the story.
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.320]  I don't know where you heard it, but I heard it from the source
[08:45.320 --> 08:46.960]  that I can at least relay it here.
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.440]  So the idea was that they set up this Carpool Karaoke in advance.
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.480]  And one of the songs Tim Cook wanted to do was Happy.
[08:55.480 --> 09:01.480]  And Eovine calls Pharrell, and I think Pharrell
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.120]  was sort of on the fence.
[09:03.120 --> 09:05.960]  And long story short, he was like, all right, well,
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.920]  if the hell we'll do it.
[09:06.920 --> 09:08.840]  And I guess they did it, but then they ended up
[09:08.840 --> 09:10.160]  not even using it in the video.
[09:10.160 --> 09:11.600]  But Pharrell was still there, so they still
[09:11.600 --> 09:12.800]  had Pharrell in the back seat.
[09:12.800 --> 09:14.480]  And then it was weirdly edited because it
[09:14.480 --> 09:16.560]  was like he was there, but then he was.
[09:16.560 --> 09:18.560]  It's like everybody, when they got,
[09:18.560 --> 09:21.200]  the gimmick is the car pulls up to the back of the Bill Graham
[09:21.200 --> 09:24.560]  Center and ostensibly, it's a joke joke,
[09:24.560 --> 09:27.280]  sort of like a Letterman joke, really, Tim Cook gets out
[09:27.280 --> 09:28.240]  and he comes on stage.
[09:28.240 --> 09:30.120]  But Pharrell's not in the cardio war.
[09:30.120 --> 09:31.120]  Where's Pharrell?
[09:31.120 --> 09:33.400]  And I swear to God, everybody, you were there.
[09:33.400 --> 09:34.320]  You were near me.
[09:34.320 --> 09:36.680]  Everybody was like, everybody turned to each other.
[09:36.680 --> 09:38.800]  Everybody noticed it was like, where's Pharrell?
[09:38.800 --> 09:41.920]  Yeah, there were some funny things in there.
[09:41.920 --> 09:45.040]  But I think, overall, it went really well.
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.840]  I mean, Tim, I wish he had to come out with the glasses on.
[09:50.840 --> 09:51.760]  He came out and then.
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.220]  No, I think coming out with them in his hand was the right,
[09:54.220 --> 09:56.760]  it was the right level of in the gag.
[09:56.760 --> 09:59.320]  Because I think you don't want pictures of him wearing
[09:59.320 --> 09:59.880]  those glasses.
[09:59.880 --> 10:02.800]  No, well, OK, yeah, that's probably true.
[10:02.800 --> 10:03.800]  Yeah.
[10:03.800 --> 10:07.080]  See, I wouldn't mind pictures of wearing those glasses.
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.320]  I thought it was really good.
[10:08.320 --> 10:09.920]  And like you said, it really did reveal
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.120]  to me what seemed to be a genuine side of Tim Cook
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.320]  that you often don't get to see because he's so on message.
[10:20.320 --> 10:22.200]  Like, it's not that he's stiff.
[10:22.200 --> 10:23.080]  He's not.
[10:23.080 --> 10:26.640]  But he is calculated, right?
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.240]  And like, for example, I actually saw it
[10:30.240 --> 10:33.760]  on your website today.
[10:33.760 --> 10:35.920]  I don't know if it was you or Dave who linked to it.
[10:35.920 --> 10:37.760]  But it was on Good Morning America,
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.280]  I guess, in a run up to tomorrow's debut of the iPhones
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.360]  and the watch and everything.
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.560]  And was it you or was it Dave who linked to it?
[10:48.560 --> 10:50.760]  And he said, it's all fluff.
[10:50.760 --> 10:52.360]  It's not really anything there.
[10:52.360 --> 10:54.920]  But what do you expect on a six-minute segment in a morning
[10:54.920 --> 10:55.400]  show?
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.480]  But it's like, you can't recommend the video as like,
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.320]  wow, you're really going to learn something?
[11:00.320 --> 11:01.560]  Like, people who listen to this show
[11:01.560 --> 11:02.680]  aren't going to watch it.
[11:02.680 --> 11:04.200]  But it is interesting to watch it.
[11:04.200 --> 11:07.320]  I watched a couple of minutes just to see how on point
[11:07.320 --> 11:08.600]  Tim Cook is, right?
[11:08.600 --> 11:15.320]  Like, he's just unflappable in that type of thing.
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.120]  But he's also very, very, he's ready for any question.
[11:19.120 --> 11:22.040]  But it's not, you know, the carpool karaoke, Tim,
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.840]  was sort of, hey, this is me.
[11:24.840 --> 11:27.560]  This is what I'm like when I'm just goofing around.
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.120]  It was actually Sean who linked to that, which explains
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.000]  the kind of negative comments, because he's just
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.440]  negative about everything.
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.280]  But anyway, it was a good description.
[11:43.280 --> 11:44.880]  It was just all fluff.
[11:44.880 --> 11:47.560]  But it's still interesting to think of it in terms of,
[11:47.560 --> 11:50.320]  this is not his primary job, you know what I mean?
[11:50.320 --> 11:52.000]  He came up as an operations guy.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.600]  I mean, clearly, his primary talent
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.240]  is in the actual executive leadership of the company.
[11:59.240 --> 12:02.080]  The spokesperson stuff does not and never
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.800]  has come naturally to him in the way it did with Steve Jobs.
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.520]  But he's getting so much better at it.
[12:07.520 --> 12:08.640]  Oh, without question.
[12:08.640 --> 12:09.400]  Without question.
[12:09.400 --> 12:12.800]  A lot of being a spokesperson and a lot of Steve's ability
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.320]  is not just being able to talk, but it's
[12:17.320 --> 12:21.560]  where the emphasis on words are and the way
[12:21.560 --> 12:23.520]  that you explain something.
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.200]  And that's huge.
[12:25.200 --> 12:27.520]  It's huge.
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.320]  Steve never would have done carpool karaoke.
[12:29.320 --> 12:32.040]  No, and it would have been funny to see that, but no.
[12:32.040 --> 12:33.280]  No, he wouldn't have done it.
[12:33.280 --> 12:35.800]  Did you see the other video that I posted today?
[12:35.800 --> 12:39.040]  Johnny Ives says, Aluminium.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.520]  Did you watch that?
[12:40.520 --> 12:41.760]  No, I didn't watch it yet.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.600]  Oh my god, you got to watch it.
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.160]  It's the most hilarious thing I have seen.
[12:48.160 --> 12:50.720]  It's great.
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.160]  I was actually, I saw it on the weekend, last weekend.
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.680]  It took me until today to post it, but I was laughing.
[13:01.680 --> 13:05.080]  I was sitting outside by myself watching this, laughing.
[13:05.080 --> 13:05.580]  Yeah.
[13:09.080 --> 13:14.480]  Well, speaking of getting better at speaking on stage,
[13:14.480 --> 13:17.920]  Jeff Williams did the Apple Watch part.
[13:17.920 --> 13:21.360]  And every time he does it, I think
[13:21.360 --> 13:24.240]  I'm going to say the same thing, which is that it is kind
[13:24.240 --> 13:31.680]  of uncanny how Tim Cook-like Jeff Williams is.
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.880]  I like Jeff speaking about it better than, oh,
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.200]  who's the Macromedia guy?
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.960]  Kevin Lynch, software.
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.280]  Kevin Lynch is software, and effectively,
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.480]  Jeff Williams is hardware.
[13:46.480 --> 13:49.640]  I mean, obviously, the design is Johnny Ives and his team.
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.200]  But that Jeff Williams, in addition to his regular duties
[13:53.200 --> 13:55.920]  as chief operating officer, is the point person
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.040]  running the watch.
[13:59.040 --> 14:00.840]  I like Jeff.
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.160]  I mean, Jeff is also in charge of all the health initiatives
[14:05.160 --> 14:06.040]  that they're doing.
[14:06.040 --> 14:07.120]  Yes.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.440]  Research kid and health kid.
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.760]  Or what's the other one in addition to research kid?
[14:13.760 --> 14:15.000]  They have a few of them now.
[14:15.000 --> 14:15.500]  I don't know.
[14:15.500 --> 14:17.120]  Hospital kid.
[14:17.120 --> 14:18.240]  Yeah, something like that.
[14:18.240 --> 14:19.040]  I don't know.
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.240]  But I like Jeff.
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.200]  He's getting much better, too.
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.920]  And then, of course, you have the best of them all, I think,
[14:29.920 --> 14:31.600]  and show her.
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.160]  Well, let's do him an order.
[14:33.160 --> 14:34.520]  All right, all right.
[14:34.520 --> 14:37.840]  But I said with Renee was on my show last episode.
[14:37.840 --> 14:40.320]  I was going to say last week, but it was closer to two weeks
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.520]  ago, but Renee was on.
[14:41.520 --> 14:43.920]  And I was a little skeptical that Jeff Williams would
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.320]  do the watch introduction.
[14:45.320 --> 14:47.280]  And Renee said, no, they're grooming
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.440]  him to do more speaking.
[14:48.440 --> 14:49.480]  He's going to do it.
[14:49.480 --> 14:52.360]  So being right point awarded to Renee Ritchie,
[14:52.360 --> 14:53.680]  it was Jeff Williams who did it.
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.280]  My skepticism about it wasn't that Jeff Williams is not
[14:57.280 --> 15:00.480]  good on stage, but that he's a little droll,
[15:00.480 --> 15:02.080]  or has been in the past.
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.920]  And I think that's OK when you're
[15:04.920 --> 15:11.120]  introducing a software platform for university hospital
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.240]  researchers to conduct large scale medical tests.
[15:16.240 --> 15:20.280]  It's not OK when you're trying to unveil the second generation
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.640]  of the second by revenue in the entire industry watch.
[15:25.640 --> 15:27.960]  That you got to take your game up
[15:27.960 --> 15:31.320]  a little in terms of enthusiasm.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.480]  And he did it, really.
[15:32.480 --> 15:39.480]  I thought that he had a sort of upbeat enthusiasm that
[15:39.480 --> 15:41.800]  was exactly what was called for.
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.440]  And it was his best on stage performance period.
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.440]  I agree wholeheartedly.
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.360]  I think that Jeff is doing much better.
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.680]  Tim is certainly doing a whole lot better.
[15:54.400 --> 15:56.640]  And again, these are not professional spokespeople.
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.360]  These are leading people in the industry
[16:00.360 --> 16:01.680]  at these very specific tasks that
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.560]  are related to their job, who like once or twice a year,
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.280]  all of a sudden have the spotlight of a million suns
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.680]  on them.
[16:10.680 --> 16:13.160]  Did you see the thing like just how many people
[16:13.160 --> 16:16.240]  watch these keynotes that Akamai released a tweet that
[16:16.240 --> 16:18.640]  said that the peak of the Apple event
[16:18.640 --> 16:21.760]  was the highest Akamai's ever had for live video streaming.
[16:21.760 --> 16:25.360]  Akamai did the live video streaming for the Olympics.
[16:25.360 --> 16:27.040]  Now, that doesn't mean more people.
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.000]  That doesn't mean more people watch the Apple event
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.440]  than watch the Olympics, because the Olympics
[16:30.440 --> 16:31.520]  are a two week long event.
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.360]  But that at their peak, there were more people
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.520]  watching simultaneously.
[16:36.520 --> 16:39.240]  So in terms of the actual strain on the Akamai network
[16:39.240 --> 16:42.120]  at any given time, that was the highest they'd ever reached.
[16:42.120 --> 16:43.280]  So think about that.
[16:43.280 --> 16:45.240]  I think about how nervous I get when
[16:45.240 --> 16:47.960]  I go to a conference with 500 people
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.000]  and get on stage and talk.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.600]  Imagine if you're getting on stage,
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.040]  you're not a professional spokesperson or speaker,
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.080]  and you're getting up there in front of the highest peak
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.720]  audience that Akamai has ever handled.
[16:59.720 --> 17:02.120]  There is serious pressure.
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.600]  Keep in mind that with this peak thing,
[17:04.600 --> 17:08.760]  they've also streamed all of Steve Jobs' stuff,
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.240]  iPhone announcements, everything, everything.
[17:11.240 --> 17:12.640]  This is ever.
[17:12.640 --> 17:18.760]  So I think what's happened in the past, and again,
[17:18.760 --> 17:21.720]  this is us, me and you, who would get up there
[17:21.720 --> 17:25.720]  and botch the whole thing if we tried to do it.
[17:25.720 --> 17:28.600]  Again, this is what we get to do.
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.560]  We get to be armchair critics and criticize.
[17:30.560 --> 17:32.600]  I think in the past, somebody like Jeff Williams,
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.560]  and I think we saw the same thing with Tim Cook
[17:34.560 --> 17:37.760]  in the early years, like when Steve Jobs was still around,
[17:37.760 --> 17:40.280]  and Tim would come out and do the, hey,
[17:40.280 --> 17:44.240]  how's the Mac doing segment.
[17:44.240 --> 17:47.920]  That, again, he was never bad, and he was always rehearsed.
[17:47.920 --> 17:50.480]  These are guys who do their homework, right?
[17:50.480 --> 17:52.200]  But I think that the pressure of the moment
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.200]  led them to be a little reserved and focused
[17:56.200 --> 17:58.440]  on not making a mistake.
[17:58.440 --> 18:01.360]  And I think that what you see is as they do it over and over
[18:01.360 --> 18:03.760]  again and they get confident is that they
[18:03.760 --> 18:05.040]  can lighten up a little bit.
[18:05.040 --> 18:07.720]  There's a certain looseness in the body language
[18:07.720 --> 18:10.440]  and in the inflection as the words come out
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.480]  that you certainly see it with Tim Cook now.
[18:13.480 --> 18:19.080]  And I thought this time that Williams leveled up.
[18:19.080 --> 18:22.880]  He leveled up a grade level in terms of his on-stage presence
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.080]  and really did a good job.
[18:24.080 --> 18:26.400]  Well, and let's be honest, the stuff
[18:26.400 --> 18:32.800]  that Williams has announced to date minus this last keynote
[18:32.800 --> 18:35.480]  haven't been the most exciting products, hugely
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.480]  important products, but not the most exciting.
[18:38.480 --> 18:41.800]  So talking about research kit and what hospitals can do
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.520]  and diseases and all of that, wildly important stuff
[18:46.520 --> 18:47.680]  that Apple is doing.
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.000]  But it's not like a new watch or a new phone.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.440]  It's hard to show the exuberance for that kind of stuff.
[18:56.440 --> 18:58.480]  But yes, I agree with you.
[18:58.480 --> 19:01.240]  I mean, he still ran over everything.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.960]  He took us through.
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.240]  And I was impressed.
[19:07.240 --> 19:08.800]  So in the previous ones, Kevin Lynch
[19:08.800 --> 19:10.560]  was the guy who did a lot of it.
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.480]  And it was a little bit more of an emphasis on software.
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.000]  And again, I think it's, wasn't Kevin Lynch at WWDC?
[19:20.000 --> 19:20.800]  I think he was.
[19:20.800 --> 19:23.960]  And in the same way that Craig Federighi was up on WWDC
[19:23.960 --> 19:27.520]  to talk about iOS 10.
[19:27.520 --> 19:32.120]  And there is, I've written about this in response
[19:32.120 --> 19:34.320]  to people talking about the diversity of the people who
[19:34.320 --> 19:36.920]  are on stage, that it matters.
[19:36.920 --> 19:40.800]  But the way it works isn't that Apple just picks people
[19:40.800 --> 19:42.040]  to who's going to do this.
[19:42.040 --> 19:44.000]  Well, let's find someone to talk about this.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.480]  Whoever is up there talking about whatever
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.040]  it is they're talking about has a direct relationship
[19:50.040 --> 19:53.240]  with the actual service or product.
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.240]  It's not like there's a pool of spokespeople who Apple picks out
[19:56.240 --> 19:59.760]  of the company and this one does that and this one does that.
[19:59.760 --> 20:02.440]  Williams is doing the watch because he's directly
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.600]  in charge of the watch.
[20:03.600 --> 20:08.680]  And there's crossover and there certainly
[20:08.680 --> 20:13.120]  are multiple people who could do certain things.
[20:13.120 --> 20:15.920]  It's not like they couldn't have brought Federighi up again
[20:15.920 --> 20:18.640]  to talk about iOS 10.
[20:18.640 --> 20:21.080]  And they could have, like I did the first time they did
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.800]  watch hardware, have Kevin Lynch talk about the software
[20:23.800 --> 20:27.440]  because Kevin Lynch is in charge of the software.
[20:27.440 --> 20:32.760]  But I think it's been a very predictable Apple year in terms
[20:32.760 --> 20:34.680]  of who's on stage for what.
[20:34.680 --> 20:38.760]  At WWDC, it's the second year in a row
[20:38.760 --> 20:41.520]  where Schiller wasn't on stage at WWDC
[20:41.520 --> 20:43.040]  because it was so software focused.
[20:43.040 --> 20:44.320]  And let's let Federighi do it.
[20:44.320 --> 20:46.600]  And Federighi is a really good speaker.
[20:46.600 --> 20:47.760]  He is a really good speaker.
[20:47.760 --> 20:53.080]  But he has that fun side of him.
[20:53.080 --> 20:57.120]  You were talking before about Williams and Tim
[20:57.120 --> 20:58.720]  when they first started.
[20:58.720 --> 21:02.200]  They were not stiff but very conservative.
[21:02.200 --> 21:03.120]  Reserved, right?
[21:03.120 --> 21:04.000]  Reserved, yeah.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.160]  And Federighi is just the opposite of that.
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.240]  He goes out and it's like his hands are going
[21:10.240 --> 21:13.600]  and he's walking around and he's joking.
[21:13.600 --> 21:15.920]  Well, he had an ad lib this year where
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.480]  he was going over the new photo stuff.
[21:17.480 --> 21:19.680]  And one of the photos was like, what was it?
[21:19.680 --> 21:24.880]  It was like a weird group of kids and something.
[21:24.880 --> 21:26.960]  And it was just a very odd photo.
[21:26.960 --> 21:28.960]  And he goes, you know, that's a really odd photo.
[21:28.960 --> 21:31.560]  And everybody laughed.
[21:31.560 --> 21:33.520]  That was a total ad lib.
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.560]  I like it.
[21:34.560 --> 21:38.840]  I like Craig's talks because he does get to the point,
[21:38.840 --> 21:43.640]  but he brings some lightheartedness to it too.
[21:43.640 --> 21:45.800]  And he's become a superstar.
[21:45.800 --> 21:49.680]  I mean, go to WWDC and people are taking pictures of him
[21:49.680 --> 21:52.120]  and it's crazy.
[21:52.120 --> 21:55.240]  They do that more with him than with you.
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.280]  Oh, without question.
[21:56.280 --> 21:58.680]  I've been with you at WWDC.
[21:58.680 --> 22:01.720]  People are pushing me out of the way to take pictures with you.
[22:01.720 --> 22:04.120]  Yeah, it's like the only place where I really get that.
[22:04.120 --> 22:05.320]  And I like it.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.720]  I inflected that poorly.
[22:06.720 --> 22:07.280]  I do enjoy it.
[22:07.280 --> 22:11.920]  But there's a subset of, it's a significant subset
[22:11.920 --> 22:16.160]  at WWDC of people who are like daring fireball fans.
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.040]  You do see a lot of daring fireball t-shirts,
[22:18.040 --> 22:19.600]  which is always a thrill for me.
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.880]  But it's clearly a subset.
[22:20.880 --> 22:22.920]  Whereas I think every single person who's there
[22:22.920 --> 22:24.280]  knows who Craig Federighi is.
[22:24.280 --> 22:26.240]  I mean, because they all watch the keynote.
[22:26.240 --> 22:29.400]  I mean, that's why nobody gets to WWDC by accident.
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.080]  And you can't miss that hair.
[22:31.080 --> 22:31.960]  Right, exactly.
[22:31.960 --> 22:35.480]  He's also a very distinctive looking person.
[22:35.480 --> 22:37.040]  It's not like there's a lot of guys
[22:37.040 --> 22:38.960]  who look like Craig Federighi.
[22:38.960 --> 22:40.880]  Anyway, Apple Watch.
[22:40.880 --> 22:43.760]  I thought that this was an, I'm not surprised.
[22:43.760 --> 22:46.560]  I am not surprised, given the price, given how many I
[22:46.560 --> 22:49.720]  see around on people's wrists.
[22:49.720 --> 22:51.840]  I mean, certainly when you're in San Francisco,
[22:51.840 --> 22:53.760]  God, you see Apple Watches everywhere.
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.000]  Everywhere.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.640]  But even here in Philadelphia, which is not a particularly
[22:58.640 --> 23:01.160]  tech-oriented or cutting edge town,
[23:01.160 --> 23:03.200]  I see an awful, ever since last Christmas,
[23:03.200 --> 23:05.680]  I've really started seeing an awful lot of them.
[23:05.680 --> 23:07.640]  But I thought it was really an eye-opening thing.
[23:07.640 --> 23:10.400]  It was Tim Cook, right before he introduced Jeff Williams,
[23:10.400 --> 23:13.480]  put up a thing that said, here were the top 10 watch companies
[23:13.480 --> 23:16.760]  by revenue in 2014.
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.480]  And here's the list in 2015.
[23:18.480 --> 23:22.880]  And Apple was second on the list only to Rolex.
[23:22.880 --> 23:25.320]  And then he, of course, added, we
[23:25.320 --> 23:27.920]  were only on sale for eight months of the year.
[23:27.920 --> 23:29.000]  Yeah.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  And the other thing that was really interesting
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.640]  about that list, I don't have it handy.
[23:32.640 --> 23:34.480]  I should see if I could get a link to it.
[23:34.480 --> 23:37.320]  But it was really, really interesting to me
[23:37.320 --> 23:42.360]  how that list, from one to 10, jumped back and forth
[23:42.360 --> 23:47.360]  between premium, like, again, Rolex was number one,
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.880]  and mass market.
[23:48.880 --> 23:51.560]  I think number two previously was Fossil.
[23:51.560 --> 23:55.200]  And they got Apple moved them down to three.
[23:55.200 --> 23:58.040]  So right there at one, two was sort
[23:58.040 --> 24:03.160]  of the yin and yang of the watch market, where Rolex is,
[24:03.160 --> 24:05.840]  you're walking, just to walk out of the store with a Rolex,
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.840]  you're talking $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 for stainless steel,
[24:09.840 --> 24:12.720]  not gold, not diamond.
[24:12.720 --> 24:13.960]  That's your base model.
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.600]  And then Fossil, I think you could get a nice Fossil watch
[24:17.600 --> 24:20.600]  for $70 or $80.
[24:20.600 --> 24:23.200]  And the whole list was sort of like that, where there's
[24:23.200 --> 24:27.200]  Omegas that are $6,000, $70,000.
[24:27.200 --> 24:30.000]  I forget, there were some companies that sell $20, $30,000
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.480]  watches, and others that are like Citizen and Seiko,
[24:35.480 --> 24:40.520]  who are mass market $75 to $200 watches.
[24:40.520 --> 24:42.240]  So I thought that was really interesting.
[24:42.240 --> 24:45.760]  And it's interesting to me that the Apple watch sort of
[24:45.760 --> 24:49.400]  straddles those two worlds.
[24:49.400 --> 24:54.080]  Now, you like watches beyond Apple watch.
[24:54.080 --> 24:57.320]  Do you have expensive watches?
[24:57.320 --> 24:58.320]  I have one.
[24:58.320 --> 24:58.880]  OK.
[24:58.880 --> 25:02.600]  And how do you use that?
[25:02.600 --> 25:04.680]  Just like you normally would?
[25:04.680 --> 25:10.720]  Why would you rather the analog than an Apple watch?
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.880]  Because I still like it, and I still think the most important
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.280]  reason that I wear it is just to tell the time.
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.800]  And when I travel, like if I take a vacation,
[25:23.800 --> 25:25.560]  sometimes I take the Apple.
[25:25.560 --> 25:29.320]  I treat the Apple watch as one of several watches that I own.
[25:29.320 --> 25:31.360]  But I primarily just wear it, too.
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.000]  I don't know, though.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.740]  I don't know how it's going to, you know.
[25:37.740 --> 25:42.720]  And I don't love Apple watch that much.
[25:42.720 --> 25:46.120]  There was a period when I first started wearing it where,
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.880]  because it was new, and I was testing it,
[25:47.880 --> 25:50.520]  and I wanted to get to know it, where I wore it every day.
[25:50.520 --> 25:53.200]  And I will say that the fitness tracking stuff,
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.880]  it reinforces wearing it every day
[25:54.880 --> 25:57.200]  because you want to keep streaks going.
[25:57.200 --> 25:58.120]  I mean, you know this.
[25:58.120 --> 26:00.600]  You've written about this as extensively as anybody,
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.080]  that it's literally changed your lifestyle
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.160]  and your physical health.
[26:04.160 --> 26:05.640]  Yeah, it has.
[26:05.640 --> 26:07.280]  And the streak definitely matters.
[26:07.280 --> 26:08.360]  I think the more you get into that,
[26:08.360 --> 26:09.640]  the more you want to wear it all the time.
[26:09.640 --> 26:11.560]  But then once you stop wearing it all the time
[26:11.560 --> 26:13.720]  and the streaks aren't there, it's
[26:13.720 --> 26:20.000]  not as, I don't feel compelled to wear it every day.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.680]  Typically, I'll just say, in rough description,
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.920]  I often wear my Apple watch on weekdays while I work.
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.560]  And it's useful when I'm up, and if I'm just
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.480]  getting up to go get more fizzy water, or go downstairs
[26:33.480 --> 26:37.440]  and pour another cup of coffee, and a notification comes in.
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.240]  I don't even have to have my iPhone with me.
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.800]  I can just look at my wrist and see what it is.
[26:42.800 --> 26:45.240]  When I do go running, it's during the day, obviously.
[26:45.240 --> 26:46.920]  I mean, I guess some people run at night,
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.240]  but I think in the city, it's a little dangerous.
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.560]  But I try to run a couple times a week, so I have my watch.
[26:53.560 --> 26:56.800]  I always wear the watch for that so I get the fitness tracking.
[26:56.800 --> 26:58.680]  But then at night and on weekends,
[26:58.680 --> 27:01.520]  I usually wear just my regular watch,
[27:01.520 --> 27:04.200]  because I don't care about notifications.
[27:04.200 --> 27:05.080]  Really?
[27:05.080 --> 27:06.040]  Yeah.
[27:06.040 --> 27:08.600]  See, I kind of like the notifications,
[27:08.600 --> 27:12.160]  because it means that I can deal with stuff
[27:12.160 --> 27:15.480]  if I need to, and leave it if I don't.
[27:15.480 --> 27:17.960]  On the watch, it's very easy to get a notification.
[27:17.960 --> 27:24.120]  If I get something from Sean, and it says,
[27:24.120 --> 27:27.000]  hey, whenever you get a minute, give me a call,
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.720]  as opposed to if I get something from you,
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.480]  and it says, I need to talk to you right away.
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.760]  OK, well, I can look at my watch and see Sean's and say,
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.200]  oh, I don't need to do anything.
[27:37.200 --> 27:38.960]  I can continue doing what I'm doing.
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.440]  As opposed to picking up the phone and seeing Sean's message
[27:42.440 --> 27:45.560]  and saying, oh, no, OK, I'll call later.
[27:45.560 --> 27:47.360]  And then, oh, here's three emails,
[27:47.360 --> 27:49.480]  and oh, there's something else that's going on.
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.320]  I might as well check Twitter while I'm here.
[27:51.320 --> 27:53.160]  And it's a 20-minute endeavor every time
[27:53.160 --> 27:57.160]  you pick up the phone, whereas my watch is not.
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.560]  You weren't a watch person before, though, right?
[27:59.560 --> 28:00.080]  No.
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.600]  And I've said all along, I said in my watch review
[28:03.600 --> 28:06.880]  this week that I got a lot of things wrong in my first watch
[28:06.880 --> 28:07.720]  review.
[28:07.720 --> 28:09.160]  But I think, conversely, Apple got
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.400]  a lot of things wrong in their first version of how
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.520]  the watch works and what they do.
[28:14.520 --> 28:17.240]  But one of the things I stand behind,
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.240]  and I think I got right right from the start,
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.040]  is that a big chunk of Apple Watch's appeal
[28:24.040 --> 28:27.160]  is aimed towards people who haven't been wearing
[28:27.160 --> 28:29.760]  a watch for years or maybe never wore a watch,
[28:29.760 --> 28:32.000]  and their wrist was wide open, right?
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.520]  Like, you're only going to wear it,
[28:35.520 --> 28:38.440]  like, part of the basic funda- I mean,
[28:38.440 --> 28:40.960]  this sounds super obvious, but you have to think about it.
[28:40.960 --> 28:43.440]  It really, you know, it's true.
[28:43.440 --> 28:45.640]  Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's untrue,
[28:45.640 --> 28:47.400]  is that for anybody to buy an Apple Watch,
[28:47.400 --> 28:51.800]  they need to have a wrist where they're going to put it.
[28:51.800 --> 28:55.080]  And if you've got, like, already wear a watch that you love
[28:55.080 --> 28:57.600]  and you have no interest in stopping to wear,
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.920]  you're not going to buy an Apple Watch, right?
[28:59.920 --> 29:03.520]  It's, you know, this is just a fact.
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.920]  I think a big part of the success of Apple Watch
[29:05.920 --> 29:09.040]  is there were an awful lot of wrists out there
[29:09.040 --> 29:10.760]  that had nothing on them at all.
[29:10.760 --> 29:12.680]  Or maybe they had something like a Fitbit
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.040]  or something like that, instead of a traditional watch.
[29:16.040 --> 29:18.960]  And the value proposition of Apple Watch
[29:18.960 --> 29:21.600]  compared to a fitness band was like,
[29:21.600 --> 29:23.480]  yeah, I'll just take this off, put it in a drawer,
[29:23.480 --> 29:25.340]  and get something that's better.
[29:25.340 --> 29:28.320]  No, you're right, you're right about that.
[29:28.320 --> 29:31.260]  And a couple of other people I know who are watch guys,
[29:31.260 --> 29:35.960]  and I say that deliberately because in my experience,
[29:35.960 --> 29:38.100]  people who are a little bit more interested in watch
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.920]  do tend to be men.
[29:39.920 --> 29:41.280]  And it's not to say that there aren't women
[29:41.280 --> 29:44.120]  who aren't watch collectors, but it's, you know,
[29:44.120 --> 29:46.420]  being quote unquote into watches
[29:46.420 --> 29:48.000]  is overwhelmingly a male thing.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.640]  And I think the reason why is because women
[29:51.640 --> 29:55.240]  have all sorts of options for jewelry.
[29:55.240 --> 29:56.080]  Yes.
[29:56.080 --> 29:59.600]  And for most men and their personal styles,
[29:59.600 --> 30:03.680]  the really only place for jewelry in most men,
[30:03.680 --> 30:06.000]  and certainly the way I dress and, you know,
[30:07.280 --> 30:09.060]  my personal sense of style,
[30:09.060 --> 30:12.480]  the only place where I'm gonna put jewelry is on my wrist.
[30:12.480 --> 30:14.380]  Which is, you know, and I'm not saying anything
[30:14.380 --> 30:16.560]  that a lot of people haven't realized, but that's why.
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.680]  And I think for watch guys, Apple Watch is less appealing
[30:20.680 --> 30:23.640]  than from people who weren't into watches before.
[30:23.640 --> 30:26.520]  Now, the only thing that would make me
[30:26.520 --> 30:30.320]  not wear an Apple Watch at this point
[30:30.320 --> 30:32.840]  is if my father gave me his watch.
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.120]  Because he got that watch from his father.
[30:38.120 --> 30:41.260]  So if I had that, I don't know if I would wear it
[30:41.260 --> 30:42.600]  or what I would do with it.
[30:42.600 --> 30:44.680]  I haven't really thought about that,
[30:44.680 --> 30:47.280]  but that's about the only situation I can think where
[30:48.680 --> 30:50.280]  I would wear something else.
[30:50.280 --> 30:52.720]  I know a couple people who are really into R Racket.
[30:52.720 --> 30:54.240]  You know, computers, they're, you know,
[30:54.240 --> 30:57.080]  however it is they make their paycheck,
[30:57.080 --> 30:58.800]  they're either writing about computers or they're writing
[30:58.800 --> 31:01.760]  code or, you know, they're somehow involved in computers
[31:01.760 --> 31:06.080]  who are into watches and it's always mechanical watches
[31:06.080 --> 31:07.680]  or almost always mechanical watches,
[31:07.680 --> 31:10.240]  meaning watches that don't take a battery,
[31:10.240 --> 31:13.520]  that are completely mechanical devices.
[31:13.520 --> 31:16.700]  And I think there's something to it where
[31:16.700 --> 31:20.240]  if you're doing something computery and electronic all day,
[31:20.240 --> 31:25.240]  there is something appealing about
[31:27.840 --> 31:30.240]  a completely non-electronic device.
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.200]  But that still works algorithmically.
[31:33.200 --> 31:35.800]  Like that's the thing is like when you get into watches,
[31:35.800 --> 31:39.040]  you start learning about the movements and it's, you know,
[31:39.040 --> 31:40.440]  and how the actual watch goes.
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.340]  And you know that it's like, well,
[31:42.340 --> 31:45.560]  if this spring has a certain tension, it'll push this
[31:45.560 --> 31:47.820]  and this gear will turn at a certain rate
[31:47.820 --> 31:49.400]  and that gear will turn at this rate
[31:49.400 --> 31:52.880]  and this thing oscillates and you end up with, you know,
[31:52.880 --> 31:55.480]  a second hand that moves it eight times a second
[31:55.480 --> 31:57.520]  between here and there, which creates the illusion
[31:57.520 --> 32:00.040]  that it's just smoothly sweeping around the hand.
[32:00.040 --> 32:03.040]  You know, if this, then that, it's algorithmic.
[32:03.040 --> 32:05.040]  And I feel like there's an awful lot of people
[32:05.040 --> 32:07.420]  who are like programmers or have a programming type mindset
[32:07.420 --> 32:10.320]  who if they were alive a hundred years ago,
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.700]  they'd be watchmakers.
[32:13.320 --> 32:15.800]  I've had this conversation with Dave Nanian of SuperDuper.
[32:15.800 --> 32:16.640]  Yeah.
[32:16.640 --> 32:17.880]  And Dave is a huge watch guy.
[32:17.880 --> 32:20.880]  He's really, when I first started getting into watches,
[32:20.880 --> 32:23.640]  he taught me, I would say probably 75% of what I know
[32:24.760 --> 32:26.800]  and has some, has really good,
[32:26.800 --> 32:29.440]  has taste that aligns with mine in a lot of ways.
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.360]  And he, you know, he said the same, you know,
[32:33.360 --> 32:35.800]  he's, I probably just ripped off that whole,
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.200]  that whole, I probably just ripped that whole thing off
[32:40.200 --> 32:41.960]  from him, from like a conversation I had with him
[32:41.960 --> 32:43.880]  at like the C4 conference, like 10 years ago
[32:43.880 --> 32:45.240]  when I first started getting into watches,
[32:45.240 --> 32:48.240]  like the correlation between the logic of programming
[32:48.240 --> 32:51.560]  and computers and the exact same type of thinking,
[32:51.560 --> 32:54.660]  but in a completely mechanical, non-electronic sense
[32:54.660 --> 32:55.760]  of mechanical watches.
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.600]  So anyway.
[32:56.600 --> 32:58.800]  Dave's gonna sue you now for taking his idea.
[32:58.800 --> 33:01.120]  Well, go buy SuperDuper.
[33:01.120 --> 33:01.960]  Yeah, there you go.
[33:01.960 --> 33:02.800]  Call it even.
[33:02.800 --> 33:03.620]  Call it even.
[33:03.620 --> 33:04.880]  It's a great disc cloning utility for Mac.
[33:04.880 --> 33:06.560]  If you've never used it, you really ought to look at it.
[33:06.560 --> 33:08.060]  I've been using it since forever.
[33:08.060 --> 33:09.640]  Me too.
[33:09.640 --> 33:10.840]  So hi, Dave.
[33:10.840 --> 33:12.200]  Yeah, anyway, the event.
[33:12.200 --> 33:15.480]  Uh, I don't know.
[33:15.480 --> 33:18.120]  So we left off at Williams.
[33:18.120 --> 33:19.440]  Right.
[33:19.440 --> 33:20.280]  What was next?
[33:20.280 --> 33:22.120]  The watch was there.
[33:22.120 --> 33:23.540]  I thought it was strong.
[33:23.540 --> 33:25.140]  Was it Shiller?
[33:25.140 --> 33:26.680]  Yeah, probably, right?
[33:26.680 --> 33:29.760]  I mean, that's really all there was now that I think,
[33:29.760 --> 33:32.500]  I left my, oh no, here's my notebook.
[33:32.500 --> 33:34.800]  So Apple Watch came out at 1025.
[33:35.680 --> 33:39.260]  Apple Watch Series 2, the Nike stuff,
[33:39.260 --> 33:42.520]  and then 1054 was iPhone.
[33:42.520 --> 33:46.080]  So watch got 30 minutes, and then Shiller was on
[33:46.080 --> 33:49.280]  for 55 minutes talking about the iPhone.
[33:49.280 --> 33:51.340]  I thought Shiller was great, and you already said that,
[33:51.340 --> 33:55.600]  but it was, you know, like almost the canonical
[33:55.600 --> 34:00.600]  Phil Shiller introduces a new iPhone introduction.
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.320]  Shiller is,
[34:05.880 --> 34:08.480]  it's tough to explain Shiller,
[34:08.480 --> 34:12.000]  but you tend to believe Shiller when he's talking.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.440]  You know, unlike some of these,
[34:13.440 --> 34:16.520]  like you were talking about before with spokespeople,
[34:16.520 --> 34:18.080]  Shiller's not a spokesperson.
[34:18.080 --> 34:19.960]  He believes what he's saying.
[34:19.960 --> 34:21.880]  He gets up, he tells you.
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.460]  And one thing, I actually thought this was very interesting,
[34:25.460 --> 34:30.460]  and I think that it happened more this time
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.980]  than with any other Apple keynote.
[34:34.980 --> 34:38.560]  They not only told you what the new features were,
[34:38.560 --> 34:40.720]  they told you why they were important.
[34:41.680 --> 34:43.120]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[34:43.120 --> 34:48.120]  You know, so when Shiller was talking about the camera,
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.280]  and he would say, you know, it's a six layer camera,
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.280]  and it does a billion actions in 25 milliseconds,
[34:57.960 --> 35:00.880]  and you know, all this stuff, that's fine.
[35:00.880 --> 35:02.560]  That's a great thing to say.
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.720]  It's perfect for a keynote that you say all that stuff.
[35:05.720 --> 35:08.060]  But then he stopped and said,
[35:09.140 --> 35:11.360]  and here's what happens during that process.
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.700]  Here are the things that we do,
[35:12.700 --> 35:14.580]  and here's what happens to your picture.
[35:14.580 --> 35:16.880]  And he went through showing the picture
[35:16.880 --> 35:19.520]  during the six layers,
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.360]  and all the things that's going on inside there.
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.120]  And as a, you know, a very poor photographer myself,
[35:28.120 --> 35:30.760]  I look at that and say, oh, okay.
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.760]  So that means that it's gonna be,
[35:32.760 --> 35:35.280]  I'm gonna be able to take better pictures.
[35:35.280 --> 35:37.960]  And I kind of understand why.
[35:37.960 --> 35:39.440]  I think that was important.
[35:40.520 --> 35:41.460]  Here's an interesting fact.
[35:41.460 --> 35:44.880]  I just pecked this out, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[35:44.880 --> 35:47.520]  but this is, and we can talk about this.
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.280]  Actually, I do wanna talk about it.
[35:49.280 --> 35:52.520]  This was the 10th generation iPhone.
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.560]  I'm not counting, iPhones I'm not counting
[35:55.560 --> 35:57.200]  that are sort of half generations
[35:57.200 --> 36:01.900]  are the Verizon iPhone 4, which introduced CDMA.
[36:01.900 --> 36:03.840]  And, and this is why, the bigger reason
[36:03.840 --> 36:07.120]  I think it deserves the half generation designation
[36:07.120 --> 36:10.640]  is it had the different antenna layout
[36:10.640 --> 36:14.920]  that ended up being used by the 4S a year later
[36:14.920 --> 36:16.960]  for all of the iPhone 4Ss.
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.680]  But the Verizon iPhone 4 had the 4S style antenna lines
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.160]  that didn't have the antenna gate attenuation issue
[36:25.160 --> 36:26.240]  of the iPhone 4.
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.600]  I'm not counting the iPhone 5C, which was plastic,
[36:30.600 --> 36:33.520]  but which had the exact same internal specifications
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.720]  as the iPhone 5 the year before.
[36:35.720 --> 36:38.760]  It was literally just the outer casing that was different
[36:38.760 --> 36:40.400]  and the display and everything inside
[36:40.400 --> 36:41.800]  was the same as the iPhone 5.
[36:41.800 --> 36:44.560]  And I'm not counting the iPhone SE,
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.420]  which is of all of those oddball off generation things
[36:48.420 --> 36:52.060]  is the one that perhaps most qualifies as a half generation
[36:52.060 --> 36:55.480]  because it's really, really interesting technology wise.
[36:55.480 --> 36:58.400]  But I'm just talking about flagship top of the line iPhones.
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.400]  The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the 10th iPhones.
[37:02.400 --> 37:06.160]  Of those 10, only three were introduced by Steve Jobs.
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.400]  The original, the 3G, the 3GS was during Jobs'
[37:10.400 --> 37:13.440]  first medical leave and Schiller did it at WWDC.
[37:13.440 --> 37:15.800]  It was still when they were doing them at WWDC.
[37:16.680 --> 37:20.240]  Jobs was back for the iPhone 4, the first retina one in 2010,
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.080]  but then the 2011 was the 4S, which was introduced
[37:24.080 --> 37:29.080]  the sort of somber maudlin town hall.
[37:29.340 --> 37:30.800]  I mean, that's almost stunning.
[37:30.800 --> 37:33.080]  If you think about how many people were at the event
[37:33.080 --> 37:37.640]  last week, I mean, that place was packed.
[37:37.640 --> 37:39.720]  To think that they actually did an iPhone introduction
[37:39.720 --> 37:42.040]  in the 100 person town hall was amazing,
[37:42.040 --> 37:43.360]  but that was the one that was introduced
[37:43.360 --> 37:45.200]  just a few days before Jobs died.
[37:46.800 --> 37:48.360]  I think it was the day before.
[37:48.360 --> 37:49.700]  The day before, yeah.
[37:49.700 --> 37:50.700]  I mean, it was. I think so.
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.600]  And you knew the day, I mean, they obviously,
[37:52.600 --> 37:55.440]  Tim and those guys were close enough that they knew.
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.120]  So out of 10 phones, Schiller's done seven of them,
[38:01.120 --> 38:03.000]  which I think in my mind, it's like,
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.060]  that doesn't sound right to me.
[38:04.060 --> 38:06.160]  It seems like I seem to remember Steve Jobs
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.960]  introducing lots of iPhones, but it's actually not true.
[38:09.960 --> 38:14.800]  That's an interesting piece of research.
[38:14.800 --> 38:15.760]  I didn't know that.
[38:18.140 --> 38:20.600]  I think, and you know, he's always been good at it,
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.520]  but I think this one was as good as ever.
[38:24.680 --> 38:29.000]  Yeah, I just, I enjoy when Phil goes up to talk.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.280]  Maybe it's, you know, he's just no nonsense.
[38:32.280 --> 38:34.320]  He gets up there and he's gonna tell you,
[38:34.320 --> 38:36.840]  and then every once in a while, I loved,
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.180]  I love this line when he was up talking about the phone,
[38:40.180 --> 38:44.600]  and he said, we're introducing another new color.
[38:44.600 --> 38:47.440]  We call it black.
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.440]  I mean, I just wanted to stand up and do the slow clap,
[38:54.160 --> 38:55.580]  you know, like brilliant.
[38:55.580 --> 38:56.960]  That was brilliant, Phil.
[38:56.960 --> 38:59.440]  You know, he had the, he had the pauses.
[38:59.440 --> 39:00.280]  It's black.
[39:00.280 --> 39:01.340]  It's a black iPhone.
[39:01.340 --> 39:04.360]  We call it, you know, is it gonna be matte black?
[39:04.360 --> 39:06.520]  Is it gonna be this fancy color like space gray?
[39:06.520 --> 39:08.080]  Is it gonna be space black?
[39:08.080 --> 39:10.800]  No, we call it black.
[39:10.800 --> 39:11.640]  Brilliant.
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.640]  There's the whole, why did we remove the antenna jack thing?
[39:15.640 --> 39:16.920]  And I'm gonna give you three reasons,
[39:16.920 --> 39:19.040]  but first, courage.
[39:19.040 --> 39:21.200]  That was still, I still see people,
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.080]  even in like their iPhone reviews this week,
[39:24.080 --> 39:24.920]  bringing that up.
[39:24.920 --> 39:29.680]  And I wrote a piece, I'm on board with it.
[39:29.680 --> 39:31.360]  I don't care what anybody says.
[39:32.760 --> 39:36.340]  And I, like the pushback is always,
[39:36.340 --> 39:40.840]  it's on like a sort of moral spectrum
[39:40.840 --> 39:44.160]  that this, you know, Apple is doing this for profit.
[39:44.160 --> 39:45.960]  They're going to make, they're doing it
[39:45.960 --> 39:48.800]  just to make money from AirPods and headphones.
[39:48.800 --> 39:49.640]  That's so stupid.
[39:49.640 --> 39:50.920]  All right, but even if it is,
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.640]  even if, let's just concede the point
[39:52.640 --> 39:54.060]  that it's a money grab, all right?
[39:54.060 --> 39:55.560]  Let's just say for the sake of argument
[39:55.560 --> 39:56.760]  that it is a money grab.
[39:56.760 --> 39:58.760]  It doesn't defeat the point that it takes courage
[39:58.760 --> 40:00.200]  to do something unpopular.
[40:00.200 --> 40:02.400]  That's the, it's like I wrote an article,
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.840]  I thought it was pretty clear,
[40:03.840 --> 40:05.960]  specifically that doing something
[40:05.960 --> 40:07.740]  that you believe to be right,
[40:07.740 --> 40:10.060]  but that you know is going to be unpopular,
[40:10.060 --> 40:12.680]  when there is right at hand
[40:12.680 --> 40:16.680]  a totally non-controversial option in front of you.
[40:16.680 --> 40:19.660]  Like if the new iPhone 7 still had the headphone jack,
[40:19.660 --> 40:20.960]  there would be no outcry.
[40:20.960 --> 40:23.960]  There's nobody, you know, who is going to be outraged
[40:23.960 --> 40:26.520]  that there's still a standard headphone jack, right?
[40:26.520 --> 40:28.560]  It's not controversial choice A
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.400]  versus controversial choice B.
[40:30.400 --> 40:33.140]  It's controversial choice A versus,
[40:34.920 --> 40:37.640]  eh, you know, that's the way it's always been choice B,
[40:37.640 --> 40:38.700]  which is not controversial.
[40:38.700 --> 40:42.080]  And that's why most companies don't make decisions like this
[40:42.080 --> 40:42.920]  before Apple does.
[40:42.920 --> 40:45.760]  That's why Apple was the first to get rid of the CD-ROM
[40:45.760 --> 40:48.160]  or DVD drive in laptops.
[40:48.160 --> 40:48.980]  Yeah.
[40:48.980 --> 40:50.720]  And the floppy disk, you know.
[40:50.720 --> 40:52.440]  Well, you know, everybody says floppy disk
[40:52.440 --> 40:53.360]  and it's a good example.
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.640]  It's a great example, but it's so far in the past.
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.160]  Like the DVD one is fairly recent
[41:00.160 --> 41:02.360]  and the outcry was loud.
[41:02.360 --> 41:03.760]  It was like, well, how the hell am I going to,
[41:03.760 --> 41:06.960]  how the hell am I going to download or install the OS?
[41:06.960 --> 41:07.800]  Yeah.
[41:07.800 --> 41:10.320]  You know, how am I going to install
[41:10.320 --> 41:12.920]  Adobe Studio?
[41:12.920 --> 41:14.480]  You know, it comes on a DVD.
[41:14.480 --> 41:15.320]  It's like, well, guess what?
[41:15.320 --> 41:16.520]  Adobe's got to get their act together
[41:16.520 --> 41:17.600]  and give it to you a different way.
[41:17.600 --> 41:18.440]  And they did.
[41:18.440 --> 41:19.280]  And they do.
[41:19.280 --> 41:22.720]  And nobody, you know, it seems ridiculous now.
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.660]  Can you imagine?
[41:24.560 --> 41:25.700]  I mean, think about how many years it's been
[41:25.700 --> 41:27.820]  since you've had a laptop with a spinning DVD drive.
[41:27.820 --> 41:28.880]  Remember how when you were typing,
[41:28.880 --> 41:30.660]  you could feel it spinning?
[41:30.660 --> 41:31.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:31.720 --> 41:32.800]  And you could hear it.
[41:32.800 --> 41:33.640]  Right.
[41:35.240 --> 41:36.720]  I can't imagine having one now.
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.800]  I don't need one.
[41:37.800 --> 41:39.120]  And you know what?
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.360]  I don't need a headphone jack either.
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.640]  And I had so many people come to me and say,
[41:45.640 --> 41:48.400]  you know, on Twitter or email and say,
[41:48.400 --> 41:53.400]  well, maybe you just don't have a good set of headphones.
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.300]  Well, I have a set, analog set, you know,
[41:58.300 --> 42:02.740]  with the headphone eighth inch thing,
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.680]  a set of FutureSonic's in-ear monitors.
[42:06.680 --> 42:08.060]  They're $800.
[42:08.060 --> 42:11.840]  They're the best monitors on the market, bar none.
[42:11.840 --> 42:14.380]  I don't care if you talk about Ultimate Ears
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.060]  or any of that other stuff.
[42:16.060 --> 42:18.280]  These are the best.
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.280]  The guy that invented in-ear monitors started FutureSonic's.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.640]  So he knows his audio.
[42:26.640 --> 42:28.920]  And you previously used those with your iPhone?
[42:28.920 --> 42:29.760]  Yeah.
[42:29.760 --> 42:32.980]  And I use them to mix music.
[42:32.980 --> 42:34.880]  I use them, so I use them to listen.
[42:34.880 --> 42:35.840]  I use them to mix.
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.520]  I use them for everything because they are the absolute
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.660]  best in-ear monitors that you can get.
[42:42.660 --> 42:43.800]  As a matter of fact,
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.760]  ear monitors is a registered trademark of his.
[42:47.760 --> 42:50.800]  Lots of people use it, but it's his trademark.
[42:50.800 --> 42:53.620]  So this guy knows his audio.
[42:53.620 --> 42:57.860]  And I put on, when I put in the FutureSonic's,
[42:57.860 --> 43:00.140]  I can actually hear things in songs
[43:00.140 --> 43:03.220]  that I can not hear on other headphones.
[43:03.220 --> 43:06.040]  So, it's...
[43:06.040 --> 43:07.120]  You're coming at, in other words,
[43:07.120 --> 43:08.480]  you're coming at this from the perspective
[43:08.480 --> 43:10.280]  of somebody who knows his shit
[43:10.280 --> 43:11.640]  and cares about good headphones.
[43:11.640 --> 43:13.960]  I care about good headphones.
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.320]  And if I didn't, I wouldn't be using FutureSonic's.
[43:17.320 --> 43:18.140]  But I do.
[43:18.140 --> 43:20.320]  So, when people come to me and say,
[43:21.280 --> 43:23.600]  you don't, maybe you don't have a good pair of headphones.
[43:23.600 --> 43:26.140]  If you did, then you would know that this isn't good.
[43:26.140 --> 43:28.040]  Well, I send them a picture of the headphones
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.680]  that I do have from FutureSonic's
[43:29.680 --> 43:31.640]  and they just write back and say, oh.
[43:31.640 --> 43:32.480]  Well, you know, I...
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.320]  What are you doing with them?
[43:33.320 --> 43:34.680]  Are you using the adapter?
[43:34.680 --> 43:36.120]  Yeah, I can use the adapter.
[43:36.120 --> 43:38.000]  It works fine.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.080]  I don't know what the major problem is with these people.
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.560]  And I wrote in my piece, okay, here's your choice.
[43:45.560 --> 43:48.100]  You can have a 100-year-old headphone adapter
[43:48.100 --> 43:53.080]  or you can have image stabilization, a bigger battery,
[43:53.080 --> 43:55.280]  and there was another thing.
[43:55.280 --> 43:56.440]  Which would you rather have?
[43:56.440 --> 43:59.200]  I say ditch the headphone jack.
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.020]  Because most people, you gotta remember
[44:02.020 --> 44:06.080]  that Apple's going for the biggest common denominator here.
[44:06.080 --> 44:08.100]  And for most people, when they say,
[44:08.100 --> 44:09.640]  oh, they're taking out the headphone jack.
[44:09.640 --> 44:11.460]  Oh my God, I'm not gonna be able to listen to music.
[44:11.460 --> 44:15.000]  Oh no, Apple's gonna include a set of headphones.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.080]  Oh, okay, well, fine.
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.040]  And Apple's gonna include an adapter
[44:19.040 --> 44:21.300]  that will let you use your old headphones.
[44:21.300 --> 44:24.100]  Oh, okay, that's fine.
[44:24.100 --> 44:25.760]  People don't care.
[44:25.760 --> 44:27.500]  I wrote earlier,
[44:27.500 --> 44:31.200]  when I read one of my favorite headlines of the year,
[44:31.200 --> 44:32.040]  jack off.
[44:35.340 --> 44:39.900]  Here's what I think Apple both should and will do
[44:39.900 --> 44:43.080]  with what are they gonna put in the box?
[44:43.080 --> 44:45.540]  That was my question heading into this.
[44:45.540 --> 44:48.040]  Let's just accept that the headphone jack is gone.
[44:48.040 --> 44:50.500]  The rumors were so rampant from the supply chain.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.460]  What are they gonna put in the box?
[44:53.460 --> 44:57.160]  And I was hoping they would put wireless headphones
[44:57.160 --> 44:58.060]  in the box.
[44:59.640 --> 45:04.640]  And I didn't think that they would put the adapter,
[45:04.820 --> 45:07.440]  but it was complicated because I said,
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.720]  but I think it makes sense that if they're gonna put
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.000]  wired lightning headphones in the box,
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.440]  which is what they're actually doing,
[45:15.440 --> 45:18.680]  then it makes sense to put the adapter in too.
[45:18.680 --> 45:20.460]  Yeah, because they're saying,
[45:20.460 --> 45:23.240]  by default, what you get are wired headphones
[45:23.240 --> 45:25.360]  and you can use ours, which will plug into lightning,
[45:25.360 --> 45:27.360]  or you can use whatever ones you want
[45:27.360 --> 45:30.280]  that'll plug into this little adapter,
[45:30.280 --> 45:32.400]  and we'll sell the adapters for the lowest price
[45:32.400 --> 45:34.880]  we can possibly get away with selling it for nine bucks.
[45:34.880 --> 45:36.760]  So you can buy a bunch of them in case you lose them
[45:36.760 --> 45:39.200]  or in case you wanna attach them to a couple of pairs.
[45:39.200 --> 45:40.540]  I think that makes total sense.
[45:40.540 --> 45:43.600]  My argument that they wouldn't include the adapter was,
[45:43.600 --> 45:45.480]  I think, I'd have to go back and read the article,
[45:45.480 --> 45:48.200]  is mostly if they include wireless earbuds in the box,
[45:48.200 --> 45:50.000]  then they shouldn't include the adapter
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.780]  because the adapter would be saying,
[45:51.780 --> 45:55.120]  you should be using wired headphones.
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.000]  And it's very clear, very clear for me,
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.840]  that the reason that they're not including
[45:59.840 --> 46:01.880]  wireless headphones is that the AirPods
[46:01.880 --> 46:03.480]  are too expensive to make.
[46:03.480 --> 46:06.160]  They need to be in the box,
[46:06.160 --> 46:10.140]  they need to be like nine, $10 cost of goods.
[46:11.560 --> 46:14.080]  And the AirPods are way, way,
[46:14.080 --> 46:15.840]  let's just hold that, we'll go back to the AirPods
[46:15.840 --> 46:16.880]  later in the show.
[46:16.880 --> 46:18.960]  Let's try to stick to the event, but we'll come to it.
[46:18.960 --> 46:21.680]  But bottom line is they had to do it this way
[46:21.680 --> 46:22.940]  with the AirPods because there's no way
[46:22.940 --> 46:24.480]  they could sell them at that price.
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.600]  I agree, and I said early on that if Apple
[46:27.600 --> 46:32.600]  takes out the headphone jack, they will include an adapter.
[46:32.840 --> 46:34.520]  I was pretty sure that they would
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.080]  because they wouldn't want everybody to be,
[46:38.080 --> 46:39.640]  they're already gonna be screaming enough
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.000]  even though they don't know what they're screaming about,
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  that if they include an adapter, that will just stop it.
[46:48.020 --> 46:52.300]  What misled me was that you can get like $30,
[46:52.300 --> 46:56.160]  some sets of Bluetooth headsets now are only like 30 bucks,
[46:56.160 --> 46:58.680]  and they're just regular old Bluetooth.
[46:58.680 --> 47:00.760]  And that misled me and thought maybe Apple
[47:00.760 --> 47:02.640]  could make their own that are like 30 bucks.
[47:02.640 --> 47:04.520]  But knowing how AirPods work now
[47:04.520 --> 47:07.800]  and that they're both little computers,
[47:07.800 --> 47:09.720]  that literally, I mean, they're not really just headphones,
[47:09.720 --> 47:12.440]  the W1 is like a computing chip.
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.840]  They're little computers that are in your ear,
[47:14.840 --> 47:16.580]  and that is how they do the,
[47:18.160 --> 47:20.400]  both ears are in sync without a wire between them,
[47:20.400 --> 47:23.020]  which is a really, really hard problem to solve.
[47:23.020 --> 47:24.520]  That's why most Bluetooth headphones have
[47:24.520 --> 47:27.400]  some kind of electrical cable between the left and right
[47:27.400 --> 47:29.120]  so that they can keep it in sync.
[47:29.120 --> 47:32.840]  Usually one of them is the little Bluetooth receiver,
[47:32.840 --> 47:34.600]  and there's a wire going under your chin
[47:34.600 --> 47:35.880]  or behind your neck to the other one,
[47:35.880 --> 47:38.600]  and the other one is literally just as dumb
[47:38.600 --> 47:40.620]  of a headphone as any headphone.
[47:42.660 --> 47:44.960]  But they're little computers, and there's no way,
[47:44.960 --> 47:46.400]  they are not little $30 things.
[47:46.400 --> 47:48.000]  Barely, we'll come back to that.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.080]  So I thought Schiller did a great job.
[47:51.080 --> 47:52.480]  I thought the courage thing,
[47:53.380 --> 47:54.840]  I guess it could have been phrased better
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.160]  because it proved so controversial, but I, you know.
[47:58.160 --> 48:00.060]  I think he was absolutely right, though,
[48:00.060 --> 48:02.040]  and for the reasons that you outlined.
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.040]  It did take a lot of courage to do what they did.
[48:05.040 --> 48:07.160]  Whether you agree or disagree with him,
[48:07.160 --> 48:08.880]  I really, here's the main thing,
[48:08.880 --> 48:10.660]  and I think this is all the way back
[48:10.660 --> 48:12.960]  to the first thing you said about Phil on stage,
[48:12.960 --> 48:14.120]  is that he's honest.
[48:15.200 --> 48:16.840]  Whether you think it's right or wrong,
[48:16.840 --> 48:18.440]  that's what Phil Schiller believes.
[48:18.440 --> 48:20.720]  He's not telling you something that's other
[48:20.720 --> 48:23.480]  than what is actually what he thinks.
[48:23.480 --> 48:25.840]  And how can you go wrong with that?
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.240]  Yeah, I just think it was a good thing.
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.840]  All right, let's take a break.
[48:30.840 --> 48:32.520]  Unless you have anything else for the actual
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.040]  what happened on stage.
[48:34.040 --> 48:35.320]  No, I've had my sea of things.
[48:35.320 --> 48:38.760]  Yeah, let's maybe talk hands-on area afterwards,
[48:38.760 --> 48:40.960]  but let me take a break first and just say,
[48:42.640 --> 48:44.140]  I wanna thank our first sponsor,
[48:44.140 --> 48:48.480]  and it is our good friends at Global Delight, you know,
[48:48.480 --> 48:50.720]  these guys, they make the Mac software, boom,
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.120]  a couple other utilities,
[48:53.120 --> 48:55.120]  they've been sponsoring the show lately.
[48:56.160 --> 48:58.380]  This week, they want me to tell you about
[48:58.380 --> 49:02.800]  one of their other utilities called Cap2, C-A-P-T-O.
[49:02.800 --> 49:05.000]  Think it's called Cap2, maybe it's Cap-to.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.120]  You know me, I don't know how to pronounce it.
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.480]  What do you think, Jim, Cap2 or Cap-to?
[49:09.480 --> 49:10.820]  What does it do?
[49:10.820 --> 49:12.600]  It's a screen capture utility.
[49:12.600 --> 49:13.480]  Oh.
[49:13.480 --> 49:14.880]  I'm gonna say Cap2.
[49:14.880 --> 49:15.840]  Cap2, yeah.
[49:15.840 --> 49:18.040]  Yeah, well, you know your Mac is not just a system,
[49:18.040 --> 49:19.960]  you use it for creating designs,
[49:19.960 --> 49:21.960]  you use it for making videos, for blogging, for coding,
[49:21.960 --> 49:24.240]  for teaching, delivering podcasts, making websites,
[49:24.240 --> 49:26.000]  I do a lot of those things.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.120]  Many times, you come across the need of capturing
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.880]  your screen or recording it live,
[49:29.880 --> 49:32.240]  and then editing it to suit your requirements.
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.240]  Cap2 is the screen capture and video editing app for Mac.
[49:37.640 --> 49:40.740]  It is a complete all-in-one solution for screen capture.
[49:40.740 --> 49:43.680]  You use Cap2 to capture an entire screen,
[49:43.680 --> 49:45.140]  or you can just capture just part of it.
[49:45.140 --> 49:48.400]  You can capture just a window, just to draw a rectangle.
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.420]  One click, and then you can record a screen live,
[49:51.420 --> 49:52.600]  and it's in HD.
[49:52.600 --> 49:54.920]  When you're done capturing, you can edit the images
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.580]  and the video without hassle, right there in Cap2.
[49:57.580 --> 50:00.280]  It automatically gets stored in well-organized folders
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.660]  where you can find them easily, manage your projects.
[50:03.660 --> 50:04.800]  Really, really great.
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.960]  So if you're making tutorial videos for YouTube,
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.080]  or stuff in-house, like if you work at a bigger company
[50:12.080 --> 50:13.920]  and you need to make videos to train people
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.920]  and stuff like that, Cap2 is the answer to your needs.
[50:18.920 --> 50:20.440]  Sound like a must-have app for your Mac?
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.440]  Then download the 15-day free trial at Cap2ForMac.com.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.120]  C-A-P-T-O, that's the name of the app,
[50:28.120 --> 50:33.080]  for, F-O-R, Mac, M-A-C,.com.
[50:33.080 --> 50:36.880]  I'm sure you could just Google Cap2 Mac,
[50:36.880 --> 50:38.660]  and you'll get to the same website.
[50:38.660 --> 50:39.600]  Now, here's the best part.
[50:39.600 --> 50:40.800]  No, two best parts.
[50:40.800 --> 50:42.680]  Number one, three best parts.
[50:42.680 --> 50:44.500]  I'm gonna go back to three.
[50:44.500 --> 50:46.000]  Three great things.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.760]  First, like I just said, 15-day free trial.
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.000]  Go there, download it.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.560]  This is the great part of IndyMac software.
[50:52.560 --> 50:53.760]  You don't have to spend any money
[50:53.760 --> 50:55.240]  to get it from the App Store before you do it.
[50:55.240 --> 50:57.740]  Go there, download it, and see for yourself
[50:57.740 --> 50:59.520]  before you spend a nickel.
[50:59.520 --> 51:01.280]  Number two, when you do decide to buy it,
[51:01.280 --> 51:05.360]  remember this coupon code, Fireball, F-I-R-E-B-A-L-L,
[51:05.360 --> 51:09.680]  and you will get 25% off on purchase
[51:09.680 --> 51:14.360]  if you do that before October 15, or on October 15.
[51:14.360 --> 51:16.560]  Don't wait till October 15, though.
[51:16.560 --> 51:17.400]  Do it now.
[51:18.320 --> 51:20.660]  You certainly have the 15 days between now and then to do it,
[51:20.660 --> 51:21.500]  but remember that.
[51:21.500 --> 51:23.920]  Fireball gets you 25% off, so you'll save some bucks.
[51:23.920 --> 51:25.020]  And here's the third thing.
[51:25.020 --> 51:28.360]  These guys at Global Delight do some of the best
[51:28.360 --> 51:30.780]  user interface design work of anybody
[51:30.780 --> 51:32.400]  in the Indy bracket today.
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.980]  So even if you don't want a screen capture utility,
[51:34.980 --> 51:36.360]  go to their website and just take a look
[51:36.360 --> 51:37.180]  at these screenshots.
[51:37.180 --> 51:40.320]  It is a gorgeous app, really gorgeous.
[51:40.320 --> 51:41.960]  They sweat the details and do it right.
[51:41.960 --> 51:46.220]  So my thanks to Global Delight, cap2fromac.com.
[51:46.220 --> 51:47.060]  Sounds cool.
[51:49.380 --> 51:50.340]  Hands-on area.
[51:51.260 --> 51:52.380]  When did you get in?
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.600]  Panzerino and I were way up in the back row
[51:57.600 --> 51:58.720]  of where the press sat.
[51:58.720 --> 52:02.440]  We literally had my back to the second level,
[52:02.440 --> 52:04.740]  and the second level was all Apple people.
[52:04.740 --> 52:07.980]  So I liked my seat because we were dead center stage,
[52:07.980 --> 52:10.640]  but it took us forever to get out.
[52:10.640 --> 52:13.400]  Yeah, I was down in the bottom section.
[52:13.400 --> 52:14.240]  Oh, that's right.
[52:14.240 --> 52:15.060]  I remember where you were sitting.
[52:15.060 --> 52:15.900]  I do remember, yeah.
[52:15.900 --> 52:17.520]  So I get out pretty quick,
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.200]  and I was among the first in there.
[52:22.420 --> 52:24.520]  Yeah, I was really late.
[52:24.520 --> 52:26.220]  Panzerino and I were,
[52:26.220 --> 52:28.580]  and there was a big long hallway that they built.
[52:30.020 --> 52:31.700]  That just blows me away.
[52:31.700 --> 52:36.700]  In addition to building, what they've done two years
[52:37.960 --> 52:40.520]  in a row at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium
[52:40.520 --> 52:42.080]  is build a building in a building.
[52:42.080 --> 52:43.480]  Yeah.
[52:43.480 --> 52:46.840]  And this time they actually built a hallway.
[52:46.840 --> 52:48.980]  I linked to it in my thoughts on the show,
[52:48.980 --> 52:50.440]  and I put a photo I took of it,
[52:50.440 --> 52:53.320]  like a very Kubrickian hallway with white walls,
[52:53.320 --> 52:55.980]  white floors, really nice lighting.
[52:55.980 --> 52:59.240]  That was just there for people like me
[52:59.240 --> 53:00.280]  who weren't gonna, you know,
[53:00.280 --> 53:02.880]  the hands-on area was way too small to let anybody in.
[53:02.880 --> 53:05.080]  So there was a long wait while you had, you know,
[53:05.080 --> 53:07.080]  as people left, they let more in.
[53:07.080 --> 53:08.120]  So they built a hallway
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.520]  so you'd have a nice Apple-like experience
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.320]  while waiting in line.
[53:12.320 --> 53:13.640]  And that's typical Apple.
[53:13.640 --> 53:15.920]  I mean, you know, I mentioned it a couple of times
[53:15.920 --> 53:18.240]  in the reviews that I did
[53:18.240 --> 53:21.880]  that their attention to detail is just outstanding.
[53:23.760 --> 53:25.000]  And that shows it.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.320]  It's things like that.
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.880]  They know that you're gonna be standing there.
[53:27.880 --> 53:29.360]  Well, they're not gonna have you standing there
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.160]  in a concrete, you know, brick hallway.
[53:33.160 --> 53:35.720]  No, they'll build a hallway for you.
[53:35.720 --> 53:37.600]  It's a nicer retail area.
[53:37.600 --> 53:38.800]  I know they weren't selling anything,
[53:38.800 --> 53:41.160]  but it's sort of set up like a retail Apple store.
[53:41.160 --> 53:42.520]  It's a nicer retail area
[53:42.520 --> 53:45.080]  than most actual stores for most companies.
[53:45.080 --> 53:45.920]  Yeah.
[53:45.920 --> 53:49.680]  And it was there for two hours.
[53:49.680 --> 53:50.920]  Yeah, for a couple hours
[53:50.920 --> 53:53.520]  so that we could walk through and look at the products.
[53:53.520 --> 53:58.200]  And there's a lot of Apple employees there, you know,
[53:58.200 --> 54:02.000]  that are there to help and talk to you about things.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.320]  And it's great.
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.880]  I love having a great hands-on area.
[54:08.880 --> 54:13.160]  I don't understand the people who go in and out.
[54:13.160 --> 54:15.240]  There's some of the people, you know,
[54:15.240 --> 54:16.680]  I'm not gonna name names,
[54:16.680 --> 54:19.920]  but there are some people who are, you know,
[54:19.920 --> 54:21.440]  in the same racket as us,
[54:21.440 --> 54:23.800]  who if they get in early, they quick look at everything.
[54:23.800 --> 54:25.040]  Maybe they snap a few photos,
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.960]  but it's like they have somewhere to go
[54:28.960 --> 54:31.160]  and they're like out.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.040]  I don't get it.
[54:32.040 --> 54:34.400]  I mean, I'm not necessarily the last guy left in there,
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.320]  although I have been in some events.
[54:36.320 --> 54:39.280]  I remember with the original iPad,
[54:39.280 --> 54:41.600]  the first iPad, Dan Morin and I got our hands.
[54:41.600 --> 54:43.600]  Remember there was a dock with a keyboard?
[54:43.600 --> 54:44.520]  Yeah.
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.720]  It's like they kind of, with the smart keyboard,
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.080]  have circled back to that original idea
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.480]  that maybe there should be a keyboard with the iPad.
[54:53.480 --> 54:55.760]  And Dan Morin and I were just playing with this thing.
[54:55.760 --> 54:57.840]  We're like figuring out which keyboard shortcuts were.
[54:57.840 --> 54:59.760]  Then when they, somebody came up and they were so nice
[54:59.760 --> 55:01.920]  and they're like, guys, you know, we're trying to close.
[55:01.920 --> 55:04.080]  And we look around and there's nobody else
[55:04.080 --> 55:06.200]  except Apple boys in the hands-on area.
[55:06.200 --> 55:07.040]  Yeah.
[55:07.040 --> 55:07.880]  Well.
[55:07.880 --> 55:09.640]  So I'm not always the last, but I stay until they start,
[55:09.640 --> 55:12.200]  at least until they start gently suggesting
[55:12.200 --> 55:15.000]  that people leave, because you can learn so much.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.680]  It's not like the people who man,
[55:16.680 --> 55:19.600]  the Apple people who man the hands-on tables are,
[55:20.520 --> 55:21.640]  they're some of the, you know,
[55:21.640 --> 55:22.880]  they're from all over the company.
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.760]  That's one of the things I think some people don't realize
[55:24.760 --> 55:26.680]  is they're not just like product marketing people.
[55:26.680 --> 55:29.720]  Like there's, you know, people from the app store,
[55:30.760 --> 55:33.560]  you know, just people who are good people people, right?
[55:33.560 --> 55:35.920]  People who are good at answering questions
[55:35.920 --> 55:38.120]  and being personable, but they come from all over
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.520]  the company and you can, you know, make contacts,
[55:40.520 --> 55:43.320]  you know, and learn, you know,
[55:43.320 --> 55:44.760]  meet interesting people from Apple.
[55:44.760 --> 55:46.320]  How often do we get a chance to do that?
[55:46.320 --> 55:47.160]  Not often.
[55:47.160 --> 55:48.440]  Not often.
[55:48.440 --> 55:49.280]  No.
[55:49.280 --> 55:50.120]  And you're right.
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.040]  There are a lot of interesting people there.
[55:52.040 --> 55:55.320]  And I always see a lot of friends there,
[55:55.320 --> 55:57.640]  you know, from Apple.
[55:57.640 --> 55:59.560]  And it's great.
[55:59.560 --> 56:04.560]  I go in and I try and take as many decent pictures
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.400]  as I can, but, you know, I agree with you that
[56:12.280 --> 56:14.480]  staying around and being able to use the products
[56:14.480 --> 56:17.560]  and, you know, once a lot of the people leave,
[56:17.560 --> 56:19.760]  once they're done with their photos and everything,
[56:19.760 --> 56:22.480]  there's actually some room in there.
[56:22.480 --> 56:24.080]  You know, you can walk around.
[56:24.080 --> 56:24.920]  Yeah.
[56:24.920 --> 56:28.440]  And you do get a better sense of the products
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.040]  because now you can finally stand there and use them.
[56:32.280 --> 56:35.080]  The one I think is funny is Rennie, Richie.
[56:35.080 --> 56:36.680]  I mean, he'll stay to the bitter end.
[56:36.680 --> 56:39.640]  He'll hide so that they have to find him and kick him out
[56:39.640 --> 56:41.840]  because he's doing videos and he's doing,
[56:41.840 --> 56:43.120]  and Rennie is funny.
[56:43.120 --> 56:44.800]  Yeah, he checks in like it's a hotel.
[56:44.800 --> 56:46.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:46.120 --> 56:49.840]  I texted him the last time, the last event,
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.320]  and I said, you know, it was probably 3.30 in the afternoon.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.440]  And I said, do you want to grab a coffee?
[56:55.440 --> 56:57.280]  And he said, I'm still in hands-on.
[56:57.280 --> 57:00.960]  I said, geez, Ray, I mean, come on.
[57:00.960 --> 57:01.800]  It was funny.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.680]  I will say over time, the hands-on areas have evolved
[57:06.680 --> 57:10.300]  and it is the changing nature, you know,
[57:10.300 --> 57:11.720]  Daring Fireball is still the same
[57:11.720 --> 57:12.840]  and there aren't any photos there,
[57:12.840 --> 57:15.520]  but the changing nature and obsession
[57:15.520 --> 57:18.300]  with these videos and especially the videos,
[57:18.300 --> 57:21.080]  but the photos have really changed the nature
[57:21.080 --> 57:21.960]  of the hands-on area.
[57:21.960 --> 57:24.280]  And it's unfortunate because it's worse.
[57:24.280 --> 57:27.800]  It's so many people want to get photos
[57:27.800 --> 57:30.520]  and they want their photos to be like,
[57:30.520 --> 57:33.460]  you know, high, you know, really, really nice.
[57:33.460 --> 57:34.300]  You can't do it.
[57:34.300 --> 57:36.040]  So when they finally get a chance to like,
[57:36.040 --> 57:37.660]  you know, you wait around and you know,
[57:37.660 --> 57:40.920]  like, let's say I want to try the new jet black.
[57:40.920 --> 57:43.440]  I want to get my hands on the jet black iPhone
[57:43.440 --> 57:44.520]  and you wait and you wait.
[57:44.520 --> 57:45.840]  You know, somebody's in front of you and they're taking
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.880]  a tour and the product guy or woman from Apple is there.
[57:49.880 --> 57:52.280]  And they have, you know, they're prepared with like,
[57:52.280 --> 57:53.360]  you know, three or four things.
[57:53.360 --> 57:54.200]  Like, what do you want to see?
[57:54.200 --> 57:55.040]  Do you want to see photos?
[57:55.040 --> 57:56.720]  You know, you know, here, take a look.
[57:56.720 --> 57:58.540]  You know, one of the things they did in the hands-on area
[57:58.540 --> 58:02.160]  for everybody was show you photos because
[58:02.160 --> 58:04.140]  on the iPhone screen, you could see the photos
[58:04.140 --> 58:07.280]  with a high color gamut, which was a fame, you know,
[58:07.280 --> 58:09.320]  they emphasize three or four times in the event.
[58:09.320 --> 58:11.380]  This kind of sucks because our projector here
[58:11.380 --> 58:14.040]  isn't high color gamut, you know.
[58:14.040 --> 58:16.960]  So what we're showing you here is not representative
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.860]  of the photos you can take and what you'll see on screen
[58:19.860 --> 58:22.520]  on this iPhone because, you know, you can't show
[58:22.520 --> 58:26.360]  a high color gamut with a non high color gamut projector.
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.000]  So they wanted to show that to people, you know,
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.800]  and they're prepared with a couple of things like that.
[58:29.800 --> 58:31.760]  And then, you know, you say thank you, you know,
[58:31.760 --> 58:34.580]  I say thanks and then, you know, step aside
[58:34.580 --> 58:36.480]  so that the next person can, you know,
[58:36.480 --> 58:38.400]  can get the same demo and then in the meantime,
[58:38.400 --> 58:41.160]  they wipe the, you know, wipe it off with a white cloth.
[58:41.160 --> 58:42.680]  When the photo people get there,
[58:42.680 --> 58:44.560]  it's like they want the phone and they don't even want
[58:44.560 --> 58:46.520]  the product tour, they're not even like listening
[58:46.520 --> 58:49.540]  to the things, they're just trying to set the thing up
[58:49.540 --> 58:52.620]  so they can take photos, which are exactly like the photos
[58:52.620 --> 58:56.240]  being taken by 100 other different people who are there,
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.800]  none of which are gonna be better than the photos
[58:58.800 --> 59:02.000]  that Apple's product marketing team has already taken
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.440]  and made available to everybody in the press.
[59:04.440 --> 59:05.720]  Yep, it's true.
[59:05.720 --> 59:08.720]  And then the worst part to me is the video people.
[59:08.720 --> 59:10.480]  I think I've mentioned this in years past,
[59:10.480 --> 59:12.560]  or last year or whatever, but it's getting worse
[59:12.560 --> 59:15.240]  because the video people want to,
[59:15.240 --> 59:17.480]  it's a two-man, two-person team
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.560]  where there's a camera person and then the talent,
[59:21.560 --> 59:26.000]  quote unquote, and the videographers want to get
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.200]  as far away, you know, they wanna get a couple feet behind
[59:29.200 --> 59:31.400]  but they, you're at the table.
[59:31.400 --> 59:32.600]  How many times did you get bumped into?
[59:32.600 --> 59:35.160]  I got bumped into at least three times.
[59:35.160 --> 59:37.000]  It's not just that you get bumped into,
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.800]  it's that they will push you out of the way.
[59:38.800 --> 59:43.800]  Yeah, and you and I, especially you,
[59:43.800 --> 59:47.760]  let's just face it, you don't look like someone,
[59:47.760 --> 59:49.560]  I mean, you know, you don't look like someone
[59:49.560 --> 59:50.400]  you wanna push.
[59:50.400 --> 59:54.400]  I'm, well, the, the, I don't look,
[59:54.400 --> 59:56.860]  I don't look tough, let's face it,
[59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.440]  but I am 6'2 and 200 pounds, you know what I mean?
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.360]  I won't move, and now I've stopped
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.240]  because like you said, there's so many of them
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.960]  that are jostling and trying to push you out of the way
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.880]  and things like that, that there was one guy there
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.360]  this time from PCMag, he was doing a live,
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.920]  maybe a periscope or something.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.300]  He was screaming, he was screaming,
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.400]  and I was standing there at the table trying
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.380]  to get a product, a demo from the person.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:35.960]  This guy was right beside us yelling into his phone
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.900]  and so I started saying, you know,
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.760]  when I was standing there,
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.740]  because the guy couldn't give me the demo,
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.680]  he was yelling so loud, I started saying,
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.280]  like since I was right next to him,
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.520]  why is this guy screaming into his phone so loud?
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.240]  Why are you screaming into your phone so loud?
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240]  Why is this guy doing that?
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.080]  Why are you screaming?
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.920]  And so I just kept talking over him
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.240]  and finally he stopped and went away
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.120]  and then I could have my product demo.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.480]  But yeah, it's, I mean, this is nothing that Apple is doing.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.720]  This is how things have changed for us.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.600]  Apple tried to stem, you know,
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.320]  tried to dam the creek for a while
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.000]  because for years, they only let you shoot video
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  in designated areas, in the hands-on areas.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.320]  Like, if you remember, like when there were hands-on areas
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.320]  in Moscone, like when they would do the iPhones at WWDC
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.040]  and then there was, that was when they had a huge area,
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.440]  because Moscone is huge, right?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.560]  Off to the side, in what's the hallway of Moscone
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.600]  is where they would have the hands-on areas.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.160]  And it was really, I mean, like, expansive.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.600]  It was, you know, like in a ballroom,
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.160]  more than, you know, a cramped area.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.340]  But they would make the video people go off to the side.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.760]  They weren't allowed to shoot video near the tables, right?
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.320]  There'd be like black curtains and some lighting
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.800]  over to the side where they could shoot their video stuff.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.200]  But I think that it's too many people, you know,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.240]  if they tried to enforce that now,
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.440]  they would just spend all of their time telling people
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.840]  you've got to shoot, you know, it would never stop.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.680]  I've spoken to them.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.800]  They designed the hands-on tables now
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.400]  with way more space between them
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.560]  than is actually necessary or feels natural,
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.680]  specifically to accommodate the video people.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.480]  But even so, you still get bumped into.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.960]  You still do, well, right?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.400]  It's because they just take up more and more room
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.440]  all the time.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.800]  They used to space them either exactly or very close
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.720]  to the space between them in an Apple retail store.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.340]  But now it's way more spaced apart
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.440]  than in an Apple retail store
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.200]  because of these video guys.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.920]  All right, I gotta tell you this.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.840]  I'm just gonna keep bumping them back.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.400]  Before, I wanted to get, I almost forgot this story.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.920]  The last thing about the event was my seat.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.040]  I was sitting next to, it was hard to get a seat.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.740]  We were among the last people to get seats.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.760]  It was me and Jason Snell and Christina Warren,
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.080]  who were, the three of us were trying to get seats together.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.000]  And we found them up in this top row in the center,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.960]  but no three of the seats were adjacent.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.920]  So we gave Christina the first one.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.320]  And then we saw Horace Dedue, and he had two seats open,
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.680]  one on his left, one on his right.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.680]  And so Jason took the one and I took the other.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.840]  And that's who I was sitting next to in the event.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.200]  On my right was this guy.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.680]  I don't know who he is, but I was wearing a backpack.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.040]  And I had coffee in my one hand.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.300]  But because we had the last row,
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.520]  there was a shelf above my seat.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.100]  That was the layer between our layer and the upper layer.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.940]  So I thought, hey, that's a good place to put my drink
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.840]  while I unpack and get this.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.920]  Because then it won't be on the floor
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.200]  and I won't kick it over.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.120]  And I turn around.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.620]  And I will admit, when I wear a backpack,
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.320]  I often bump into things.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320]  I have a bad sense of the 3D space
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.520]  my backpack takes behind me.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.520]  And apparently, I bumped into the wide-brimmed fedora
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.120]  of the gentleman sitting next to me.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.680]  Oh, dear.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.720]  And he said, hey, bro, you bumped my hat.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.440]  And my first thought was to be apologetic.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.580]  I'm a nice guy.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.980]  But the way he said it,
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.460]  I had a moment where I almost said,
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:18.700]  well, I am sorry, but on the other hand,
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.360]  you could act like a normal gentleman
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.100]  and remove your hat and doors.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:22.940]  But I didn't.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.240]  I didn't say it.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.200]  This son of a bitch spent the whole event,
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.240]  I mean the whole two hours of the event,
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.200]  Instagram videoing what was going on on stage
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.240]  and mumbling into his microphone.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.080]  Oh.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.040]  Oh.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.480]  Now, he wasn't talking.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.440]  He was whispering into his microphone.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.560]  But I was sitting right next to him.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.560]  And it was, I don't know if it was French-accented English
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.920]  or French, any other, the other thing, too,
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.000]  is he purposefully shot all of his video
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.440]  with his iPhone at a 45-degree angle.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:07.440]  So that everything looked like the bad guy layers
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.580]  in the old Batman TV show.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.640]  And he's like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.600]  And I came close a couple times to being like,
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]  you gotta stop.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.200]  And it was like every time it seemed like
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.940]  I was gonna have to say something,
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.500]  it seemed like he dialed it back
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.520]  and all of a sudden five minutes would go by
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.440]  and he wasn't shooting an Instagram video.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.840]  But then he'd do it again.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.880]  And it's like.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.380]  Yeah, that drives me crazy.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.440]  There were people behind me.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.320]  I was at the last row in the bottom section.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.440]  There were people right behind me
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.240]  at the start of the second section
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.520]  that were talking throughout the keynote.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.440]  And a couple of times I turned around
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.200]  and gave them a dirty look.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:56.200]  Like, I'm here to listen to Tim and Phil, not you.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.340]  Shut up.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.560]  I can't, I mean, why was the guy even there?
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.880]  I mean, and people could, anybody who wanted to watch,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.600]  there's a live stream, you know what I mean?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.440]  Right.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.280]  I didn't get it.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.100]  It was really, really.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.940]  I don't get it.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:10.560]  But people, I go to the keynote to watch them.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.000]  And Apple does a good job of making sure
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.220]  that they put on a great show
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.280]  and that we have hands-on areas.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.360]  And then these morons come in,
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.600]  and they talk through a keynote.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.520]  Why would you talk through a keynote?
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.800]  Oh, you know the last one that,
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.360]  I think it was at town hall,
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.560]  the last event that was at town hall,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.200]  there was a guy from a reporter from China
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.320]  that talked the entire way through the keynote.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.160]  Right, because he was translating for his audience.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.660]  He was translating the keynote over the phone live.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.600]  They gotta, that's not where you,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.320]  if you're gonna do that, watch the video
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.000]  and go into a room and load up the video
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.840]  and do it from the video. Oh my God,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.680]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.680]  I nearly lost my mind.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.520]  Right.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.580]  And he was right behind me.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.720]  And so at the end of the keynote,
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.040]  when I get up, I took his picture and tweeted it
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.060]  and said what a moron he was.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.560]  I don't get, why did,
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.560]  it's like I tweeted this afternoon,
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.280]  I said, there's so much stupid shit written about Apple
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.680]  whenever they release new products.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.600]  Why is it that these people that go to these keynotes
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.520]  are so dumb?
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.040]  They're dumb.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.400]  They talk through the keynote.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.800]  They push us out of the way so that they can get their,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.420]  do their video thing.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:31.000]  They scream into their phones for Periscope.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.040]  It's just, it's dumb.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.780]  Did you get the impression that there were a lot more people
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.320]  from Asia who were there for this keynote
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.440]  in terms of like, hey, who got a seat
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.680]  and who didn't, which is always inside baseball
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.600]  in our racket, who gets invited and who doesn't is there.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.840]  And it seemed like invitations,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.740]  even though the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is huge,
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.360]  the press seating area was only on the lower level
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.680]  and only on the one side.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.780]  Right.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.600]  And the whole central stage front section
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.820]  is all VIP seating for Apple and their friends.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.480]  So there weren't that many press seats.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.540]  And it really seemed to me like the reason
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.660]  that even though it's such a huge auditorium
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.440]  that press invitations seem to be somewhat tight
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.160]  is that there were so many people from Asia press.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.120]  And I don't know who's press, who's analyst,
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.280]  but it's just unbelievable.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.480]  And it's part of that they used to have like simulcasts
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.920]  in Asia and they don't do it anymore.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.760]  Instead, they invite them to come to California
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.700]  and be there live.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.460]  It's just, it really seemed like more than ever before.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.960]  Well, the whole section where I was
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.400]  was basically Asia except for Walt Mossberg, Renee and me.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.560]  Yeah, and Matt Honan was there, right?
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.740]  Oh, was he down there too?
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.640]  Yeah, he was like right on the aisle,
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.440]  like had like the leftmost seat.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.680]  Oh, I see, yeah, I didn't see Matt.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.920]  I saw him outside and you know.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.220]  Well, anyway, let's take a break
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.720]  and let me thank our second sponsor,
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.080]  it's our good friends, really good friends of the show.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  Big, strong supporters of the show, Casper.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.880]  Casper makes obsessively engineered mattresses
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.200]  at shockingly fair prices.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.880]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.240]  and use that code, the talk show
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.140]  and you'll save 50 bucks toward your mattress.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.920]  Now you've heard me talk about mattress before,
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.560]  or Casper before.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.720]  Casper has an in-house team of engineers, really.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.560]  I mean, you think about it,
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.920]  everything needs to be engineered.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.080]  They spent thousands of collective hours
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.320]  developing the Casper mattress.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.140]  You don't go there.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.240]  This is my favorite thing about them
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.440]  because this is the type of decision
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.640]  that just paralyzes me.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.440]  You don't go there and pick between six different types
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.440]  of springiness or foam or memory foam and all this stuff.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.140]  They make one type of mattress.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.720]  It's got just the right balance
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.100]  between springy latex foam and supportive memory foam
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.120]  for a sleep surface with just the right sink
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.560]  and just the right bounce.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.840]  And it's a breathable design.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.560]  So it's not just comfortable and soft
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.480]  and has the right balance,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.920]  but it's a breathable design that sleeps cool
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.360]  to regulate your temperature through the night.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.920]  I love to sleep.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.120]  I sleep as long and as often as I can.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.640]  Sleeping, to me, is one of the great joys of life
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.160]  and having a good mattress makes it even better.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.220]  If you're at home and you go to a hotel
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.440]  and you're ever in a nice hotel
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.800]  and you say, wow, that's a great mattress, I love that.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.720]  You know what, why don't you get a great mattress
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.080]  and have it in your house?
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.760]  If you go to a hotel and find,
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.160]  and I've had this happen,
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.160]  because I used to just use a mattress forever.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.280]  You gotta think about it.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.360]  Your mattress wears out over time, it really does.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.880]  And if you ever have that experience
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.440]  when you go to a hotel or something like that
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.040]  and you're like, wow, this is a great mattress.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.840]  This feels way better than my mattress at home.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.260]  Well, why not get one for home
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.440]  where you are 350 nights a year?
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.080]  Casper has it great.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.360]  Now, in addition to the fact that it's a great mattress,
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.420]  their prices are amazing
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.800]  because they cut out all the middlemen.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.600]  They make them right here in the USA
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.040]  and then they ship them right to you, right in a little box.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.120]  And then you open it up and it fills up with oxygen
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.260]  and becomes a full-size bed.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.840]  Here's their prices, $500 for twin, 600 twin XL,
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.040]  750 for a full, 850 for a queen,
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.420]  and just 950 bucks for a king.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.440]  Most mattresses, you know, you go to a mattress store,
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.920]  you spend like $20,000 on a king.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.780]  I don't know, but you spend a lot more than 950.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.520]  Now, one more thing, I hope you haven't skipped ahead.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.800]  I hope you're listening because they have
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.520]  an amazing new product.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.920]  It's a dog mattress.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.240]  They're making dog mattresses at Casper now.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.480]  They've put just as much attention to them
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.200]  as their people mattresses.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.240]  And they've got removable covers that you can wash
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.600]  and they got like a zipper that just tucks away.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.960]  Your dog deserves a good night's sleep too,
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.760]  probably more than you do.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.880]  So go there and check this out.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.720]  It is amazing.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.240]  They have the best dog mattresses you're ever gonna find.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.920]  Casper.com slash the talk show.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.160]  And remember that code, the talk show,
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.920]  you'll save 50 bucks towards your first mattress,
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.560]  whether it's for you or whether it's for your dog.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.620]  I like Casper too.
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.300]  Good stuff.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.480]  You know who doesn't get mattresses?
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.320]  Who?
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.920]  Cats.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.760]  Good.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.580]  You know why?
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.420]  Why?
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.240]  Cats suck.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.080]  Cats suck.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.920]  I hate cats.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.740]  I love dogs.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.240]  I'm probably gonna turn off half my audience here.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.600]  It's all right.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.440]  But you know what?
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.680]  That's part of the reason why cats suck
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.360]  is you could buy your cat a mattress
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.320]  and they wouldn't even use it.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.160]  They wouldn't.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.960]  They would jump up on your head instead
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.800]  and sleep there.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.280]  Yeah, they'd still sleep on your TV or whatever.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.480]  Creep, creeping around.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.560]  Dog, you know what a dog's gonna do with a mattress?
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.640]  Gonna sleep the hell out of it.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.480]  Sleep.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.300]  Dogs know how to sleep.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.400]  That's the other thing about dogs.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.320]  A good dog will sleep 22 hours a day.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.720]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.640]  Only get up to go to the bathroom and eat.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640]  And eat, right?
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.820]  And greet you, right?
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.240]  And the other thing they'll do
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.640]  is they'll greet you when you come in the door.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.660]  Unless you come in too late,
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.360]  then they might just wag their tail and still be sleeping.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.880]  All right, we've got products to talk about.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.720]  I don't know if you know.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.560]  Did you know this?
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.200]  That there's new products that came out?
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.040]  Apparently.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.880]  All right, we can talk about them.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.240]  But while we're talking about events,
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.560]  let's speculate.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.440]  Let's jump ahead.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.800]  Okay.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.800]  So there was no Mac hardware news at the event last week.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.840]  They didn't even talk about the software.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.760]  Really, Mac was not part of the event.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.600]  You're welcome.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.120]  As you predicted.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.300]  You know, you were very astute.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:35.300]  Now, last year, there was one fall Apple event.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.640]  Now, in years prior to that,
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.360]  there was sort of a TikTok schedule
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.400]  where there would be a big event in September with iPhones
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  and then a smaller event in October with other stuff.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.720]  And sometimes it was Mac.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.960]  I don't even remember what the small event was.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.780]  iPad.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.620]  Sometimes iPad.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.660]  Yeah.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.440]  Usually, September, big event, somewhere big.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.800]  You know, like the Flint Center, the one time.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.280]  So going back further, years further,
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.800]  it would be in the Yerba Buena Center
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.400]  right in downtown San Francisco.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.240]  Right.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.500]  And then the October event was often in town hall.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.800]  Maybe always in town hall.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.640]  I don't know.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.800]  Yeah, yeah, maybe.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.800]  Last year, there was just one event for the fall
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.600]  and a couple of people at Apple who I spoke to
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.000]  said that is by design that the two event thing,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  even with a smaller event, was a real stress on them.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.520]  I can see that.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.920]  Personnel and time-wise.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.880]  And it wasn't just like, oh, poor us.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.920]  We don't want to do the work.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.720]  I mean, you know, honestly,
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.420]  I'm not just trying to blow smoke up their asses.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.960]  The people who put on these events for Apple
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.840]  work their asses off and they're not afraid of hard work.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.680]  It's just that what I heard from a couple of people
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.340]  was that they always felt that with the mid-September
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.240]  and then mid-October events that both events suffered,
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.720]  especially the October event,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.560]  because they didn't have enough time to do it right.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.760]  And that it was better to put all their eggs in one basket
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.820]  and do one than to do two.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.420]  And secondarily, adding onto that,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.160]  when the March event was in town hall,
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.420]  the one where the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was introduced,
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.200]  Tim Cook said, this is probably the last time
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.440]  we're gonna have an event here.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.940]  We've had a lot of great history here,
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.240]  but we're moving to a new campus next year, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.080]  Right.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.740]  So no Mac hardware news,
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.980]  no event to showcase features in Sierra.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:26.980]  Yet there are, well, A, every single product
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.700]  in the Mac lineup other than the MacBook One port,
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.140]  Joby, is old and outdated, over a year.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.540]  I'm not being hyperbolic.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:38.060]  I mean, MacBook Pros are over a year old.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.380]  The Mac Pro literally just passed its thousandth day
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.260]  since it was updated.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.240]  And there is an excellent new version of macOS
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.040]  that is coming out soon.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.960]  Do you think that there's gonna be an October event
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.860]  where they do Mac stuff?
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.700]  You know,
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.620]  here's the thing for me with the Mac.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.940]  I think a simpler question is,
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.200]  do I think that they have Macs that they'll release
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.120]  sometime before the holiday shopping season?
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.520]  Yes.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520]  I agree.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.220]  I think my answer to that is a definite yes.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.800]  Will they have an event for those Macs?
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.120]  I think is a more difficult question
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.880]  because like you said,
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.640]  the reasoning for these one event things is very sound.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.340]  It's a sound reasoning to cut that out.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:42.340]  So if they have an event for what we would have to think
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.520]  at this point would be Macs,
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.520]  because don't forget the iPads were updated
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.920]  at the last event too.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.500]  They didn't talk about it, but they were.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.780]  So this is basically going to be a Mac event.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.600]  So are those Macs that they have so good
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.800]  that they'll want to roll them out in an event
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.920]  as opposed to rolling them out in a press release
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.920]  or do briefings with a number of their key people
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.820]  and roll them out like that?
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.320]  I mean, there are a few things that they could do.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.740]  If the Macs are big enough
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.960]  and they're that confident in them,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.880]  then yeah, there'll be an event.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.820]  If not, then I think one of the other two options
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.660]  is the best.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.400]  I think it'll either be an event or it will be briefings.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.880]  And when they do the briefings,
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.000]  and they did this, like one of the first ones I remember
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  was it was a version of Mac OS X.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.400]  It might've been 10.7, somewhere around there,
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.400]  but it was, remember, it was around March
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.640]  and they had like a mysterious, they were like,
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.360]  can you, for me, it was New York.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.300]  I don't know where you went.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.780]  Maybe you were still going to New York at the time,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:02.240]  but it was, hey, come, we have something to show you.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.280]  Can you make it up Tuesday at noon
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.800]  or one o'clock in the afternoon?
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.960]  And I was like, well, what's it about?
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.320]  And they're like, well, we want to keep it under wraps.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.840]  I had no idea what it was.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.920]  And it was the time, I wrote about it.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.360]  I had a briefing with Phil Schiller and Brian Kroll
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.120]  from Product Marketing where they showed the next version
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:19.960]  of Mac OS X.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.640]  I think it was 10.7, but it doesn't really matter.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.520]  But it was off schedule.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.480]  And it was at a time when the Mac was generally
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.480]  only getting updated every 18 months or so.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.680]  Like Mac OS wasn't on a yearly schedule.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.280]  It was coming off that time where there were a couple
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.200]  of years where they even said, hey, you know,
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.320]  Mac OS is getting updated slower because we're pulling
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.080]  key people to keep iOS, you know, the top priority
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.320]  of the company software wise were annual releases of iOS.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.920]  And the Mac, I mean, they admitted it.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.440]  They even had a PR the one time where they're like,
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.360]  you know, we were gonna have Mac OS come out at WWDC,
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.200]  but it's gonna come out later in the year instead
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.040]  because we, you know, we're engineering constrained.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.040]  And these product briefings were sort of a, hey,
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.880]  we're back, we're back at full steam ahead
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.320]  and we're doing the Mac every year too.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.000]  And we've got, you know, here's what's coming.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.680]  We're gonna try to release this later this year.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.880]  And, you know, and they've done that a couple
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.760]  of other times too.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.360]  But the Mac one really stuck out to me.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.600]  Yeah, and I don't mind that.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.920]  I don't know about you, but I don't mind that.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.520]  Well, and it's not as exclusive as it sounds either
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.600]  because they would generally when they do this,
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.200]  well, in fact, maybe I think every time I know
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.880]  that they've done it, they do something in California
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.640]  and Cupertino, and then they have another team fly out
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.440]  to New York and usually get like a suite of hotel rooms.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.280]  And it's, you know, they could have two or three, four,
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.280]  maybe even four teams at a time in parallel doing it,
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.720]  you know, half an hour at a time.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.120]  So they can fit, you know, each team can fit,
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.760]  I don't know, 10, 15 briefings in a day, you know,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.200]  multiplied by three or four teams, you know,
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.960]  and you can easily, you know, get these briefings out to,
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.440]  you know, 50 to 100 people.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.240]  Yeah, and I don't even know if they were that big.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.060]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:00.900]  I don't know that they did.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.740]  May not be.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.960]  Well, there's always so secretive about it.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.360]  Yeah, you only really know.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.400]  All you ever really know is who came before you
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.240]  because you see them on the way out
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.880]  and you know who's coming in after you.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.080]  Exactly right.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.500]  Or like I think we did one time,
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.560]  we bumped into each other walking down the street.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.920]  Oh, what are you doing here?
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.760]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.400]  So I don't know, I don't know which way to bet though.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.400]  I'm kind of betting on briefings,
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.960]  but I don't wanna make a bet.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.120]  I, you know, like if you wanted to put money on it,
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.200]  I wouldn't wanna put up more than $5
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.360]  if you said you thought it was gonna be an event.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.840]  No more than $5.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.160]  Because the other thing too is I wonder whether for them
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.120]  it is less effort to do one event in town hall
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.880]  than to send two teams, send a team to New York
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.500]  and have another team in Cupertino.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.340]  I don't know.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.160]  Do you know what?
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.560]  Town hall are some of my favorite events.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.280]  I'm kind of rooting, that's the one thing too
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.760]  is I'm rooting for town hall
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.440]  because I would like to go one more there.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.940]  I love town hall, I really do.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.780]  I just-
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.680]  And this time we'd know it's the last.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.280]  Yeah, that's correct, yeah.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.840]  Cause there are no more products coming.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.200]  Well, I guess we don't know,
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.280]  it wouldn't be a hundred percent certain
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.520]  cause there's a chance that, you know,
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.600]  construction would be significantly delayed
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.120]  and a March event that they might wanna have next year
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.800]  couldn't be held on the new campus.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.800]  But I kind of get the feeling like if they have a March
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.160]  event, it's gonna be at the new campus.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.400]  Yeah.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.540]  And I know you can just tell by looking at it,
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.020]  there is no chance in hell that an event next month
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.920]  is gonna be at the new campus.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.760]  No, no, no, no, you can't, they wouldn't do that.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.760]  But the important thing I think is the very first question.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.300]  Is there, are there Macs going to be available,
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.020]  new Macs before the end of the year?
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:52.860]  Yes.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.680]  I think yes.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.520]  Yes.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.440]  But I think MacBook Pro for sure.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.280]  Yes.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.080]  And I think part of the reason that Tim Cook said,
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.360]  I think this is, you know, in March
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.140]  that this will probably be the last time we meet here
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.200]  is I really do think that Apple at that time
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.040]  thought that MacBook Pros would be out by WWDC.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.920]  But maybe I'm wrong,
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.800]  because maybe there's a design aspect of this new Mac
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.920]  that is like tied into AirPods or something like that.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.120]  Well, see, that's the whole thing.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:22.180]  Are these Macs big enough that they'll hold an event?
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.440]  And that's what we don't know,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:28.440]  because you know, there's rumors and stuff,
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.680]  but you never know, I mean.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.280]  Are they gonna update the Mac Pro?
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.600]  I think they either have to update it or kill it.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.720]  The Mac Pro?
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.540]  Yeah.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.380]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.000]  I mean, a thousand day old computer is,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.700]  again, I know it's not their bread and butter.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.360]  I know that it's actually the opposite.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.560]  You know, financially speaking,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.320]  the iPhone is, you know, 60% of the company's revenue.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.880]  Mac Pro is some immeasurably slim thing.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.640]  But if you're gonna have, you know,
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.280]  a personal computing platform for professionals
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.520]  like the Mac, there needs to be professional hardware
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.360]  to run on it.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.560]  You're not bringing it into something else
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.160]  with something like the Mac Pro or even the Mac Mini.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.640]  You need a screen.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.600]  I don't wanna go buy a screen from HP or,
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.900]  I want an Apple screen.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.920]  Well, and I want the screen.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.000]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.840]  I'm not gonna buy a Mac Pro now.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.400]  I'm almost certainly gonna run iMacs
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.640]  until they stop making iMacs,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.860]  because I don't need the performance.
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.700]  I really don't.
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.880]  And I love just having one less thing
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.400]  to hook up to another thing.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.960]  But it doesn't make any sense to me
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.200]  that if you buy a $12,000 Mac Pro
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.880]  that you can't hook it up to a display
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.460]  as nice as you get on a $3,000 iMac.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.300]  Right.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.140]  Right.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.500]  I don't even know what the entry level iMac is,
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.120]  but it doesn't make any sense
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.040]  that you can get a better display
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.400]  with professional high color gamut.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.240]  Right.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.080]  And all this stuff.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.780]  Yeah, and that's a very good point.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.760]  Don't forget, these are wide color gamut displays.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.860]  So you're actually getting something
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.120]  that's better than what most people have,
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.080]  but yet you can't get it with the Mac Pro.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.220]  But maybe their thought is that people
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:03.240]  that use the Mac Pro don't actually use displays,
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.080]  and they don't use them like that.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:04.900]  No, yes, they do,
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.940]  because they're photographers and videographers, right?
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.440]  If you're doing professional video editing,
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.980]  of course you want a Mac Pro,
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:14.080]  and of course you want the high color gamut display.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.400]  And if you're a professional photographer,
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.360]  of course you want it.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.800]  That's, yeah.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.360]  I would use it for audio.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.040]  I mean, I use an iMac, and I love this iMac.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.000]  But if I had the choice,
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.800]  yeah, I'd get a Mac Pro and a big display
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.800]  and do my stuff.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.900]  I love making fun of people who put the word finally
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.360]  in their headlines about Apple
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.940]  in completely inappropriate ways.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.780]  But this is a case,
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.480]  and one of the reasons why is that if you overuse a word,
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.280]  the word ceases to have meaning.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.120]  Right.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.560]  This is a case where if, let's just say if, in October,
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.360]  they release a new Mac Pro with modern Intel hardware,
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.120]  and I think the place where it's most dated by far
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.040]  isn't even the CPU, even though the CPU is three years old,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:02.920]  but the graphics,
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.740]  like the graphics capabilities of the Mac Pro,
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.040]  the graphics chips have made tremendous increases
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.960]  in the last three years.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.960]  And a 5K cinema display that has,
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.020]  or whatever they're gonna call it, display,
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.140]  that has a wide color gamut and is beautiful.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.600]  That's a case where the word finally is
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.140]  exactly, exactly right.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.420]  Yeah, you can't argue with that.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.260]  You really can't.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.080]  So I hope so.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.840]  And I have absolutely zero scuttlebutt.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.520]  Nothing I've heard from any little birdies
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.220]  has told me that any of this stuff is coming.
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:38.660]  Well, MacBook Pros, we know we've heard are coming.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.000]  Gurman's had reports on them,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.040]  and a lot of people have heard stuff about MacBook Pros.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.480]  I haven't heard anything about the Mac Pro, though.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.680]  No, me neither.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.200]  It's almost terrifying to me that I haven't.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.040]  Well.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.640]  Because it makes me worry that my expectation
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.860]  that it's coming is simply based on my hopes,
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.560]  and the hopes of daring Fireball readers
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.440]  and talk show listeners who I know are waiting for it.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.880]  Well, and you're not alone in that.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.040]  My readers have had the same reaction,
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.920]  emailing and Twitter and everything else that,
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.840]  what have you heard about this?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.600]  All I know is that I look at the Mac Rumors Buying Guide,
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.360]  and it says it's 1,002 days old.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.100]  So, better be coming.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.120]  Let me take a break here,
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.240]  and then we'll talk about the actual products.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.600]  And I thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.440]  What a great sponsor.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.800]  I love these guys, Audible.com.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.340]  They have an unmatched selection of audio books,
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.320]  and don't even just think of them as the audio.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.440]  That's what I used to think of them as.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.960]  That's where you go to get audio books.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.960]  Audible now has original audio shows, news, comedy, and more.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.920]  Like what Netflix is to video,
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.160]  Audible is to audio, really is.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.280]  You get a 30-day free trial at Audible.com slash talk show,
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.280]  and they'll know that you came from here,
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.400]  and you'll get 30 days free,
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.120]  and you can listen to it all.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.100]  They have audio books from virtually every genre
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.080]  you can imagine, ready to go anytime, anywhere,
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.360]  and you can play them with your Audible account
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.240]  on your phones, tablets, computers,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.600]  most modern Kindles, and even iPods.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.880]  Most of the time, I think most people
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.160]  are gonna probably listen to it right on your iPhone.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.080]  Why not?
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.780]  Well, they're great for long flights, road trips,
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.900]  your daily commute.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.560]  So if you wish I did more episodes of the talk show
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.360]  because you run out of time and things to listen to,
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.080]  Audible can fill up all the time you have on your commute
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.400]  if you're one of the people who have a long daily commute,
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.760]  whether it's public transportation
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.880]  or riding in your car, whatever it is.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.320]  Audio books bring books to life.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.520]  Many of them nowadays are read by the authors themselves,
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.320]  adding an extra dimension to the text.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.280]  And when you have an account, you can take risks
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.420]  and try new authors and genres without regret
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.280]  because Audible offers what they call
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.120]  the Great Listen Guarantee.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.100]  If you start an audio book and you don't like it,
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.200]  you can exchange it for another one for free
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.120]  so you can't lose.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.560]  It's like being able to browse the book in the bookstore
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.480]  and maybe read chapter one before you decide
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.160]  whether you're gonna buy it.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  See and listen for yourself.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.600]  When you begin your 30-day free trial,
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.240]  you get your first audio book for free,
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.780]  and there's no stress or obligation.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.560]  You can cancel your membership at any time.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.160]  So with audio books and spoken word products,
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.680]  you'll find what you're looking for.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.800]  Again, 30-day free trial.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.920]  You cannot lose.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.160]  You'd lose nothing except for the pennies
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.800]  you pay for the download over the air.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.000]  And you probably don't pay by the penny.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.120]  You probably don't pay by the kilobyte, right?
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.420]  Nobody does.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.060]  So it's absolutely free.
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.860]  Audible.com slash talk show.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.400]  No the, just slash talk show.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.240]  My thanks to them for their continuing support
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.520]  of this award-winning podcast
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.480]  that has never won any awards.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.320]  All right.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.140]  I don't know.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:50.980]  If it.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:51.820]  I don't know.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:52.640]  The.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.480]  Oh God.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.200]  The products themselves.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.680]  What, I mean, again, I don't wanna complain,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.840]  but I can complain to you.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:03.680]  All right.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.520]  Don't worry, I won't kill anybody.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.000]  I have a great job.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.900]  You have a great job.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:11.040]  We are lucky.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.840]  As we record this, everybody who's ever gonna end up
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.200]  listening to it is wondering what it is like
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.080]  to hold the new iPhones.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.640]  What's it like to feel the jet black?
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.640]  What does it look like?
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.920]  What's the camera like in the iPhone 7 Plus?
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.760]  Everybody wants to know.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.240]  What does it look like when you go and hit the 2X button
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.880]  and you're looking through the second lens?
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.080]  Everybody's curious.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:31.920]  Everybody's dying.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.240]  Maybe by the time they listen,
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.560]  if they pre-ordered, they'll have them.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.480]  They're showing up tomorrow.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.240]  You and I both know the answers to all those questions.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.200]  What a great job.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.600]  If I didn't have this job, I would wish that I had it.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.520]  I used to be jealous.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.200]  Like when I read about the original iPhone,
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.420]  I wish that I was one of the guys
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.600]  who got to use it before everybody else.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.500]  And now I do.
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.120]  I get to use it before everybody else.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:54.960]  That said,
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.320]  getting two phones
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:04.920]  and a brand new Apple Watch and an all new headphone
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.500]  and being given five days to review them
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.620]  before the embargo goes up is,
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.080]  it is pretty hard.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.800]  I actually, I'm telling you the goddamn truth.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.820]  Now, part of this is I cut a fingernail too short
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.640]  on my left ring finger.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.960]  I hurt my finger typing this week.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.900]  I suffered like a work-related injury.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.740]  I need,
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.740]  I actually hurt myself.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.360]  Oh, man.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.840]  I mean, I've written, I swear to God,
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.320]  I've written something like eight or 9,000 words this week.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.320]  We'll take out a Kickstarter or something for you.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.320]  Let me insert my usual disclaimer
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.960]  that my mom's father was a coal miner.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.120]  He spent his entire career digging coal out of mountains
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.520]  in central Pennsylvania
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.460]  and wound up dying of black lung disease.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.480]  And you cut your fingernail too short.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.000]  I am his grandson.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.640]  I think if he knew what I was doing
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.020]  and how many people listen to my podcast
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.760]  and how many people read my site, he would be so proud.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.860]  He would be delighted.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.180]  He really was your stereotypical,
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.600]  he was a first generation,
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.900]  he came over from the Ukraine when he was like a baby.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.880]  And he was the stereotypical immigrant American
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.920]  who wanted nothing but for his children and their children
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.280]  to have better and better lives.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.600]  And that is exactly what's going on
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.280]  with me and my sister, he'd be so proud.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.160]  But here I am complaining about my finger that hurts here
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.120]  because I cut a fingernail too short
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.920]  and had to type 7,000 words about $1,000 cell phones.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.120]  You know what you remind me of?
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.700]  You remind me of that GE commercial
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.280]  where they put a hammer on the table
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.120]  and said, you can't lift the hammer, can you?
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.280]  Did you ever see that?
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.040]  Yeah.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.540]  It's, that's, yeah.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:09.400]  You know, like the Goodfellas scene
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.760]  when he takes Lorraine Bracco into the Copacabana
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:17.120]  and then they get the table put out
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.600]  right in front of the front row
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.120]  and she's like, what do you do?
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.880]  And he goes, I'm a union delegate.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.520]  I don't know, she goes, I'm in construction.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.440]  Yeah, she feels his hands, right,
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.520]  where the calluses should be.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.760]  And she goes, you don't feel like,
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.800]  your hands don't feel like you work in construction.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.240]  And he says, I'm a union delegate, right?
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.320]  Like if you just took, if you took my hands
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.600]  and just felt for calluses,
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.240]  you wouldn't say it feels like I'm a hard worker.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.400]  Yeah.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.200]  But you did injure yourself this week.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.560]  It was, it's hard to review.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.040]  I really felt the pressure, especially with the phones.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.460]  I like to take more time.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.040]  I wish I could have two weeks
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.060]  and not because I want to take two weeks to write.
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.760]  It's like, I want to settle in with the devices before.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.960]  And it's really hard, especially with two phones
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.360]  and especially with two phones that are fundamentally
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.980]  different.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:04.840]  Well, I could only,
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.960]  I mean, like the camera,
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.420]  most of what I focused on with the camera
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.360]  was focused on the plus with the zoom
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.760]  because you're kind of rushing at that point
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.640]  because you leave the next day
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:28.480]  and you get everything set up and then the next day
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.000]  and your time is running short.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.800]  So I, you know, I try and do the best I can
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.660]  and give the best thoughts that I can on it.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.500]  But I really enjoyed both of them.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.300]  I do.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.740]  And you know what, somebody asked me today,
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.960]  which phone do you think I should get?
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.960]  Should I get the one with the plus for the two times camera?
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.920]  And I know for a fact that this person
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.340]  hates the bigger phone.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.600]  You know, when it came to the six or the six plus,
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:07.960]  they went for the six because they hated the bigger phone.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.080]  They've just, they saw no use for the bigger phone.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.280]  And my response back to them was,
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.280]  I know you don't like the bigger phone.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.000]  So think about this.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.620]  Do you want to use a bigger phone 24 hours a day
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:28.160]  for those few times that you'll use the telephoto camera?
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.300]  I don't think so.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:32.480]  I don't think that you do,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:35.420]  but that's kind of how to look at it.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.440]  And it is much harder this year than the previous years.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.780]  The two previous years,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.320]  there was a photographic advantage to the plus models,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.840]  which was that it had optical image stabilization
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.600]  and they made it even better last year.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.980]  First year with the six,
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.800]  the optical image stabilization was only for still photos.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:55.040]  And then last year, the plus did optical image stabilization
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.440]  for video.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.440]  It's a big deal.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.400]  It really does work.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.620]  It does increase in photo terms.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.620]  It gives you at least, I think at least two stops.
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.120]  I think Apple advertises it as three stops.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.000]  I think it's very fair to say that for most people
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.680]  in their ability to hold a camera still,
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.120]  you'll get at least two stops
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.640]  from optical image stabilization.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.720]  What does stops mean?
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.000]  It means that it's,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  you can get in focus, not blurry picture with less light.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:28.080]  Or you'll, if you're like shooting out of a moving car
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.640]  or something like that, you'll get,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.240]  you'll be able to take a steadier picture.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.780]  It's exactly what, you know,
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.000]  optical image stabilization is a feature
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  that is exactly, it's perfectly named.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.680]  I try never to shoot out of a moving car, but you know.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.360]  It works, it does work.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.280]  I think personally, especially in typical,
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.720]  like just regular person going about their daily life,
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.420]  shooting stuff with their phone,
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.960]  the optical image stabilization for video
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.200]  is even more important than for stills
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.680]  because it works all the time.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.920]  So like just like when you're shooting something with video
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.960]  and you're walking and there's that,
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.040]  just even that no matter how steady you try
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.340]  to hold the camera, you get this camera shake.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.760]  The optical image stabilization,
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.280]  when you just like just walk down the sidewalk
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.340]  and trying to keep it steady,
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.880]  the difference between with
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.760]  and without optical image stabilization is night and day.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.120]  It looks like the difference between like a consumer camera
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.960]  and a thousand dollar pro camera.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.120]  One of the tests I did, I don't publish these things
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.300]  because I just don't have time.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.800]  I just try to focus on words
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.780]  and I know other people will show examples,
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.880]  but I took my 6S,
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.420]  which does not have optical image stabilization
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.960]  and the 7, just the regular 7.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.640]  So it would be the exact same size.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.100]  And I held them back, you know, right next to each other
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:44.120]  so that the, you know, imagine this,
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.200]  like put the glass of the 6 right on the back of the 7
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.820]  so that the camera lenses are as close as possible
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:55.400]  without one of the lenses obstructing the other, right?
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.620]  Start shooting video with both of them
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.780]  and then just walk down the sidewalk
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.680]  and then come back in, load them up on a computer
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.520]  and watch them.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.260]  The difference between A and B is just huge.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:07.640]  It's a huge factor and it was tempting,
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.680]  but it wasn't enough for me
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.320]  to get the big phone the last two years.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.080]  But now that it has the new lens system,
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.320]  boy, I am absolutely, I honestly,
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.160]  I'm telling you right now, Jim,
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.640]  I haven't ordered a phone for myself yet
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.120]  because I don't know what to get.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.120]  I think for me, a lot of it is use
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:28.400]  and I need reading glasses now.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.400]  So the plus is, it has to be the plus for me
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.680]  because if I pick up the 7, I have trouble seeing it.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.160]  What do you do for that?
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.280]  Now I'm in the same boat, I've talked about it
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.120]  on the show before.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:45.940]  I need reading glasses too,
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.120]  at least when I have my contacts in.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:47.960]  What do you do?
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.880]  Do you go to zoom mode so that you're running it
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.560]  at the same effective resolution as the smaller one
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.060]  or do you just go in and bump the text size up?
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:55.900]  And-
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.640]  This is terrible, but I do both.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.640]  All right.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.360]  I mean, yeah, I do both.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  I bumped the text size up and I use the zoom mode
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.360]  because it's just, I need that.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.360]  I want to be able to pick up my phone
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.360]  and just be able to look at it to see a message,
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.400]  if a message comes in, that's what I want.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.840]  But even with zoom and bigger text,
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.660]  because bigger text doesn't work for everything.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:37.040]  So even with the bigger text, I still, a lot of times,
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.280]  have to pick up my glasses to actually see what's there.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.600]  With the plus, I can usually just pick it up
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.240]  and look at it and say, oh, okay.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.760]  I know that it makes me sound like I'm older
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.240]  than I actually am even.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.240]  My eyes are older, my close vision is worse
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.740]  than my age should be.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.320]  I'm actually like behind.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.300]  So it makes me sound old.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.300]  And I remember being young and, you know,
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.840]  anybody who looks at Daring Fireball knows
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.920]  that as a designer, I love small type.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.760]  I love it aesthetically, I do.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.760]  I like small.
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.380]  And I used to like to do stuff when I was editor
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:11.920]  of school paper where we'd make little,
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.880]  like to fill in the empty ad spots,
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.320]  we'd make little house ads for the paper itself.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  And I would just fill them with tiny little,
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.840]  like literally like five or six point type in footnotes.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.000]  I loved it.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.360]  So I resisted bumping the text size up as long as I could,
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.200]  cause I like it.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.400]  But then once I gave in, but I'll tell you what,
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.280]  I want to say something.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.620]  I don't know how many people from Apple listen to the show,
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.040]  but I've been thinking about this a lot lately
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.160]  as I experiment with what's best for me with, you know,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.600]  reading glasses or just not wearing my contacts
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.700]  and using regular glasses.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.940]  Cause then I can just take my glasses off and I can see,
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.900]  I can see anything with my glasses off small print.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:55.400]  The text sizing feature in iOS,
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.440]  where you go to display and brightness text size,
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.720]  and you can get to the same setting
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.520]  through the accessibility too.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.520]  And it says apps that the sport dynamic type will adjust
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.600]  your preferred reading size below.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.940]  It's not just that it makes text size bigger,
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.040]  a lot of places, but especially,
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.840]  I think starting in iOS 9 and in iOS 10, it's even better.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.520]  It's not just that the text is bigger,
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.740]  but the way it flows makes it look like it's exactly right.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.200]  Like when they first introduced this feature
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.120]  a couple of years ago, and I played with it,
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.360]  I was like, well, this is a great accessibility feature.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.720]  And people who have vision problems will really appreciate.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.760]  I have a friend who has really terrible eyes.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.640]  I mean, maybe like it's like,
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.320]  he's on the spectrum of being blind,
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.580]  not blind like you can't see, but like,
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.920]  he really blows it up.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.560]  Like he goes to the in accessibility where there's like,
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.620]  it's beyond the top setting, you know,
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.240]  there's like a special, like, hey,
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.240]  do you want to expose super big,
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.440]  like almost ludicrously large type?
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.120]  He blows it up to there.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.320]  And he said, it's like a game changer for him
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.220]  because even though it's ridiculously big,
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.320]  he has absolutely no trouble reading text messages anymore.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.520]  It's like changed his life.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.060]  So I'm, you know, nowhere near that bad.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.960]  I just need 1.00 reading glasses.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.400]  But I'll tell you what I really appreciate
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.360]  as somebody who appreciates fine design
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.580]  and was resistant to this,
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.000]  because I didn't want my iPhone to look worse
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.720]  because I was using big type.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.980]  It blows me away how I can go two clicks bigger on the type,
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.460]  three clicks bigger even,
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.240]  and everything still looks like it's nicely designed.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.080]  Yes.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:22.920]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.740]  It looks beautiful to me.
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.400]  And I look at my son's iPhone
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:28.080]  and his is running at the stock default size
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.360]  because he's 12 years old and his eyes are perfect.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.120]  I look at his now and it almost looks to me aesthetically,
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:35.640]  just judging as to whether it's pleasing,
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640]  not whether I can read it,
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.720]  but whether it's pleasing or not.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.160]  It actually looks too small to me.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.320]  So I really, I just want to say,
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.680]  if anybody who works on these accessibility features
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.060]  at Apple and the dynamic sizing stuff
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.760]  that accommodates them,
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.080]  I can only imagine how hard that is to design something
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.140]  that looks good at widely varying text sizes.
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:56.720]  I've designed many things in my life
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.760]  and it's really hard to do that and I really appreciate it.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:00.600]  And I'll tell you what,
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.360]  it's like what you just said about running in Zoom phone,
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.820]  when you run into an app that doesn't use dynamic type,
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.800]  I want to smash my iPhone.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.000]  Uber, I'm looking at you.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:08.820]  Yeah.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:12.920]  The Uber app, I really, I have to get like a magnifying glass.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.760]  I know.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.000]  Yeah, I've been having,
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.840]  this is the type of stuff that I was talking about earlier
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.420]  with the retention to detail.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.260]  Yeah.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:28.160]  That's what other companies just don't do.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.040]  The fact that they've clearly have a team
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.760]  that spent so much time system-wide across so many apps,
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.000]  I have noticed one bug where mail sometimes goes back to,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.220]  mail on iOS goes back to smaller type.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.040]  And I wonder, and it confuses me
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.680]  because sometimes you get email that's just styled text,
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.400]  you know, the person isn't sending plain text.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.080]  And I thought, oh, they just picked a small font
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:47.920]  and it's picking it up.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.800]  But then I realized like two or three messages in a row
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.380]  are too small and I force quit mail and relaunch it.
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:53.480]  And all of a sudden the same message
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.040]  has the text that I prefer.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.440]  So I've noticed that mail, there must be just a bug
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.480]  where it somehow loses track of the dynamic size.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.640]  But system-wide, messages, mail, Safari reader view,
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.620]  they pick up this thing and it just looks great
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.200]  and I can read it and it's great.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.040]  Well, I don't need that.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:09.880]  So I don't have a preference.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.880]  I will say this after spending some time with both
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.720]  and spending the last year on the regular 6S size.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.040]  My eyes are not at the point where I need the bigger phone
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.680]  just for reading, but I certainly,
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:23.120]  I'm at the point now where when you say that you do,
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.680]  I know exactly what you mean.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.720]  And if anybody out there is listening who doesn't,
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.600]  count your blessings, whether if you're young,
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.440]  appreciate it while you have it.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.040]  I do think, one thing about my vision
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.160]  and as it's getting worse as I get older,
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.880]  I do feel that I didn't waste my youth with perfect vision.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.280]  I feel like I actually appreciated it while I had it.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.000]  So did I.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.720]  Oh my God, I told you I was sitting next to Horace Dejau
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.960]  in the thing and he's making these numbers spreadsheets
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.560]  live, like based on the numbers that like Tim Cook
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.360]  and Jeff Williams are giving, he's posting these,
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.680]  he's so amazing in numbers.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.560]  Honest to God, I would just like to have like a video feed
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.520]  of him just working in numbers for half an hour.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.480]  But he, his numbers spreadsheet,
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.040]  it's like this expansive canvas that he pans across
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.080]  and he's got all these charts.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.600]  It's not like a bunch of different sheets.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.680]  It's like one big sheet with a whole bunch of sections
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.040]  and everything is at like six point type.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:24.040]  Oh my God, so I could basically sit beside him
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.360]  as a spy and never get anything.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.880]  No, to me, it looked just like a bunch of dots,
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.320]  like a little ants on screen.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.040]  Did you get, I think everybody might've gotten seated,
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.280]  everybody who got review units from what I could tell
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.160]  got the exact same two phones, jet black iPhone 7,
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.960]  regular black iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.880]  Yes.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.880]  I think everybody got the same ones.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.040]  To my knowledge, nobody other than in the hands-on area
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.640]  has seen a jet black iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.860]  I actually like the matte black better.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:58.920]  I can totally see it.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:03.920]  I'm also, to this point, I am still torn on both quadrants.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.600]  I don't know which finish to get
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:08.000]  and I don't know which size to get.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.660]  Honest to God, I haven't ordered.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:14.660]  You brought up a good point about the blemishes
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.360]  that could happen to the jet black one.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.240]  It is a gloss finish.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.640]  Of course, when showing a picture on stage,
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.280]  I fell in love with the jet black
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.600]  when they were showing it in the keynote
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.720]  because it's just so shiny and gorgeous.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.200]  I felt like a crow, ooh, something shiny, I want that.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.400]  But when I get back into the hands-on area
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.400]  and I saw the matte finish, I love that.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.000]  It's so subtle.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.960]  I don't think that their initial batch
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.720]  of product photography does it justice.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.160]  I think that they're, I'm talking about the flat black,
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.480]  matte black, regular black, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.040]  In their product photography,
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.540]  especially what they showed us on stage,
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.380]  and I don't know if this was made worse
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.040]  by the fact that it was a projection,
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.480]  but it looked like very dark gray.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.400]  Not that it didn't look good,
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:11.840]  but that when you see it in person, it is clearly black.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.040]  Yes, it is black.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.120]  I had the feeling when we watched the event,
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.180]  I still thought they both looked good,
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.360]  but I thought, oh, I thought that's a stretch
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.400]  calling that black.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.200]  And I know, one of the reasons I thought that it's a stretch
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.000]  is I know that black is a very hard color
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.080]  to anodize on aluminum, and that's why they abandoned
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.480]  what they called slate with the five
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.080]  to go to the much lighter, it's actually more
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.280]  like a dark silver, what they call space gray.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.120]  Right.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.020]  But when you see it in person,
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.660]  it is absolutely positively legit black.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.660]  Yeah, and it's stunning, I thought.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.560]  So I'm not worried about the little blemishes
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.140]  that may come up in a phone.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.980]  I don't use a case.
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:00.540]  I have keys in my pocket, I have a lighter in my pocket.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.680]  I would put the phone in there
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.620]  and it would get scratched all to crap,
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.180]  but I don't care about that.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.860]  I play guitar, I have some expensive guitars.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:13.100]  I play them and my belt buckle scrapes on them
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.260]  and I don't care about that either.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:18.300]  I just, I wanna use it and I wanna use the best one.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.580]  And so that isn't a consideration for me,
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:24.220]  that will be a consideration for a lot of people, I think.
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:29.220]  The fact that blemishes will show up so easily on that phone
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.400]  and Apple does warn you about that.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.360]  I mean, they're very clear about it, so it's gonna happen.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.360]  But I just, overall, the look of the black
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:43.140]  over the jet black, I'm sitting here looking at it now
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:46.860]  and I'm just, you know, I'm just admiring it.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:50.140]  Here's an interesting thing I didn't mention in my review,
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.620]  but I thought it was really interesting,
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:56.100]  is on the regular black, the Apple logo,
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.140]  I think it's actually, just like previously,
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.500]  it's a stainless steel insert, I think,
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.940]  but it is, it's super high gloss,
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:03.700]  you know, the Apple logo is super high gloss.
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:06.940]  And the Apple logo pops off the back.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.180]  On the jet black, it's actually,
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:12.060]  you actually have to put it in the right light
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.540]  to even see the Apple logo.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.400]  It is the first iPhone ever where I think that's true.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.760]  Like in most, I'm sitting here playing with it now,
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.280]  it's sort of getting towards dusk here.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.080]  But at most angles, I can't even see the Apple logo
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.620]  on the back because the Apple logo is shiny too.
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:32.460]  It is also, it is different, it's not, you know,
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.740]  there is an Apple logo and you can feel it,
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:36.780]  so I think it's also a stainless steel insert.
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:38.500]  Like I can rub my finger over it
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.460]  and I feel the edges of the Apple logo.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:42.540]  But in most lighting angles, if it's not,
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.540]  if you're not catching the light to get a reflection,
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:46.020]  you don't see the Apple logo.
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.700]  I didn't even notice that, I'm gonna have to go look.
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:50.420]  I don't know that that's a reason for anybody
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.420]  to buy it or not buy it, you know,
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.860]  but it's just an interesting thing to me that, you know,
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.180]  I don't know, because I don't think
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.400]  they've ever made an iPhone before
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.620]  where the Apple doesn't pop on the back.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:03.140]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.160]  What do you think about the feel?
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.360]  This is, by far and away, the number one question
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.600]  I got last week is, is the jet black slippery?
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.600]  Me too, and I was actually surprised with how tactile was.
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:18.540]  It looks like a wet bar, so.
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:20.100]  Yes, it does, it does.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.500]  And you know, you posted on Twitter
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:27.260]  about how it kind of stuck to your skin
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.020]  or you posted something like that.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.540]  And I thought, you know what, that's exactly right.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.900]  And it looks like you're gonna pick it up
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:37.800]  and it's gonna just pop right out of your hand
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.340]  and, you know, smash.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:42.580]  But it sticks to your hand.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.120]  I don't know, I wonder, I'm really curious,
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.540]  I can't wait, this is one of the things
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:49.660]  I can't wait until tomorrow when thousands
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:50.980]  of people start getting them,
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:52.720]  to see if everybody agrees with that
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.480]  or if it has something to do with my skin.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.980]  My hands, I don't think I, you've shaken my hand before.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.180]  I don't, I wouldn't say that I have sweaty hands,
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:04.280]  but my hands naturally have, are nice and moist.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.540]  You know, like they feel like I use nice moisturizer.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:07.380]  Which I do.
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.260]  Am I gonna have to give you my visa number here
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.760]  or something?
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.820]  I'm just saying though, maybe, I'm just curious
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:16.180]  if people who have, let's say, dry hands,
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:19.140]  which I don't have, I don't suffer from dry hands.
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:20.420]  I wonder if people who have dry hands
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:21.500]  will find it slippery.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:24.700]  Because I have seen, most people seem to agree with me
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.420]  that it is a grippy phone, it's a grippy texture.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:32.420]  But Marques Brownlee, MKBHD,
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.520]  he called it slippery in his hands-on area video,
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.620]  and then he called it slippery in his unboxing
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:43.820]  when he got a review unit on Wednesday.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:44.640]  Really?
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.060]  So I don't know, maybe he has dry hands?
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.480]  It is, I stand behind the fact
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.700]  that it's the grippiest phone I've ever felt.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:53.640]  Yeah.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.340]  Or iPhone I've ever felt.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:57.100]  A week later, but.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.740]  Well, I just wonder whether there's any variance
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.620]  between dryness of hands and that reaction.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.620]  The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is actually more grippier
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.860]  than this, but that's because it blows up, so.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:10.620]  Well, it's hard to hold a phone that's on fire.
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:14.460]  Hey, did you see that they actually just initiated
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.420]  the formal recall?
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:16.460]  I did.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.940]  I can't, I mean, I don't wanna, I don't like,
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.380]  I have tried to make as little hay over this as possible
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.220]  on their firewall. Me too.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.260]  Because I don't understand it,
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.900]  I don't know how widespread it is.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.460]  And I wonder, I mean, say what you want about Samsung
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.220]  as like a copycat company,
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.020]  and I really don't like them in that regard.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.860]  I really do feel that they're sort of,
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:38.060]  you know, well, like your feelings on Pharrell,
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.380]  that's how I feel about Samsung.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:42.700]  I don't like, and when they are original,
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.500]  I tend to find it distasteful.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.360]  I don't really like, I just, I'm not a fan of the company.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.620]  I don't know, maybe that's a shock to people.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:54.680]  But I think engineering-wise, they're, you know,
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.700]  they're very, very competent.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.580]  I mean, in fact, they make chips that are used
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.420]  in the iPhone.
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.760]  You can't knock them on engineering quality.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.460]  So there's this aspect to this that says,
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.780]  there but for the grace of God goes any company,
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.780]  including Apple, you know, that this sort of,
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.160]  I don't know, I don't know.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.980]  Maybe we'll find out in the long run
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:19.460]  that there was some slipshod engineering in there.
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:22.460]  Maybe like there were warnings that were ignored.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:23.300]  I don't know.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.500]  There could be the case.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.740]  It could be the case that no,
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.980]  this wouldn't happen to Apple because at Apple
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.820]  or, you know, just insert another company here,
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:34.340]  Lenovo or whoever you wanna say who has a good reputation,
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:37.100]  where if engineer said, hey, this battery, you know,
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.100]  with this many milliamps, you know,
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.740]  whatever the problem is with this battery,
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.020]  this is gonna be a problem.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:45.020]  This is outside specs, maybe, or maybe,
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:47.140]  maybe this was, who knows what the explanation is.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:48.380]  So I don't wanna make hay over it.
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.100]  But that said, boy, this is a fiasco.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:56.100]  Now, how do things work in the US when the safety regulators
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:59.660]  issue a recall, do they follow that up
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:00.740]  with an investigation?
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.140]  So will Samsung be asked to hand over papers
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:05.500]  to show that there was some negligence or?
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:08.500]  I think it's absolutely 100% inevitable
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.460]  that they're gonna suffer a class action lawsuit
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.740]  and it's all gonna come out then.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:13.820]  Now, whether the government will initiate on their own,
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:15.280]  I honestly don't know.
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:16.120]  I don't know.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:16.980]  I think that they might.
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.100]  I think the US Consumer Product Safety Commission
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:20.680]  will probably investigate it on their own.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:23.880]  But it's gonna get investigated by the class action lawsuit.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.720]  Did you see the thing?
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.540]  Here's the other thing too.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.980]  This is, and again, is Samsung,
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.700]  is the fact that they're having this problem
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.540]  in the first place.
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.860]  I mean, you know, remember 20 years ago,
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.980]  there was a PowerBook that had a problem with batteries.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.620]  Somebody's battery on one of the,
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.500]  it was like the PowerBook 5300, I think,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.100]  that had a, you know,
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.580]  but there were only like one or two cases of it happening.
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:46.560]  It was certainly far less frequent with this.
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:50.660]  But on the other hand, Apple sold far fewer PowerBook 5300s
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.740]  than Samsung sells Galaxy Note 7s.
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.340]  But again, happened to Apple once with the PowerBook.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.540]  The engineering and design problems that led to this,
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.520]  let's leave those aside
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.820]  because we can't pass judgment on them right now.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:04.160]  Public relations-wise,
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:07.140]  I think Samsung is absolutely botching this.
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.580]  I think what they should do is just say,
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:13.400]  okay, all of them right now, send them back.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.820]  Every single one, whether it's in retail,
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:17.900]  whether it's already been sold, unsold,
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:20.740]  if it's in a warehouse, if it's in a Verizon store,
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.620]  send them all back to us, every single one of them,
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:25.780]  and we will make things right somehow.
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:27.260]  I don't know what making it right is.
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.000]  I don't know if it's giving everybody their money back.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.780]  I don't know if it's giving them a different phone.
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:32.380]  If it's asking them,
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:34.980]  hey, you can either take your money back now or wait,
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:38.880]  and we'll get you a fixed Galaxy Note 7 in six weeks,
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.660]  whatever it is, but that's what they should do.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.140]  What they're doing now is ridiculous.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.460]  Did you see the thing where they were gonna,
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.580]  they were gonna put them in a mode
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.580]  where it only charges the 60%?
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.620]  Oh my gosh.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.100]  I mean, I think that's off the table now
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.620]  that the U.S. consumer product,
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.940]  you know, now there's official recall,
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.460]  but yesterday, Samsung announced that they were gonna,
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.620]  they were gonna force a firmware update over the air
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.900]  that only allowed them to charge to 60%.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.980]  Oh, wow.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:05.580]  Which is wrong on a couple of levels, right?
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:07.340]  Because even if you're like,
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:10.460]  if you as a Galaxy Note 7 owner are perfectly fine
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:11.500]  keeping the phone,
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.660]  but now your phone only has 60% battery life.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:16.100]  Oh, man.
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.700]  Anyway, we got Apple stuff to talk about,
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.500]  but I thought this Note 7 thing is,
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.160]  I, that's a, you just have to cut losses, right?
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.000]  You have to, you know.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.380]  Well, yeah, that's the right thing to do.
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.940]  Do you remember the Tylenol recall?
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:29.140]  Remember in the 80s when some nut job,
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:33.060]  some nut job put, what do you put in there?
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.900]  Cyanide?
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.900]  Cyanide or something like that, yeah.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.580]  Some nut job working in a Tylenol plant,
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:43.420]  poison a batch of Tylenol with cyanide,
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:46.620]  and it got nipped in the bud.
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.380]  But the way Tylenol handled it is like,
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:50.540]  it's like textbooks and public relations
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:51.380]  have been written about it
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:52.900]  because Tylenol knew,
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.860]  I think I'm getting the details on this, right?
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:56.660]  But the gist of it is that Tylenol knew
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.740]  the exact batches that were affected.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.060]  You know, it's batches with these numbers.
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:02.780]  And what they could have done is said,
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:04.000]  you know, all of these batches,
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.900]  if you're a distributor,
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.900]  if you're a drug store, whatever,
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:10.580]  these batches of Tylenol, whatever strength,
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:13.040]  send them back, these are the bad batches.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.420]  That's not what they did.
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.680]  What Tylenol did is they said,
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.820]  get every single thing in every store,
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.260]  warehouse, anywhere that has the word Tylenol on it,
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.940]  whether it's Tylenol, cough syrup, or whatever,
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.340]  send it all back, get it all,
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.300]  we're just gonna destroy the entire stock
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:31.040]  of Tylenol as we know it,
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.140]  and then we're gonna give you new stuff
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.740]  so that everybody can feel good
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.820]  about the Tylenol that they're taking, right?
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:37.660]  It's-
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.480]  Save their company.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:39.600]  Yeah, save the company, right?
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.340]  It's a huge, they took a huge,
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:44.420]  a much bigger loss financially in the moment
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:46.740]  to deal with it, but saved their reputation,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.780]  because what it did is it actually did reinforce
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.820]  the reputation that Tylenol's a brand you can trust, right?
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:54.160]  There's nothing you can do to stop one lone nut job,
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.680]  but then Tylenol said, you know,
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.300]  we want you to have complete faith in a brand.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.740]  I think Samsung is actually doing,
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:02.140]  this whole 60% trick is like the opposite.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:05.060]  Well, and I said today, you know,
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:07.740]  when I posted about the recall,
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:11.200]  how are you gonna trust them again?
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.740]  I mean, I don't trust, I really don't trust,
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:16.140]  if the piece, it's the piece of hardware
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:19.300]  that can catch fire, I don't trust a software update.
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.420]  You know, this piece of hardware, as it is,
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:24.420]  might catch fire, but you can trust this software update
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.260]  so that it won't.
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.620]  Well, I don't know.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:28.420]  I don't know about that.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.720]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.820]  All right, back to the side, which one?
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.940]  I don't know, I'm torn.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:34.780]  I'm torn, Jim.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.700]  I think, here's the thing that I really ought to do,
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.380]  is it's, we've had an unbelievable hot stretch
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:43.380]  here in Philadelphia, it was 92 yesterday.
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:44.220]  Geez.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.940]  So I'm still wearing shorts, but I think it's cooling off.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:50.380]  I gotta get some jeans on and try this plus size one
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.780]  with jeans, because wearing shorts is sort of a cheating move
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:55.820]  because it's a lot less, to me, the least pleasant part
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:58.220]  of carrying a plus size iPhone is getting it
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:57:59.620]  in and out of jeans pockets.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:01.620]  Yeah.
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:06.260]  I think, though, if you had to,
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:10.140]  if you had to tell me I had my plus in my front pocket.
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:11.220]  Yeah, that's what I do, too.
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:13.620]  But it's still, it's way harder to get out for me
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.780]  than the 6S.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:15.940]  Maybe I wear my jeans too tight.
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:16.760]  Maybe.
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:19.620]  If you told me I had to order my phone
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:21.220]  that I'm gonna use for the next 12 months,
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:23.080]  right now, on the air, in this show,
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:27.820]  I would get the 4.7 inch in jet black.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:32.740]  But I'm not gonna order for another week or so,
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:36.100]  and so I withhold the right to either get that.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:39.700]  I do think, I think, I feel much more certain
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:42.500]  that I'm gonna end up getting the smaller iPhone 7
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.580]  and less certain about whether I'm gonna get jet black
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:48.100]  or the regular black.
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.420]  But I think I'm gonna get jet black.
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.620]  And I think the reason why has nothing to do
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:53.080]  with the way it looks and everything to do
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.540]  with the grippiness and the confidence I have
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.860]  that I'm not gonna slip and fall with it.
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:00.660]  You typically use the smaller phones anyway.
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:01.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.940]  So, and I typically go for the bigger ones.
[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:08.940]  So, you know, I could easily recommend either phone.
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:12.360]  This time I feel like I, having the bigger one
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:15.460]  is a better choice because I also get the camera, too.
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:16.480]  Yeah.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.860]  So.
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:21.020]  I do, I do feel bad about the camera this time.
[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:24.220]  I've told you before, OIS, optical image stabilization,
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.300]  really is nice.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:27.940]  I do, I've spent two years kind of wishing I had it
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:30.900]  and kind of feeling a little bad that I didn't have it.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:32.820]  If I do go ahead and get the plus,
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.420]  or not the plus, the 4.7 inch,
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:35.780]  I'm gonna feel even worse this year
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:37.780]  knowing that every time I take a shot
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:40.560]  where I feel like I'm too far away
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.280]  and I wish that I was zoomed in a little more,
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:44.820]  every single time I snap a photo,
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:46.500]  I'm gonna think, God, I wish I had that other camera.
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:49.120]  Yeah, and you know, anytime I see a picture
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.660]  that you've taken on Instagram or on Twitter,
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660]  I'm gonna post and say,
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.020]  why couldn't you zoom in on that?
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:57.700]  Oh, right, right, you didn't have the good phone, right.
[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.540]  Sorry about that.
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:03.540]  No, I did, I read your review.
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:05.820]  It seems like we're largely in agreement.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.700]  Yeah.
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.660]  It's a phenomenal year over year improvement.
[02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:10.840]  I've been tweeting lately.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.100]  I tweeted and I posted something
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.060]  on Daring Fireball last night,
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:14.780]  and I know benchmarks aren't everything,
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:15.900]  but that the Geekbench,
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:18.540]  if you just use Geekbench as your benchmark,
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:21.980]  the iPhone 7, and both iPhone 7s benchmark
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.140]  almost exactly the same,
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:26.140]  like the difference is like the difference
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.060]  between one run and another on the same phone.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.220]  So I'll just say iPhone 7, but I mean both.
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.420]  The iPhone 7 on Geekbench gets better scores
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.120]  than any MacBook Air ever made.
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:39.300]  It gets better scores than the current one-port MacBook,
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.480]  and it gets about the same performance
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.840]  as a 2013 MacBook Pro.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.960]  It's only three years behind the MacBook Pro in performance.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:49.120]  And I know there's some people who say,
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.780]  we can't really compare Geekbench numbers
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:52.260]  for ARM versus Intel.
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:54.100]  There's differences, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:57.140]  But in broad terms, it's unbelievable
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:00.980]  how fast Apple's A-series chips are catching up on Intel.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:03.760]  Because even if you say that what I'm calling
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.300]  equivalent numbers between these phones
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.080]  and a 2013 MacBook Pro,
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.340]  even if you say that that's not quite apples to apples,
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:11.660]  it's more apples to oranges
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.260]  because the differences in the OS
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.900]  and differences in the architecture,
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.020]  it is still the truth, though,
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:20.620]  that two or three years ago, the new iPhones,
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.940]  which had every single year better CPUs,
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:26.160]  were not three years ahead of the MacBook Pro.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.860]  They were behind.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.720]  They were five or six years behind.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.840]  And if you go back further,
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.260]  it was more like 10 years behind.
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:36.020]  They're getting more efficient and faster in what they do.
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:38.940]  Yep, and if you look at the graphs
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.500]  that they showed on stage,
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.840]  that's not stopping, it's exhilarating.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.580]  Yeah, and somebody tweeted,
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.940]  well, isn't it funny how you care about benchmarks
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.100]  only when they come out in favor of the Apple product?
[02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:54.420]  And that's, but that's not true.
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:56.100]  It's, I'll admit, I mean,
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:58.380]  I've been using a Mac nonstop since 1991
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.220]  when I first got,
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:00.980]  that's the first time I owned my own computer.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.540]  And between 1991 and 2007,
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.300]  when you could buy an Intel-based Mac,
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.740]  most of those years,
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:10.740]  the Mac had slower performance dollar for dollar
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.180]  compared to the Intel PCs.
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.020]  And if you were really into performance,
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.360]  if you're doing something intensive
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.600]  and you wanted to spend the most money you could,
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:21.180]  for most of those years,
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:23.380]  the, you know, if you wanted the fastest computer
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:26.260]  you could buy, it was gonna be the Intel machine.
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:31.140]  And I would say, well, I used a Mac all those years,
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:32.720]  not because I didn't care,
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.860]  but because it didn't,
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:37.180]  wasn't outweighed by the other advantages of using a Mac.
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:38.220]  And it seemed true today.
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:40.740]  If the, if it were, the tables returned
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.900]  and Samsung phones and whatever else uses Qualcomm's chips
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:48.800]  got double the single core Geekbench numbers as the iPhone,
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.340]  I would still use an iPhone.
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.760]  And I would admit it, but it would, it would be,
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:56.180]  hey, weighing all the pros and cons, this is a con,
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.180]  but it doesn't, isn't outweighed by the other thing.
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:01.300]  Well, you know, for me in all of these reviews that I do,
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:04.980]  whether it's the Mac, which I love my Mac, I really do,
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.060]  but whether it's a Mac, an iPad, an iPhone, a watch,
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.580]  I always review it and how I use it
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:16.060]  and how it fits into the lifestyle that I have set up.
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:19.100]  Is this something that I'm trying to shoehorn in?
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:21.740]  In which case, no, that's not gonna work for me,
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:24.580]  but is it something that just kind of slides
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:26.820]  into what I normally do?
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.780]  And yes, this is a great product and here's how I use it.
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:33.260]  You may use it differently, but here's how I use it.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:37.740]  I never mentioned, you know, oh, this is,
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:40.940]  this is super fast at doing these types of calculations
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.580]  because that's not how I use it.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:44.980]  So I wouldn't know that.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.780]  Here's what I think it really pays off
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:48.860]  is it doesn't really pay off in like,
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:51.420]  oh, I'm doing this super computationally expensive thing
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:53.620]  and it's faster on my iPhone than it would be on an Android.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.740]  I think it's the results where real people benefit
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:00.620]  from Apple's serious edge in chip design
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.100]  is in energy efficiency.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:04.780]  So it's not so much what the iPhone can do
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.780]  at peak performance.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.100]  It's that the iPhone doesn't have to break a sweat
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:09.980]  to get good enough performance
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:14.140]  and therefore can you get better battery life.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:15.260]  Yeah.
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:17.300]  So what I've heard, so there's this,
[02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:20.420]  the new quad core design of the A10 Fusion
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:23.620]  has two cores that run optimized for speed
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.860]  and two cores that run optimized for power
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:27.660]  and Apple builds the power efficient ones
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:30.500]  as being one fifth the energy of the other ones.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.340]  So if you're doing something computationally expensive,
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:33.580]  it's gonna use the fast ones
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:35.300]  and then like Phil Schuler's example
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:37.260]  is if you're just reading email,
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:39.380]  then it's gonna shift to those low power ones
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:41.500]  that are one fifth the power.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:44.180]  I mean, it's a serious difference in energy consumption
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:47.700]  and what I heard, the scuttlebutt I heard last week
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:50.260]  was that they are, and I'm gonna wait
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:52.340]  for like the non-tech guys to figure this out,
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.820]  but the gist that I don't,
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:54.940]  because I don't know how I would test it,
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:55.940]  but the gist I heard is that
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:58.780]  they are effectively A8 performance.
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:02.540]  So they're the performance of the two year old iPhone 6,
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:07.540]  but at one fifth the power of the current high end cores
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.060]  and the A6, the thing is,
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:11.860]  if you look at those Geekbench numbers,
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:15.340]  the iPhone 6 is still at single core performance.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:19.140]  It's on par with the top of the line Android phones today.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:21.900]  So when you're running in low power mode on the iPhone,
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:24.580]  you're still getting the single core performance
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:28.660]  of the top of the line Samsung Galaxy Note.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:29.740]  It's pretty crazy.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:30.860]  Now, which is crazy.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:33.060]  Do you plug your phone in during the day?
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:38.500]  I do normally, but with the plus, I don't.
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:40.260]  I don't, you know.
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.380]  It's absolutely a difference in habit.
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:45.100]  Like day to day with the iPhone 6S,
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.740]  when I'm at my desk, I plug it in at least once
[02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.380]  and then it easily gets through the day.
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:54.860]  With the, so we're recording at 7 p.m. Eastern time
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:59.100]  as we record my iPhone 7 Plus,
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:00.380]  which is my main phone right now,
[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:03.820]  the testing, the review unit, is at 84% battery.
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:05.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:07.260]  I'm about the same.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:12.260]  And you know, most days, I, actually, no.
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:18.460]  There isn't a day when I plug in my Plus.
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:21.940]  I run all day till the end of the day when I go to bed,
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:25.600]  I plug it in overnight, get up in the morning, unplug it,
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.700]  and go for the full day again.
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:29.820]  So that's how I use that phone.
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:33.500]  You know, you said you get asked it, I get asked it.
[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:34.460]  Which phone should I buy?
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:37.060]  The first question is, do you mind the big size?
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:37.900]  Yeah.
[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:39.500]  And if the answer to that question is no,
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:41.380]  then you're done, go get it, right?
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:43.340]  If you don't mind the big size,
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.740]  or you actually prefer it,
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:46.220]  then there's no question you should get it.
[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:47.060]  Yeah.
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.020]  What about your jet black?
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:53.060]  Do you have any scratches on your jet black?
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.540]  No, nothing real big.
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:58.700]  I mean, hair, those micro abrasions.
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:06:59.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:01.240]  I know some people have called them euphemism,
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.620]  but I think it's actually right.
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:05.180]  A scratch, to me, in my mind,
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.060]  is something you can feel with your finger.
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:07.900]  Right.
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:10.420]  Or even just your fingernail.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:12.560]  The scratches that I see on the back
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:16.820]  of my jet black iPhone 7, I cannot feel.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:17.660]  Exactly.
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:19.220]  I cannot feel, even with my fingernail, I can't feel.
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:21.020]  Now maybe if I used it longer,
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.700]  it would pick up scratches like that.
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:24.940]  But that's, I think micro abrasion is a good word for it.
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:27.260]  I see it when I put it at the right light
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:28.500]  and reflect light on it.
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:31.780]  Yes, and that's something that I actually had to do
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.860]  in order to see them, was to kind of tilt it
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:39.700]  and say, oh, yeah, okay, maybe that was my keys
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:41.140]  or something like that.
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:43.420]  Right now, I have an order, but my plan is
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:45.740]  I'm gonna get a regular iPhone 7 in jet black.
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:47.180]  I'm gonna use it for a year.
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:49.560]  I'm not gonna put it in a case.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.980]  In fact, the whole reason I wanna get it
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.320]  is because the grippiness means,
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:54.540]  the only reason I would even think about
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:57.720]  putting an iPhone in a case is just the lack of grippiness
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.620]  of these aluminum finishes.
[02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:01.040]  So I'm definitely not gonna put it in a case.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.180]  And I fully expect the year from now
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:06.280]  when I back it up for the last time
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:09.240]  to use the backup to put into an iPhone 7S
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:10.820]  or an iPhone 8 or whatever they're gonna call
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:12.700]  next year's iPhones, that it's gonna be
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.780]  all scratched up on the back, and I don't care.
[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.460]  I don't care either.
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:19.640]  And that's, see, as much as you say
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.260]  the first question is, do you mind the bigger size,
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.420]  I think the second question is,
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:26.140]  do you mind it being all scratched up after a year?
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.940]  Yeah, and do you mind being able to see fingerprints
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:29.380]  during the day and stuff like that?
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:31.140]  And if they do have, I know it's a question
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:33.820]  people have asked, they do have an oleophobic coating
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:37.060]  on the whole thing, so it does rub,
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:38.640]  when you rub it on your jeans or whatever
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.100]  to clear the fingerprints, it's easy.
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:44.100]  The screen clears up a fingerprint just as easily as,
[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:45.700]  or the back clears up a fingerprint
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.580]  just as easily as the front.
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:50.580]  But it starts picking up again as soon as you flip it around.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.620]  I don't care either.
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:53.300]  It just doesn't bother me.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:55.300]  I care less about, I do like to have a phone
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.540]  that looks cool, and so both blacks look cool.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.500]  Yes.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.260]  But I care more about how it feels.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:03.300]  All right, we're running short on time.
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.820]  What would you rather talk about more?
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.220]  Would you rather talk about AirPods more,
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:08.460]  or Apple Watch Series 2 more?
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:13.460]  Oh, well, we did talk about AirPods a little bit earlier.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.120]  I will say, just a quick note on AirPods,
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:22.480]  people have been going insane, losing their minds
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.080]  that these things are gonna fall out of your ears
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  when you're running, they're gonna, the sound isn't good.
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:31.580]  They've never had them.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:33.140]  They've never touched them.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:37.300]  And it's all these people that have never had the AirPods
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:39.320]  that are saying how bad they are.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.980]  Well, I have exercised in them.
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:47.980]  I've lifted weights, I've walked, I tried.
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:51.480]  I don't run often, but I ran a bit.
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  I tilted my head sideways.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:56.140]  I did everything but do cartwheels
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:57.300]  with these things in my ear.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.540]  They have never fallen out.
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:00.660]  No, I've been running with them.
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:03.580]  I mean, and again, it might vary ear by ear,
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:07.300]  but, and for me, they fit so well that I was confident.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.780]  I knew as soon as I put them in, I was like,
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:09.620]  oh, I could go running.
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:10.620]  It's no doubt.
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:14.020]  I mean, maybe out of everybody who listens to the show,
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:16.500]  surely somebody's got ears that are of different shape
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.460]  and you're gonna, but you're gonna know when you put it in
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:21.520]  whether it's a good fit or not.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:26.520]  I don't, I just, I don't know why people do that,
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.980]  but yeah, here's, so here's the thing.
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:34.300]  I think, and this is the big tell over time to me
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:38.180]  is how much of this is about Apple wanting,
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:42.000]  seeing these AirPods as the future of audio, personal audio,
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:45.380]  and how much of it is a money grab?
[02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.880]  How much of it is that they wanna make money
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.180]  selling $159 headphones?
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:53.020]  I believe, and it's just, you know,
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:55.660]  it's not entirely uninformed, but I, you know, who knows?
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.460]  Maybe the person I spoke to is full of shit,
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:01.060]  but I believe that they price them as low as they could
[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:02.820]  and that if they could've sold them for 129,
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.060]  they would've sold them for 129,
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.700]  and if they could've sold them for 99,
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:07.260]  they would've sold them for 99,
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:11.940]  and I think the fact that 159 is such an oddball price
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:14.860]  is, it's that it's the direct result of the,
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:17.080]  I'm not saying they're selling them at cost.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.700]  I'm saying, though, that they're selling them at cost times
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.060]  whatever minimal profit Tim Cook and Jeff Williams,
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:25.200]  you know, want out of these things,
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.860]  but the margins on these things, I think,
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:30.300]  are significantly lower than Apple's typical margins
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:32.300]  and that they're not selling them for a profit.
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.460]  They wanted to sell them.
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.300]  This is the lowest price we can get away
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:36.860]  with selling them at and make a profit,
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:39.740]  and 159 is a very unusual price.
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:42.500]  Even 149 would've been more typical for Apple,
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:46.140]  and here's the way, I mean, we won't know until next year,
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.880]  but here's the tell, if next year there's still 159,
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:54.100]  well, maybe the price of making them didn't come down.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:55.500]  Two years from now, though,
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:58.220]  if they don't get the price down to 129 or 99
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.260]  or something like that, then okay,
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:02.600]  I would then concede that they are trying
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.060]  to make money selling AirPods.
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:09.520]  I expect that next year and or the year after that,
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.160]  the price is gonna go down on AirPods
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.760]  because they really want these
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:14.860]  to be in as many years as possible,
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.720]  and it's more important than making a profit.
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:23.220]  I don't think at all that this is a money grab,
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:26.740]  and the reason I don't think that
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:29.400]  is because if it was a money grab,
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:33.580]  they didn't have to do all of these extra things
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:34.420]  that they did.
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:36.380]  They could just make a set of Bluetooth headphones,
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:38.980]  or they could've said, yes, our partner, Beats,
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:41.620]  has these Bluetooth headphones.
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:46.180]  I think that they are trying to do two things,
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:48.740]  well, one and two.
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:52.060]  The first is that I think they are moving to wireless,
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:54.100]  and I think in order to move to wireless,
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:56.420]  they needed to build this W1 chip,
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:01.320]  and this is the first that we're seeing of this chip.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:06.500]  They're solving problems along the way.
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:09.920]  They're solving wireless issues along the way.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.520]  They're giving us features in wireless
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.820]  that we've never had before,
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.740]  and to me, that is not a money grab.
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:20.700]  Those are features that users will be able to use,
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:23.260]  and I agree wholeheartedly with you
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:25.060]  that in two years, they want these
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:28.840]  in as many people's ears as they can possibly get.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.840]  Yeah, I think, this is my hope,
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:33.240]  and I really think that this is what I would bet on
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.580]  is that the price will go down steadily over time,
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.340]  year over year, and I don't know how many years it'll take,
[02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:41.940]  but three, four years, it'll be in the box with the iPhone.
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:45.080]  Yeah, yeah, but it can't be yet.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.780]  It's too expensive, because there really are,
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:48.020]  they are two computers.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.960]  When you put them in, they are two computers
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:51.180]  that you're putting in your ear.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:52.580]  This is my favorite detail about how they work.
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:55.340]  I think that they even say this on the marketing site,
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:58.980]  but they're little, I don't know if they run iOS.
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:01.140]  I don't think they do, but they run
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.740]  some kind of operating system.
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:03.580]  They're computers.
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:06.380]  When they're in your ear, they use a motion coprocessor
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:09.700]  to see when your jaw moves, and when your jaw moves,
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:12.100]  that's when the microphone turns on to start listening,
[02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:16.300]  so that you, you know, it's not,
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:18.060]  so like, if you're on a phone call,
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:22.260]  and you're just listening, I'm listening to you talk,
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:25.340]  the microphone isn't going for me.
[02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:29.300]  It's not wasting battery life on the microphone.
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.660]  It waits until my jaw moves for me to start talking
[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:33.620]  before the microphone kicks in,
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:36.360]  and the motion coprocessor is so sensitive
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.480]  that it can pick up when my jaw moves.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:39.320]  Yeah.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:40.140]  That's crazy.
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:40.980]  Crazy.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:43.980]  Now, I asked them, I don't know if you talked to them
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:47.700]  about this, but because I do this,
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:49.600]  I said, what happens if I'm walking down the street
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:54.260]  singing Aussie, you know, with my headphones in?
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.340]  And they said, they looked at me kind of weird,
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:57.980]  and I said, yeah, I know, but I do it.
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:14:59.100]  I, you know, I do it.
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:01.460]  And they said, well, the microphone will come on,
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:02.300]  because it won't.
[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.120]  It won't?
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:03.960]  It will.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:05.740]  Oh, but why would it come on if it wasn't even thinking
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:06.580]  about listening to you?
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:08.460]  Because it's not in a context where it needs any,
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.280]  it doesn't do-
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:10.340]  Yo, dingus.
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:12.780]  I shouldn't have said that, but I think that they're wrong.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.620]  I don't, I don't, sorry if anybody's Siri kicked in.
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:21.620]  Oh, my God.
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:24.240]  No, I don't think it will,
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.100]  because that's why you have to double tap to get Siri.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:29.340]  You have to double tap for Siri,
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:30.180]  so it's not always listening.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:32.500]  Only on the phone, on the watch, that doesn't work.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.840]  But on the EarPods, it does.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.860]  I don't think the microphone is listening to you
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:40.380]  just because you're singing Ozzy
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:41.620]  while you walk down the street.
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:43.740]  I think you could do, you should do a battery test.
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:46.620]  Spend an hour without singing, and spend an hour singing.
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:48.260]  I think you'll see the same battery life.
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:49.940]  The battery life difference between these
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.940]  and other Bluetooth EarPods, you know,
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:55.260]  obviously those big over-the-ear ones from Beats,
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:57.220]  you know, they get 40 hours of battery life.
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:58.060]  I know, I know.
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:15:59.120]  It's crazy.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:00.760]  But these get so much better battery life.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:03.500]  Samsung released a pair of similar EarPods,
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.420]  the ones that come with a case that charges,
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:07.120]  they get 90 minutes of battery life.
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:09.820]  This is a product that Samsung released two months ago.
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:16.100]  These get, the five hours they advertise are totally legit.
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:17.680]  I mean, I think they undersold it,
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:19.100]  because I took a cross-country flight
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.940]  and listened to music most of the time and got home,
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:23.140]  and I had 44% battery life left.
[02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:24.440]  Oh, wow.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.660]  Yeah, I said that I think that they were being conservative.
[02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:31.220]  Yeah, now that said, like when I went to the bathroom,
[02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:33.220]  or I forget what I did, or a couple times during,
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:35.020]  or takeoff and landing, for example,
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.100]  you have to take them off, you know,
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:37.660]  turn the Bluetooth off, and I put them in the case.
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:39.940]  So they did get to sip from the charger,
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:41.580]  but that's typical use.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:44.580]  I didn't do anything a normal person wouldn't do
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:46.820]  who wanted to listen to music and podcasts
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.960]  during the flight the whole time.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:50.020]  So I listened to it for most of a transcontinental flight
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.180]  and had 44% battery life.
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.440]  Well, here's something interesting.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:17:02.660]  The AirPods never went to zero charge unless I wanted it to.
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:04.020]  So I never got them down.
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.300]  I never got them below 40%.
[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:08.340]  And that's one of those problems of five-day review.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.780]  Or I haven't really written my AirPod review.
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:10.940]  I guess I should let them run down,
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:12.820]  but I couldn't get the battery to run down.
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.380]  I ran it down to zero.
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.300]  But I use them.
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:17.340]  I use earphones all the time, because.
[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:20.860]  Hey, what kind of indication do you get when it gets low?
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.380]  Does the phone tell you?
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.420]  Do they beep or something?
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:24.860]  There was a beep in my ear.
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:26.460]  I noticed it actually last night,
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.460]  because they went down to 11%.
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.820]  And I heard something in my ear, and I thought, that's weird.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.420]  What was that?
[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:36.060]  And when I checked the battery, it was down.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:39.260]  It said 11% at that point.
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:42.980]  So the only time that they died is when I wanted them to.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:47.340]  Now, it took, I'll say, less than 15 minutes
[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:51.540]  to get to 100% charging.
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.060]  It's crazy.
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:54.460]  So it was incredible.
[02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:55.820]  I put them in the charger.
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:58.500]  And 10 minutes later, I looked.
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:00.980]  And they were almost, it was like at 75%.
[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:03.380]  And I thought, wow, this is crazy.
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:07.420]  And if I had kept checking at that point,
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:10.260]  I would have probably seen it at 11, 12 minutes,
[02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:13.220]  where it was completely charged.
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:15.540]  But I had to go in and get a beer.
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:18.940]  So by the time I got back, they were completely charged.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.340]  And I'll be conservative and say 15 minutes.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.300]  But I think it was less.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:28.060]  From zero, absolute zero dead.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.180]  That's crazy.
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.420]  I still haven't written a full AirPods review,
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:33.420]  because I even wrote my review.
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:34.420]  I just ran out of time.
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:38.180]  Again, it's just the nature of being a one-person shop.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:40.500]  I don't have colleagues to review the watch
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.580]  while I review the phone or anything like that.
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.820]  And I really honestly believe that the AirPods
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.900]  deserve their full review.
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:49.220]  They don't deserve to be like a little section of an iPhone
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:52.700]  review, because they're that interesting.
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:55.580]  I had a friend yesterday ask whether I
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:58.340]  think Apple would ever do a wearable computer smaller
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:18:59.500]  than a watch.
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:01.220]  And I said, I think they already did.
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.740]  I think that the AirPods legitimately
[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:05.300]  qualify as a wearable computer.
[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:09.340]  Well, here are a couple of other things that, just cool things.
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:14.540]  You have the AirPods in your ears.
[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:19.660]  You take one out, and your music will pause automatically.
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.420]  You put them back in, and the music
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:24.180]  will begin playing again automatically.
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:25.740]  And you can do that with either one,
[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:27.260]  because as you mentioned earlier,
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:30.780]  they're both equally as smart.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:33.460]  You can double tap on it, and it'll
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:35.340]  activate Siri on your phone.
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:37.540]  Double tap if you're listening from your watch,
[02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:41.260]  and it'll play pause the music.
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:43.660]  So here's something I did the other day quite by accident.
[02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:44.900]  And I didn't mean to do this.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:48.220]  I had music playing on a playlist from my watch.
[02:19:48.220 --> 02:19:51.580]  I walked over and pressed Siri on my phone.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:53.980]  The headphones connected to the phone
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:57.220]  and was waiting for me to give my question.
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:59.340]  So I asked the question.
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:02.140]  It gave me the answer.
[02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:03.460]  And then I left everything.
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:04.900]  I didn't touch a thing.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:08.100]  And in five seconds, it reverted back to the watch
[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.820]  and started playing my song again.
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:12.140]  That's pretty cool.
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:13.380]  That is very cool.
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:18.980]  It's switching among devices on the fly.
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:20.660]  So I thought that was great.
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:27.580]  I think, and I don't know how much of this is software.
[02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:29.660]  I don't know how much of it is microphones.
[02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:33.940]  I don't know how much of it is the cloud back end.
[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:38.100]  But Siri voice dictation, just does Siri
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:41.100]  understand the words that you're saying to Siri,
[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:42.860]  is better than ever.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:45.220]  And so today, I picked up my son from school.
[02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:46.100]  It was a beautiful day.
[02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:47.460]  So we walked.
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:49.020]  And I was a little bit late.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.460]  And I was listening to podcasts.
[02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:52.340]  And so I double tapped my AirPod.
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:53.960]  Never took the phone out of my pocket.
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.900]  Double tapped.
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:57.900]  I got the little doot-doot.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:00.500]  And I said, text Jonas.
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:04.260]  I'm running a few minutes behind, probably five minutes
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:06.460]  late, period.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:08.020]  And I waited.
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.020]  And it was just the right amount of time
[02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:11.500]  to make sure I was done talking.
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:15.220]  And then Siri said, OK, John, here's the text.
[02:21:15.220 --> 02:21:16.940]  Here's the message I'm going to send.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:18.740]  And she read the whole thing.
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:22.820]  She got every single word of it exactly right, word for word.
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:25.940]  And then she was like, what should I do?
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:27.380]  And I think that's what she did.
[02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:28.980]  And it was like, I got the doot-doot.
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.100]  And I said, send it.
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:31.340]  And then she said, OK, send.
[02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:34.820]  And then, like you said, a beat or two later,
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:38.420]  the podcast just started playing again.
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:39.940]  That is cool.
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:41.540]  And again, I know people have complaints
[02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:42.920]  about Siri dictation or whatever.
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:45.220]  But this is a major city thoroughfare
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:46.100]  here in Philadelphia.
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:47.020]  And it wasn't quiet.
[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:52.600]  I mean, this was a pretty big street with lots of traffic.
[02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:54.600]  And it couldn't have been a better experience.
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:56.500]  And here, it's summer.
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:58.740]  It feels like summer, at least, and I've got shorts on.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.780]  It wouldn't be that hard.
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:02.700]  But that would be so much better in the winter
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.500]  when I don't want to take my phone out
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:06.220]  if I've got gloves on or something like that,
[02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:08.260]  or if I just want to take the glove off enough just
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.660]  so that the, that's curious.
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:12.780]  I have to test that, whether a double tap on the headphones
[02:22:12.780 --> 02:22:13.540]  works with gloves.
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:14.540]  I don't know.
[02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:16.380]  But anyway, great product.
[02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:18.580]  I only have a few minutes left before we got to wrap.
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:21.020]  But anything else on AirPods?
[02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:23.060]  You want to just talk about Apple Watch Series 2?
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:26.060]  Yeah, Apple Watch Series 2.
[02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:29.860]  I don't want to toot my own horn.
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:33.700]  But I really feel like my Apple Watch Series 2 review,
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:36.140]  I feel like I really expressed my feelings on it
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:38.660]  as well as I can express on anything else,
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:41.900]  that it's, they've, Apple, this is my take, in the nut.
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:45.660]  Apple really got, had a loose handle
[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:50.100]  on what the watch should be two years ago originally.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:52.580]  In the intervening two years, figured out
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:56.140]  what it is good for and what people want to buy it for.
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:57.220]  Focused on those things.
[02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:59.940]  They made the parts that are good, better, fitness
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:03.460]  tracking, and they made the parts that were problems.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:07.580]  They really fixed, in order, the top problems on the phone.
[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.620]  Or not the phone, the watch.
[02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:14.220]  And it's just a very, very impressive
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:15.940]  second generation device in terms
[02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:19.300]  of how much of the low-hanging, the problems they fixed,
[02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:21.060]  and how much better they made the features
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:22.460]  that people really are using.
[02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:24.260]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:25.300]  That sums it up.
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:27.980]  Couldn't agree more.
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:33.100]  For me, it actually, it allowed me some freedom.
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:37.300]  And if you've ever left home without your phone,
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:42.340]  you know, when you realize it, you think, oh my god.
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:43.020]  No phone.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:46.340]  But when you leave home without your phone on purpose,
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:49.620]  you have a kind of a freedom.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:52.420]  But I never leave home without my phone.
[02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:53.500]  Now I do.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:58.140]  With my watch, with the GPS, I have my AirPods.
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:59.100]  I put those in.
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:00.620]  I have a playlist on my watch.
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:02.060]  I press play.
[02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:05.140]  It shuffles through all the songs that I've loved.
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.180]  And I just, I walk.
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:11.500]  And it's so good, you know, to have that 30 minutes or 35
[02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:14.620]  minutes away from everything.
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:18.140]  And the GPS still captures all the data
[02:24:18.140 --> 02:24:20.340]  that I want about my walk.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:26.260]  I can, as soon as I walk in the door, it syncs to my phone.
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:29.380]  And I can look on my phone, which I did the other day.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:34.060]  I walked in, grabbed my phone, sat down, and, you know,
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:35.820]  pulled it up, and all the information
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.860]  was already there on my phone.
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:39.900]  And I just looked.
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:41.300]  It's wonderful.
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:41.800]  It's great.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:47.780]  I do think, too, that people are underestimating.
[02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:51.420]  Because the watch, in addition to those things
[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:54.080]  we said about the watch, I mean, it is clearly
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:56.460]  growing independent, right?
[02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:57.380]  Yes.
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:59.020]  You know, this is second generation.
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:03.680]  But the GPS is a very nice bit of independence.
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:06.100]  It is obviously going to eventually
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:07.180]  be an independent device.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:08.340]  It's going to have its own networking.
[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.060]  And it's going to do a lot of stuff
[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:13.340]  without a phone tethered to it.
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:16.360]  That world, where the phone or the watch
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.020]  is like an independent personal computer,
[02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:19.380]  needs wireless headphones.
[02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:21.580]  There's never going to be, there never is or never
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:25.140]  would have been a headphone jack on an Apple watch.
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:26.340]  Yep.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:27.620]  Right?
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:28.940]  No.
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:29.580]  Yeah.
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:31.020]  No way.
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:34.540]  You know, I think part of the backwards-looking aspect
[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:39.140]  of the people who are so angry about this headphone jack being
[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:46.420]  removed is that you can argue about whether the phone is
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:48.660]  big enough to have a headphone jack.
[02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:53.140]  But every device smaller than that is too small.
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:58.020]  Yeah, stuff like that is just not going to happen.
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:00.900]  But that's why I don't think that this whole wire
[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:02.500]  was thing as a money grab.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:06.420]  I think that it's more than that.
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.620]  I do too.
[02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:10.140]  Jim, I thank you for your time.
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:11.380]  I think that's just about it.
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:13.140]  I think it's a good quick take.
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:19.420]  Got to leave stuff for subsequent episodes.
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.980]  Everybody can find all the Dalrymple
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:23.420]  they want at your website, The Loop.
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:27.620]  It's loopinsight.com is the address.
[02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:30.580]  Your podcast, what do you got for podcasts?
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:31.580]  The Dalrymple Report.
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:33.660]  It's linked right off The Loop's home page.
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:34.900]  Yeah, good podcast.
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:41.060]  And on Twitter, you are J Dalrymple.
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.580]  Yeah, right.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:43.900]  Well, I thank you for the time.
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:45.020]  It was good seeing you last week.
[02:26:45.020 --> 02:26:45.420]  Really good seeing you.
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:45.920]  Thank you.
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:49.260]  Yeah, it's always great to be able to sit down,
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:53.700]  have a beer or a cup of coffee, and catch up
[02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:56.380]  on everything that's happened.
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:59.580]  All right, and my thanks to our sponsors today.
[02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:02.980]  Audible.com, that's where you go to get audiobooks and audio
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:03.500]  shows.
