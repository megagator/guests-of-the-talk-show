[00:00.000 --> 00:07.240]  Yeah, it does kind of feel like like I just discovered Phil's in San Francisco once last
[00:07.240 --> 00:11.240]  year and I'm probably never going to go there again.
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.240]  Guess what though?
[00:12.240 --> 00:18.280]  I looked on the map and there is a Phil Z within a few blocks of the San Jose Convention
[00:18.280 --> 00:19.280]  Center.
[00:19.280 --> 00:20.280]  Oh, yeah.
[00:20.280 --> 00:21.280]  All right.
[00:21.280 --> 00:22.320]  In that case, we're going there a lot.
[00:22.320 --> 00:28.480]  It's like not right across the street, but it's probably about as close as the one just
[00:28.480 --> 00:29.480]  couple blocks.
[00:29.480 --> 00:30.480]  Yeah.
[00:30.480 --> 00:31.480]  That was a good place.
[00:31.480 --> 00:35.760]  I do wonder how different the culture of San – I've never been to San Jose.
[00:35.760 --> 00:42.960]  Like I've been only a handful of times in Silicon Valley at all and so San Jose is even
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.600]  less familiar to me than the rest of it, but you've gone to a couple of events here and
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.600]  there, right?
[00:49.600 --> 00:57.620]  Yeah, including the only time I ever set foot in San Jose was the 2012 October event.
[00:57.620 --> 01:03.120]  So it was the one – a month after the big iPhone event, they did iPads and I think that
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.620]  was when the current form factor of the iMac debuted with the thin side, not yet retina
[01:09.620 --> 01:17.760]  of course, and was the last public event Apple held while Scott Forstall was an executive.
[01:17.760 --> 01:25.400]  Yeah, that was – I still remember like the day that he was officially announced as being
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.400]  out.
[01:26.400 --> 01:29.240]  And actually Tiff and I were on vacation in Seattle and I was like in this weird clothing
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.200]  store with her like killing time on my phone and I'm trying to catch up on what the heck
[01:33.200 --> 01:34.200]  just happened.
[01:34.200 --> 01:35.200]  Everyone was exploding about it.
[01:35.200 --> 01:37.200]  It was pretty cool.
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.120]  So speaking of our iMacs though, I have a bone to pick with you about – because I
[01:42.120 --> 01:48.160]  believe that you and I have the same 2014 first gen 5K iMac.
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.360]  Correct.
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.920]  Does yours have problems with image retention?
[01:51.920 --> 01:53.560]  No.
[01:53.560 --> 01:54.560]  You're lucky.
[01:54.560 --> 01:55.560]  Either that or –
[01:55.560 --> 01:56.560]  Exactly.
[01:56.560 --> 01:57.560]  I don't see it.
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.640]  It's possible that maybe if my eyes were what they used to be, I would see it.
[02:02.640 --> 02:03.920]  But it doesn't seem like it does.
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.120]  Well, here's why you would see it in particular.
[02:07.120 --> 02:11.920]  Because the most common place I see it – this just started happening over the last few months
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.640]  and it's –
[02:13.640 --> 02:15.640]  I know exactly what you're going to say.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.680]  It just started happening over the last few months and it's getting worse quickly.
[02:19.680 --> 02:22.560]  And so what happens is – I'm not talking about burn-in.
[02:22.560 --> 02:25.680]  Like on Plasma TV you have something burned in forever.
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.280]  I'm talking about LCD image retention where basically you kind of see like the ghost image
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.040]  of what was there before for a few minutes and it like fades over like a minute or two.
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.240]  So like if you have something high contrast up for five or ten minutes, say.
[02:41.240 --> 02:44.000]  So for instance, when you're podcasting and you have a couple windows up that might
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.140]  have like text notes or the Skype window or whatever else, and then you go to your web
[02:48.140 --> 02:56.800]  browser and you load a dark gray website, then you will see the shadows of your formerly
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.020]  in those spots black and white windows.
[03:00.020 --> 03:03.640]  You will see those very clearly against the gray background of the website you're looking
[03:03.640 --> 03:04.640]  at.
[03:04.640 --> 03:05.640]  Yeah, it's like 4a5 –
[03:05.640 --> 03:07.360]  So this almost always gets me.
[03:07.360 --> 03:09.360]  4a5, 2, 5a.
[03:09.360 --> 03:10.360]  Exactly.
[03:10.360 --> 03:16.260]  I, on my previous display – and it was ancient – I used to talk about it on a podcast,
[03:16.260 --> 03:22.600]  but before getting this 5K iMac – what was that, like two and a half years ago now?
[03:22.600 --> 03:23.600]  I guess?
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.600]  Yeah, something like that.
[03:24.600 --> 03:32.840]  I was using a 20-inch Apple Cinema Display, not 24-inch, 20-inch from – oh, geez, must
[03:32.840 --> 03:35.520]  be like 2000 or 2002 or something.
[03:35.520 --> 03:36.520]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.680]  It was really – maybe it wasn't quite that old, but it was really pretty old.
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.760]  And I was sort of in a Syracuse situation where I – it was long past the point where
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.880]  I could have easily afforded to replace it, and there were all sorts of good options I
[03:52.880 --> 03:53.880]  could have bought.
[03:53.880 --> 03:59.120]  But I was sort of hoping for something retina forever and ever and ever, and so I just kept
[03:59.120 --> 04:00.120]  putting it off.
[04:00.120 --> 04:04.200]  It's like, there's no way I'm spending $1000 on an Apple, even no matter how – I guess
[04:04.200 --> 04:07.040]  they were 30-inch for a while and then they went to 27-inch.
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.980]  But I just didn't feel like buying it not to have retina, knowing that retina would
[04:10.980 --> 04:14.000]  come out any year now for years and years and years.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.280]  So my – I was using – and that display, after – it must have been – it had to
[04:18.280 --> 04:22.040]  be at least 10 years old, and I'd used it every day, had terrible image retention.
[04:22.040 --> 04:26.080]  And I knew exactly where you were going because my website was the number one culprit.
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.560]  Yeah, because like most – if you're dealing with other black and white windows, you don't
[04:30.560 --> 04:31.720]  really see it as often.
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.040]  But when you've had something black and white up for a while and then you switch to
[04:35.040 --> 04:38.960]  a large expanse of gray, you see it very clearly.
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.080]  And my initial thought is always, I didn't realize that Safari was translucent.
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.480]  Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.480]  I always think it's like window translucency, and I'm like, oh, that's a weird design
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.480]  decision.
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.560]  Oh, wait, that isn't a design decision.
[04:50.560 --> 04:51.560]  Right.
[04:51.560 --> 04:54.160]  When I first encountered it, that's exactly what I thought, is I thought that maybe at
[04:54.160 --> 04:59.720]  some point I'd hit some kind of weird – I'd diddled something in the terminal with defaults
[04:59.720 --> 05:00.720]  right.
[05:00.720 --> 05:01.720]  Right.
[05:01.720 --> 05:07.660]  You know, calmed out Apple.Safari slash, you know, space translucency equals 91 or something
[05:07.660 --> 05:08.660]  like that.
[05:08.660 --> 05:09.660]  Right.
[05:09.660 --> 05:10.660]  Exactly.
[05:10.660 --> 05:11.660]  Because that's exactly what it looks like.
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.660]  Sorry about that.
[05:12.660 --> 05:16.480]  But now it's an iMac, and it's my main computer, and so it's like, I don't want
[05:16.480 --> 05:20.520]  to send this thing in for repair and not be with my main computer for like two weeks or
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.520]  however long it takes to get it actually fixed.
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.800]  Like two and a half years under even daily use seems like too soon, honestly.
[05:26.800 --> 05:27.800]  Yeah.
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.520]  And I don't know, like – and then it's like, am I going to get one that has just
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.520]  the same problem?
[05:32.520 --> 05:34.840]  Are they – I'm always worried that they're not even going to believe me or that they're
[05:34.840 --> 05:38.560]  not going to replace it because they don't think it's bad enough, you know.
[05:38.560 --> 05:41.440]  Even though I don't – I mean, there's not – I don't have a lot of basis for
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.440]  those feelings.
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.760]  It's just like, it's such a – it's such a hassle to send away my main computer
[05:46.760 --> 05:47.760]  for repair.
[05:47.760 --> 05:48.760]  Yeah.
[05:48.760 --> 05:49.760]  Especially because it's large.
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.040]  Like if it's a laptop, I could bring them to a Genius Bar and maybe have something faster,
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.040]  maybe.
[05:54.040 --> 05:57.760]  But like because it's such an ordeal to haul this thing anywhere and ship it anywhere,
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.640]  I don't know.
[05:59.640 --> 06:05.380]  My current plan is to just hope that they do something with like an iMac Pro or a Mac
[06:05.380 --> 06:12.080]  Pro sometime this year before my Apple Care runs out in October.
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.080]  And then I can just buy a new one, send this in for repair, and then when I get it back
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.080]  from repair, sell it.
[06:18.080 --> 06:20.720]  Oh, if you've got Apple Care, you should definitely do it, although you have to be
[06:20.720 --> 06:21.720]  without it.
[06:21.720 --> 06:22.720]  But it's a pain.
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.720]  Yeah.
[06:23.720 --> 06:25.800]  It's like I don't want to switch to my new crappy keyboard touch bar.
[06:25.800 --> 06:26.800]  Yeah.
[06:26.800 --> 06:27.800]  You know I haven't bought it.
[06:27.800 --> 06:30.540]  I haven't bought Apple Care since 1991.
[06:30.540 --> 06:33.480]  The only reason I bought it on this – and I'm with you most of the time.
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.760]  The only reason I bought it on this is that Apple Care, the pricing is based on these
[06:37.760 --> 06:40.520]  tiers of the product they apply to.
[06:40.520 --> 06:48.040]  A $1,400 iMac has the same Apple Care cost as a $4,500 fully loaded one.
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.520]  And so I was buying the very first generation of a new thing, of the 5K.
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.840]  And so I thought, you know what, it was only like 200 bucks or something.
[06:56.840 --> 07:01.640]  It was not a lot of money for what was something like a $4,400 configuration because I got
[07:01.640 --> 07:04.360]  like really maxed out because it's my main computer.
[07:04.360 --> 07:06.800]  And I figured, you know what, the ratio there pays off.
[07:06.800 --> 07:10.040]  I don't really get it for anything else, but in cases where like you're buying a
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.680]  really maxed out config of something, it often does pay off because it's such a low relative
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.680]  cost.
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.680]  Yeah.
[07:16.680 --> 07:17.680]  I think we might have literally the same machine.
[07:17.680 --> 07:18.680]  I think we do.
[07:18.680 --> 07:19.680]  Yeah.
[07:19.680 --> 07:21.680]  I know I maxed out the RAM, 32 gigs, and I would have if I could have gotten –
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.680]  Yeah.
[07:22.680 --> 07:23.680]  If you have a terabyte.
[07:23.680 --> 07:24.680]  Right.
[07:24.680 --> 07:27.240]  I think I have a terabyte drive because I don't know why I wouldn't have bought
[07:27.240 --> 07:30.200]  it because it's the only drive I keep attached most of the time.
[07:30.200 --> 07:33.480]  I actually don't even know.
[07:33.480 --> 07:34.480]  That's something.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.480]  Wow.
[07:35.480 --> 07:37.320]  It's got to be a terabyte.
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.080]  I don't see how I would be able to function if it wasn't a terabyte.
[07:41.080 --> 07:44.280]  And then what I get, the four gigahertz Intel Core i7.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.280]  Yep.
[07:45.280 --> 07:46.280]  Yeah.
[07:46.280 --> 07:47.280]  Same thing.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.280]  Yeah.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.280]  Enjoy.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.280]  Enjoy your wonderful screen.
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.280]  You will know quickly if it ever becomes a problem.
[07:51.280 --> 07:52.280]  Yes.
[07:52.280 --> 07:53.280]  It is a terabyte drive.
[07:53.280 --> 07:54.280]  I hear –
[07:54.280 --> 07:55.280]  999.38 gigabytes.
[07:55.280 --> 07:56.280]  Which is bullshit.
[07:56.280 --> 07:57.280]  Only got ripped off.
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.280]  You didn't get the full terabyte.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.280]  Right.
[07:59.280 --> 08:00.280]  Yeah.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.280]  Yeah.
[08:01.280 --> 08:02.280]  Oh, boy.
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.000]  I just hope I get – I hope I can fix this easily.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.440]  I don't know.
[08:05.440 --> 08:10.200]  ATP Tifster said that this was a problem with the one that we have, the 2014, but that they
[08:10.200 --> 08:13.280]  fixed it for the 2015 model, which is still the current model.
[08:13.280 --> 08:17.320]  But he also says they're going to have new ones like in March or whatever.
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.320]  Who knows?
[08:18.320 --> 08:19.320]  Yeah.
[08:19.320 --> 08:20.320]  We can get to March soon.
[08:20.320 --> 08:21.320]  We'll have to get to that.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.320]  Did you see –
[08:22.320 --> 08:26.000]  It kind of sounds like Apple's going to release like 15 things in March.
[08:26.000 --> 08:32.440]  That's kind of what – like all the rumors are pointing to like four iPads, new iMacs,
[08:32.440 --> 08:39.080]  new 12-inch MacBook One, and new watch bands and who knows what on the software side, new
[08:39.080 --> 08:41.840]  iPad stuff maybe.
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.640]  There is such a giant list of things that rumor people expect to be launched in March.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.640]  It's kind of ridiculous.
[08:46.640 --> 08:47.840]  Did you see this?
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.120]  I don't – I've been meaning to link to it and I haven't because I forget why.
[08:52.120 --> 08:56.160]  I think it might be because I can't find the guy's name and I keep – you and I
[08:56.160 --> 09:00.880]  ran into the same thing with somebody on Twitter recently, the guy OMD or something like that
[09:00.880 --> 09:01.880]  or –
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.400]  Yeah, yeah, who didn't – he like didn't have his name anywhere on any of his stuff
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.200]  and we both wanted to link to him and name him like it's nice and –
[09:09.200 --> 09:10.200]  Right.
[09:10.200 --> 09:11.200]  Like I always –
[09:11.200 --> 09:14.160]  I think he didn't – he responded and it's not like he didn't want to be named.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.160]  At least he gave only a first name or something like that.
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.200]  I heard – and he said something like he's building his brand on OMD or something like
[09:19.200 --> 09:22.800]  that and it's harder for me to link to somebody who's anonymous.
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.680]  The other thing that really gets me and I hate to say it to you but it's true is it
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.040]  was often – it seems like I link a lot less frequently anymore to people who have Tumblr
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.720]  blogs, just anecdotally.
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.480]  But back when Tumblr was sort of at its peak as a blogging platform, like I'm not saying
[09:39.480 --> 09:44.320]  that Tumblr is in decline but I think it's in decline for the sort of blogging that I
[09:44.320 --> 09:46.900]  tend to link to it during Fireball.
[09:46.900 --> 09:51.320]  An awful lot of Tumblr sites don't have the person's real name on it.
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.920]  It's just their Tumblr handle.
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.480]  And that was always a big hassle for me and I'd have to like figure out what their Twitter
[09:57.480 --> 10:00.680]  name was and go to their Twitter page and find their real name from there.
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.440]  Like it didn't even seem like it was people who were trying to hide their name.
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.200]  It's just sort of idiomatic for Tumblr.
[10:06.200 --> 10:07.480]  But anyway, there's this site here –
[10:07.480 --> 10:09.760]  No, and that was actually designed that way.
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.840]  Like we meant it to be – like it's the same way that like one account could have
[10:14.840 --> 10:20.720]  multiple blogs and that there would be no way to tell unless you put it there which
[10:20.720 --> 10:23.680]  blogs belong to which account.
[10:23.680 --> 10:28.920]  It was very easy to create anonymous things that weren't tied to your main identity
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.320]  and that was very much intentional.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.880]  Because like everything else at the time, like keep in mind like we made Tumblr as kind
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.040]  of a response to Myspace and Facebook and like the big social networks that were big
[10:40.040 --> 10:42.400]  when we started it in 2006.
[10:42.400 --> 10:45.280]  And so Twitter wasn't really – I mean Twitter existed but it wasn't big.
[10:45.280 --> 10:48.960]  So it was really a response to those that were all about getting your real name and
[10:48.960 --> 10:51.480]  putting all your stuff out in public under your real name.
[10:51.480 --> 10:56.800]  And you know a lot of people can't or won't give their real name for a lot of the stuff
[10:56.800 --> 10:58.200]  they want to do online.
[10:58.200 --> 11:05.360]  And so you enable a lot more like creativity and different types of uses if you allow people
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.360]  to be anonymous.
[11:06.360 --> 11:10.440]  So that was kind of like the ethos from the beginning of like you can make a different
[11:10.440 --> 11:11.440]  blog.
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.240]  It's not going to like you know look bad upon you.
[11:14.240 --> 11:16.240]  This is before all the hate crap that we have today.
[11:16.240 --> 11:19.040]  Today it might be a little bit different calculation there.
[11:19.040 --> 11:22.920]  But back then you know most of the hate was confined to these fringe forms and stuff and
[11:22.920 --> 11:24.720]  they weren't really on Tumblr.
[11:24.720 --> 11:25.720]  I don't even know what they are now.
[11:25.720 --> 11:26.720]  I don't think they are.
[11:26.720 --> 11:34.280]  But regardless the idea of getting like anonymous identity out there very, very easily was quite
[11:34.280 --> 11:35.840]  a positive thing in 2006.
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.640]  Anyway, I just sent you the link, it's to a guy named Thomas Verschorin at Verschorin.com.
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.120]  He has a Twitter link so I got his name from there.
[11:45.120 --> 11:50.680]  But anyway, he has an interesting speculation here that it's purely his guess, it doesn't
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.400]  seem, he's not claiming any sort of sources.
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.600]  But what he's saying is that when Apple made standalone displays they tend to sell them
[11:56.600 --> 11:57.760]  for a long time.
[11:57.760 --> 12:01.040]  The 27 inch LED display was on sale for three years.
[12:01.040 --> 12:03.960]  The 27 inch Thunderbolt display was on sale for five years.
[12:03.960 --> 12:07.760]  I guess they're still selling it or do they still sell that, right?
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.760]  I don't even know.
[12:08.760 --> 12:09.760]  No.
[12:09.760 --> 12:10.760]  No, no.
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.760]  They just continued like a year and a half ago or something.
[12:11.760 --> 12:14.760]  So you can't even buy an outdated Apple display at this point?
[12:14.760 --> 12:15.760]  No.
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.920]  I mean you might be able to find somebody who has one in stock but they haven't sold
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.400]  them new for a while.
[12:20.400 --> 12:21.720]  So here's his guess.
[12:21.720 --> 12:29.760]  His guess is that Apple didn't want to release a 5K standalone cinema display back in October
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.720]  when they did all the new MacBooks that could use them because they weren't yet ready to
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.840]  sell one with True Tone because they don't have True Tone in the iMac either, none of
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.500]  the desktop Macs do.
[12:40.500 --> 12:44.740]  And so as he says here, his conclusion, if you were Apple what would you choose to do?
[12:44.740 --> 12:50.160]  Release an Apple 5K cinema display in 2016 and then sell it for a few years unchanged
[12:50.160 --> 12:58.520]  without True Tone or push the LG display in 2016 as a stopgap and release an Apple 5K
[12:58.520 --> 13:01.540]  True Tone display sometime in 2017.
[13:01.540 --> 13:07.640]  So is anybody who's still holding onto a thread of hope that Apple hasn't abandoned the standalone
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.760]  display game, which I would not bet on, I kind of suspect that they are done, but there's
[13:13.760 --> 13:17.960]  a wee bit of sense here in my opinion.
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.000]  So the thing about they tend to have these displays that last for a certain amount of
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  time.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  Throw that right out, doesn't matter.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  It doesn't matter how long things have been out, like five years, this is a very small
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.720]  sample size, Apple does not artificially hold things back simply because the last one is
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.760]  only three years old instead of four years old or whatever.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.760]  This is too small of a correlation to matter and that's not how they really work.
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.000]  I think the only question here is whether we believe that they would hold back this
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.120]  display and go through the kind of, assume the LG display was perfect, which it isn't,
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.280]  but assume the LG display was perfect, they still took a big PR hit in order to push that
[13:56.280 --> 14:01.640]  as the solution and to have the idea out there floating unchallenged for months and still
[14:01.640 --> 14:04.080]  so far that they are out of the display business.
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.040]  Yeah, but what if they had no choice?
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.800]  Is that more likely than them wanting to save True Tone for the iMac?
[14:12.800 --> 14:13.800]  They don't sell them any iMacs.
[14:13.800 --> 14:15.220]  They sell a lot more laptops.
[14:15.220 --> 14:22.720]  It would not surprise me if when the Thunderbolt display that they, when they disappeared recently,
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.600]  that one, when it was new, it wouldn't surprise me if that outsold the iMac when it was new.
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.440]  It might not, but they sell a lot of laptops and they sell a lot of these displays for
[14:33.440 --> 14:35.560]  laptops for their laptops.
[14:35.560 --> 14:42.520]  And so I don't see them holding back something that their customers very clearly want, replacing
[14:42.520 --> 14:48.720]  a product that was incredibly out of date only for the purpose of one of its really
[14:48.720 --> 14:53.280]  minor features, like jumping ahead of the iMac getting that same feature.
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.680]  It doesn't seem like that would be important enough to them to justify all the downsides
[14:56.680 --> 14:57.680]  of that strategy.
[14:57.680 --> 15:01.280]  What if the original plan though was like a year in advance or well over a year ago,
[15:01.280 --> 15:08.200]  if they had hoped to also have 5K iMacs at the end of 2016 too with True Tone and the
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.200]  whole thing just fell apart?
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.200]  Maybe.
[15:10.200 --> 15:12.640]  That's plausible, but it just seems...
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.160]  I'm not saying how likely it is, but the whole thing seems plausible to me that it's some
[15:16.160 --> 15:23.800]  sort of engineering slash supply chain screw up or maybe screw up is too harsh of a word,
[15:23.800 --> 15:26.720]  but something didn't go according to plan and that's where they are.
[15:26.720 --> 15:27.720]  I don't know.
[15:27.720 --> 15:28.720]  I still love it.
[15:28.720 --> 15:31.480]  I brought it up the other week on this show and there must be an awful lot of people who
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.440]  listen to my show who don't listen to ATP because I got so much...
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.980]  The best feedback I got was that the observation...
[15:38.980 --> 15:44.440]  We got so much email about ripping off Syracuse's observation from ATP, which I did credit him
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.600]  with that, what does Apple plan to do in their beautiful new campus?
[15:48.600 --> 15:49.960]  Stuff all of these...
[15:49.960 --> 15:55.480]  Which supposedly has a more open floor plan where you'll see more of your colleagues'
[15:55.480 --> 15:56.480]  desks.
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.520]  Are they going to put one of these ugly LG monitors on every single one of these Johnny
[16:00.520 --> 16:03.120]  Ive designed desks?
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.780]  Johnny Ive is bought these off in the woods, nailing desks together out of wood that comes
[16:08.780 --> 16:13.640]  from one special brand of tree that grows in Northern Italy or something and they're
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.820]  going to put ugly LG monitors on all these desks?
[16:18.820 --> 16:23.040]  That's also a good counter argument, but I think it's just as likely that you could just
[16:23.040 --> 16:25.840]  say, well, their solution is just they're going to give most of their engineers and
[16:25.840 --> 16:28.560]  stuff like iMacs.
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.640]  It really does seem like, and again, this could be blown into the water when Apple releases
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.640]  a brand new Mac Pro, iMac Pro, whatever it is in July, but I think that's very unlikely.
[16:38.640 --> 16:42.280]  I think if that was going to happen, we would have a lot more than casual speculation about
[16:42.280 --> 16:43.640]  it by now.
[16:43.640 --> 16:48.320]  The fact that there's nothing in the pipeline to suggest that's happening makes me believe
[16:48.320 --> 16:51.600]  it's definitely not happening this year, if ever.
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.560]  And so I really do think it's very clear that we all have wishful thinking that goes in
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.800]  a different direction, but the reality is it's most likely that Apple really is out
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.500]  of the display business and the Pro desktop business and the Mac mini business and is
[17:06.500 --> 17:11.080]  really just going to make the iMac and the MacBook Pro their only computers going forward.
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.680]  I've heard that, I think I figured if I've talked about this, I've heard that there is
[17:15.680 --> 17:22.320]  a new Mac Pro in the pipeline, but that it is, it sounds ridiculous, but that it's effectively
[17:22.320 --> 17:27.920]  like in a slot where there's so many other machines, whether they're Macs or other things
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.800]  that are getting testing and like validation engineering resources ahead of it, that there's
[17:33.800 --> 17:38.160]  no way it's going to ship by WWDC, which seems ridiculous, but.
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.160]  Well, yeah.
[17:39.160 --> 17:47.560]  Even if they, I mean, here's the thing, most, most people who feel bad about Apple because
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.000]  of the lack of Mac Pro updates at all, they don't necessarily need it to ship at WWDC.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.120]  I think what would, what would calm a lot of fears, my own included, would just be like
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.080]  an acknowledgement and confirmation that something else is coming.
[18:01.080 --> 18:04.880]  Like just confirmation, even if it's one of like one of their like kind of BSE replies
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.200]  to the press, like, you know, keep an eye out this space, you know, whatever else, like
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.720]  something and Tim Cook's like little Q&A response to that internal bulletin board thing a few
[18:13.720 --> 18:15.680]  months back, that wasn't enough.
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.040]  That was actually in fact making things worse, I think, by kind of implying that the iMac
[18:19.040 --> 18:22.560]  was going to be going to be it going forward.
[18:22.560 --> 18:23.840]  That's all we really want here.
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.920]  But again, I just, it's what I want to be true.
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.680]  I want there to be a new Mac Pro of some sort.
[18:31.680 --> 18:37.080]  And if it's, if it's shaped like an iMac, and it has a built in 5k screen, and it just
[18:37.080 --> 18:40.920]  has a Xeon processor in it with like a thicker back for a bigger heatsink, that's fine.
[18:40.920 --> 18:41.920]  I'll take that.
[18:41.920 --> 18:42.920]  That actually sounds kind of nice to me.
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.000]  It wouldn't be as ideal as standalone because then I'd have the same problem I have now
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.400]  when it gets image retention, I have to send the whole thing in.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.400]  But I take it.
[18:49.400 --> 18:50.400]  It's better than nothing.
[18:50.400 --> 18:51.400]  That'd be great.
[18:51.400 --> 18:52.400]  Yeah.
[18:52.400 --> 18:53.400]  And it leads to, I don't know.
[18:53.400 --> 18:54.400]  Leads to weird situations.
[18:54.400 --> 18:58.160]  I mean, again, better than nothing if they made an iMac Pro and put it, somehow put a
[18:58.160 --> 19:04.240]  Xeon in there and solve the heat problems that that would, you know, I say that technically
[19:04.240 --> 19:05.240]  possible.
[19:05.240 --> 19:10.340]  The biggest, I think, I think it's possible, although talking to atp tipster about this
[19:10.340 --> 19:14.760]  a little bit in our chat a few weeks ago, he pointed out that the logic board in the
[19:14.760 --> 19:18.480]  iMac faces the wrong way to really make that happen.
[19:18.480 --> 19:23.520]  Like I think the CPU faces towards you when you're sitting at it, and to drastically improve
[19:23.520 --> 19:28.040]  the heat capacity to be able to cool like a high powered Xeon chip to make it more
[19:28.040 --> 19:32.400]  Mac Pro class processing power, you need to flip the whole logic board around, which kind
[19:32.400 --> 19:35.880]  of be like a redesign on the level of a whole new iMac generation.
[19:35.880 --> 19:42.400]  So the question is like, would Apple really do that for this, you know, relatively low
[19:42.400 --> 19:43.400]  volume?
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.240]  I mean, I guess they designed a whole case before, but like, it sure does seem like they
[19:48.240 --> 19:52.880]  couldn't possibly care less about keeping the Mac Pro updated in any reasonable fashion.
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.520]  And so it really, it's a pretty big question whether they would basically redesign the
[19:57.520 --> 20:03.840]  entire iMac enclosure and a whole new computer just for this line that they haven't given
[20:03.840 --> 20:06.840]  two craps about for three years.
[20:06.840 --> 20:08.720]  It's a real mystery.
[20:08.720 --> 20:13.080]  I think it's part I think the iMac Pro is is possible or that they'll sell it as a pro
[20:13.080 --> 20:14.080]  somehow.
[20:14.080 --> 20:15.360]  I don't know.
[20:15.360 --> 20:19.920]  But I hope I wish for it to be true, but I just don't see it.
[20:19.920 --> 20:24.040]  But there's got to be a reason why they don't just stop selling the Mac Pros.
[20:24.040 --> 20:28.640]  There's some contingent within the company that's clearly hoping for new Mac Pros.
[20:28.640 --> 20:30.780]  Otherwise it would be easier.
[20:30.780 --> 20:35.280]  It would be easier and they'd look less foolish if they had canceled the Mac Pro like at last
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.280]  WWDC.
[20:36.280 --> 20:40.880]  If they just said, hey, these new iMacs are so great that's, you know, it's all that,
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.600]  you know, the time for the standalone is gone, whatever it would, you know, people would
[20:44.600 --> 20:45.600]  disagree obviously.
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.040]  And there'd be people who'd be heartbroken and there'd be people who are furious.
[20:49.040 --> 20:50.600]  But at least Apple wouldn't look foolish.
[20:50.600 --> 20:51.600]  Right?
[20:51.600 --> 20:57.080]  Yeah, because it really looks bad now, like it really like the situation now is is a kind
[20:57.080 --> 20:59.600]  of egregiously bad.
[20:59.600 --> 21:00.600]  It's kind of embarrassing.
[21:00.600 --> 21:01.600]  It's hard to believe.
[21:01.600 --> 21:03.520]  It's really kind of hard to believe how old it is.
[21:03.520 --> 21:05.640]  It really is.
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.080]  And still my biggest regret is that I didn't ask Schiller about it on stage last year and
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.080]  I had the card.
[21:11.080 --> 21:12.080]  I had it.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.080]  I had it on a card.
[21:13.080 --> 21:14.080]  And I did not.
[21:14.080 --> 21:19.240]  Some people understand, but it's so hard to keep that thing going live.
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.820]  And it's my one and only regret from that whole show.
[21:22.820 --> 21:27.040]  The year before when Schiller was on the first time, I had way more regrets afterwards.
[21:27.040 --> 21:31.760]  And I felt like my self-criticism really helped and I did a better job last year.
[21:31.760 --> 21:35.800]  But my one, oh, I can't believe it.
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.240]  And now look at this, we're already at the point where WWDC has been announced again
[21:39.240 --> 21:41.920]  and it still hasn't been answered.
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.520]  And like the one reason why I put it at a lower priority at first and then towards the
[21:46.520 --> 21:52.000]  end when I was wrapping up, I was flipping through the cards I had left and I didn't
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.960]  see that one, which I might have as a last question.
[21:54.960 --> 21:59.000]  But the reason I originally had it lower in the stack was I thought, well, they got to
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  do something in September, right?
[22:01.000 --> 22:09.420]  I can get them on the record now, but it's only for the next two, three months.
[22:09.420 --> 22:12.520]  So anyway, I don't know.
[22:12.520 --> 22:16.720]  It's hard when you're in a situation like what you're doing with these executive
[22:16.720 --> 22:17.880]  interviews.
[22:17.880 --> 22:18.880]  It's hard.
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.040]  And we got a little bit of this from when ATP interviewed Chris Lattner a few weeks
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.040]  ago.
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.040]  Which was great, by the way.
[22:25.040 --> 22:30.120]  And we had a couple of people ask us afterwards on Twitter and email and stuff, why didn't
[22:30.120 --> 22:31.600]  you ask him about the Mac Pro?
[22:31.600 --> 22:33.560]  Oh, you can't.
[22:33.560 --> 22:34.560]  Yeah.
[22:34.560 --> 22:42.000]  It's like, A, even if he knew about Mac Pro stuff, you're not going to answer that.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.140]  And B, the guy who writes the compiler probably has no clue about what the Mac Pro hardware
[22:47.140 --> 22:50.560]  team is doing and what might or might not be released in that department.
[22:50.560 --> 22:51.960]  It's a big company.
[22:51.960 --> 22:59.120]  And so anyway, your contacts interviewing Schiller on stage, it's tough to know whether
[22:59.120 --> 23:04.040]  you should bust out a question like that, which is slightly antagonizing and really
[23:04.040 --> 23:06.040]  puts them on the spot.
[23:06.040 --> 23:12.640]  And because there's a very good chance that you would just get a non-answer, just a nice
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.480]  PR-friendly non-answer, kind of like Tim Cook's post, we really love desktops, we have great
[23:17.480 --> 23:19.920]  desktops coming in the future, stuff like that.
[23:19.920 --> 23:21.320]  And that's not very helpful.
[23:21.320 --> 23:27.280]  And then you've just shifted the tone of the interview in a way that now they are on edge
[23:27.280 --> 23:29.820]  or are less likely to go to you in the future.
[23:29.820 --> 23:32.040]  So it's a tricky balance.
[23:32.040 --> 23:34.160]  So I don't blame you for not asking that last year.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.160]  No, but it wasn't because I thought it was in a...
[23:35.160 --> 23:36.920]  I don't blame you for not asking it this year.
[23:36.920 --> 23:37.920]  Yeah.
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.920]  This year it would have to happen.
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.320]  This year it's going to be the first question you ask.
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.320]  Yeah, but watch.
[23:41.320 --> 23:47.400]  I'll end up getting, I don't know, somebody who has nothing to do with Mac hardware or
[23:47.400 --> 23:48.400]  something like that.
[23:48.400 --> 23:50.400]  You can get Chris Lattner.
[23:50.400 --> 23:51.400]  Right.
[23:51.400 --> 23:58.040]  Like all of a sudden Schiller doesn't return my calls, you know, because there's ways to
[23:58.040 --> 23:59.040]  ask it.
[23:59.040 --> 24:03.880]  And I feel like that's something that maybe why I've gotten to this position where I can
[24:03.880 --> 24:09.320]  do this is where I can ask the question, but do it in a way that's not confrontational.
[24:09.320 --> 24:15.200]  I mean, the framing I would have used is, look, this audience in particular is largely
[24:15.200 --> 24:21.200]  comprised of people who use Xcode, which is one of the apps where every bit of CPU power
[24:21.200 --> 24:24.360]  can really help at times.
[24:24.360 --> 24:31.480]  And we're in this transition moving towards from Objective-C to Swift, and Swift, I think
[24:31.480 --> 24:36.120]  it's fair to say, is more taxing on the CPU than Objective-C. It seems like the Swift
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.960]  compilers, you can write Swift code that takes a lot longer to compile, but whatever.
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.920]  It certainly isn't easy to compile.
[24:45.920 --> 24:52.800]  And there's just a general sentiment that Apple's priorities for pro hardware in general
[24:52.800 --> 24:55.680]  are lower than they used to be.
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.140]  The Mac Pro is, I don't know, whatever it was, 900 days old at this time.
[25:00.140 --> 25:03.780]  After an incredibly splashy debut, what the heck is going on here?
[25:03.780 --> 25:07.360]  I don't think that is making, it's not like I'm putting him on the spot.
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.540]  And he can easily say, and maybe that's all he would have said is, hey, we love you guys,
[25:13.540 --> 25:18.960]  we got you, but you know I can't talk about future stuff.
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.280]  And then that's the end of it.
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.760]  So it's possible, but at least I would have asked.
[25:24.760 --> 25:25.760]  Yeah.
[25:25.760 --> 25:26.760]  Anyway.
[25:26.760 --> 25:30.880]  There's always future executive podcast interviews live at WBC.
[25:30.880 --> 25:33.240]  I loved the Latner interview, by the way.
[25:33.240 --> 25:39.840]  It was really, and especially for a show that almost never does interviews.
[25:39.840 --> 25:41.840]  I mean, you guys have-
[25:41.840 --> 25:42.840]  Never.
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.120]  I thought there was one a long time ago, or no, I guess you guys swapped with another
[25:47.120 --> 25:48.120]  show.
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.120]  Yeah.
[25:49.120 --> 25:51.280]  We had John Trade Spots with Christina Warren for one episode, which actually turned out
[25:51.280 --> 25:53.440]  really nice, but it wasn't really an interview show.
[25:53.440 --> 25:56.200]  She just was another host on our show for that episode.
[25:56.200 --> 26:02.080]  And I thought that for a show that has an established rhythm between the three of you,
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.360]  in which really none of it is really interview style, and there's an incredible comfort level
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.440]  between your personalities, to have somebody new on and do a three-way interview where
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.600]  all three of you asked good questions, I thought it was really impressive, because that's hard
[26:16.600 --> 26:17.600]  to do.
[26:17.600 --> 26:18.600]  Thank you.
[26:18.600 --> 26:19.600]  Because it was a really different show.
[26:19.600 --> 26:20.600]  Yeah.
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.120]  It's like all of a sudden, instead of driving a car, you're riding bicycles or something.
[26:25.120 --> 26:26.720]  Yeah.
[26:26.720 --> 26:27.840]  It was a lot of fun, though.
[26:27.840 --> 26:29.960]  And Chris, he made it easy on us.
[26:29.960 --> 26:34.760]  He wasn't a prima donna about anything, and just really easy to work with, and super nice
[26:34.760 --> 26:35.760]  guy.
[26:35.760 --> 26:36.760]  That was a lot of fun.
[26:36.760 --> 26:37.760]  Yeah.
[26:37.760 --> 26:43.060]  It's obviously not true from top to bottom, but it is generally true that Apple tends
[26:43.060 --> 26:45.880]  to attract very nice people.
[26:45.880 --> 26:46.880]  There are-
[26:46.880 --> 26:47.880]  Yeah.
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.760]  I mean, Federighi is a great example, where I don't know what he's like in real personal
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.800]  life, but backstage and stuff like that.
[26:54.800 --> 27:00.920]  And when you see him at WWDC, and people come up, and just random attendees are like, hey,
[27:00.920 --> 27:02.120]  can I get a selfie or whatever?
[27:02.120 --> 27:06.200]  He stops and talks for five minutes with them and asks what they're doing.
[27:06.200 --> 27:16.440]  He comes across talking to a group of five first-time WWDC attendees wearing a WWDC jacket.
[27:16.440 --> 27:19.240]  He comes across exactly with the same demeanor that he has on stage.
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.520]  So that affection that people seem to have for him, it's true.
[27:22.520 --> 27:24.220]  It seems to be his personality.
[27:24.220 --> 27:26.640]  And Latner's exactly that type of personality.
[27:26.640 --> 27:29.320]  He's just a nice guy.
[27:29.320 --> 27:30.320]  Yeah.
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.380]  Did I tell you about last year, WWDC, when I visited Apple's and Facebook's campuses
[27:35.380 --> 27:36.880]  in the same day?
[27:36.880 --> 27:37.880]  Yeah.
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.440]  It all sort of blurs together.
[27:39.440 --> 27:42.240]  I remember you doing it, but I don't remember what the details were.
[27:42.240 --> 27:44.520]  It was really interesting.
[27:44.520 --> 27:51.280]  In both cases, me and Casey and a couple other friends, we had a friend at each company that
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.840]  wanted to just give us a quick tour, let us in, and show us around and stuff like that.
[27:55.840 --> 28:02.640]  And Apple, I only saw the center courtyard and Cafe Max, because you can't bring people
[28:02.640 --> 28:04.080]  into the buildings really there.
[28:04.080 --> 28:05.080]  Frowned upon.
[28:05.080 --> 28:06.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[28:06.080 --> 28:11.800]  So I didn't see any actual offices, but I was able to see the courtyard and hang out
[28:11.800 --> 28:13.560]  and have lunch with everybody there.
[28:13.560 --> 28:16.720]  And we had lunch with something like 15 people at this giant table.
[28:16.720 --> 28:19.960]  So I got to meet a lot of people there and hang out for a good amount of time.
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.120]  And they had pretty good coffee at Apple, even at Cafe Max, I got to say.
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.840]  And kind of get a feel for the vibe of the campus, even though I didn't see any offices.
[28:28.840 --> 28:31.760]  And then a couple hours later, we went to Facebook.
[28:31.760 --> 28:34.400]  And I had never been to either of these campuses before.
[28:34.400 --> 28:38.280]  I had been to the Apple retail store, but I'd never gone through the doors into the
[28:38.280 --> 28:40.240]  courtyard.
[28:40.240 --> 28:42.140]  And I'm actually not sure I was allowed to.
[28:42.140 --> 28:46.960]  They have some kind of weird rules about bloggers, but I think I'm just under...
[28:46.960 --> 28:49.640]  I'm not really officially Apple Press in any capacity.
[28:49.640 --> 28:50.640]  I never have been.
[28:50.640 --> 28:54.240]  And so I think that's why it wasn't a problem that I was there.
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.280]  Like I had a friend who tried to go who was Apple Press and was not allowed in.
[28:58.280 --> 29:02.800]  So that was interesting, but anyway.
[29:02.800 --> 29:11.680]  So seeing Apple and then seeing Facebook could not have been two more different company culture
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.040]  and environments, at least visibly from these brief visits I did.
[29:16.040 --> 29:21.140]  And Facebook, I just felt horrible the whole time I was there.
[29:21.140 --> 29:29.040]  I felt kind of creeped out and intimidated by just how bizarre and kind of intense, high
[29:29.040 --> 29:33.600]  energy but not high positive energy it seemed to be.
[29:33.600 --> 29:35.600]  Just really like...
[29:35.600 --> 29:36.600]  I don't know.
[29:36.600 --> 29:37.600]  It's hard to explain.
[29:37.600 --> 29:39.440]  I really got a very bad feeling from Facebook.
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.920]  A combination of like, how does anybody get any work done here?
[29:43.920 --> 29:46.000]  And where are the adults?
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.600]  And it just didn't feel good.
[29:48.600 --> 29:53.440]  It felt like a dysfunctional workaholic culture that was hard to get any real work done in
[29:53.440 --> 30:01.000]  an environment that's kind of weirdly trapped in youth forever bizarro college fantasy world.
[30:01.000 --> 30:08.800]  And then Apple was so calm and adult and just nicely low key.
[30:08.800 --> 30:11.960]  The people there were just nice and calm.
[30:11.960 --> 30:15.180]  It kind of felt like, oh, this is where the adults work.
[30:15.180 --> 30:19.400]  This is where people come to actually do serious work.
[30:19.400 --> 30:25.480]  And whatever the environment actually is, again, because I've never worked at these
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.040]  companies and didn't even go inside the offices at Apple, it's hard for me to really say this,
[30:30.040 --> 30:37.000]  but it just felt like the little tiny windows into these cultures I saw really just seemed
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.120]  like Apple was the place where the nice, mature adults go to work.
[30:42.120 --> 30:46.800]  I could see that.
[30:46.800 --> 30:50.920]  It definitely seems like people who go to Apple.
[30:50.920 --> 30:55.080]  Company cultures attract like-minded people, but it does seem to me in general, like when
[30:55.080 --> 30:59.000]  I've been there, people know how to turn it off.
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.320]  That when you're going to lunch and they're going to have lunch with a friend, they're
[31:02.320 --> 31:05.660]  just having lunch with a friend.
[31:05.660 --> 31:07.560]  Get back up to speed when they get back to work or whatever.
[31:07.560 --> 31:13.200]  I mean, I'll tell you one thing, I don't hear a lot of stories about Facebook and Apple
[31:13.200 --> 31:17.000]  stealing talent from each other, and maybe that's because I don't really pay attention,
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.900]  but I'll tell you one thing, seeing the both of those places, I cannot imagine that anybody
[31:20.900 --> 31:25.520]  who works for one would want to work for the other in either direction.
[31:25.520 --> 31:28.280]  Like I don't think they're competing for the same people at all.
[31:28.280 --> 31:30.240]  Yeah, I've never really heard that either.
[31:30.240 --> 31:35.080]  I mean, and obviously at a certain level, there's probably some like maybe like a sys
[31:35.080 --> 31:38.160]  admins or something like that, but, and you know what?
[31:38.160 --> 31:41.280]  There was that one team at Facebook that was largely poached from Apple, but now they're
[31:41.280 --> 31:42.280]  all dispersed, right?
[31:42.280 --> 31:43.280]  They're gone.
[31:43.280 --> 31:44.280]  The mic man.
[31:44.280 --> 31:47.760]  Yeah, they bought a bunch of designers for a while and then just slowly eroded their
[31:47.760 --> 31:49.400]  sanity until they all quit.
[31:49.400 --> 31:50.400]  Right.
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.760]  And they built a very Apple-like beautiful system and custom tools to support it with
[31:54.760 --> 31:58.920]  the Facebook paper or whatever they call it, whether it was just paper or Facebook paper
[31:58.920 --> 31:59.920]  or whatever.
[31:59.920 --> 32:00.920]  What are the names they stole?
[32:00.920 --> 32:01.920]  Yeah, it's fine.
[32:01.920 --> 32:06.920]  Well, but you know what I mean?
[32:06.920 --> 32:10.080]  It's a tough call because the paper app was the other paper app, the one that you draw
[32:10.080 --> 32:15.680]  on was there first, but it is, it's the risk you take when you get a regular, a plain word
[32:15.680 --> 32:16.760]  is your app name.
[32:16.760 --> 32:21.440]  You know, it seemed like for a while there, like Facebook was just gobbling up as much
[32:21.440 --> 32:25.560]  design talent as they could at about the same time that Google was gobbling up as much email
[32:25.560 --> 32:26.560]  talent as they could.
[32:26.560 --> 32:30.800]  And it seems like both of those have just kind of fizzled and faded over the last year
[32:30.800 --> 32:31.800]  or so.
[32:31.800 --> 32:32.800]  Have you talked about them recently?
[32:32.800 --> 32:36.840]  I think in broad terms, what happened was that there was a period where Zuckerberg,
[32:36.840 --> 32:42.960]  I think it coincides with, um, cause you know, if there's one, I don't, I don't get Facebook,
[32:42.960 --> 32:44.560]  I've never signed up for it.
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.880]  Uh, and so I'm not, it, it does feel foreign to me.
[32:48.880 --> 32:53.920]  It feels like studying a foreign country, but from my observations, it, it is clear
[32:53.920 --> 32:58.400]  that I don't think there can be any question that Zuckerberg has a tremendous gift for
[32:58.400 --> 33:00.360]  changing his mind.
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.880]  Um, people often said that about Steve Jobs.
[33:02.880 --> 33:07.880]  Uh, Tim Cook has often when he talks about working with Steve Jobs, like usually just
[33:07.880 --> 33:11.920]  talks about him on a personal level, but if you can get them talking about working his,
[33:11.920 --> 33:15.880]  you know, Tim Cook, it tells stories about his absolutely amazing ability to change his
[33:15.880 --> 33:19.600]  mind and, but the, you know, the Steve Jobs style is that when he comes in with his mind
[33:19.600 --> 33:23.160]  change, he acts as his opinion all along.
[33:23.160 --> 33:26.320]  Um, and I think Bill Gates had some of that too, right?
[33:26.320 --> 33:31.280]  Like when Bill Gates famously that like Microsoft was building this early nineties strategy
[33:31.280 --> 33:35.840]  to sort of do their own custom stuff for connecting computers to each other.
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.680]  And then all of a sudden, you know, Gates writes like a 10 page manifesto that we got
[33:39.680 --> 33:41.200]  to get on this internet thing.
[33:41.200 --> 33:46.920]  And all of a sudden, you know, I mean, how long did it take for, for explorer to, to
[33:46.920 --> 33:47.920]  decimate Netscape?
[33:47.920 --> 33:48.920]  Didn't take long.
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.200]  Um, yeah, but at the same time, then we got active desktop.
[33:52.200 --> 33:54.080]  So I don't know if that was a net win.
[33:54.080 --> 33:55.880]  I'm not saying that it was seamlessly executed.
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.880]  I'm just saying, no, he did change his mind, you know, it's, it's, you know, and the broad
[34:00.880 --> 34:07.020]  strokes Facebook was a website, it was a website you went to and he did all these things and
[34:07.020 --> 34:15.400]  the iPhone came out and an awful lot of products that were popular websites in 2007, um, in
[34:15.400 --> 34:21.360]  the iPhone era just were nowhere, weren't getting the engagement that things that could
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.520]  be done as a native app got.
[34:23.520 --> 34:28.520]  And uh, I mean, not to go too far off into the weeds, but one reason is that an awful
[34:28.520 --> 34:30.840]  lot of websites were built.
[34:30.840 --> 34:33.880]  I don't think this is true anymore because mobile is, I don't think anybody overlooks
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.760]  it, but that the backend of the website was inextricably tied to the front end of the
[34:38.760 --> 34:39.760]  website.
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.680]  And instead of having everything go through nice APIs, even the front end of the website
[34:43.680 --> 34:52.240]  so that you could make clients for other devices like a native Mac client or, and, and people
[34:52.240 --> 34:54.760]  say, well, I forget it, you don't need a native Mac or windows client, we'll just go through
[34:54.760 --> 34:55.760]  the web browser.
[34:55.760 --> 34:57.920]  And for a lot of things, for a lot of years, that was fine.
[34:57.920 --> 34:59.940]  But then with the phone, that wasn't good enough.
[34:59.940 --> 35:05.440]  And Facebook had an app that was largely just a front end for HTML and JavaScript and then
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.760]  they seem to get it and it's, you know, from Zuckerberg on down that, no, we should do
[35:09.760 --> 35:11.980]  this as with as much native stuff as we can.
[35:11.980 --> 35:13.680]  We should, this app is important.
[35:13.680 --> 35:15.520]  This is more important than our website.
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.680]  Uh, and that's around when he hired all those designers and I think there was sort of a,
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.440]  I think there was sort of a look, apples, you know, apples, the company to look at,
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.200]  they, they value a plus design talent.
[35:27.200 --> 35:28.200]  Maybe we should too.
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.800]  And then I think in the intervening years, the Facebook realized that that wasn't really
[35:32.800 --> 35:38.960]  that important to them, that the native part was, but the design caliber wasn't.
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.200]  Or rather, I think they, it's, it seemed like there was a lot of trouble, you know, like
[35:43.200 --> 35:47.200]  they were able to get the talent, but just, you know, by applying sheer force of will
[35:47.200 --> 35:49.060]  and lots of money, they were able to get the talent.
[35:49.060 --> 35:52.000]  But then the question is, well, what do you have all these great, all these incredibly
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.840]  talented people do at Facebook?
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.360]  And that was, it seemed like they had a harder time having a good answer to that question
[35:59.360 --> 36:01.160]  and maintaining that over time.
[36:01.160 --> 36:02.960]  Um, but who knows?
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.440]  It's hard to keep good people interested in working for a giant established product, you
[36:08.440 --> 36:11.520]  know, like Apple has this problem too, like it's really like once you have something that's
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.000]  big and successful and boring, like Facebook or the iPhone, it's hard to get people interested
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.600]  in working on that, who, the same kind of people who would make something like that
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.160]  because they want to go make something else.
[36:21.160 --> 36:22.160]  Yeah.
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.840]  I know Mike Mattes a little bit, uh, and I haven't spoken to him much since he left Facebook.
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.480]  So I, you know, I'm, I'm just sort of speculating here, but I know from a couple of the people
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.080]  on the team that they were used to being the A team at the company, you know, like Mattes
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.000]  was, I think, I know he designed a whole bunch of stuff in the original iPhone, but like,
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.880]  I think he literally did like the actual pixels for the slide to unlock, you know, like that's,
[36:47.880 --> 36:53.000]  you know, that, that's, that's, and if you're like the person who designs both the visuals
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.120]  and the interaction for a thing doing slide to unlock is pretty, pretty big.
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.360]  Cause I mean, I remember Steve jobs actually demoed it like three times.
[37:00.360 --> 37:01.360]  He was like, that's so cool.
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.360]  I'm going to do it again.
[37:02.360 --> 37:04.080]  He like lock the phone and did it again.
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.780]  So like when you designing the feature that Steve jobs decides, I'm just going to do this
[37:09.780 --> 37:13.440]  three or four times on stage because it's, I just love it so much.
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.540]  And then to go to at Facebook and you're not designing, you're not designing the app that's
[37:18.540 --> 37:20.320]  in front of a billion users.
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.300]  You're designing the app that's in front of like one 10th of 1% of the users who care
[37:25.300 --> 37:29.840]  more about how things look than the regular Facebook experience.
[37:29.840 --> 37:32.400]  I just think it's hard to get excited about that.
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.400]  Yeah.
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.200]  Um, I'll take a break.
[37:36.200 --> 37:37.200]  Let's take a break.
[37:37.200 --> 37:40.040]  This is our first sponsor to our good friends at audible.
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.360]  You guys know audible audible is where you go to get, um, just about anything and everything
[37:45.360 --> 37:47.360]  audio related.
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.880]  I used to think of it as a place you go to get audio books and it's true.
[37:50.880 --> 37:58.080]  They have more audio books than anybody, but they have so much more than audio books.
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.280]  Now you go there, you sign up for an account and you can get all sorts of stuff.
[38:01.280 --> 38:05.440]  They have news, daily news shows, they have comedy shows, all of this stuff.
[38:05.440 --> 38:08.960]  And a lot of this stuff is original to audible.
[38:08.960 --> 38:11.240]  If you want to listen to it, audible has it.
[38:11.240 --> 38:14.260]  Listen to audio books from virtually every genre, anytime, anywhere.
[38:14.260 --> 38:17.080]  They have a great listen guarantee.
[38:17.080 --> 38:20.320]  So if you get an audio book and you start listening to it and it's like putting you
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.120]  to sleep, uh, you could just like give it back to them and they'll get, get like a different
[38:24.120 --> 38:25.120]  book.
[38:25.120 --> 38:26.120]  Like that's how confident they are.
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.120]  They just, you're not going to get bored.
[38:29.120 --> 38:32.500]  You're just going to fill up your every minute where you need to listen to something to not
[38:32.500 --> 38:33.500]  be bored.
[38:33.500 --> 38:34.880]  You can fill it up with stuff from audible.
[38:34.880 --> 38:40.320]  And I've always said, I think this is one of the greatest, uh, advertising opportunities
[38:40.320 --> 38:41.320]  ever.
[38:41.320 --> 38:42.320]  Why do they sponsor podcasts?
[38:42.320 --> 38:45.880]  Because they know that everybody who's listening to me tell you about audible is somebody who
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.440]  listens to spoken word content by definition.
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.400]  So if you're listening to this and you feel like you've got gaps in your, your, your life
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.540]  where you need more podcasts, uh, or things like podcasts, go to audible, sign up, go
[38:59.540 --> 39:02.520]  to audible.com slash talk show.
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.800]  No the just talk show and no, no, you came here and you get a free 30 day trial, 30 days.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.720]  We can just listen to whatever you want.
[39:09.720 --> 39:13.600]  Audible dot com slash talk show.
[39:13.600 --> 39:16.600]  I think I wrote that script.
[39:16.600 --> 39:25.600]  Yeah, maybe, uh, I was telling her, I forget I was talking to the, I forget if it was on
[39:25.600 --> 39:30.640]  air or not, but uh, bill Simmons, I've been listening to football season.
[39:30.640 --> 39:31.640]  I was listening.
[39:31.640 --> 39:32.640]  He does the sports thing.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.640]  He does a thing called the ringer.
[39:33.640 --> 39:34.640]  Thank you.
[39:34.640 --> 39:35.640]  Uh, very popular.
[39:35.640 --> 39:38.960]  You'd probably see it's probably pretty high up in overcast.
[39:38.960 --> 39:41.920]  So that'd be interesting to see if it was actually all that high up in overcast cause
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.600]  maybe overcast skews towards, uh, non sports stuff.
[39:46.600 --> 39:50.580]  Maybe like sports stuff is a little bit more, I don't know, they'd be interesting.
[39:50.580 --> 39:52.640]  It does go, it does pretty well in overcast.
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.560]  It is not as high as tech shows and like the really popular, you know, NPR style storytelling
[39:57.560 --> 39:58.840]  shows like this American life though.
[39:58.840 --> 40:00.800]  I think it was Ben Thompson and I who were talking about it.
[40:00.800 --> 40:04.200]  I forget if it was on the show or off, but the gist of it is that when, when bill Simmons
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.520]  first started doing sponsors reads on his show, he was awful at it.
[40:08.520 --> 40:14.440]  As was I like when I first split off and started doing this show on my own, just brutal.
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.880]  I mean like maybe the shows were, maybe they were okay, but the sponsor reads were just
[40:18.880 --> 40:19.880]  brutal.
[40:19.880 --> 40:21.360]  You just, I don't know why it's hard.
[40:21.360 --> 40:22.360]  It's hard thing to do.
[40:22.360 --> 40:23.360]  You get the hang of it eventually.
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.240]  It took you maybe a couple of months and then you, then you were pretty good at it.
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.120]  Yeah, but it's a, but Simmons is doing, Simmons is actually taking it to a new level.
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.840]  He was, I think I would venture to say he was worse than me at the beginning and now
[40:32.840 --> 40:36.400]  he's better than anybody I've I've ever seen.
[40:36.400 --> 40:41.440]  He's he's like in Howard Stern territory at being able to do it.
[40:41.440 --> 40:44.840]  Because sometimes when I listen to Stern anymore, it almost seems like when Stern does one where
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.880]  he does the read, he's, he's phoning it.
[40:46.880 --> 40:50.880]  You could tell he's phoning it in whereas Simmons does it and he's got a real tight
[40:50.880 --> 40:57.160]  script and it seems like he's trying to literally stick it to 30 seconds, get in and out and
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.800]  he really starts talking faster.
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.720]  And it just alleviate, it does just completely alleviate any urge I have to skip ahead.
[41:05.720 --> 41:13.200]  I tend not to, I tend not to skip ahead on sponsor reads on podcasts simply because I,
[41:13.200 --> 41:16.920]  you know, I know some people do and if you do, you know, that's why the features there.
[41:16.920 --> 41:17.920]  It's okay.
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.920]  It's my job to try to make it as interesting.
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.120]  We've, you and I have talked about this before.
[41:20.120 --> 41:22.800]  I was my job to try to make it so interesting that you don't want to skip.
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.440]  But when I'm listening to podcasts, I tend not to skip because I want to listen.
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.120]  I'm curious at a, at a professional level, how is this person going to keep me interested?
[41:31.120 --> 41:36.000]  Um, yeah, I often will, we'll listen to other people who are doing reach for the same sponsors
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.920]  that I have just to get to hear like, you know, how are you doing this read and like
[41:39.920 --> 41:43.800]  maybe, maybe there's something I can learn and do better in my reach for the same people
[41:43.800 --> 41:45.880]  from the way you're doing this read.
[41:45.880 --> 41:46.880]  Yeah.
[41:46.880 --> 41:48.440]  Uh, so what else we got?
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.440]  We got a lot to talk about.
[41:49.440 --> 41:51.320]  We got to hurry up.
[41:51.320 --> 41:52.320]  We're really good at that.
[41:52.320 --> 41:53.320]  Yeah.
[41:53.320 --> 41:55.320]  So we got to, what about WWDC moving?
[41:55.320 --> 41:56.760]  Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool.
[41:56.760 --> 41:59.560]  I mean, I don't know anything about San Jose, so it's going to be interesting.
[41:59.560 --> 42:00.560]  Talked a little bit about that.
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.880]  I, I, I was so completely surprised by this.
[42:02.880 --> 42:08.040]  I really, I just, this wasn't even on my radar, but I kind of ever, you know, once it happened,
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.080]  it was an initial shock and then I thought, oh shit, what am I going to do about my live
[42:11.080 --> 42:12.080]  show?
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.040]  Uh, you know, of course my thoughts turned to myself immediately.
[42:15.040 --> 42:20.420]  I mean, everyone else is dead to everyone else is like, oh, how can I fly there?
[42:20.420 --> 42:21.420]  Is Arno hotels expensive?
[42:21.420 --> 42:23.840]  I mean, everyone's thinking the same general stuff.
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.440]  Um, you know, most, most of the people aren't thinking, where can I host my live podcast?
[42:27.440 --> 42:30.160]  But it just never occurred to me that they would do this though.
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.200]  Like, uh, it, it, I guess the rough thinking was, and we've all had this, you know, people
[42:36.200 --> 42:39.760]  who go regularly that San Francisco is not great.
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.720]  The, the, in particular, I mean, there are parts of San Francisco that are absolutely
[42:43.720 --> 42:47.840]  gorgeous, but South of market where Moscone is, it's not great.
[42:47.840 --> 42:48.840]  I don't hate it.
[42:48.840 --> 42:49.920]  Some people really hate it.
[42:49.920 --> 42:57.720]  Some people, you know, it is what it is, but it is sort of the touristy hotel-y, uh, maybe
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.960]  touristy is the wrong, but it's, it's kind of like the worst of San Francisco is the
[43:01.960 --> 43:08.720]  area that we see when we go to WBC is, is a terrible image of the city as a whole.
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.920]  Well, and then it's not too far from union square though, and union square is nicer,
[43:12.920 --> 43:15.380]  but union square is just high end retail.
[43:15.380 --> 43:16.920]  It's not, you know what I mean?
[43:16.920 --> 43:18.120]  Like what are you supposed to do?
[43:18.120 --> 43:24.120]  Go shopping for jewelry and stuff like that, you know, it's, it's okay, but it is what
[43:24.120 --> 43:25.120]  it is.
[43:25.120 --> 43:27.880]  But the fact is that Apple, you know, we'd say, well, what could they do different?
[43:27.880 --> 43:31.480]  Well, there's no other facility with 5,000 people.
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.000]  And then we, you know, we would just say, well, it used to be in San Jose, but they
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.920]  moved out of San Jose for a reason.
[43:35.920 --> 43:38.120]  And uh, there's nothing else.
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.680]  And they're not going to go further away because it's already a major stress on Apple to get
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.400]  a thousand engineers, you know, from the South Bay area to San Francisco for labs and to
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.040]  just hang out and do stuff and still get work done.
[43:51.040 --> 43:58.680]  Um, I for one had just completely overlooked the, well, they could move back to San Jose
[43:58.680 --> 44:00.560]  angle for years.
[44:00.560 --> 44:03.720]  It just never really, I never even really gave it serious thought, but then once they
[44:03.720 --> 44:07.000]  said, yeah, here's what we're doing, I could totally see the logic of it.
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.760]  And it seems like a very Apple like move.
[44:08.760 --> 44:11.920]  I mean, really, it makes a ton of sense logistically too.
[44:11.920 --> 44:18.840]  I mean, not only is it closer to them, but like San Francisco is a dense, competitive,
[44:18.840 --> 44:20.960]  very expensive city.
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.160]  There's a reason why you don't see a lot of tech conferences in Manhattan.
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.200]  It's because if you put on a tech conference in Manhattan, the space that you hold it in
[44:30.200 --> 44:32.960]  is going to be extraordinarily expensive.
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.720]  All the logistics, getting the food in there, getting it like all the equipment, that's
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.440]  all going to be extraordinarily expensive.
[44:38.440 --> 44:43.520]  And then for the attendees, they're going to have to pay ridiculous hotel prices because
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.720]  they're going to this major city that is itself a massive tourist destination.
[44:48.720 --> 44:55.160]  And so it's very unappealing to hold a major conference in New York city unless it really
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.160]  needs to be specifically in New York city for some reason.
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.720]  So everybody see could be anywhere like for the intent as far as far as the attendees
[45:02.720 --> 45:05.160]  are concerned, it doesn't matter where it is.
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.760]  You're going to see talks and labs and stuff and that could be in any conference center
[45:09.760 --> 45:12.440]  in any city in America.
[45:12.440 --> 45:18.320]  You don't have to be paying the extreme premium and dealing with all the logistical challenges
[45:18.320 --> 45:25.280]  and downsides of being in a massive tourist expensive dense city just to go watch some
[45:25.280 --> 45:26.460]  talks and go to labs.
[45:26.460 --> 45:32.880]  And either you already have friends and colleagues who will also be there and you'll see them
[45:32.880 --> 45:35.680]  and it doesn't matter where you are or even if you don't, even if you're like a first
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.360]  timer, if you're new, you're going to be surrounded by like-minded individuals.
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.040]  And it's not hard to make friends or even just temporary friends while sitting at a
[45:46.040 --> 45:51.480]  bar or something like that, you could start talking about Xcode and all of a sudden you're
[45:51.480 --> 45:52.480]  not bored.
[45:52.480 --> 45:53.480]  Right.
[45:53.480 --> 45:57.200]  I mean like if anything, the city is kind of wasted on you because if you're attending
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.120]  the conference, you don't really have time to go out and explore much of the city.
[46:02.120 --> 46:05.680]  For the most part, you're waking up, you're trying to get to that 9 a.m. session in the
[46:05.680 --> 46:09.600]  morning, you're in sessions and stuff all day, you might have a little hour for lunch
[46:09.600 --> 46:13.040]  but you can't go that far and then you're back and then like five o'clock rolls around
[46:13.040 --> 46:16.400]  and you just want to like go to the hotel bar with your friends, have a couple of drinks
[46:16.400 --> 46:19.480]  and go to dinner and that's the night.
[46:19.480 --> 46:21.020]  You can do that anywhere.
[46:21.020 --> 46:23.480]  You're not seeing the whole city.
[46:23.480 --> 46:24.480]  It doesn't really make sense.
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.280]  I mean like one of my favorite conference venues I've ever been to is where Ool has
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.640]  been held the last couple of years in Killarney, Ireland in this hotel called The Europe and
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.440]  it's like, it's very, very remote location and the hotel itself, you've been there,
[46:40.440 --> 46:41.600]  you know, have you been there actually?
[46:41.600 --> 46:42.600]  I don't think so.
[46:42.600 --> 46:43.600]  I don't…
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.600]  Yeah, because you missed the, yeah, anyway, it's awesome.
[46:46.600 --> 46:49.920]  It depends how many years in a row they've been at the same one.
[46:49.920 --> 46:54.200]  I was at one that was at a remote location but I think they've switched to a different
[46:54.200 --> 46:55.440]  remote location.
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.840]  Yeah, this is, I believe this is their third one that they're about to do next month.
[46:59.840 --> 47:00.840]  I'm going.
[47:00.840 --> 47:01.840]  I recommend it.
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.440]  Anyway, so it's, you know, it's just like this one giant hotel venue kind of in the
[47:07.440 --> 47:08.440]  middle of nowhere.
[47:08.440 --> 47:11.840]  It's beautiful but like you're all kind of self-enclosed there.
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.040]  There is, I mean, there is a nearby city of Killarney but like you don't really, the
[47:16.040 --> 47:17.640]  attendees don't really have to go there.
[47:17.640 --> 47:21.780]  Like you're all on premises and you're surrounded by all the people that are there
[47:21.780 --> 47:27.420]  for your event and so, you know, there is, there is no time to go out and enjoy some
[47:27.420 --> 47:28.420]  other city.
[47:28.420 --> 47:29.420]  Like that's what you're there for.
[47:29.420 --> 47:31.920]  You're there, you're there to hang out with those people and see those talks and
[47:31.920 --> 47:33.060]  do those events.
[47:33.060 --> 47:38.000]  So to have a conference in a massive city that you're paying a big premium to be in
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.840]  doesn't actually make a lot of sense.
[47:40.840 --> 47:41.840]  I love Ireland.
[47:41.840 --> 47:47.280]  I remember with the last time I was there and there was a band, remember, and the lead
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.280]  singer.
[47:48.280 --> 47:49.280]  Were you there this year?
[47:49.280 --> 47:50.280]  And there was a lead singer named Paddy.
[47:50.280 --> 47:51.280]  P-A-D-D-Y.
[47:51.280 --> 47:54.560]  I've never been there on the same time that you were there.
[47:54.560 --> 47:55.560]  I don't think so either.
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.080]  So Paddy was there and he was the lead singer of this band and he had nothing interesting.
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.720]  You know, he had no connection to like Apple related stuff.
[48:03.720 --> 48:07.760]  But he came up to the pub in, you know, in the, you know, without leaving the building.
[48:07.760 --> 48:09.600]  It's sort of like a compound.
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.200]  He came up and was going to have a drink or two and he just, you know, he's gregarious,
[48:14.200 --> 48:18.040]  you know, showbiz performer, but you know, but very nice.
[48:18.040 --> 48:21.700]  And it quickly struck up conversations with all sorts of people and he was having a good
[48:21.700 --> 48:25.100]  time and never left.
[48:25.100 --> 48:29.760]  And then at like midnight, they were doing last call and everybody's like, oh man, what
[48:29.760 --> 48:30.760]  are we going to do?
[48:30.760 --> 48:32.280]  Everybody wanted to stay up a little bit later.
[48:32.280 --> 48:37.320]  And Paddy went up to the bartender and just off, you know, it wasn't like whispering in
[48:37.320 --> 48:39.720]  his ear, but he just like spent about two minutes talking to him.
[48:39.720 --> 48:42.760]  And the next thing you know, the bartender's like slapping on the back and the bartender
[48:42.760 --> 48:44.600]  says, all right, we'll stay open two more hours.
[48:44.600 --> 48:45.600]  That's awesome.
[48:45.600 --> 48:48.840]  I've never heard of anything like that in my life.
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.580]  Like where the staff of a place I can, he got, you know, he like called over, you know,
[48:52.580 --> 48:55.880]  he didn't like make it unilaterally called of another bartender and was just like, Hey,
[48:55.880 --> 48:58.400]  what do you, you know, these guys want to keep going to, you know, how about we do two
[48:58.400 --> 48:59.400]  more hours?
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.680]  It was a good conference.
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.040]  Why do you think WWDC moved from San Jose to San Francisco when it did, I think it was
[49:09.040 --> 49:10.040]  2003 or 2004.
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.040]  I don't know.
[49:11.040 --> 49:13.160]  That was before my time.
[49:13.160 --> 49:17.040]  I think some of the other things I've heard, I think Jason had, had, was talking about
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.480]  it on upgrade, uh, uh, about how like, you know, back then Apple really wanted to be
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.960]  like in more of the media spotlight with this stuff, you know, it's more prestigious to
[49:26.960 --> 49:27.960]  go there.
[49:27.960 --> 49:30.680]  It's like, you know, really owning like, yeah, we're big, we're awesome, kind of attracts
[49:30.680 --> 49:33.720]  more media attention being there, but now the attention comes to them.
[49:33.720 --> 49:34.720]  They don't need it.
[49:34.720 --> 49:35.720]  They don't need to do that as much.
[49:35.720 --> 49:36.720]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[49:36.720 --> 49:37.720]  Exactly.
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.540]  I think it was Steve jobs and I think Steve jobs, you know, Apple was firing on all cylinders.
[49:41.540 --> 49:46.240]  The iPod was slowly turning into a massive hit.
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.960]  The retail stores were slowly turning into a success story.
[49:50.960 --> 49:57.360]  Um, uh, they were, it was the, you know, the LA famously, I know that, uh, I think Jason
[49:57.360 --> 50:01.620]  and Mike even went over this and the last one at San Jose was the one where they had
[50:01.620 --> 50:07.560]  a funeral for Mac OS nine, which was actually kind of forced.
[50:07.560 --> 50:10.520]  Like the only reason they had to, it's kind of, you think like that's kind of, you think
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.640]  like that's a weird thing to do is have a funeral on stage for your product.
[50:13.640 --> 50:16.620]  But it was actually because it wasn't dead.
[50:16.620 --> 50:21.400]  It was because so many people were still using Mac OS nine, but it was at the point where
[50:21.400 --> 50:24.320]  they felt like they were in the clear.
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.480]  It was three or four years into the, I guess at least three years into the Mac OS 10 era.
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.360]  But they were at the point where I think they could see the light at the end of the tunnel
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.360]  that yes, we're, we're going to make this transition.
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.840]  All Macs will be running Mac OS 10.
[50:37.840 --> 50:39.560]  You know, this isn't going to sink us.
[50:39.560 --> 50:44.320]  The first two years of Mac OS 10 was kind of iffy really in terms of how big the uptake
[50:44.320 --> 50:45.320]  was.
[50:45.320 --> 50:48.960]  So I think that after that one, you know, the Mac was clearly had a bright future.
[50:48.960 --> 50:50.280]  The iPod was great.
[50:50.280 --> 50:51.280]  Retail was great.
[50:51.280 --> 50:55.160]  I think Steve jobs wanted a bigger spotlight.
[50:55.160 --> 50:59.720]  And I think doing that idea of having like a hopeful funeral, like we really hope this
[50:59.720 --> 51:04.360]  is it, guys, please return, which we're begging you, please make this dead.
[51:04.360 --> 51:08.240]  I remember they had it and I, it was before my time of attending WWDCs, but I still had
[51:08.240 --> 51:10.200]  two, two Macs at my desk.
[51:10.200 --> 51:17.360]  I had a, what did I have, I had a power Mac 9,600 that was still running Mac OS nine as
[51:17.360 --> 51:18.360]  my main machine.
[51:18.360 --> 51:21.320]  And then I had a, uh, an iBook running OS 10.
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.400]  Oh, so now I have one with the keyboard I can use and one with another one.
[51:25.400 --> 51:26.400]  Yeah.
[51:26.400 --> 51:27.400]  Um, so that's what I think.
[51:27.400 --> 51:30.080]  I think they moved to San Francisco for the publicity.
[51:30.080 --> 51:31.340]  I think that's exactly right.
[51:31.340 --> 51:33.400]  That they wanted more attention.
[51:33.400 --> 51:35.560]  They felt like they need, you know, they could use it.
[51:35.560 --> 51:36.640]  They had stuff to say.
[51:36.640 --> 51:39.320]  They had stuff that deserved more attention and now they don't.
[51:39.320 --> 51:43.080]  And I don't think San Francisco was ever a good fit for Apple culturally.
[51:43.080 --> 51:45.520]  They're not a San Francisco city.
[51:45.520 --> 51:51.280]  Yeah, they're, they're really, they have a very different vibe about them than what I've,
[51:51.280 --> 51:55.260]  I mean, again, I've never, I've never worked for Apple and I've never lived in San Francisco.
[51:55.260 --> 51:59.400]  So it's hard for me to say this, but just my, my, my kind of bird's eye view of it,
[51:59.400 --> 52:01.640]  it does seem like they didn't really fit in there.
[52:01.640 --> 52:06.480]  Like there's no, put travel aside, like cause they're there when they moved to the new Apple
[52:06.480 --> 52:09.760]  campus, when they opened a new Apple, I shouldn't say move because that's exactly my point,
[52:09.760 --> 52:15.580]  but when they opened the new Apple campus too, they're not leaving the Apple campus,
[52:15.580 --> 52:17.160]  the original infinite loop campus.
[52:17.160 --> 52:19.260]  They need, they need all the space they can get.
[52:19.260 --> 52:23.720]  And so, I mean, there might be some empty offices for a while, but that, you know, there's
[52:23.720 --> 52:28.280]  going to be back and forth between the original Apple campus and Apple campus too on a daily
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.280]  basis.
[52:29.280 --> 52:33.320]  So having them both in Cupertino is a big deal, you know, and they have new office space
[52:33.320 --> 52:38.240]  in San Jose, they have space in a few other places in the South Bay area, but the fact
[52:38.240 --> 52:42.080]  that getting between anywhere in the South Bay is easier than getting from anywhere in
[52:42.080 --> 52:44.520]  the South Bay to San Francisco is a big deal.
[52:44.520 --> 52:51.400]  Like there's no universe where Apple campus too is a skyscraper with the same square footage
[52:51.400 --> 52:52.400]  in San Francisco.
[52:52.400 --> 52:58.320]  It's just culturally and travel aside, even if part of it was like a tunnel dug by Elon
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.800]  Musk that could get you between them in 10 minutes, even if you could get between them
[53:02.800 --> 53:04.760]  in 10 minutes, there's just no way they would do it.
[53:04.760 --> 53:12.080]  It's just San Francisco is not an Apple town in a way that San Jose I think is.
[53:12.080 --> 53:15.120]  I'm looking forward to it because it, you know, it really is like going to a whole new
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.080]  conference now and you know, WBC, I've, I've gone now for something like seven years, something
[53:21.080 --> 53:26.640]  like that and I've, I've enjoyed it, but I'm looking forward to something new, something
[53:26.640 --> 53:27.640]  fresh.
[53:27.640 --> 53:30.200]  And you know, it's, it's kind of more exciting now because it's, it's going to be something
[53:30.200 --> 53:32.400]  a little bit different.
[53:32.400 --> 53:37.040]  I forget if I went in 2006, so I either went 10 years in a row or nine years in a row.
[53:37.040 --> 53:38.040]  Yeah.
[53:38.040 --> 53:42.520]  It's one of my favorite things about covering Apple is that they're very predictable.
[53:42.520 --> 53:46.400]  So if you try to approach them and analyze them in a logical standpoint, you can have
[53:46.400 --> 53:51.040]  success, but they're also resistant to complacency, right?
[53:51.040 --> 53:56.880]  So they're not going to like ping pong around and move WWDC to random cities every year,
[53:56.880 --> 54:02.240]  but they're not going to keep it in San Francisco just because that's where it's been for 10
[54:02.240 --> 54:04.080]  years.
[54:04.080 --> 54:10.560]  Which we'll get, we'll get to when we talk about iPhone and iPad form factors soon.
[54:10.560 --> 54:13.440]  The other thing too is we, you've heard it, I've heard it, everybody who's gone in recent
[54:13.440 --> 54:17.880]  years has heard that from the longtime attendees who remember the San Jose era, there's a reputation
[54:17.880 --> 54:22.320]  that downtown San Jose was kind of sleepy that, you know, restaurants and bars close
[54:22.320 --> 54:23.320]  early.
[54:23.320 --> 54:26.780]  There's quote unquote, nothing to do.
[54:26.780 --> 54:31.440]  Two things on that is one back then WWDC didn't even sell out.
[54:31.440 --> 54:38.280]  I forget when the first sell out was, but I don't think it was in San Jose.
[54:38.280 --> 54:44.400]  And the second thing is that talking to a couple of people, downtown San Jose has improved
[54:44.400 --> 54:52.080]  a lot in the last 10 years, that there's been a lot of, I just looked it up, first WWDC
[54:52.080 --> 54:53.080]  to sell out was 2008.
[54:53.080 --> 54:57.500]  Gee, I wonder what happened 2008 that would cause the first sale.
[54:57.500 --> 55:01.260]  So up until 2008, even the first few years at Moscone, you could like buy a ticket the
[55:01.260 --> 55:03.680]  day before WWDC.
[55:03.680 --> 55:06.640]  I think the fact that this is obviously going to sell out and that there are going to be
[55:06.640 --> 55:12.920]  people in San Jose who don't even have tickets, you know, it's going to be a different vibe.
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.120]  And a couple of people have said that downtown San Jose has really improved a lot.
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.360]  I was just talking to a friend of the show, Jim Dalrymple.
[55:20.360 --> 55:22.080]  You don't really need much.
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.520]  Like when you're there for a conference, like you need a handful, you know, you need good
[55:26.520 --> 55:29.800]  hotels that you can hopefully get for a reasonable price.
[55:29.800 --> 55:35.480]  You need a bunch of restaurants to be able to get food at and you need, you know, a handful
[55:35.480 --> 55:38.360]  of decent bars and bars in the hotels.
[55:38.360 --> 55:39.360]  And that's about it.
[55:39.360 --> 55:44.600]  Like you don't need tons and tons of nightlife for a tech conference for five days.
[55:44.600 --> 55:45.600]  Right.
[55:45.600 --> 55:48.720]  It's actually better if the bars are generally empty but are willing to stay open late so
[55:48.720 --> 55:50.640]  you can take over them.
[55:50.640 --> 55:55.480]  Dalrymple, I was talking to about it, now he's familiar with the area now and he goes
[55:55.480 --> 56:00.780]  to hockey games at the San Jose, I forget, I don't know what the name of it is, but wherever
[56:00.780 --> 56:04.480]  the Sharks play, which is only one mile away from the convention center.
[56:04.480 --> 56:08.040]  So it's, you know, by city standards, not a far walk.
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.680]  Like that's the thing about San Jose is that downtown San Jose is all in one area.
[56:12.680 --> 56:14.920]  It's not spread out.
[56:14.920 --> 56:17.880]  And he said like after hockey games, you know, 10, 30, 11, there's all sorts of stuff to
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.800]  do, bars to get beers at and places to eat late and stuff like that.
[56:21.800 --> 56:24.480]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.760]  Are you going to go no matter what?
[56:28.760 --> 56:29.760]  I'm going, yeah.
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.200]  I actually, last year I told myself, you know what, I'm not going to get tickets anymore.
[56:34.200 --> 56:37.480]  Like I'm, cause I'm, I'm going to like fewer sessions.
[56:37.480 --> 56:42.320]  I'm like, you know, it's, I feel now that I got, I'm wasting a ticket because I keep
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.240]  trying to do more and more other things.
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.120]  Like I keep getting double booked for time slots with meetings and social events and
[56:48.120 --> 56:49.120]  podcast events and everything.
[56:49.120 --> 56:51.400]  I was like, you know what, I just, I'm just not going to take it.
[56:51.400 --> 56:54.720]  And now I'm actually kind of, I'm questioning that because now it's going to be different.
[56:54.720 --> 56:56.760]  Like, well maybe I should get a ticket this year.
[56:56.760 --> 56:57.760]  I don't know.
[56:57.760 --> 56:59.080]  But I'm definitely going out there.
[56:59.080 --> 57:00.080]  Yeah.
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.720]  I mean, I'll go just to cover the keynote and I have nothing to announce, but hopefully
[57:04.720 --> 57:08.800]  to do my live show again.
[57:08.800 --> 57:12.200]  But I always do that on, try to always do it on Tuesday evenings.
[57:12.200 --> 57:13.680]  My question is how long to stay?
[57:13.680 --> 57:15.520]  Like I don't know if I'm going to stay all week.
[57:15.520 --> 57:17.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.520]  It's because the thing is we don't know.
[57:20.520 --> 57:22.300]  It is a whole new conference effectively.
[57:22.300 --> 57:26.440]  So we don't know if, you know, if you, if you say, if you plan to like, you know, go
[57:26.440 --> 57:29.420]  in Sunday and leave Wednesday or so, you know, something like that.
[57:29.420 --> 57:32.860]  Are you going to regret that you didn't stay until the cool things that were going to happen
[57:32.860 --> 57:33.860]  on Thursday night?
[57:33.860 --> 57:35.160]  Like you don't know.
[57:35.160 --> 57:38.880]  And that's why I'm kind of thinking like I might just do my usual, like, you know, Sunday
[57:38.880 --> 57:44.400]  through Friday afternoon thing just, you know, the worst that can happen is I have a couple
[57:44.400 --> 57:45.720]  of bonus days in California.
[57:45.720 --> 57:46.720]  Oh no.
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.640]  You know, there are worse things in the world than that.
[57:50.640 --> 57:54.640]  Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do, but anyway, what a surprise.
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.240]  So that came out like what the day after ATP last week.
[57:57.240 --> 57:58.240]  So you guys didn't get to talk about it yet.
[57:58.240 --> 57:59.240]  Yeah.
[57:59.240 --> 58:00.240]  Haven't talked about it yet.
[58:00.240 --> 58:01.240]  Yeah.
[58:01.240 --> 58:03.520]  I think the gist of it and I think, I think everybody's sort of wrapping their heads around
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.800]  it is I think Apple, Apple can spend the money on surrounding stuff around the convention
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.880]  center and the number of people that'll be there, you know, attendance is not going up,
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.880]  but even if it's just 5,000 plus a couple of thousand people who, you know, come in
[58:19.880 --> 58:23.360]  or I don't know if a couple of thousand come, but if a thousand people come just to be there
[58:23.360 --> 58:25.800]  and simultaneous with it.
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.760]  And then the other factor is combined with all the South Bay companies whose employees
[58:29.760 --> 58:35.560]  might come after work when they couldn't, if it was all the way up in San Francisco.
[58:35.560 --> 58:39.200]  I think it's, I think it's going to feel like Apple's taken over San Jose.
[58:39.200 --> 58:40.200]  Yeah.
[58:40.200 --> 58:47.480]  So my main concern is if I don't get a conference ticket, will I not be able to get into major
[58:47.480 --> 58:49.600]  events that I will then want to get into?
[58:49.600 --> 58:50.600]  Yeah.
[58:50.600 --> 58:53.920]  You know, like that's, that's been like my one, my one concern of like, you know, should
[58:53.920 --> 58:56.200]  I go any way or not?
[58:56.200 --> 59:01.440]  And because in San Francisco there was so much to do everywhere that whether you had
[59:01.440 --> 59:07.500]  a WDC badge didn't really matter for anything except for the beer bash.
[59:07.500 --> 59:11.360]  That was the only thing where it really mattered whether you had it or not, but all the other
[59:11.360 --> 59:15.040]  events that happened around the, around the conference were for anybody.
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.720]  And I hope that's going to keep being the case, but I don't know yet.
[59:17.720 --> 59:19.400]  Yeah, I think it'll be the same.
[59:19.400 --> 59:20.400]  I do.
[59:20.400 --> 59:22.800]  I do think, here's my theory.
[59:22.800 --> 59:27.840]  One of my theories is that they'll have the bash on campus at Apple Campus too.
[59:27.840 --> 59:31.520]  Because I think that would be awesome, but I don't think it's ready.
[59:31.520 --> 59:32.720]  Maybe by June it will be, I don't know.
[59:32.720 --> 59:34.040]  I mean, it's certainly cutting it close.
[59:34.040 --> 59:35.080]  Yeah, I don't know.
[59:35.080 --> 59:36.760]  Or maybe they'll have it back at Infinite Loop.
[59:36.760 --> 59:37.760]  I don't know.
[59:37.760 --> 59:39.120]  That's what they used to do.
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.120]  Is it big enough?
[59:40.120 --> 59:43.680]  Like, is the courtyard there big enough to hold today's WDC crowd?
[59:43.680 --> 59:44.680]  I don't know.
[59:44.680 --> 59:45.680]  Yeah, I don't know.
[59:45.680 --> 59:47.320]  I mean, the new courtyard certainly is.
[59:47.320 --> 59:49.320]  Like, Yerba Buena felt crowded.
[59:49.320 --> 59:52.880]  And that's a big yard, you know.
[59:52.880 --> 59:57.640]  But if you, you know, it got crowded by the stage, but yeah, I don't know.
[59:57.640 --> 59:58.640]  No, no.
[59:58.640 --> 59:59.640]  It was empty by the stage.
[59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640]  I guess you're right.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640]  I know.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640]  You know what I mean.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640]  It was very crowded.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:08.160]  The more crowded back you got from the stage, the more crowded it got, because none of the
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.080]  nerds at the conference ever wanted to be near the band.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.160]  We all wanted to talk to each other.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]  Right.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160]  You can't hear.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]  I can't hear you.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.160]  Let's go to the back.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]  It's the worst gig for a band to ever play.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.160]  Some of them had success.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.960]  I felt bad for them every year, because it's like, oh, God, like you're playing to a bunch
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.920]  of nerds' backs who are, like, plugging their ears because they don't want to hear you.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920]  Right.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920]  Oh, it's terrible.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920]  All right.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.840]  Let's shift gears to...
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:41.320]  There's supposedly a March Apple event, and they're going to do iPads, new iPads, possibly
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:47.200]  a 128-gigabyte upgrade to the iPhone SE, and then what else?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.880]  A new red color for the iPhone SE, or maybe a new red color for all iPhones.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.520]  I think the rumor was a new red color for the main iPhone 7 line.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.520]  Oh, maybe.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.520]  Which is kind of odd to do halfway through a cycle, but, I mean, who knows?
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.000]  Again, this is the kind of thing where if we look back and say, well, Apple never does
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  that, the iPhone makes a lot of money, Apple's an evolving company, they can do whatever
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.440]  they want, and they will.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.720]  If they think there's a good reason to do something like this, they would do it.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.760]  So I think one of the interesting things is that just about everything we know about,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:24.080]  or have heard, I shouldn't say we know, but just about all the rumors we have about upcoming
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.120]  Apple products all come from Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst at KGI Securities.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.160]  He certainly seems like he has the best info the earliest.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160]  Right.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.240]  Like, Gurman has had some stories at Bloomberg, but it hasn't really been a lot.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.400]  He had an Apple TV thing recently, but it's just 4K coming to Apple TV.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.160]  In terms of iPads and iPhones, he hasn't had a lot recently.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.860]  It seems like it's all coming from Ming-Chi Kuo.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.000]  It seems like Gurman's sources are maybe more in the Mac area.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.240]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.680]  Because he seems to have more Mac info, and Ming-Chi Kuo seems to have more iOS supply
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680]  chain info.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.680]  It's all supply chain info.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.760]  I don't think Ming-Chi Kuo has any sources at Cupertino.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760]  I really don't.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.000]  And a lot of what he gets wrong is from not having those sources, but that he has seemingly
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.280]  drinking buddy status with some Foxconn executives.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:27.600]  But it was interesting, because just yesterday I'm looking at the date Mac Otakara, the Japanese
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.000]  rumor site, who has a pretty good track record, too.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Yeah, they're pretty good.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.360]  I mean, I'll put a link in the show notes to the one, but I'll put it in the Mac rumors
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.640]  version because it's in English.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:49.120]  What they're saying is, much like KGI or Ming-Chi Kuo, the new 9.7 and 12.9-inch iPad Pros—so
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.920]  like the iPad Pros, we already have new ones—a bizarre to me rumor of a 10.5-inch iPad, which
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:03.900]  basically has the same footprint as the 9.7-inch as we know it, but with an edge-to-edge display.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.020]  So get rid of the bezels at the top and bottom.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:11.740]  So it has a 10.5-inch diagonal display because it gets rid of the bezels.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.440]  Now the reason I call that bizarre, getting rid of bezels sounds like something Apple
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.800]  would do, but the reason it sounds bizarre to me is that all these rumors say that it's
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.640]  going to come alongside a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:30.600]  Like to me, what both makes sense and fits the historical pattern is, if they're going
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.240]  to do that, introduce that as the new high-end model at this footprint and put the 9.7-inch
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:44.640]  iPad Pro at a minus $100 or minus $200 price point lower down the chain.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.960]  There's an awful lot—all these rumors say that they're going to do both.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.880]  And now, Mac Atacara yesterday says there's also going to be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.000]  So in other words, an iPad Pro Mini.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Which should be the first update to the Mini in quite some time.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.560]  Yeah, but I think that they've done that before.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.240]  I think if you look at the updates to the Mini, that they've skipped years before.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.240]  Yeah.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.680]  I mean, so, you know, let's—easy things first.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.960]  The 7.9-inch iPad Pro Mini, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.920]  And it's probably got last-year specs, right?
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]  That's what I would think.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.520]  It probably has the specs of the current 9.7 Pro, which is now a year old.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.760]  So that makes sense, right?
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.080]  You know, Apple doesn't need to save the Pro name only for the higher-end products because
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.920]  Pro means they can sell a $100 pencil and a $150 keyboard with these things.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.840]  So they love spreading Pro all over the whole line.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.880]  I wonder what a—I mean, a keyboard that would fit—I have an iPad Mini in front of
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880]  me right now.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.120]  That's a cramped keyboard.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.400]  Yeah, I used, like, a Logitech one once a long time ago, and it was nearly impossible
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.400]  to use.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  It was tough.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:59.000]  Like, the 9.7 size allows for a just barely usable keyboard case on it, but the 7.9, that's
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  tough.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.160]  I mean, they do exist, and I guess somebody's buying them, but that's certainly not a good
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160]  keyboard.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.520]  But anyway, so that makes sense.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:15.720]  So between 9.7 and 10.5, you know, there are these kind of similar rumors that we'll probably
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:22.240]  get to also with the whole iPhone 7S and 8 being also simultaneously released in the
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.160]  fall, and they're basically being like the iPhone, quote, 8 would be this similar bezel-less,
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.900]  you know, larger screen, smaller case, higher-priced model.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.520]  So that's—you know, if they're going to do that for the iPhone line, whatever their
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.360]  reasons are for doing it there, maybe they finally got their edge-to-edge design and
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.920]  technology lined up so they can finally do this, so they're very excited to do this,
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.600]  but it costs more to do it for various reasons or whatever else, or they just wanted to have
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.280]  a premium product because they want to start—you know, if people are really treating their
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:00.600]  phones and their iPads as computers, both in what they're doing with them and in their
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.800]  replacement cycles, then Apple probably wants them to boost those prices up a little bit.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.600]  It's like, well, if you're only going to buy a new phone every three years or a new iPad
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.200]  every five, and you're going to treat it like you used to treat your $2,000 laptop, well,
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.660]  if we can get you to pay 1,100 bucks for it, that's better for us, and we can give you
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:21.720]  higher-end specs and higher-end, you know, more storage and fancier screen technology
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  and all this other stuff.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.720]  So it makes lots of sense why they would have higher-priced ones at all.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:33.600]  And it's totally plausible with modern Apple that they would also keep making lower-end
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.000]  ones that, you know, rather—because, you know, when Apple releases new things like
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.380]  this, you know, new iOS devices, new form factors, one of the ways that they can release
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.240]  these things that they have in the past is you release the new thing at the old price
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.800]  point and push everything down 100 bucks.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.460]  The other way you do it is you leave everything at the same price point and you bring the
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:59.020]  new one in that's 100 bucks more than the old one was because the new one's higher-end.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.920]  So that's what I see them probably doing here.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.080]  That's probably what the 10.5-inch iPad and the, quote, iPhone 8 with this weird edge-to-edge
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.620]  display, both of those are probably that latter kind of product where they both probably come
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.300]  into an existing lineup that itself doesn't really change or changes only in minor ways,
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.800]  and they come in at higher price points with more premium stuff.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]  Yeah.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.920]  So I think it's almost like you have to—because the pattern is the same, that there's going
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:29.620]  to be new models in the old form factor and there's amazing edge-to-edge, you know, blowaway
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.040]  design without the bezels.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.280]  It's the same story for the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]  So we might as well talk about the iPhone.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.280]  Did you just forestall the blowaway thing as a verb?
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280]  I might have.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280]  Oh, geez.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]  Or was it an adjective?
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280]  It was an adjective, yeah.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  An adjective.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280]  I might have.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280]  It's a big league.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280]  It's a big league design.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.280]  I thought it was big league, like B-I-G-L-Y.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280]  No, it's not.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280]  Every time—no.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:55.920]  Everybody who says that—we're talking about Trump here.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.920]  Trump uses big league as an adjective, and he's—it doesn't make any sense to say big
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920]  league.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.640]  It wouldn't—he says big league, but it comes out—
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.800]  I mean, I don't think not making sense is necessarily a—
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.680]  Yeah, but big league is what he's saying.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680]  Trust me.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.680]  All right.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.680]  So you're going to have these blowaway designs forestall.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.680]  All right.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680]  Keep going.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.600]  You can even see it when the White House transcribes his remarks.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.600]  It's big league.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.600]  It's going to be a big league design.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.560]  Are you sure I'm not just autocrafting for it?
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:37.480]  You know, I mean, would I bet on it, no, but I—it's the same story, but to me, it makes
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.840]  more sense with the iPhone than the iPad, and so the story with the iPhone is that there
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.000]  would be what would presumably be called or at least described—I mean, again, marketing
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.760]  names are the hardest thing to know for sure because they're the tightest-held secrets,
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.800]  but it sounds like they're going to do the 7S and 7S Plus exactly like you would think
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.400]  where it's the same form factor, close enough, like down to like the tenth of a millimeter
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:12.640]  where you can probably use the same case with presumably like a better camera and maybe
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.440]  like a next-generation A-series CPU.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.680]  You know, everything—exactly what you're thinking a 7S would be.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.720]  And then also this new iPhone.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.040]  I don't—if this is any—if there's any truth to this, I don't think there's any chance
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.440]  that they call this new iPhone the iPhone 8.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  There's just no way.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.360]  I think that they would call it the iPhone Pro because I think that's the only way that
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:45.960]  you can have a reasonable amount of excitement for the new 7S and 7S Plus and have this new
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960]  iPhone.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.080]  Like it doesn't make sense to me to have an iPhone 8 and a 7S in the same year.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.680]  Like why not just—because who wouldn't just buy the 8?
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.200]  Well, it's going to be expensive though.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200]  Right.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.200]  That's the part of the rumor.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.440]  All the rumors are it's going to be like a thousand dollars, which is like if you actually
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.120]  look at like the full price of iPhones, that is not that ridiculous.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.640]  It's like 150 bucks more than a similar respect Plus model would be.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640]  Right.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.760]  If you assume that it probably starts at 128 or 256, which it probably does.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:24.000]  The 256—no, a rumor came out today that it's going to have two models, 64 and 256.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Really?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Oh, God.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.960]  I would guess like it might be like 1049 for 64 and 1149 for 256.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.840]  At least it's only two.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.200]  But the idea would be that this would get slotted in at a new higher price point, that
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.840]  the 7S and 7S Plus would take the existing price points and that they're actually—instead
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.120]  of going lower, they're actually going more upscale, and that is a very Apple-like thing
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  to do.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.280]  Yeah, it makes sense on a lot of levels.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.880]  I mean, the cynical take is, of course, they're going to make a lot more money because the
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.380]  ASP is going to go up on their most profitable products and all that.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:03.040]  That's a big deal for them financially, for their performance on Wall Street, et cetera.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.040]  Okay.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.480]  But also, there are good reasons for it also.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.120]  One of them is they can afford to put higher-priced parts in this one.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:17.640]  So you could have something that maybe they couldn't afford parts price-wise to put in
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.640]  all the iPhones for a year, because that's a lot of phones, then they can have it in
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.560]  this model for people who are willing to pay another couple hundred bucks.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.840]  And then also, if the rumors are true that they're doing this crazy edge-to-edge screen
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.960]  thing, I think it's pretty clearly going to be OLED.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.320]  OLEDs are, at this scale, possibly they're having production yield problems with the
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.840]  type and quality and whatever that they're making.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.420]  And so maybe they can't make 80 million of them a quarter, whatever the number is.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:50.880]  So they have to have a mainstream iPhone for this coming year that isn't this crazy new
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.080]  screen.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.960]  But they also want to have this crazy new screen in whatever quantity they can make
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.800]  for people who are willing to pay for it.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.280]  And it lets them keep the kind of innovation crown going, because it's like this wonderful
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.880]  showpiece at the top of the line, even if 60% of the buyers aren't buying it.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.120]  I think, though, if they do this, it has to be in sufficient quantity that they can meet
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.840]  demand as well as they've met it in recent years with whatever the new top of the line
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  is.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.200]  Because I think a ton of people are going to want this.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.120]  If this exact rumor comes true, I don't know if it's 40%, but it's not going to be just
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  a sliver.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:39.600]  Like, there's going to be an awful lot of people who, for an extra $100 or $200 or even
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.800]  $300, are going to say, I want the new hotness.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:49.080]  And I think it's a risk if they're really going to do this.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.840]  And I think the idea, if you're complaining about Apple, is they don't take risks anymore.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.920]  Here's your story.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:01.800]  Because the risk I see happening is if they make this announcement and 40% of everybody
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:08.120]  who wants to buy a new iPhone in September wants this one, and it's instantly backordered
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.720]  three months or something, and nobody can get it instantly.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.720]  It will be.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.360]  None of those people are then going to say, oh, cancel my order, I'll get the 7S.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  Nobody's going to do that.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.720]  They're all going to say, I'll wait.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:25.800]  So what I could see happening, if they can't meet demand at least as well as they've done
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:32.020]  in recent years, just to say in the quarter they just reported, if they can't meet demand
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:40.520]  for this iPhone Pro as well as they did for the 7 and 7 Plus three months ago in what
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.060]  turned out to be the best-selling iPhone quarter ever, then I think they're in real trouble
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:50.460]  because everybody who's waiting for it is not going to settle on the 7S and 7S Plus.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.560]  And then year over year, it's going to look bad because they're going to take a big hit.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.200]  It'll even out eventually because eventually it's not like these people waiting for the
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.280]  iPhone Pro are going to switch to Android.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.960]  They'll wait till January or February or March or however long it takes to get it, but it's
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:13.320]  going to look bad in that year over year, quarter over quarter demand.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.760]  So I think that the idea, I've seen people say, oh, they'll do this, and it's sort of
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.360]  just like the 20th anniversary Mac.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:26.060]  It's like a little thing at the fringe for just a handful of people who are willing to
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.800]  spend a little bit more.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.960]  I don't think that's the case at all.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.820]  I think this might be the best-selling phone they come out with next year.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.520]  And I happen to know, I just anecdotally, I see lots of people on Twitter, the people
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.520]  who really care.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.600]  I mean, I've gone on then this along with the iPhone 7 looking so much like an iPhone
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.600]  6 and 6S.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.360]  I can't see why people are so obsessed with the exterior of the phone, but it's true that
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.760]  an awful lot of people are, that they're not even getting into what the camera does, how
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.280]  good the screen looks, how good the touch sensor is, how good the new virtual home button
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.920]  is, and all the other things that there are to like about it.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.920]  There's an awful lot of people, and you see it in all the tech reviews.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.440]  You certainly see it in most of the gadget reviews that it's like, ah, it looks like
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.440]  the old iPhone.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440]  Meh.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.760]  There's an awful lot of people who think like that, who've been waiting for years for, screw
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.760]  it.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.360]  I'll hold on to my old phone for another year because I know Apple's going to come out with
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]  a new thing eventually.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  Yeah.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.080]  I mean, it matters.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.400]  It matters a lot, and I think you're right.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.240]  I think a lot of people are going to want this new thing.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:35.800]  I mean, I think we've shown that as customers that no matter what the new iPhone is, no
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.920]  matter how happy we are or aren't with it, you know, in our social media posts and tech
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.900]  reviews and everything, we all want it, and we're all going to buy it, and we're all going
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.340]  to pay whatever it costs.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:53.600]  So yeah, they're going to, if this thing is real, unless it has some obscene downside,
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:59.060]  which it probably won't, and an extra 150 bucks is probably not enough of a downside
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:04.220]  for enough people, then they're going to sell this thing, like literally just they're going
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.360]  to sell as many as they can possibly make.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.900]  I really wonder why people would buy the 7S and 7S Plus.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:18.280]  I can totally see why they would keep selling the 7 and 7 Plus at lower prices, but I just
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.120]  can't see why people would sign up.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.480]  I guess it's people who have more sense than I do financially and who are like, well, it
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.480]  is $200.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.840]  I'll just get the 7S.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.120]  Yeah, and that's a lot of people.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:41.160]  It's everybody who doesn't buy the top of the line model in any other year.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.680]  People who don't buy the 256, even though they only use 128 of their storage, just in
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]  case they...
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]  I don't even buy the 256.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]  I do.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]  I know.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.600]  I can't stand the thought of not having the best one.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.720]  I just can't.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.560]  I often think, and then I say to myself, what happens if you're out and about and breaking
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.020]  news happens and you start shooting video of this major event?
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:11.480]  I don't want to run out of space to shoot video because I cheaped out on my phone by
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480]  $100.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480]  You'd have to be shooting a lot of video.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.300]  Well, I don't know.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.520]  Just thought that occurs to me.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.200]  I think the battery would die before you fill it up.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.200]  All right.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]  We'll come back to this.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.320]  I'm going to take another break here for a sponsor, but I'm not done with this because
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.960]  I want to take this back to the iPad because I don't think the iPhone story works with
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960]  the iPad.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.300]  But I'm going to take a break here and thanks to our next sponsor, our good friends at Eero.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.480]  You guys know who Eero is.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.600]  We talk about them a lot lately.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.400]  They're new Wi-Fi base stations.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.080]  The old model of Wi-Fi is that you get a router, you hook it up to your cable modem, put it
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.200]  somewhere probably wherever your cable box is in your house and then hope that that one
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.160]  router would give you good Wi-Fi throughout your whole house.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.880]  We've been doing that for like 15 years.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880]  Guess what?
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]  That model stinks.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.120]  And the old way, if you did that, you could also maybe get like an extender or something,
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.520]  but then all of a sudden you're playing like junior sysadmin trying to get this to work
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.560]  to have like a second device that connects to the first device and somehow extends the
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:16.960]  same network so that when you just open your device, it looks like the same network, whether
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.320]  you're upstairs or downstairs or whatever.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.440]  Eero is a system designed from the ground up to have multiple devices spread throughout
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.440]  your house.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:33.200]  It just coordinates all the nerdy stuff to make that happen seamlessly all by itself.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.080]  You don't even have to separate which device is the main one and which one are the satellites.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:45.560]  They're all actually the same little Apple TV style size hockey puck type things.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560]  Really nice design.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.960]  You can put them anywhere in your house.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.080]  If you have a Wi-Fi router anywhere in your house, the Eero is almost certainly better
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.480]  looking than smaller device.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.320]  They recommend three for most houses.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.360]  You could just go to their website and they'll tell you, put like how many floors your house
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.760]  in, how many square feet, and they'll give you a recommendation on that.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.340]  If you buy four and you really only need three, you can send one back.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.920]  You configure the whole thing through a nice, really nice app.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:17.480]  You don't have to go to like some weird website on the router at 192.168 whatever, none of
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.480]  that stuff.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.960]  It's a really nice app and you don't have to worry.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.240]  You're not playing sysadmin, you're just setting it up the way you want it to be.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.200]  You want to have a guest network, you'd say, give me a guest network, then your network
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.200]  has a guest network.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]  That's it.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200]  You're done.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.200]  Really, really great.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.200]  I've got one here.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200]  I've set it up.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.400]  I've replaced an Apple base station set up in our house with Eero and the speeds are
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400]  way better.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.800]  They even tell you in the app what your speeds are so you can check and it'll even tell you
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.160]  what kind of speeds you're getting from your cable company or files or whatever you've
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160]  got.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.760]  They even have great customer support.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.320]  That's something that the company is really invested in.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.240]  You can call and you get a hold of a real wifi expert within 30 seconds just in case
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.720]  you need it because look, this stuff's tough.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.680]  So maybe something happens 30 seconds.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.440]  You're talking to an expert.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.600]  Where do you go to find out more easy?
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.160]  Go to ero.com slash the talk show.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.720]  Go to the talk show.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.880]  Use that code and you'll get something nice.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.160]  I think you get expedited shipping.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.480]  Yeah, that's pretty sure that's it.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.480]  Yeah.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.120]  You get expedited shipping at ero.com so use that code.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.400]  The talk show.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400]  What's your talk?
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  What's your code?
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400]  Probably ATP.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  I think so.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.360]  You can use ATP too and then Marco will get credit for it.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.760]  Either way, it's fine with me.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.960]  Good company, Eero.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.720]  So anyway, I don't think that this middle iPad that doesn't have a bezel, I don't think
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.680]  that it has that same cache that this rumored iPhone does.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.520]  Would I pay an extra $200 to get a way cooler looking iPhone?
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520]  Yes.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.960]  Would I pay an extra $200 to get a cooler looking iPad?
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960]  No.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]  I don't think so.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.880]  Well, I think it's, you know, the iPad approach that Apple has taken in recent years has been
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.960]  pretty much scattershot.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.880]  Just like we have this product category.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.560]  It's not performing as well as we want it to or need it to.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.400]  So let's try a bunch of stuff.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.160]  And that has resulted in a lot of, you know, weird attempts for things and a lot of things
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.160]  that are really good.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:26.960]  And, you know, the whole iPad Pro branch of the product line, the whole thing with making
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:31.520]  a pencil after, you know, everyone assumed Apple never would because Steve Jobs made
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:38.080]  one comment 20 years ago, like, you know, they've been just trying a bunch of stuff.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:46.400]  And the fact is, what most people need out of their iPads to, like, you know, get more
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:52.280]  work done or more of their work done is really tricky, difficult, long term software stuff
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.840]  that's much harder to do.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.080]  It's much easier to just, let's try some new screen sizes and some new hardware abilities.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.480]  Like, that's actually easier to do than, like, let's figure out file management on iOS or
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:09.120]  windowing or any, like, those are way harder and, you know, or let's fix the App Store
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120]  pricing ecosystem.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.560]  Like, that's way harder than Apple, who's already an excellent hardware company, making
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.720]  one more screen size or making, you know, one more hardware configuration.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:27.760]  The iPad has never been, to my mind, an ooh and aah industrial design product, except
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.960]  for maybe the first one.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.920]  The first one was, like, because it was just like a quote unquote, they're making a tablet.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.320]  Nobody knows it's going to be thick.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320]  How big is it?
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.240]  Nobody knew, you know, what it was going to be like.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.820]  And then we saw it and it was like, wow, this is really nice.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.160]  And it's, wow, this is really kind of cool to have something with the touch latency of
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.800]  an iPhone on a big screen.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.800]  It was impressive.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.960]  But then every iteration since then has been very iterative, to my mind.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:01.720]  Like, there's never been one generation where you're like, whoa, with the possible exception
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.840]  of the move from non-retina to retina.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:12.000]  But even then, it's not really the way it looks without turning it on.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.280]  You know, like, the rumors about this iPhone Pro or iPhone 8 or whatever you want to call
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:22.480]  it are that it's going to look like, wow, what is that before you even turn it on?
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.880]  It doesn't seem, you know, that was never really the case with iPads.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.520]  I mean, the current iPad's looking off a lot like the original one.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.800]  I mean, the backs are flat now.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.680]  And the bezel on the side is narrower.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:38.560]  But like, the top and bottom bezel is almost exactly the same.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.500]  I think what it is, you know, it's a combination of them, like, trying to figure out, you know,
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:48.040]  what else can we try here to turn around the sales curve and to let this product really
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.760]  come into its own.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.280]  And then also, just like, the iPad, I don't think it's about flashiness.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.640]  I think this is actually just about utility.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:02.600]  The iPad really struggles between how much screen size you get versus how nice it is
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.960]  to use.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:09.720]  It's really this incredibly, you know, polar opposite relationship where like, if you want
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:15.040]  to get anything more done on it than browsing the web and watching video, you really want
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.040]  more screen space.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:21.160]  Like, if you try multitasking at all, the 9.7 can do it.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.720]  But it's, you know, it's pretty tight.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.680]  And the people who, like, people we know, like, in the community who are big pro iPad
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.600]  users who get a lot of their work done on iPads almost always prefer the 12.9 now for
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.320]  getting like, quote, work done, because it has more screen space.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:44.960]  But you know, anyone who's ever used a 12.9 can tell you, like, it's pretty big to, like,
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960]  for an iPad.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.760]  Like, for a laptop, it's still nice and small.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:55.340]  But for an iPad, the way you use and hold an iPad, it really is quite large.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:02.220]  And so, adding that screen space to get the 12.9 and its ability to have multitasking
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.680]  be better and to get more work done and more effectively has come at a great cost of this
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.020]  kind of unwieldy size for hand-holded iPad use.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.480]  That's why I think a lot of 12.9 users use, like, you know, keyboards and stuff where
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.480]  it's kind of more like a laptop propped up on a table more of the time, because if you're
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.320]  actually, like, using it, like, one-handed, like, you know, one hand to hold it and the
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.360]  other hand to, like, touch it or use the pencil, like, that's a pretty big iPad to do that
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  with.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.360]  It's kind of awkward.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.360]  It's kind of unwieldy.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.640]  So this 10-point whatever, I think, is an attempt to cram that screen resolution into
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:42.400]  the smaller body, which for iPad power users, and I guess we don't know how many of those
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.200]  there are, but for iPad power users, that sounds incredible.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:53.000]  That sounds like exactly what so many people would want in, I want an iPad that is still
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.440]  small enough to feel and handle like an iPad, and that means 9.7 roughly, you know, physical
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.880]  dimensions, but that would have more screen space so I could better multitask and get
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.800]  more of my work done on this device or get my work done more efficiently on this device.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:15.120]  And the speculation, I think, is that the pixel resolution, instead of being at 266
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.140]  pixels print, it's going to be 326, which is the pixel resolution of the Retina Mini
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:24.880]  and the iPhone.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.660]  That seems really small to me for a device that you would hold at a further away distance,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.240]  but maybe that's just my aging vision speaking.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.040]  I mean, it's just like the iPad Mini, you know, it's like if the iPad, you know, the
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.520]  iPad Mini just has like the 9.7 resolution shrunk down, it's going to be that same relationship.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.720]  So like, if the iPad Mini looks acceptable to you, and you can use it with that eyestrain,
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.560]  then this would probably work for you, too.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.080]  It just seems like a confusing decision, though, which one you would buy, doesn't it?
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080]  You don't think so.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.520]  Well, it's probably going to be more expensive than the equivalent 9.7, so it's probably
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.840]  going to be like 100 bucks more at least, so, you know, and it may be like slightly
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.800]  cheaper than the 12.9 version of it, you know, so who knows?
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.520]  I mean, we'll see what they do.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.480]  I think at this point, it's very clear that Apple's strategy with the iPad, again,
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480]  it's scattershot.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.760]  It's like, let's just try a bunch of stuff and see what works, and just give people tons
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.920]  and tons of options.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:25.080]  You know, they will now sell you an iPad at pretty much every $100 price point from $250
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:29.680]  on up to like $1,100, and it's like any of these price points, pick your price, whatever
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.340]  you're willing to pay for an iPad, we got one to sell you at exactly that price point,
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:36.440]  but a little bit more after accessories.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.360]  And I think for what they're trying to do with the iPad, like I think it's very clear
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:48.720]  that again, I think they maybe don't really know what will work and what won't to boost
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.200]  sales or to carry this platform forward, so they are just trying a bunch of random stuff
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.440]  at this point, and I'm sure there's more thought that goes into it than that, but it
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.680]  certainly seems like they're taking a lot of hardware risks here in order to just cover
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:07.160]  more of the market in hopes that people will want what they're now making without having
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.800]  to really dramatically change iOS to be more PC-like.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:16.320]  I don't know, it just seems really curious to me that this new bezel design would debut
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.240]  alongside the iPad Pro 2, you know?
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.240]  I don't know.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.400]  I mean, I probably wouldn't under Steve, but I think this is kind of a hallmark of Tim
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:33.040]  Cook's Apple is like, you know, just is not an aversion to throwing a bunch of different
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.040]  options out there.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.240]  I don't think that's Tim Cook.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240]  I really don't.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240]  I don't know.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.600]  I don't know what to think.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.480]  I think there's something we're missing if this is true.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.440]  I just don't get it.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.160]  I don't know.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.580]  I do think, have you played around with the math?
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:53.440]  There was a MacRumors had a report from Ming-Chi Kuo on this new, the iPhone, as I'm calling
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.080]  it, the iPhone Pro, as others are saying, the iPhone 8, which supposedly has a 5.8-inch
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:06.720]  OLED display, but that's the whole device, and only 5.15 inches of it are really the
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.840]  sort of, what we think of as the iPhone display now, and the rest is like the chin, and presumably
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:19.640]  there'll be new features in the OS that can light stuff up down there.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:26.120]  But basically, if you do the math, and he's exactly right, it's a device that's a very
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.000]  different aspect ratio than the iPhone as we know it.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.960]  Yeah, like it's too tall and skinny.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:38.760]  Yeah, it's basically a device that the hardware is as narrow as an iPhone SE, because it's
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.600]  an edge-to-edge display.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:47.040]  And if you actually put like an iPhone SE or an iPhone 5 on top of a 4.7-inch iPhone
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:52.400]  and turn the screen on and then put like an iPhone SE on top of it, it's pretty much exactly
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400]  the same width.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:54.400]  Hang on.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]  I'm doing this now.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.400]  Yeah.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.400]  I got this right here.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.400]  All right.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]  So it's a device.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.400]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:05.160]  It's a device that's actually narrower in hand than an iPhone 7, you know, than a 4.7-inch.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.040]  It's more like an SE in hand, but it's as tall as an iPhone 7.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.600]  In other words, it's as tall, almost exactly the height, and it's a device of the iPhone
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.280]  with a 4.7-inch screen.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.840]  So as a piece of hardware in your hand, not even turning it on, it would be smaller than
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:26.680]  an iPhone 7, about the same height and a little narrower.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:37.200]  But the aspect ratio that KGI is saying, instead of being 16 to 9, it's more like 2.15 to 1.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:42.520]  It's more like a widescreen movie, you know, like a anamorphic movie.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.680]  It's a lot wider.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.280]  It's not just a little bit wider than 16 to 9.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280]  It's a lot wider.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:55.320]  Yeah, I mean, that's why I think the most likely explanation for this is just like,
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.200]  there's some other key piece of information that we don't know, you know, about how the
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:04.040]  screen is used, how it's shaped around the device, you know, maybe like there's this
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:10.480]  like function area at the bottom, where presumably some kind of like home button area will go.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.720]  Maybe there's one at the top also, which we could slice off that other part of the aspect
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.920]  ratio and therefore make it look right.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920]  Who knows?
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:24.560]  But this is getting into really nitty-gritty specifics that I think we probably don't have
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:29.080]  enough information to really gauge, you know, what's real here and what's not.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:36.160]  I mean, it's so early and there's no other information backing this up besides KGI stuff,
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.800]  which again, KGI stuff has been good about a lot of details about stuff.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.400]  Especially on component type stuff.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  Right.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.240]  But all this, you know, all this is saying is the panel resolution and there's lots of
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.380]  things that could, you know, affect that being correct or not, and that being like how we
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.520]  think of the screen shape on the phone or not.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.200]  Like, you know, OLED allows lots of flexibility.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:04.880]  It allows, you know, not only like different shape things, but it allows like holes to
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.320]  be cut in panels and stuff like that.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.340]  You can do all sorts of crazy stuff with OLED.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.360]  So it could be something weird that we don't, that we, we can't explain this yet with what
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:19.040]  we know, but it could be a much less interesting story than, than, you know, oh, it's going
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.280]  to be a new shape phone.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:25.360]  Like, well, it might just be, it might look like what we have now in general proportions
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.360]  and aspect ratios and just have this weird implementation detail about why the screen
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360]  happens to be this certain resolution.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.520]  Would you want it to be that tall, do you think?
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:41.240]  Like what if it, what if it really is just, it's as wide as iPhone 7, but tall, you know,
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.240]  way taller.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.640]  So like you'd see more messages in a list in mail.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.320]  If you're reading an article, you'd see more of the article on screen at once, but at the
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.480]  exact same width.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:58.400]  As the designer of an app that has to lay out a giant square in the middle of its now
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.020]  playing screen, that would be awesome.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.280]  But as a user of the phone, I don't think I need that really.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:09.120]  I mean, that's, I think there's a lot of advantages to the, to the phone display being 16 by nine.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.040]  One of them is when you turn it sideways and shoot video, you have the whole screen and
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.600]  it looks right.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.280]  So there's a lot of advantages to that.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.160]  16 by nine allows you to lay out a lot of different shapes fairly nicely within it.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.960]  You know, squares, four by three.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:30.280]  So and so it's, I don't, I don't think I really want the screen to be taller and skinnier,
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]  but who knows?
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.520]  I mean, I'd have to actually see it and use it.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.520]  Well, the screen wouldn't be any skinnier and the numbers add up.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.960]  So he's saying that the, this is his numbers for the pixel resolution, 2,436 high.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.620]  This is for the display area, not the whole panel, but the part that would be used as
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.100]  a display area by 1125 wide.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:54.200]  Now 1125 wide is really interesting because an iPhone seven, I know the iPhone six S and
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:05.160]  the six, the ones that were 4.7 inches have a 375 point and uh, at two acts and it's in
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.040]  pixels it's, what is 375 times two?
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.800]  It's a seven fifties.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.560]  And so if you take 375 times three, guess what?
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.560]  You get 1125.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.800]  So basically it's saying we're going to have three X.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.560]  It's exactly three acts.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:25.600]  So it would be the exact same point for point size as the iPhone 4.7 inch screens that we
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.300]  know except instead of being at two X resolution, it would be three X and unlike the plus phones,
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.280]  it would be a real three acts with no down sampling, which I mean that would look great
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.240]  because the plus phones with their like, you know, rendered three X scale down to 10 DP
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.020]  that already looks really nice.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.480]  Like it doesn't, it isn't a massive difference over two X, but it is a difference.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.400]  It's like you, it does kind of look nicer and I can't explain why I don't think I can
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.600]  really see like the pixels for making it, but it just does look nicer.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.680]  So you know, to have it be true three X uh, and not even have to do the down sampling
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.720]  compared to what we have now in the 4.7 inch line I think would look really great.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  Yeah.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.260]  I think that like 10 years ago or, or prior the down sampling technique, even if it was
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.800]  technically a higher resolution screen, but if you down sampled it might look bad.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.880]  I think it probably would have, but I think at this point the pixels are so small that
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.720]  down sampling actually makes it look better as so long as the actual pictures are smaller.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.960]  But anyway, this rumored phone would actually be true to three X resolution, which, and
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.080]  the fact that the numbers really add up makes, gives me, it makes me think that he's onto
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.080]  something.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:42.040]  Yeah, I think cause like these are, these are weird numbers to just make up or to like
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.760]  to misinterpret, you know, like, so there is probably something here.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.080]  I think again, the only question comes down to like, how are these pixels actually allocated
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.240]  to the various screen elements?
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  Right.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.060]  And what does the app get and what does the system get?
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.800]  So anyway, exactly.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.000]  The other last aspect of this is that it seems like nobody knows what the hell is going on
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  with the touch ID.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.160]  It seems like some of this stuff is like, well, a touch ID must go away because the
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.660]  display goes all the way to the bottom.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.720]  So there's nowhere to put the little Sapphire button, which is wrong.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.720]  I think so too.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:20.080]  I don't think, I think that there's a way to integrate it into the screen.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.520]  Just put it in the middle, you know, and you know, clearly the move away from the physical
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.320]  button last year to a virtual button that has haptic feedback would play right into
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.880]  this.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.980]  But then there's all these rumors, also rumors that they're going to use a new fancy new
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:39.360]  camera to do face recognition or something like that.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.360]  I wouldn't be surprised if they do that, but I would be a little surprised if they did
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.560]  it in place of touch ID because I feel like touch ID it's, it seems like it's like a habit
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560]  people already have.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.280]  I don't feel like they could take that away.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.080]  Well, I mean they, again, they could, they could try whatever they want, especially if
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.540]  it's all like this weird high end one that is already kind of like selecting for fewer
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:59.540]  buyers.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.680]  But, uh, but I, I'm, I think that's unlikely.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.680]  I'm with you on that.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.120]  I mean, again, we'll see what happens.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.520]  I mean, I think we all thought the headphone jack was unlikely too, but no, I didn't.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.520]  Okay.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.520]  You didn't.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.240]  I couldn't wait for him to get rid of my headphone jack.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:21.540]  Uh, anyways, I don't have the energy for that today, but yeah, um, I, the, the whole face
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:27.040]  recognition thing, uh, I, uh, they, I'm sure they wouldn't do it if they couldn't do it
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  really well.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.040]  Right.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.360]  The same thing with the fingerprint where the first fingerprint sensor was, was pretty
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.360]  darn good.
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.360]  Yeah.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.760]  And like when you compared to previous fingerprint sensors at the time, they were all really
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.080]  awkward and garbagey and Apple came out with a really good one and now they're all pretty,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.600]  you know, they're all up better than they used to be.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.520]  Uh, you know, people saying now that they're like face recognition on their Samsung, whatever,
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.360]  whatever, uh, was, was crappy.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:55.500]  Uh, I think again, like I don't, I don't see Apple doing this unless they could do it really
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500]  well.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:00.040]  So I wouldn't worry too much about what these things have been like in the past from other
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.040]  people.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.800]  Uh, but I still, despite saying that, I still think it's, it's unlikely that this is what
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.480]  they have in mind just cause it's, it, it doesn't sound like it would be better.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.800]  It sounds like it would be worse.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:11.800]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.960]  I guess the other thing too is that when I first heard these rumors a few months ago,
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.000]  I was really, really skeptical cause again, same thing with the iPads for it.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.480]  It's so un atypical for Apple to introduce two generations of new stuff at the same time.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480]  Right?
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.440]  Like if they do this, the seven S and seven S plus are totally going to get lost cause
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.140]  they are, they're debuting as mid range phones.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.680]  And that's just hasn't happened before.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:42.560]  Um, and the other aspect is that Apple has had so much success since the iPhone six by
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.800]  selling two size phones at really three size if you count the se, which is obviously a
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.800]  surprise hit.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.920]  I mean they've admitted that they underestimated demand for that.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.260]  Um, so multiple sizes have proven so popular.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:01.320]  Why in the world would they come out with a brand new design at only one size?
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.920]  But when you do all the math and think about this, it's actually a pretty good size to
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:15.880]  be a one size fits all because it's, um, you know, the usable display area is 4.5 0.45
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:24.520]  inches more than the 4.7 inch phone diagonally it's 0.35 inches less than the 5.5 inch phone.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.700]  So it's right in the middle, right in the middle and the end air is a little bit on
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.700]  the bigger side.
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:29.700]  Yeah.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.880]  So physically in hand, it's narrower than the 4.7 inch phone, which is to me the biggest
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:40.120]  factor of what makes the iPhone se so, so nice to hold is that it's so narrow.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  So in terms of like, well, you like something that fits in your hand really securely and
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.440]  that you can go from side to side with your thumb and you like the fit more information
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:55.380]  on screen at once, like an iPhone seven plus and the last aspect to all these rumors is
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:03.180]  that it's supposedly going to have a, um, iPhone seven plus caliber, at least in the
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:07.720]  general range battery as opposed to the 4.7 because that's the other factor.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.720]  I mean, I know it.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:11.840]  I mean, there's some people who just love the big phone and you and I both know people
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.240]  who have the seven plus and they don't even like the size, but they do it.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.480]  I mean, I think you were even talking about it where the battery life alone is sometimes
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.960]  a reason enough to get it like, ah, yeah, it doesn't fit my pocket.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.680]  It's too big to hold, but I could use it all day and still have battery life at the end
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680]  of the day.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:34.600]  Although to be fair, that was a lot more true of the six versus six plus that it has been
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.520]  of the, of the success or seven generations.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.560]  Like the gap is now smaller and to the point where now like the battery life on the seven
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:46.680]  is actually pretty decent and on the seven plus it is better, but it's not better by
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.880]  as much as it used to be in the previous ones.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.540]  Yeah, it's, it's gotta say it's, it's the seven has the best battery life for me.
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.200]  I think of any iPhone I've ever had.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.200]  Me too.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.200]  Um, the only time I ever get down into red is on days when I somehow admit a circumstance
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.500]  where I didn't even start the day with a hundred percent, which is rare because usually I sleep
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.920]  with it charging.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:13.800]  But anyway, um, all right, let me take another break here and thank our third and final sponsor
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]  of the day.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  Who do you think it is?
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.720]  You have a guess?
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.720]  Hmm.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720]  Casper, Squarespace, Hover.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.440]  Well, you got it, but you can only guess one.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:29.160]  I'm going to go Squarespace, Casper, Casper.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160]  You guys know Casper.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.160]  They're the obsessively engineered mattress and they sell it at a shockingly fair price.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:38.640]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show and use that code, the talk show, and you will save
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.800]  50 bucks towards any mattress.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.720]  Insert X asterisk right there.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  There's a footnote.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720]  You have to wait for it.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  Here's the deal.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:55.080]  Casper to me is it's, it's like an apple like company where to me design is making decisions
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:58.860]  and they've designed one perfect mattress.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:04.200]  You don't go to Casper and select from like six different types of mattress and then get
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200]  the size you want.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.440]  No, you just pick the size you want.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.440]  That's it.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.120]  And then they send it to you and it's one perfect mattress.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.080]  They've engineered, they have mattress engineers.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.080]  That's a real thing.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.060]  They spent a lot of money and time to get one mattress that's just is the right mattress
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.060]  for most people.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:25.520]  A combination of a supportive memory foam and uh, uh, all sorts of other technology
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.420]  ships to you in a little box.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:31.920]  It's about, it's the size of like a little like, like a little dorm room refrigerator
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.280]  or maybe a little bigger than that, but remarkably small for a big mattress.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.900]  You put it in your bedroom, you open the box following their instructions.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:41.680]  It sucks all the air out of the room to fill the mattress.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.840]  So you, you get lightheaded when you do it and you'll kind of get dizzy, but it's fun
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.000]  to be in a room when it happens.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.600]  It makes a very cool sound and then boom, you've got a great mattress.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.700]  I say it all the time.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.560]  It's going to a mattress store is gross because what do you want to do?
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:01.200]  You want to sit on a bed that all sorts of other people have come in and sat on and laid
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:07.120]  on and whatever and laying on a mattress with bright fluorescent lights in a mattress store.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.200]  It doesn't simulate sleep.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.320]  So the fact that you can actually sit on a mattress in a retail store, it doesn't really
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.560]  give you any better hint of whether you're going to light the mattress you buy anyway.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.320]  So why don't you just trust Casper?
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.480]  Buy it next time you need a mattress.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.320]  They give you a hundred night home trial.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.800]  If you don't love it, they'll just give them a ring or go to the website.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.660]  They'll pick it up at your house and give you a full refund.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.320]  No questions asked, no hard sell.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.640]  This is not like, it's not like sending your cable box back and cord cutting where they
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.520]  send like a Gestapo after you to try to keep it.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.400]  No, they'll just say, okay, sure, sorry.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.520]  You know, here's your money back.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.680]  We'll come pick up the mattress.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.680]  Here's the asterisk.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.040]  They also sell a dog mattress and I keep hearing from people who've bought it for their dogs
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.040]  that their dogs.
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.040]  Yeah, they have a dog mattress and it's very, very popular.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.280]  People who've got, if listeners of the show have gotten it, love it, but here's the deal.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.160]  You don't save the 50 bucks on it because it's like a lower cost mattress.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.040]  And this is the gist of it is I got a whole bunch of email from people who bought the
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.200]  dog mattress and then they said, Hey, I just wanted to say, I love the mattress.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.960]  My dog loves it, but the 50 bucks code didn't work.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.000]  I botched it the first time they had the dog mattress.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.200]  So anyway, go to casper.com slash the talk show.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.560]  Remember that code, the talk show, say 50 bucks towards your mattress unless it's a
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.260]  dog mattress, but you'll get 50 bucks a love from your dog that'll, that'll make up for
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.260]  it.
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:23.260]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.260]  All right.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:31.060]  Why don't we talk about, uh, overcast, overcast 3.0 just shipped yesterday and big update.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:36.160]  I knew you were working on this, but I somehow had no idea that it was that close to shipping.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160]  Yeah.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.040]  I think I was even on the beta.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.100]  Was I on the page?
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:41.200]  You were definitely on the list.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.920]  I don't know if you actually ever installed it, but you were on the list.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920]  I think I did.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.880]  I think I remember my overcast having the orange dot next to it, but I don't, I never
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.520]  remembered any, I, I, I, I remember the switch to cards and talking to you about it.
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:57.040]  And I remember playing with the slide on the card.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.440]  This was months ago though.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.960]  And, and you had it really like when I was, when I was in Philly, I showed you a prototype
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.640]  and I had you play with it on my phone and tell me what you thought I'd hop sing, right?
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.400]  We were at hop sing and I was playing with it and I had, and it was already, the prototype
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400]  was very, very good.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.400]  I had very minor feedback, but it was, I couldn't even find anything to complain about.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.880]  Um, I forget what I wrote today.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]  Did I write this today?
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.480]  I know I wrote a bit about the business model, but did I write about how if you casual user
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.880]  not paying attention isn't going to be, even though there's a yet.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:31.120]  So that's my two points is that, uh, it's a great update because all these things, every
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:35.480]  single thing you documented on your blog about the changes, I think every single one of them,
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.720]  it's like, yes, I totally agree.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720]  This is better.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.720]  This is better.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.720]  This is better.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.520]  But I think a casual person who just wants to listen to podcasts, they, they, and if
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.560]  they have like auto updates on, they may not even notice that that it's a new version.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:53.840]  It's, it's odd because here I was like, you know, really busting my butt and just changing
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:54.840]  a little.
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:59.260]  It was a lot of work going into these changes and overcast three.
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:02.980]  And then at the end, when it comes time to like, you know, write the release notes and
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:06.840]  start like promoting it to people and it's all right, well, what, what's the list of
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:15.040]  new features and 3.0 and it's like, uh, I redesigned a lot of the UI.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.240]  That's about it.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.940]  There's like, there's like a couple of like Q features here and there, but it's, and there's
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:25.600]  a new watch app that's, which actually does less than the old one, but it's way faster.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.560]  And that's about it.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:32.800]  Like the, the bullet point list of what is new in this update is incredibly short unless
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.800]  you want to go through and like itemize all the little UI changes, but nobody wants to
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.640]  read that because nobody cares.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.800]  What you care about is the whole thing, like how, how the whole thing feels and works for
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.160]  you and everything else.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:49.520]  And there were tons of changes and tons of, of time that went into this, that most of
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.080]  which is fairly subtle or hidden or is the kind of change that you notice the very first
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.360]  day you use it.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:01.040]  And then it just becomes normal and you, you immediately stop noticing because it's, that's
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.960]  how this app is now.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.080]  And and you know, and things like, you know, the whole, the card UI that took forever to
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080]  get working.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.520]  That took so long and, and so much work and there, and there are still so many like weird
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.080]  little considerations with it.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:26.240]  Like one of the things I had to issue a quick 3.0.1 update because I moved all of the like
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.000]  secondary screens in the app into these cards because I have like a reusable controller
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.080]  that I, that I can use for anything now to put it in one of these cards.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:40.880]  And the problem is that when a, when an iOS standard table view is in one of these cards
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:46.900]  in certain modes, the reorder controls like the drag handles and when a table's in reordering
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.920]  mode just don't work.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.460]  Like it moves like, you know, two pixels and then stops.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:57.000]  And it's only because it's in this card environment and a few, a few of the implementation details
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.160]  of that.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.800]  And so I had to issue an update today that just moved the playlist editor out of, out
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.160]  of the cards because otherwise you can't reorder the priority podcast setting.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:11.840]  And it's like, like when I was in development, there were so many weird cases like this where
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:19.480]  like some, some part of the UI would fail in a weird way if it was moved to this card
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:20.480]  thing.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.320]  And, and so I had to either try to figure out why and see if I could work around it
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.600]  or re-implement it in a different way so it wouldn't fail.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.960]  And, and that's just, that's just one, you know, this, that card thing is just one of
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.480]  the changes.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:38.960]  And there were just so like, I mean just so many, so much time going into seemingly minor
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:45.540]  things like that, even other things like the full-time drag handles now on the playlist.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.200]  That is not easy to do in UI table view.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:49.200]  No, I know that.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.200]  I do.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.200]  I did it.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  It's not a collection view.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.920]  It is still a table view.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.560]  And the way I did it is such an incredible hack and that took a long time too.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.880]  Similarly, like having, having like the tweet bot style where you tap on the episode and
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.440]  a little row of buttons expands out from the bottom of it that you can then select actions
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  from.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:16.560]  Again, a seemingly small thing in the UI, but that takes a long time to implement and
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:21.400]  to figure out how you have to abuse the system frameworks to let them let you do this.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.560]  Like it's all like, and you know, you know from Vesper stuff, like a lot of times it's
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.600]  these little tiny implementation details or these little tiny interactions or UI affordances
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.720]  that they make all the difference in the world when you're using the app and like how nice
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:38.160]  it is to use or how easy it is to use.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.880]  But like one of those little, little behaviors or little animations or implementations might
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.160]  take you weeks to just develop that one little thing.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:50:02.780]  It is my opinion that the modern touchscreen UI that started with the iPhone is a trickier
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:11.660]  and inherently more limited interaction model than the mouse pointer interface that we've
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:20.580]  had since the Mac and go back to the Xerox thing that was before the Mac in a lot of
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.200]  ways.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.840]  And I think that most people don't think about it.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.780]  You shouldn't have to if you're not a designer, but when you are a designer, you suddenly
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:30.740]  realize that you're limited in a certain way.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:36.440]  So for example, let's just say a list of things, you have a list of rows and you can drag them
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  to reorder.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  There's all sorts of apps that do stuff like this.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.920]  On a Mac, you would think, well, I could just click on the row I want to move up and hold
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.920]  the mouse button down and drag up.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.360]  And that's exactly how you do it.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:53.400]  You click on it and drag and you don't have to click and wait.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.640]  You just, you could click and wait and then drag, or you could just click and drag immediately
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.640]  and it just works.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:04.120]  Well, you can't do that on a touchscreen because if you're in a list and you just touch and
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:09.880]  immediately move down or move up, you're scrolling the list because touching on the list and
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.880]  moving your finger is how you do it.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:19.160]  So how do you take an item and move it up if you can't just touch on it and move up?
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.160]  You can't have like a modifier.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.160]  He'll just hold down command.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.080]  And the truth is there's no perfect solution.
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.540]  There's a perfect solution with a mouse pointer, which is just allow the user to click and
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:29.600]  drag up.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:34.200]  On touchscreens, I could think of, there's three ways I can think to do it.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.960]  Apple's usual way is to have an edit button in the top right that you tap this edit button
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:45.300]  and then it switches it to a mode where there's like a little grippy strip over there and
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:48.380]  you can use that grippy strip to drag things up and down.
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:51.600]  And if you touch on the grippy strip and drag, it won't scroll the list.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.200]  It'll drag the thing up.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:57.000]  The way Vesper did it, and a lot of other apps do, is you tap and hold.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.640]  And after a brief, and again, this is the sort of thing where you sit there and you
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.480]  play with little fractions of a second to see how long is too short and how long is
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480]  too long.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:09.520]  But you know you're drag, you know you're moving it because it visually pops up off
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.520]  the screen.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:16.520]  And you can see that it's sort of like raised and then you're moving the item up and down.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.680]  I like the solution you came with where you just put the grip strips there all the time.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.760]  And so you can't scroll the list from over at the edge of the screen, but most of it
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.320]  you can.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.040]  Yeah and most people don't scroll that far the edge anyway so it's fine.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.080]  Because you know what I found, like I made this whole blog post about like, and actually
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.120]  like you know this this blog post was the release of Overcast 3 and kind of the announcement
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:44.900]  of Overcast 3, but I titled it Design Walkthrough because this really like this release really
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:48.000]  was effectively a redesign.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.360]  You know not like not like 100% redesign, a lot of things look kind of similar or the
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:57.020]  same but there's a lot more redesigning than anything else in this release.
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:01.920]  And that's because you know over the last couple of years since I since I made 1.0 like
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:08.460]  I've gotten literally thousands of emails and tweets from people with feedback and some
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:12.880]  you know support questions and things that I've seen I basically had a lot of feedback
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.560]  to show me all the ways in which the old design failed.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.320]  And by that by that I mean like you know people weren't able to find features that they wanted
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.920]  to find or they couldn't understand the way something worked or something caused errors
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:30.080]  to you know people to to erroneously invoke it or things like that.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:36.400]  And so there were one of the one of the major themes I learned over the last couple of years
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.640]  is these built-in iOS standards.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.680]  Things like tapping edit in the top right corner and then having a table view switch
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:51.160]  to this mode where you can delete or reorder or batch operate on on things in a list or
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:55.360]  even just swiping a table cell to delete it.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:01.360]  These things that you know we like power users have known literally since iOS 1.0 introduced
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:07.360]  most of them, most people who use iPhones these days don't know those things they never
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:11.240]  find that they don't know you can swipe on a table view to reveal a delete button.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:15.280]  They don't they never tap the edit button in the corner and if they if they do they
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:18.780]  quickly undo it because they don't really understand what it does and don't care.
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:27.240]  So there's lots of like kind of assumed knowledge of platform standards that I went into with
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:30.200]  this that I think a lot of iOS developers still do.
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.480]  That the reality is the customers don't have that vocabulary in enough quantity.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:41.520]  Yeah I think that you can only really count on them finding what they can see.
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.080]  Exactly right and if you can't if the only way to do it is a way that you don't see you
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:50.340]  have to do something to see it like slide the row they won't find it.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:54.040]  That's why you know if you look at an app like I think it's a super successful app is
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:57.220]  an app like Apple's mail for iPhone.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:01.700]  That's why there's a trash can when you're in a message view but also why why you could
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:07.680]  swipe on the message in the list of messages and delete it from there yeah but that trash
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:11.880]  can has to be there because some people would be shocked to find out that you can delete
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:16.240]  a message any other way because like even you know even like the edit button in the
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:22.080]  corner that is visible but it's not even obvious enough like what it does or why you like if
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.760]  you're in a list like what does that even mean to edit in the corner of this entire
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:30.720]  list of episodes like like a lot of people just don't think that way they don't they
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:36.040]  don't try to to poke everything and see what is what is this weird word do that I that
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.360]  doesn't seem to specify anything in particular I hate to spring this on you but all right
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:48.040]  I'm in all episodes and there is an edit button up there yeah I don't know there I don't understand
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:53.080]  what it does I hit edit and then it says done and it just toggles between edit and done
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:59.440]  but what's different do you actually have the latest version I think so because normal
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:02.600]  what's supposed to happen is if you hit edit you're supposed to get a little header on
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.400]  top that says edit playlist no one half and delete playlist on the other half and then
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.120]  all the rows turn into the multi-select toggle dots on the right oh maybe I don't have the
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:18.360]  latest version I don't know I thought I updated to the App Store version let me see if I make
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.080]  a new playlist I mean you might have found a bug but I might have not how it's supposed
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:35.880]  to work anyway I agree with you though what about the so the other factor and we talked
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.320]  about it and and one of the things that lets you do this and you and I have had discussions
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:46.120]  about this over the years you know going back to Vesper and overcast and that okay well
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:50.880]  let's just give up you know the old model for indie software developers is you pre-app
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:56.600]  store you sell a version let's say it's $30 and then you do version 2.0 and you still
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:01.120]  sell it for $30 but you give your existing users an upgrade price maybe they get it for
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:05.560]  half off maybe they get the new version for $14.99 maybe you sell it the upgrade for just
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.160]  $9.99 but then the idea is you keep building users and the ones who stick keep using the
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:18.120]  app will every year or however often you come out with a major upgrade keep giving you upgrade
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:25.000]  money and that's what funds the continued development of the app because eventually
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.080]  you stop getting you know you you max out on new users and you need to monetize your
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:36.800]  existing user base well there's no upgrades in the app store and so new models are called
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:44.480]  for if you want to sustain an app I I think you've come across an interesting one because
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:48.920]  the downside to the old model and as much as everybody you know I still kind of wish
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.320]  the app store supported it and allowed users the developers the option of doing it the
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:59.920]  downside to it is that everybody seems to agree that the way you know most cases people
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:03.740]  would decide whether to buy the upgrade to the new app or not based on what are the new
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:09.560]  features and so like that overcast three like where you say like it's hard to say like here's
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:15.760]  all the new features it may not sell as a paid upgrade because way it's just what it's
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:24.160]  just a modernized you know version of the same UI but to me this is the sort of thing
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:30.320]  I like I'm glad to pay for because it's exactly what I want in an app because like if you
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.840]  if you do it the other way like where where you're dependent on that upgrade revenue for
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:39.640]  new features every release then you get Microsoft Office where you have like there was there's
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:44.200]  all this pressure to just add more and more and more features even if it kind of makes
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:48.740]  the app worse to have more features added to it but that's the that's what the incentive
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:54.360]  structure kind of forces you to do and that's why that's one of the reasons why you see
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.960]  these major apps like office and Adobe Creative Suite trying to get away from that model and
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:02.040]  moving towards subscriptions so aggressively over the last few years and I think they've
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:07.240]  both pretty much completed that move where like you know now they're kind of free to
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:13.940]  do things better as opposed to like the old model of like having having to try to justify
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:19.560]  your revenue every single year with like a bullet list of features that you added right
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:25.640]  it just eventually even the however much it was ever in dispute within those companies
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:29.200]  it becomes obvious to everybody that it's not sustainable forever you can't just keep
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:36.000]  adding more and consider and assume that that means better when you can for a while like
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.520]  you know if and it's generally like when things are young so when when the applications are
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:47.080]  young or like you know in the case of like you know Adobe and Microsoft a lot of their
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:53.840]  revenue came from people like you know OS's were still young right and as OS's would change
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:57.740]  you'd have to get the new versions of the app to just work on the new OS computers were
[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:02.920]  still young you'd be buying like a new computer every three to five years or whatever it was
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:07.140]  that would be so different from your old one and so much better that you would buy new
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:10.900]  software to take advantage of it or whatever and like now everything's a lot more settled
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:14.320]  down in these in these industries and it's true of mobile as well like you know the upgrade
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.880]  cycles are getting longer for these things and and all the OS's are kind of settling
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:25.840]  down and and maturing and so and and all these and if you if you've had any kind of you know
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:31.560]  long-standing product I mean hell my podcast app is only like two and a half years old
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:36.920]  and I'm already running out of features I think I want to add to it like there's at
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:42.000]  a certain point you've you add pretty much everything that you think it needs and it's
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:49.440]  kind of done feature wise but that doesn't mean it can't be improved right so what you've
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:54.040]  arrived at after like you know and again you've you've you've changed it subtly with each
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:01:00.360]  major release but where you are now is it's a free download so anybody can get it try
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:05.120]  the overcast for free which I think is essential in today's world it's been free since day
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.480]  one I don't regret that for a minute right well I think you're and I think it it's proven
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:15.600]  right and because it's it's it's just you know I've said this before but I really do
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:22.720]  think it's true that when people there's just too many people who if they're looking for
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.920]  a podcast app or they're looking for a notes app or whatever the app is they'll start looking
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:34.280]  and they will start trying free ones and eventually one of the free ones I guess this is good
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.440]  enough and they never get past that they never get past it even if your app is 99 cents there's
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.540]  just too many people who never ever say I'm gonna try I'm gonna I'm gonna cough up a dollar
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:49.380]  before I even try it just because the screenshots look good I mean some people will but it's
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:53.800]  it's not enough and there's too many free ones and there's too many free ones that really
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.840]  are good enough yeah well and you know there's that saying that like you always find the
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:03.920]  last war like right I apologize to John Syracuse for butchering that but I when I when I was
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.320]  running Instapaper it was never free during the time I ran it I was paid up front the
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.240]  whole time and I was really you know adamant about that I had just had to be paid up front
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:16.880]  because that's how you have to make revenue and that was okay for the first couple years
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:23.760]  of the App Store but then every competitor I got from that point forward they were all
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.960]  free right like every every major competitor was free and I would and then Apple made reading
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:35.900]  list which was free of course because it's built in and it's just like I really was marginalized
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:43.120]  by to a large degree by all of my competitors being free and and by the platform having
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.480]  this thing for free and by my app having a big paywall in front of it before anybody
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.700]  could even try it and so that's one of the reasons why and I was I was also I was always
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:03:00.020]  afraid that a new competitor would come out that would be awesome and free because I didn't
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:06.280]  have that for a long time and and so like it was like every morning I would wake up
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.900]  afraid to look at the news on my phone because what if today was the day my business was
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:16.360]  crushed by a new awesome free competitor and so with overcast I launched it free in part
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:20.080]  out of that because I was just like you know what I don't want to leave I don't want to
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.360]  leave that gap for anybody like I don't want to I don't want to wake up every morning with
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:28.440]  that fear well you also you had the advantage though and I mean it that it's an advantage
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:34.800]  that Apple already had the podcast app exactly I was pre Sherlock and so like I yeah so it
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.560]  was and that was a big reason why I was free because you know a I didn't want to leave
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:45.220]  you know what Apple calls a price umbrella for you know competitors to to beat me only
[02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:50.520]  on price like if you want to beat me on quality fine I'll play that game I will happily fight
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:56.120]  on that on that battlefront but I didn't want price to be the only thing people could compete
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:01.220]  with me or I'd rather I didn't want to be losing a lot of customers to someone else
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:05.880]  because of price I think you had I always was with instapaper and and it killed me and
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:11.320]  so and I was at the time I was I was not a good enough business person in this regard
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:14.200]  to recognize at the time that I should have gone free and figure out something else back
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.960]  then but you know in the meantime I kind of figure that out and so that's why I launched
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:23.240]  this I think you had an advantage that podcast Apple's podcast app isn't all it always has
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.880]  been pretty good and it's free and it's there and it's got the iTunes store backing it and
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:32.040]  the fact that it's Apple's app does it come with the phones or do you have to get it from
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:36.280]  the app store I forget how it's they go back and forth from that like every few releases
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.880]  I forget what it is now I think it's separate the fact that it's pretty good and very popular
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.960]  is a much better situation I I feel like we at Vesper we were we had a it was a disservice
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:52.960]  to us that at that time Apple Notes was garbage it was like it was a really bad app with really
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:59.000]  bad sync the only way to get sync was through IMAP that was a mess God bless him for having
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.920]  made it work but it just didn't work well and it worked terrible if your email was Gmail
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:10.640]  because you'd get copies of messages over and over again it was terrible the I think
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.640]  it was starting with iOS 9 I think it was two years ago where they redid notes and they
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.720]  built it on cloud kit and it's it's super good it's a really great it's a great notes
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:23.880]  app and it's really great sync the sync is terrific would have been better if that was
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.880]  already out because it would have calibrated our expectations like it wasn't like we assumed
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:32.040]  Apple would never improve notes but we didn't know what it would be you know and it yeah
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:40.680]  exactly so right now you're what you do you get it for free and for free you show ads
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.920]  and you started this when did you start September so just in September and you were using Google's
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:51.440]  mobile ad services and if you want to you want to get rid of the ads and you want to
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:57.040]  support the app you can subscribe for 10 bucks a year and it's a lot of recurring or no it
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:01.040]  just reminds you in the air now it's recurring because now we get a raise after year one
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:05.560]  if we do recurring so right yeah right so anybody who's with you for more than a year
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:12.000]  if it's recurring you get an 85 15 split exactly right which is a big deal yeah like because
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  like 30% is a lot and could be having that cut from from 30 to 15 after a year that adds
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.980]  up a lot as well what means you make basically like you make a raise you get a 15% raise
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:28.080]  from your existing users it's actually kind of putting the old upgrade model the other
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:31.840]  way around where you would get less money from your longtime users because they're only
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:36.240]  paying the upgrade price now you're getting more even though they don't pay more I have
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:41.100]  I have a strong incentive now to keep people subscribed long term this is one of those
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:48.440]  areas where it really is Apple everybody's interests align it's not necessarily that
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:52.480]  Apple is putting developers ahead of Apple itself because Apple still makes money but
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:56.640]  that the motivation is they're they're they're putting motivation out there to build apps
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:04.780]  and services that are worth keeping a multi-year subscription to yeah and that's in their interests
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:11.320]  in terms of not maximizing their revenue from the App Store at any given transaction or
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:16.880]  any given renewal but in terms of making the platform more popular and getting you know
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:25.000]  of which leads to people doing things like buying crazy new $1,100 iPhones and it's great
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.960]  for users because the user doesn't pay more I pay the same 10 bucks on my renewal for
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:33.480]  overcast and you just get more of the money you get $8.50 instead of $7
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:38.840]  Yeah and a long time ago like when I when I launched the magazine it was it was a newsstand
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:42.840]  app and newsstand was the first thing to have these auto renewing subscriptions and this
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:49.120]  is back in iOS 5 and 6 and the at the time I wrote this big blog post basically saying
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:53.600]  like auto renewing subscriptions are terrible and I would never do them again and I wouldn't
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.960]  if they were the same but they're a lot better now like everything about them now they still
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:02.440]  have a lot of shortcomings but everything about them now is a lot easier to implement
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:08.640]  and easier for both developers and customers to deal with than it was in iOS 5 and so like
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:15.880]  now it's it is again there are still limits in particular it's like you still can't tell
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:21.600]  if somebody has has told their subscription not to renew so effectively if they've canceled
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  you have you don't know until it expires like you know the date that it's supposed to renew
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.640]  but until that date comes and it doesn't renew you don't know they've canceled it and there's
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:39.320]  weird things with like if you want to also sell through your website maybe and like offer
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:44.420]  both payment options it's really hard to to reconcile these things because like you don't
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:48.200]  know if the person has canceled on their phone if they are extending so it's there's a whole
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.200]  bunch of weird cases but the way I'm doing it now which is very simple and there is no
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:58.720]  web payment option along with the the improvements they've done to the system since iOS 5 make
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:05.360]  it a much easier sell now and then add the raise to it and it's a no-brainer yeah and
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:11.240]  it was starting now with the version 3.0 you've you've switched the you seem to have narrowed
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:16.040]  in on that's $10 a year recurring subscription for the pro you know what do you call iPhone
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:22.240]  or overcast I call it premium premium yeah well all right you can call it that I was
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.140]  kind of like going off of like you know like what streaming music services call their ad
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:30.720]  free tiers yeah which are almost all premium I guess it semantically it makes sense pros
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:36.640]  shorter and pro is kind of a it's kind of weird to call something pro that adds almost
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.680]  no features right like it's like what like so premium like there was basically like you
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:46.440]  know I'm kind of going off of like what people are accustomed to here and streaming music
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:50.960]  services are way more popular than overcast so like if they're all saying their ad free
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.120]  tiers are called premium and if I call mine that I think people basically get it but the
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:02.120]  big change is on the ad side where instead of using Google's mobile ad services you've
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:08.200]  dropped it for your own homegrown system where you're going to sell or you are selling ads
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:14.200]  that you know you sell the ads and they get shown with the novel idea but which is very
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.120]  obvious and it kind of gets into my thing when I was talking about audible before that
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.280]  hey guess why audible advertises on a podcast because they know everybody who listens to
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:29.640]  it is listening to spoken word content and so one of your ideas is that podcasts can
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.720]  buy these ads to promote their podcast so I could buy ads for the talk show and people
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.880]  would be listening to other shows and if they're free users of overcast I get a little ad at
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.440]  the bottom and I can try to pitch them on listening and if they tap it it doesn't like
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.800]  take them to my website or something it does something far smarter than that it takes you
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:54.480]  to the page you know not the page but the the card in overcast where you would be able
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.520]  to either subscribe to my show or listen to the latest episode to see what it's like yeah
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.160]  you browse the whole episode list the whole history of the show and everything you know
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:08.000]  it is exactly what you get from the ad podcast screen you know it's the same thing yeah I
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:14.200]  mean it's this was kind of I mean I've kind of like fallen into all my business models
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:19.760]  for overcast here I don't know if it's gonna work I mean you never know you have to try
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.840]  them and and you know like my RSS feed sponsorships have worked way better than I thought they
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:29.020]  would or than I even hoped they would but I'm sure glad I tried it because it worked
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:34.320]  a lot better than I then I thought it would and who knows it maybe it will maybe it won't
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:40.160]  but it at least fits the basic description of advertising that is sustainable and works
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:44.840]  in my experience and it isn't just a flash in the pan which is that it's got to be that
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:50.680]  sort of win-win-win scenario where it's a good value for the advertiser it's not super
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:56.400]  annoying to the user and it makes money for the person selling the ad and it kind of has
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:01.680]  that and and part of the way that you get that to work is to not try to make ads that
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:07.880]  are exactly like the ads for previous medium or you know to reuse the analogy fighting
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:14.320]  the previous war but what what is native for this and you know like I've given talks about
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:18.640]  it but like in the early days when people would try to monetize RSS they would have
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:23.160]  to ask strategies the big one that was super common for a long time was that you wouldn't
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.720]  put the full article in the RSS feed so you didn't have to put ads in and anybody who
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.400]  wanted you'd get a list of articles and if you wanted to read one you'd get like a two
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:34.160]  sentence summary and then you'd double click it and go to the website and then you'd see
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:40.040]  the website ads well that work you know it works in terms of not giving away your content
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.780]  for free but it wasn't what people who used RSS readers want to do they they they were
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:49.180]  using RSS readers because they wanted to read your stuff in the RSS reader so then we ruin
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:53.040]  the feet right and so the next thing people would try to do is they would put banner ads
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:59.160]  in the each article which made them like little web pages and they paid like pennies and everybody
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:04.800]  just skipped over them and so my idea was why not just have a paid entry in the feed
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:09.360]  like once a week make give them the whole entry don't put something in the entries just
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:16.080]  sell an entry and it has worked out very very well and I think selling a podcast I think
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:23.260]  if if your idea works I think actually having the podcast sell by other podcasts buying
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:28.240]  the ads is going to work and one of the things that occurred to me is what do you see a lot
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:32.360]  when you watch regular commercial TV what do you see a lot of commercials for TV show
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:40.280]  TV shows and it's not because the network couldn't sell the spot and oh well we'll we'll
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:47.640]  put an ad for Modern Family during you know the the football game because we don't we
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.320]  didn't sell the spot they do it because they know it's super valuable to get people to
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.100]  watch the show like I can't even tell you how many times during the Super Bowl they
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:14:02.240]  told you how many forget what the show was but it shows how well the ads work but but
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.400]  they kept telling you what should what show is going to be on right after the Super Bowl
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:11.560]  yeah it was like the new 24 reboot or something like that over and over and over again because
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:18.360]  it works because you're already watching TV right exactly and listening to a podcast yeah
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:25.120]  and so like that's like I think this the only question in my mind basically is like do enough
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:31.560]  podcasters have enough money to want to pay for ads right that and that's a big question
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:35.880]  mark and that's why I'm like this isn't just podcast like I also have like a hover ad and
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:40.340]  a Squarespace ad and a Linode ad it might like I can advertise for I put the whole thing
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:45.720]  to be fairly generic so I can advertise for podcast or just any website or apps in the
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:53.160]  App Store so any of those things can be advertised with these with these ad units and I can control
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:59.460]  all server sides I can you know dynamically insert them as necessary I just it remains
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:05.120]  to be seen like whether podcasters actually will buy these at the prices that they end
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:10.040]  up being worth or not what I don't that's I don't know what percentage I mean right
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:14.680]  now your your revenue is overwhelmingly from the premium subscribers correct yeah and that's
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:19.160]  and like basically what what allowed me the freedom to even try this at all is that what
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:25.680]  I found since September since using the Google ads the Google ads in apps and that's I mean
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:33.160]  this is true of any you know in-app advertising basically how much it works for you is extremely
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.760]  dependent on your click-through rate you know like basically how many clicks do you get
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:44.240]  per you know a thousand impressions of the ad as it's shown and my click-through rate
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:49.580]  in the Google ads was awful it was it was so far below like industry averages and everything
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:54.080]  it was terrible and who wants to jump out to a web browser that's certainly part of
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:57.520]  it I mean and another part of it is how many people how many people think if they tap it
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:00.880]  and it goes to a web browser that the podcast is going to stop playing it didn't because
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:05.740]  it has to run in the background but how many people wouldn't even would it may even be
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:09.160]  vaguely interested but wouldn't tap it be out of fear that the podcast would stop playing
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:13.260]  which would be like the worst thing ever yeah I never thought about that but yeah so basically
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:18.400]  like there was there was that big problem of like you know my tap through rate was terrible
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:24.460]  and and and also just you know things that advertise in these kind of like bulk ad networks
[02:16:24.460 --> 02:16:32.600]  on mobile they weren't often very high quality ads right so the result of this was was both
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:39.600]  that they look kind of junky and also they made very little money and so and and the
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:47.280]  only reason that this has succeeded as a business model at all is because having the ads there
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.540]  made a lot more people subscribe as premium members than the previous system which is
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.140]  basically like subscribe if you like me it was like kind of like you know voluntary patronage
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:02.460]  thing right that got very few people to subscribe and so having the ads there you know I thought
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:05.140]  it would be a nice balance of like all right I'll make a lot of money from ads and some
[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:09.660]  money from subscription then it ends up I made more money from subscriptions than I
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:13.500]  thought and way less money from ads than I expected so there's there the advantage there
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:20.180]  though the silver lining there is that I could replace the ads with basically any other ads
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:27.480]  like it doesn't really matter whatever I replaced them with as long as it brings in some money
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:33.800]  it can I can come out basically you know the same or ahead from the little bit I was making
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.280]  from Google just because I said like my my tap rate was terrible from those ads and doesn't
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:42.140]  so doesn't make you hang your head in shame at the quality of the ads as long as exactly
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:48.780]  you had a good point and I only have like about 24 hours worth of numbers so far but
[02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:54.980]  my tap rate on the new ads is something like I think it's like a hundred times better than
[02:17:54.980 --> 02:18:00.480]  it was it's it's some obscene multiplier and again I only have 24 hours of data and everyone's
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:04.640]  trying them out to see what they are so you know this is not representative of long-term
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:16.260]  trends but I'm confident so far that I think I hit something better this time I I I think
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:20.620]  it's gonna work I think it's a good idea but it's it's definitely better than the old ads
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.860]  no I mean my only question really is like you know in six months are most of the ads
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:30.140]  that you see in overcast going to be for websites like hover and Squarespace are they gonna
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:34.500]  be for podcasts yeah I have no idea yeah but it's good to keep an open mind and let it
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:39.260]  sort out exactly as it falls water seeks its own level I think this is one of those things
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:46.540]  to where you underestimate your personal skill set in terms of your I mean you know the main
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:51.800]  part of overcast is a you know it's an iOS app and it's programming you know and you've
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:56.460]  done we talked you know extensively already about all the UI stuff that you've done and
[02:18:56.460 --> 02:19:01.660]  changed and customized and and customizing the table view and all this stuff that's just
[02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:09.020]  pure this is what iOS of developers of good apps do but your background as a CMS developer
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:16.940]  let's gives you like such a leg up in terms of I'll just build my own ad network and you
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:21.860]  you know because you did this before where you built the system that we we use I use
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:30.020]  that you ATP uses it just to just set up the schedule of podcast ads you know which ads
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:36.300]  are in which episode and what do you say it was just something you built out of the frustration
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:42.500]  of like whatever jury-rigged system I don't remember what we did before but I used a terrible
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:46.700]  Excel spreadsheet before that I think that most people have some kind of like awful combination
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:55.820]  of what I had a number spreadsheet and it was just awful and it you know so like your
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:20:03.280]  ability to to have this second skill set where you can build the back end of a dynamic on
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:08.500]  the fly you know up to the minute ad thing is a huge advantage of being able to think
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:11.500]  of something like this because I can see a lot of people might come up with this idea
[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:16.260]  but then like they will wait how would I actually how would I actually manage the ads on the
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:20.980]  back end so that they get served and maybe that would never percolate up to the level
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:26.820]  where they do it because they don't have that skill set well I mean it's I wouldn't necessarily
[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:33.380]  say they don't that it's it's much of a skill set honestly it's more of like a a willingness
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:38.180]  or it's more of a confidence to do it because like so many so many app developers don't
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:42.220]  have a lot of server-side experience and so like you know they have experience developing
[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:46.860]  like the local native app but maybe not necessarily server-side chops or they don't want to run
[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:52.780]  the server themselves or have to depend on a server and and I just whatever like whatever
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:56.980]  it is that that intimidates people or turns people off about running servers I don't have
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:01.700]  that because my job you know before making apps my job was all about running servers
[02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:06.460]  and running applications on servers and so I just became comfortable with that running
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:10.580]  servers and running apps on servers and writing back end code is actually way easier than
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:15.780]  writing app code in so many ways it's it you know sorry back end developers I know I'm
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:20.500]  I'm one of you sometimes but I'm telling you it's so much easier most of the time that
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:25.900]  I'm writing at most app code that you have to do to make a reasonable quality app and
[02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:29.860]  so it isn't that most developers can't do this it's that most of them think they can't
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:36.260]  do this and so they don't even try the main challenge for me trying to do all this ad
[02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:42.420]  stuff is that I just find it incredibly uninteresting like the the idea like I actually really got
[02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:47.060]  a lot of enjoyment out of designing the ad format and integrating them into the app and
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:52.420]  making that work really nicely but doing the back end of like putting in the ads and tracking
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:57.940]  how many clicks they get like that I could not be less interested in doing that I put
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:21:58.940]  it off forever
[02:21:58.940 --> 02:22:07.220]  well you did it I don't know we'll see how it goes I literally did it like three days
[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:14.900]  ago the other little details I have are some of the the changes like you call it a dios7
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:20.480]  of vacation so one of the the good things about the timing of overcast is it debuted
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:26.940]  with ios 7 so it never had to go through that shift from the old world of ios 6 to ios 7
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:31.820]  visually and and you know in terms of the the way that you code an app and assume you
[02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:40.260]  know stuff it went through the shift just no one saw it except me right and it is interesting
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:47.740]  like it's it's I was never an ios 7 hater but ios 7 definitely debuted at the extreme
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:52.580]  end of the direction that it went which I think is the way that you go I think it's
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:56.940]  the right way to I think it was right for apple to go push it as far as they could with
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:05.440]  the thin fonts and the translucency everywhere but they've dialed it back a lot of ways each
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:15.300]  step ios 8 to 9 to 10 and a lot of the changes you made in overcast 3 really bring them to
[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:19.200]  the forefront because there were some things that have been there in overcast since 1.0
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:24.020]  that are now gone but that didn't disappear until now like the popover that you would
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:29.540]  get for the info on a podcast which you said you hated from the beginning I did I I hated
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:37.820]  those popovers included in the use of popovers was translucency like ios 7 introduced an
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:44.400]  awful lot of things that were like a semi-translucent piece of glass or like it's like the popover
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:48.540]  that I'm talking about looked like it was printed on like frosted glass so you could
[02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:52.420]  like see that like in a shower you can see that there's somebody in the shower but you
[02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:57.980]  can't see what they look like a lot of use of blur because what happened was like at
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:05.320]  the time that ios 7 came out whatever combination of hardware and software tricks blur is computationally
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:10.340]  intensive and so they basically couldn't do it before and on on that year's I think it
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:18.020]  was 2013 that came out on that year of iphones they were finally powerful enough to really
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:22.220]  do it and they came up with a couple of neat software tricks to do it a little bit faster
[02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:27.660]  and so it was like they had this new technical ability that that was pretty rare before especially
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:32.460]  and was not seen at all on mobile because it was too complex to do on mobile hardware
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:35.460]  and so they went nuts with it it was like you know typical you know when you get a new
[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:40.500]  tech ability you first go nuts with it and then you dial it back and they certainly did
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:46.300]  but I think what what this update really focuses is where we we still use blur apple still
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:52.560]  uses blur extensively in ios 10 but instead of being like this foreground panel that's
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:57.260]  in the front and that you see through it's the background that gets blurred so for example
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:04.380]  when you do the force touch on a on an episode to you know peek peek at it it the panel is
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:10.780]  not translucent but the background around it is which is in it's a subtle difference
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:15.420]  but I think it works much better because yeah it doesn't make the thing you're looking at
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:21.460]  hard to read but it gives you this immediate context of oh this is temporary this is just
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:24.460]  a little you know because it's all blurry in the background i've popped this thing up
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:30.060]  yeah because you know the other thing about blur is like it's actually it's besides being
[02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:35.340]  computationally difficult it's also very hard to design around you know like like when you
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:41.820]  when you have these blurry foreground panes and these like large blurry expanses and then
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:45.780]  you have like you know behind them you have like some like bright pink icon shining through
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:51.220]  any of this like pink blob in the in the blur area it's very hard to design around that
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:26:00.300]  to make that both legible and attractive in all situations it's it's nearly impossible
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:05.620]  and then the other difference that's definitely moving directly away from ios 7 is slightly
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:10.740]  thicker lines you know like icons and stuff like that like the sharing icon and stuff
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:15.460]  it's not everything isn't so wispy anymore it's a little you know i wouldn't say it's
[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:20.300]  thick lines but they're they're much more like regular lines oh you should have seen
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:26.540]  the conversation between me and louis mantia i i designed the the entire rest of the app
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:31.260]  myself and then i went to him because he made the original icon so i went to him to to refresh
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:38.540]  the icon and uh and i showed him the screenshot of of the toolbar and the main screen that
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:42.700]  has those four icons across the top and he's like what are you doing with the stroke width
[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:49.540]  because the you know the the lines in on all the icons and everything in all previous versions
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:55.140]  were one point wide which is you know two pixels on the on the 2x phones and then three
[02:26:55.140 --> 02:27:02.520]  pixels or six yeah three pixels on anyway so one point was what we had before i wanted
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:09.460]  to make everything a little bit thicker two points uh in most things look too thick so
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:16.520]  the actual stroke width of most of the icons and overcast is 1.5 points and this makes
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:23.980]  everything suck this this makes everything about icon design harder because you can either
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:31.280]  have it blurry on all devices or you can align things to quarter point boundaries and have
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:37.740]  it work so that's what i did and when i try to make another designer do that i got some
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:47.240]  pushback eventually we worked it out but that the the result is that uh almost all the icons
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:53.960]  in overcast 3 have a 1.5 point stroke width and it works so it looks sharp and so is that
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:28:00.620]  gonna work out well on the 3x iphone 10 so that's that's a question so uh basically the
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:05.260]  way it works the way i've aligned them on these quarter pixel boundaries uh it it is
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:11.500]  sharp on 2x on 3x it is a little bit less sharp but there are so many pixels i'm kind
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:15.180]  of thinking you might not notice yeah because i don't i don't notice on the plus phones
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:23.580]  now right hmm we'll have to see anyway i think it's good work anything else you wanted to
[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:29.060]  talk about i don't think so i mean we've only been going for two and a half hours i mean
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:32.980]  we we still have three more to go right that's short for us we gotta wrap it really this
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:37.460]  really is short for us uh uh how'd the release go you had that one bug you had to fix so
[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:41.100]  you had to have one emergency bug in it but it seems like that got through did you have
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:48.340]  to do an expedited review no i they it was just fast yeah it was just that fast um so
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:53.980]  yeah i actually i actually fixed uh here let me pull up i fixed 13 like kind of important
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:58.180]  day one bugs um one of the things you know people i had a couple people on twitter saying
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:29:02.180]  like why didn't you beta test this more with a bigger group your beta group sucked and
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:07.660]  and the the the the reason why literally is secrecy like that's it it's a boring reason
[02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:11.840]  and but that's true like i have done bigger betas before i've done betas where i've tried
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:17.100]  to fill like all 1000 of my test flight slots and i came pretty close and i had like 800
[02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:20.480]  people on one of them and and i've done like kind of medium size where it's where it's
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:25.800]  like 150 people and and this one was something like 40 or 50 people and and the reason why
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:31.900]  i kept it small uh is because every previous beta i've done i've set the instructions please
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:35.220]  don't share screenshots of this with anybody please don't show those people who aren't
[02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:39.380]  on the beta like please try to keep this under wraps and every single time it's been bigger
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:44.480]  than my group of like friends that i did this beta with people leak it because and it's
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.580]  not that they're trying to be devious they just don't read the directions um and they
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:51.460]  think it's okay or they want to show it off or whatever else so i just didn't want that
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:56.580]  like there was there was enough new stuff in this visually that i did not want anybody
[02:29:56.580 --> 02:30:02.140]  sharing a screenshot before i made it to the world and you know whether you think it's
[02:30:02.140 --> 02:30:06.780]  a valid excuse or not that was the reason and uh and and i knew i could trust this group
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:10.900]  of people to to be attentive to that and to be trustworthy of that so i tested it just
[02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:17.340]  with with trusted friends and i found the the number of bugs that you find with larger
[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:21.420]  groups of people actually isn't that much more i don't think so either that's my really
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:25.500]  is experience i think the only way you could do it is do a public beta and then you'll
[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:30.620]  you will shake out more bugs in the aggregate but then you're completely blowing any kind
[02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:35.260]  of secrecy because it's a public beta yeah exactly and you kind of can't do that on ios
[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:39.420]  like that's that is kind of what i simulated with my like test flight invitation form and
[02:30:39.420 --> 02:30:45.140]  with that with those previous tests but but uh it's yeah it's it's it basically is like
[02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:50.260]  now i would do it for a bug fix update because now like there's nothing secret for the next
[02:30:50.260 --> 02:30:53.100]  few releases the next releases are going to be bug fixes and minor feature addition so
[02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:56.980]  like i would consider doing it now but now it's not necessary anymore i i really have
[02:30:56.980 --> 02:31:00.900]  found that keeping the beta small is the way to go so anyway we had about a couple of bugs
[02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:04.700]  we had about 60 with vesper and our rule was i'm looking at the list right now because
[02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:08.780]  we put them in the credits i would say out of the 60 at least 40 of them are people who
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:13.380]  i would give my wallet to and our general but that was like our general rule and then
[02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:17.980]  the other 20 are ones that either brent or or dave would vouch for you know but the rule
[02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:21.460]  was if you wanted somebody on the beta you'd have to be someone that you would verify you'd
[02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:27.660]  trust with your wallet yeah exactly and and again like you know the the benefit of having
[02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:32.620]  a lot more people on that than that on a beta is is fairly small uh it's severely diminishing
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:37.460]  returns so uh yeah it was fine so anyway i uh i fixed all those bugs in a release that
[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:42.620]  went through today i created one also major bug during that release uh which is that now
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:49.940]  you can't create new playlists anymore uh so i have to fix that uh but otherwise uh
[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:53.620]  besides those those things it's actually been great and you know the servers haven't collapsed
[02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:59.100]  or anything uh you know everything's pretty stable there so uh yeah so far so good i uncovered
[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:02.900]  that bug while we were talking about this earlier and i didn't want to tell you i didn't
[02:32:02.900 --> 02:32:08.680]  like create playlist bug yeah there's no there's no there's no save button yeah that's that's
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:13.300]  a tough one yeah that's all right that's all right i'll probably i probably the time that
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:16.120]  you actually publish this episode it might even be fixed that's probably i'm probably
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:19.340]  gonna have to issue an update tomorrow to fix that one and hope it gets through app
[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:24.620]  review somewhat quickly i feel kind of i feel kind of guilty putting through like something
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:29.520]  in app review two days in a row but i i feel like they've got the wheels to turn it over
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:32.700]  there where that's not you shouldn't feel guilty it seems like they've just got you
[02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:37.180]  know they've really upped up the capacity i mean i've heard from a couple of like i'm
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:41.460]  not requesting fast reviews like they just happen to be going through quickly yeah yeah
[02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:45.940]  i think especially if you don't request an expedited review just just fix it however
[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:51.820]  often you want yeah i don't know i feel like i'd be like put on some like bad list you
[02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:55.740]  know i don't think like every day for a while i don't know maybe if it kept up for a very
[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:59.380]  long time but even then it might be more like let's make sure this guy isn't doing anything
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:06.100]  suspicious yeah that's true uh well marco thank you for your time uh thank you everybody
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:11.340]  we can uh listen to your the dulcet tones of your voice on a very regular weekly basis
[02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:19.260]  at uh atp.fm which is literally my favorite podcast um thank you i say i do notice though
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:26.620]  you cheat and it sorts to the top of the list in in overcast you would not believe how many
[02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:34.340]  people think that well i mean it's not a lot of people who think that i do because it's
[02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:42.780]  yours i do i do get the occasional angry email or one star app store review from people who
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:49.260]  think that the entire reason i made overcast was to promote my own podcast uh and that
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:55.160]  that's why it shows up in the most recommended list sometimes that i've hard-coded it to
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:34:02.700]  appear there oh did i tell him change the name of my show triple a talk show like yellow
[02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:08.340]  pages triple a talk show a talk show exactly oh i wanted i that reminds me that's amazing
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:12.060]  that you said that i want i have i have some follow-up from like an episode 10 weeks ago
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:19.980]  on atp you were of course you were you were confused about uh minor league baseball and
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:27.420]  why single a and double a yes triple a uh it's just more a's are better and so why aren't
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:35.540]  the major leagues quadruple a they are in concept it's you could think of them as as
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:41.180]  my whole question was like why is triple a like the top tier in video game budget terms
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:46.740]  right but like this kind of minor league thing in baseball yeah i think that it's a different
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:50.260]  i think that i i don't know that's actually a good question on the video games i suspect
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:54.300]  that the triple a for video games has absolutely nothing to do with baseball that it doesn't
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:35:00.420]  come from baseball that it's some other um some other route so are there single a and
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:05.700]  double a teams yes there's single a uh which is really regional and then double a is a
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:11.780]  little bit bigger triple a is is elite it's people most of the people on a triple a team
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:18.640]  are the uh expected or at least have the potential to play major league baseball and then you
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.500]  can think of major league baseball as quadruple a baseball but they nobody calls it that nobody
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:28.900]  ever would because it's not minor league what are the columbus clippers i have no idea and
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:32.500]  there's also it says triple a there's also a affiliate of the cleveland indians there's
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:39.580]  also uh independent leagues which are so uh i believe it's the case i could be wrong but
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:44.980]  i believe it's the case that every single a double a and triple a team is affiliated
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:50.180]  with a major league team so like the yankees own a triple a team and a double a team and
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:55.660]  an a team but then there's independent leagues which aren't affiliated with a major league
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:36:00.740]  team um i think right over the river here in philly the trenton uh whatever they're
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:05.960]  called land sharks or rat sharks or whatever the hell they're called are unaffiliated sharks
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:10.460]  that's it yeah yeah they're an independent team and so they're not affiliated with a
[02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:18.200]  major league team so but they they they some of them are like single a and some of them
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:22.500]  are even like double a they say but for the most part they're they're just players who
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:25.780]  are having trouble getting picked up by a major league team anyway i figured i'd explain
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:30.060]  that to you thanks yeah actually i didn't realize that that like they weren't just all
[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:34.220]  triple a no like i'm seeing now like like the only two teams i know of are the columbus
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:37.660]  clippers because that's that was my team growing up in columbus like we'd go there like on
[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:42.160]  school field trips because it costs nothing and they actually are triple a apparently
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:47.620]  yeah associated with the indians and then now that i'm in new york the nearest team
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:53.380]  i think of this of this caliber is the long island ducks uh which are apparently independent
[02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:58.420]  they're in the uh the liberty division of the atlantic league of professional baseball
[02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:03.460]  which is not affiliated with the mlb right so they appear to have no a's no they don't
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:08.140]  have any ace no a baseball team uh it's not trenton it's camden it's the camden river
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:14.380]  sharks hey you were close yeah yeah the trenton rat sharks close enough yeah what i love about
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:17.900]  these games like because i don't you know i i wish i cared about sports i really do
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:22.180]  uh because i i like i know the rules of all the games i just don't care about the teams
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:28.260]  and so i don't get into it but like i i like the experience of seeing a game in person
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:32.100]  with friends who care about it like that's a that's a nice thing to do and so i love
[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:36.740]  triple a baseball because you can go to these stadiums with basically no advance notice
[02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:41.900]  whatsoever you can get amazing seats for almost no money yeah and you can go have a really
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:46.300]  good time and you can watch a game with great seats and everything and you know the food
[02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:51.140]  is not exorbitant uh relatively speaking and you know you could just have a really nice
[02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:56.460]  time and it's much less of an ordeal and much less expensive and much better quality of
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:38:00.820]  like you know your seats and everything compared to a major league game as long as you don't
[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:06.780]  care about teams which i don't so it's perfect uh yeah the camden river sharks i've gone
[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:10.380]  to see them a couple times with jonas and you can go in for like three bucks and sit
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:13.940]  in the front row and then you can and it's even cooler if the kids are you know like
[02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:18.040]  a younger age uh you know like when jonas was playing little league when he was a little
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:21.420]  younger because then it's like after the game you can get autographs from the players and
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:25.080]  stuff like that and you know it seems super cool it's like holy cow this guy was out there
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:29.900]  playing professional baseball 15 minutes ago now he's signing my hat you can't get that
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:33.280]  in a major league here's a here's a quora answer why are big budget games called triple
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:39.100]  a this seems this seems pretty credible i mean although is always the best uh way back
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:44.500]  in the old days games in old days studios had a b and c titles in the catalog a games
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:48.780]  were made in house with your developers and they were your main products the b titles
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:53.940]  were either add-on content for your a titles or new but slightly more humble games created
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:39:00.300]  by third-party developers that you would specify and then c titles were the older classic sku's
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:04.620]  now reduced to a value price or small games people brought in in a nearly finished state
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:11.460]  to be published even uh non-game add-ons like screensavers and stuff like that and of course
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:16.100]  the industry is full of hyperbole and bluster so everything was new was bigger and better
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:21.420]  and so the biggest a titles eventually began to be described as double a to emphasize or
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:27.060]  a plus to emphasize that they were even better than a games uh and it wasn't long until the
[02:39:27.060 --> 02:39:33.180]  triple a moniker arrived just like the number of blades in disposable razors watch for five
[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:39.660]  a games coming soon that's a pretty good answer yeah i find that to be very good answer a b
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:46.260]  and c and then it went to double a just to to plus it up a little bit that's probably
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:49.940]  how minor league baseball got it too probably used to be the same thing and then they you
[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:53.900]  know have like a better team and they'd say that i will leave that as your homework this
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:40:05.660]  week to research that all right thank you marco thank you
