[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  Adam angst welcome. There's a first time. I can't believe that it's my fault, but welcome to the talk show
[00:07.240 --> 00:13.480]  It's been way too long and I'm looking forward to it so speaking of too long
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.520]  Yeah, the motivating factor the hey
[00:21.520 --> 00:28.520]  Let's make this happen event that has gotten us here. Is that tidbits just celebrated?
[00:28.520 --> 00:30.520]  It's 30th anniversary
[00:32.400 --> 00:35.080]  Yes, which is it's
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.540]  Believe the word is inconceivable. And yes, it does mean
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.040]  So in some ways I mean, you know, it's like my mom always said my mom I
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.000]  Forget how old she is. I guess I shouldn't even say but she's not that old but you know
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.640]  but she said this forever like as she hit, you know big milestones like 50 and 60 and stuff like that that
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.360]  You know, she's always had the mindset that look you either hit these milestones or you don't and that means you're dead
[01:05.960 --> 01:07.960]  so it's only
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.960]  It's only goodness, right?
[01:09.960 --> 01:17.520]  I mean either either tidbits eventually turned 30 or tidbits went away and it's obviously it's a fantastic
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.520]  It is absolutely fantastic
[01:19.520 --> 01:21.480]  But
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.200]  It is but what makes tidbits different and unique is
[01:26.800 --> 01:34.360]  That by by having been started in 1990 it literally predates. It's an it's an online only
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.360]  Publication with 30 years of continuous publication under its belt that predates the web
[01:42.120 --> 01:44.120]  Yes
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.240]  That newfangled web I remember when that started I
[01:47.240 --> 01:52.440]  Mean, I remember when we first got our we got our first website in
[01:53.480 --> 01:55.360]  1996 and
[01:55.360 --> 02:02.960]  It was actually hosted for us at Dartmouth by a guy named Andy Affleck who I'm still friends with to this day
[02:04.680 --> 02:06.400]  So how
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.520]  And you know, I bet there are a fair number of people listening who if not going back to the original
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.840]  You know issue one in 1990 at least remember those early 90s pre web
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.720]  times
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.400]  But I'm sure that most people listening don't just it's just the nature of it
[02:25.400 --> 02:31.560]  So how how let's just start there. I mean, honestly, let's just start with the early days
[02:31.560 --> 02:36.880]  I mean, how did how did you publish an online publication before the web?
[02:36.880 --> 02:38.880]  It's
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.400]  It's amazing to think about so
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.920]  Keep in mind the first 99 issues 99 weeks of tidbits were published in hypercard
[02:51.800 --> 02:54.640]  so it wasn't even text and
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.760]  we every week we
[02:58.560 --> 03:04.240]  imported what we wrote into hypercards hypercard stack and then I had to stuff it and
[03:04.240 --> 03:10.200]  Bin hex it and then send it out on the internet. Now. What did sending it out on the internet mean?
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.600]  we had a initially the first couple of issues we had a mailing list and
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.480]  That crashed a Navy VAX in San Diego
[03:22.520 --> 03:31.240]  Because get this I had put more than 256 one of those special computer numbers more than 256 addresses in the two-line
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.240]  Oh
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.280]  Cornell's Cornell's mainframe operators were not tremendously impressed with me
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.560]  so
[03:40.560 --> 03:43.360]  One of the things about being a computer user back then
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.640]  was that
[03:45.640 --> 03:53.320]  Even if you weren't a programmer type you became very familiar with those magic computer numbers that it didn't
[03:53.320 --> 03:56.520]  Yes, it didn't seem random at all that when you had
[03:56.520 --> 04:02.800]  255 people it was fine. And when you had 256 it broke you were like, oh, of course
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.880]  They they were putting those they were counting them in a bite
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.960]  There's there's a wonderful story there's a
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.960]  Fabulous book I should go back and look at it at some point called the soul of a new machine by Tracy Kidder
[04:14.960 --> 04:20.620]  And it's about I think a data general mini computer and he tells a story like this
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.560]  You know where where it's like it fails in some way and it's like oh well
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.640]  Just go change the number in the code
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.200]  And but yes you stuff like that happened
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.280]  so so yeah, so we we were we started a we had to move off of the
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.400]  distributing via email for a while
[04:40.960 --> 04:42.520]  and
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.400]  but I I
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.400]  managed to make friends with
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.080]  people that I called the time the net heavies and
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.760]  And they were just people at universities who?
[04:55.960 --> 05:03.360]  They were more important than other people and it wasn't quite clear why usually I mean they were CS professors or
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.480]  Computer administrators or whatever, but they were the people who made things happen
[05:07.480 --> 05:14.560]  and if they said you could do something you could do something and if they didn't want you to do it you didn't happen and
[05:14.560 --> 05:20.400]  And it was like and I said that use the term net heavies because they weren't
[05:20.960 --> 05:25.560]  Elected or anything like that. They just somehow ended up in that position and
[05:26.320 --> 05:27.720]  so
[05:27.720 --> 05:29.840]  Working with some of them. I managed to get
[05:30.320 --> 05:37.080]  Be able to upload tidbits to the infomak digest or infomak archives, and then it was it was shared out of the infomak digest
[05:38.080 --> 05:39.560]  and
[05:39.560 --> 05:46.680]  And also, I mean gosh this the neurons firing in my head right now. We were uploading to various
[05:47.400 --> 05:54.000]  Bulletin boards and online services and things like that and it was all by hooker by crooks. I couldn't pay for any listen any money
[05:54.880 --> 05:59.120]  Um, so it was like I had to you know, but if you traded things if you said oh
[05:59.120 --> 06:05.560]  I'm gonna provide you with this content. You could often get free accounts or whatever. And so yeah for those first couple of years
[06:06.400 --> 06:08.400]  there was a whole lot of
[06:08.400 --> 06:10.400]  you know
[06:10.720 --> 06:13.560]  Friends doing friends favors the infomak
[06:14.440 --> 06:16.120]  archive
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.200]  slash digest was
[06:19.680 --> 06:21.760]  For me the the
[06:22.960 --> 06:27.200]  Apple dinner well, if not the Apple at that time
[06:27.360 --> 06:32.640]  Yeah, I guess it predates the Newton actually, but the Mac was Apple. It was the Mac
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.720]  Actually, the Apple to still had its last legs in some ways
[06:37.720 --> 06:41.680]  I mean, but I don't think it was ever part of the the
[06:42.480 --> 06:45.200]  Mac internet because you couldn't I
[06:46.080 --> 06:50.520]  Say couldn't because and I I put that in quotes cuz I'm sure that there were some people
[06:51.360 --> 06:54.640]  Because it was it was the time when people would figure out crazy stuff
[06:54.640 --> 06:59.520]  Like how do you get an Apple to GS on to the internet even though there's no, you know, etc
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.160]  So I'm not gonna say no and people and people did do that
[07:02.160 --> 07:05.120]  But it was yeah, it was crazy and it was it was a different subset
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.240]  I mean those were completely different computers and the two worlds didn't mix much
[07:10.800 --> 07:17.720]  From what I remember we could get to the Macintosh internet starter kit, but there was no Apple to internet starter kit, but
[07:19.200 --> 07:22.640]  Hey, it was amazing enough that we managed to get the Mac on the internet
[07:25.280 --> 07:27.120]  But the infomak
[07:27.120 --> 07:34.560]  Archive was like I never had all sorts of news groups on usenet that I that that I followed
[07:35.120 --> 07:37.680]  religiously and and stayed up to date
[07:37.680 --> 07:44.480]  But if you if you could only have one thing it was the info Mac because if you had info Mac
[07:45.200 --> 07:47.040]  You got all you know
[07:47.040 --> 07:53.360]  If there was software being released as shareware or freeware and you could download it from an FTP site and there was a new
[07:53.360 --> 08:00.160]  Version it was if it wasn't on info Mac as a as an it didn't exist. Yeah, and you could either
[08:00.720 --> 08:02.720]  Get it post by post
[08:02.720 --> 08:07.280]  Depending on you know, and I think whether you wanted it post by post sort of depended how you got it
[08:07.280 --> 08:10.720]  You know, like if you got it by email, you probably didn't want it post by post
[08:10.720 --> 08:12.800]  It was too many emails but on usenet
[08:12.800 --> 08:18.480]  It wasn't fine because then it was all in one group and you could just go through but the digest was like I forget
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.480]  Was it a daily digest?
[08:20.480 --> 08:22.480]  Digest
[08:22.680 --> 08:28.840]  You know, I'm trying to remember but what was interesting about it was yes a little bit how busy things were
[08:28.840 --> 08:34.520]  I think it was dial daily, but keep in mind. It was also moderated, right?
[08:34.520 --> 08:41.440]  It wasn't a free-for-all and the I mean to be an info Mac moderator was a big deal and there were also
[08:41.840 --> 08:48.320]  You know the archivist people who actually managed the file uploads and made sure everything was named reasonably and organized
[08:48.320 --> 08:51.920]  Well and things like that. So yeah, this was back at this
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.000]  Maybe this is also back in the days of the user groups being huge forces, you know
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.400]  Well be mug be mug had 50,000 users
[09:01.280 --> 09:01.920]  You know
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.600]  so there were people who would dedicate themselves to these tasks because
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.600]  They saw it as this incredible opportunity to provide something for a really pretty large and vibrant community
[09:14.120 --> 09:18.160]  Who you saw and heard from you know, I mean obviously there's many more users now
[09:18.160 --> 09:21.800]  But somehow it's much more amorphous. I remember
[09:22.920 --> 09:29.480]  My memory it's my memory. It's like 85% there and 15% not there. I don't remember the name of the Drexel
[09:30.120 --> 09:32.120]  user group, I think it was
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.520]  Damn, what was it? It was something everybody was every everything was something mug
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.920]  Macintosh user group and without the mug you wouldn't even know it was a Macintosh user group
[09:41.920 --> 09:45.920]  It might have been just demug or the we were the Drexel dragons
[09:45.920 --> 09:52.280]  It might have been the dry I forget but Drexel had a Macintosh user group and my freshman year in 1991. I
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.360]  wandered in eventually and Drexel had a great Drexel was
[09:57.800 --> 10:04.720]  Of this era was absolutely fantastic as somebody who was a budding Mac nerd because Drexel was part of this
[10:05.520 --> 10:13.120]  Pilot program in the late 80s where they worked with Apple the consortium. Yeah. Yeah University Consortium and they had a policy
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.040]  That every you didn't have to own a Macintosh. I mean college even in the early 90s was expensive enough
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.720]  But you had to have access to a Macintosh and that that was simple enough because even if you didn't own one
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.520]  They had a lab full of them that that had so meant so plentiful with
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.660]  Macintoshes that you could sit down in front of that it was never even at like the end of semesters
[10:37.680 --> 10:40.960]  You know when you would think it might be the hardest time to get time on one
[10:40.960 --> 10:44.400]  There was always free one really well, and I think the reason why
[10:45.040 --> 10:51.280]  Was that they had such an aggressive education pricing thing and they did kind of encourage freshmen
[10:51.440 --> 10:55.000]  They they it was they delicately balanced
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.560]  You don't have to buy one, but you really ought to buy your kid one
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.100]  And so just about I don't I my freshman year. I did not know anybody who didn't buy one
[11:04.100 --> 11:11.340]  other so you're you're a little younger than I am that because I graduated from Cornell in 89 and
[11:12.100 --> 11:19.420]  So Tonya and I were in charge of public computer rooms at Cornell and we definitely had waiting lines and things like that
[11:19.420 --> 11:23.460]  I mean you cuz you mean certainly you could buy them at the at the University today with the discount
[11:23.860 --> 11:26.420]  But it wasn't common enough yet
[11:26.420 --> 11:31.140]  Well, so it sounds like you just in that like, you know, you know couple of year periods when it when it transit
[11:31.140 --> 11:36.180]  Well, the big weight the big way, you know and anybody else who was at Drexel at that time is gonna call me on it
[11:36.180 --> 11:38.180]  The big weight was for the laser printers. Oh
[11:38.900 --> 11:44.460]  yeah, and and that and that absolutely core corresponded to the end of
[11:45.580 --> 11:48.420]  Semesters because of course that's when you know, yeah there might you you know
[11:48.420 --> 11:50.420]  You might have stuff do all throughout the semester
[11:50.420 --> 11:55.320]  But everybody has stuff do at the end of semester and anybody who had any two cents to rub together
[11:55.340 --> 11:58.100]  You know, like like the deal I got as a freshman
[11:58.100 --> 12:02.180]  I got a Mac LC and it came with a freestyle writer free
[12:02.180 --> 12:07.820]  It was just thrown in and it was a great education discount price. So why not take it and the style writer wasn't bad
[12:07.820 --> 12:10.900]  so I had a you know, but it was kind of a waste because
[12:11.700 --> 12:16.840]  Every single freshman also got one. So we had like two style writers in every dorm room like
[12:19.260 --> 12:21.260]  And you could still hear them now, yeah
[12:22.620 --> 12:26.980]  But like it was slow and be you know, it's yeah
[12:26.980 --> 12:33.100]  No, it's still it was a janky early days in time. I mean, I mean I wanted laser. I wasn't
[12:35.020 --> 12:37.020]  But anyway, right
[12:37.860 --> 12:42.460]  We it was a great lab and they had they had site licenses for
[12:43.020 --> 12:46.140]  All the I don't even think it was branded Claris yet
[12:46.140 --> 12:50.700]  But you know Mac, right and Mac draw and Mac paint everything like that
[12:50.820 --> 12:55.780]  You could just all you needed was right now floppy disk come in and and then you could get them all
[12:55.780 --> 12:58.180]  totally legit straight-up legal
[12:59.260 --> 13:01.620]  site license for the whole university but
[13:02.500 --> 13:04.500]  There was already
[13:05.460 --> 13:07.060]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[13:07.060 --> 13:07.580]  you know
[13:07.580 --> 13:14.740]  I guess thousands is a fair way of saying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shareware titles games and utilities and goofy stuff and
[13:15.220 --> 13:20.940]  When I wandered into the the Macintosh users group and found out that they had all of it
[13:20.940 --> 13:26.140]  And all you had to do is bring in floppies. I was like, I'll be back
[13:28.380 --> 13:33.140]  And you bought those boxes of like 10 floppies at a time and it was just like wow
[13:33.340 --> 13:39.020]  I could put so much stuff on this it was all of my money all of my money when I was in college all of
[13:39.020 --> 13:40.620]  it went to
[13:40.620 --> 13:42.620]  long-distance phone calls
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.660]  Because Amy Amy was in Pittsburgh and I was in Philadelphia and calling across the state of Pennsylvania
[13:47.660 --> 13:55.300]  Was like ten dollars a minute long-distance phone calls compact discs and floppy disks
[13:58.420 --> 14:02.060]  So it's all communication. Yeah, just you know, you know asynchronous and synchronous
[14:04.700 --> 14:07.100]  And the pack rat in me
[14:07.100 --> 14:10.340]  Didn't want to overwrite floppies, you know
[14:10.340 --> 14:14.740]  There were some things that you knew you could just overwrite like if you just wanted to print out a thing
[14:14.740 --> 14:19.260]  Well, then you'd you'd bring it back, but it's like well, I don't want to get rid of this weird version of Tetris
[14:19.260 --> 14:21.460]  Oh, I want I need a new floppy disk
[14:24.980 --> 14:28.020]  Well, so again being just a little bit earlier Cornell
[14:28.660 --> 14:33.780]  What you you had a couple of floppies because you could put the system and as it we used right now
[14:34.020 --> 14:37.700]  for word processor that was our site licensed one great little word processor and
[14:38.100 --> 14:44.100]  You put so your system and your application and your documents on a single floppy 800k floppy disk
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.740]  800k floppy and
[14:45.740 --> 14:50.620]  so you to have a couple of floppies that you just carry around with you at all times because then you could stop in a
[14:50.620 --> 14:56.020]  Computer room and work on your file, you know print if you needed to that kind of stuff and I still have
[14:56.540 --> 15:02.220]  Tanya and I had had a pair of floppies which are still called Ziggy. You know, I stand on my table here
[15:02.220 --> 15:03.860]  They're called Ziggy and Stardust
[15:03.860 --> 15:06.100]  So it's very much the time
[15:06.500 --> 15:12.740]  But your your concept comment about the names of the Mac user groups reminded me there were some pretty good ones
[15:12.740 --> 15:14.740]  and
[15:14.900 --> 15:17.620]  Ithaca's Ithaca's group was called mugwamp
[15:18.140 --> 15:24.100]  Which was indeed an acronym for the Macintosh user group for writers and users of Macintosh programs. Oh
[15:24.780 --> 15:30.100]  Which is pretty good and then Seattle's was debug for downtown business users group
[15:30.900 --> 15:37.740]  So, you know, so we're a few that managed to break the trend and there's been a few others that Rochester had Apple cider
[15:37.740 --> 15:41.580]  And I don't know what that I remember. I don't know how that expand. Yeah, that was a big one
[15:41.580 --> 15:47.140]  But but yeah, yeah as it was such a such a change. I mean, you know from now, you know
[15:47.140 --> 15:51.400]  There's there's user groups hanging on and I love I love them dearly, you know
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.380]  I go visit periodically at various ones, but it's it's a different scene. Yeah, because it's
[15:58.020 --> 16:04.580]  It's like voluntary it's purely social whereas back then it was yes, you could be totally it
[16:04.580 --> 16:08.900]  I don't want to say antisocial, but you could have no interest in any kind of camaraderie with others
[16:08.900 --> 16:12.520]  But you'd want to be an active member because otherwise you wouldn't find out what the hell was going on
[16:13.420 --> 16:20.980]  Well and companies like word perfect and Microsoft would come to Cornell to speak to this group of 30 or 40 people
[16:20.980 --> 16:25.940]  I mean like the biggest companies in the world would show up to demo and I still remember that word
[16:25.940 --> 16:29.620]  Perfect guy throwing little bags of M&Ms during his demo to keep people awake
[16:30.380 --> 16:34.780]  Because you you wanted the M&Ms and you know, and he was pretty good presenter too, but nonetheless
[16:36.620 --> 16:38.060]  Yeah
[16:38.060 --> 16:44.680]  So very different years info Mac in those days info Mac archives moderated. It was essential. It was so it was zero noise
[16:44.680 --> 16:48.260]  I mean it might be you know, it might be an update to a utility that you didn't care about
[16:48.260 --> 16:50.820]  But you didn't feel like oh that that shouldn't be here
[16:50.820 --> 16:56.860]  I mean, I don't think there was ever once anything that got posted to info Mac that made it through the moderation that you you know
[16:57.220 --> 17:04.620]  Felt like virus checking everything. It was all good. Yeah, and yeah. Yeah, it was as a I mean
[17:04.620 --> 17:10.520]  I'm still remain remembering there was a guy named Bill lipa and actually John pew who I'm still in touch with
[17:10.520 --> 17:12.480]  He was one of the monitors for a while
[17:12.480 --> 17:16.420]  So yeah, but you have to go back and back into the depths of my email
[17:16.420 --> 17:19.780]  Although I honestly don't have a lot of email from the early 90s
[17:20.260 --> 17:22.940]  My email archives start a little bit later than that
[17:23.660 --> 17:24.780]  it's
[17:24.780 --> 17:29.020]  Well, so how big were the hyper card issues? I mean because
[17:31.340 --> 17:32.940]  Not very
[17:32.940 --> 17:35.820]  Yeah, that was think they had to be smaller because you had to get stuff
[17:37.780 --> 17:41.780]  Well, actually I take that back I don't remember how large the files were
[17:41.780 --> 17:47.860]  I do remember that once we switched to text because we had the structure enhanced text format that we came out with issue 100
[17:47.900 --> 17:49.740]  That that that was you know
[17:49.740 --> 17:54.260]  Sort of where you took some of that stuff and when you were working on markdown got to a very similar kind of stuff
[17:54.260 --> 18:00.100]  We'll get to that but but once we went to text all the issues had to be under 30k
[18:00.100 --> 18:06.300]  Right because there were internet gateways that freaked out at of course 32k
[18:06.300 --> 18:11.500]  but you couldn't ever guarantee that was really gonna be 32 so you always want I always went to 30 and
[18:12.060 --> 18:16.620]  So yeah, they are the the thing that was interesting about the hypercard archives though
[18:17.140 --> 18:22.300]  Hercard stacks was they could archive themselves into a single stack
[18:22.900 --> 18:26.380]  So you'd get a new one that you download a new one each week and then you click a button in it
[18:26.380 --> 18:31.500]  I was so proud of this click a button in it and it would archive itself into the stack that you selected
[18:31.660 --> 18:35.180]  so you'd have this single uber archive of
[18:35.620 --> 18:38.520]  Every tidbits issue that was fully searchable and all that
[18:39.020 --> 18:44.980]  It was a big switch going from hypercard to plain text and that's what the see
[18:44.980 --> 18:49.620]  Yeah, how do you pronounce I always pronounce it see text see text. Yeah. All right. Yeah, it is see text
[18:49.620 --> 18:56.860]  And so there was there's a remarkable word in my history that I took a guess how to pronounce it was right in
[18:57.460 --> 18:58.700]  That case in this case
[18:58.700 --> 19:05.700]  It was that was specific because the guy who who came up with most of us kind of Ian Feldman who has disappeared entirely
[19:05.700 --> 19:09.940]  I mean he disappeared quickly. Like I never heard from him. I don't know more than a year or so after that
[19:10.540 --> 19:17.420]  But he was very particular about things like pronunciation and he said it's see text. Okay, we're going with that
[19:17.420 --> 19:23.580]  The big difference is so I'm gonna even if you don't remember a hyper card
[19:23.980 --> 19:29.420]  Everybody kind of knows it was a very early hyper text system graphical
[19:29.700 --> 19:36.900]  it was sort of a combination of an early predecessor to the web in terms of being hyper text and hyper connected and
[19:37.500 --> 19:39.900]  also a very early
[19:40.780 --> 19:42.780]  sort of
[19:42.780 --> 19:47.500]  It easy to use programming environment. Yes, and
[19:48.540 --> 19:54.380]  Visually software rector set was that it was the term, you know, and and with a a
[19:55.140 --> 20:02.600]  Programming language that really only could be compared to Apple script, you know that a hyper hyper talk was very
[20:03.020 --> 20:03.580]  you know
[20:03.580 --> 20:09.220]  It was at a time when everybody not everybody maybe but a lot of people thought that was the key to making
[20:09.220 --> 20:14.380]  Programming more accessible to more people was to make it the syntax look like English syntax
[20:15.460 --> 20:17.460]  But people were incredibly
[20:18.060 --> 20:22.620]  Productive in it there were people who were non programmers who wrote amazing things in hyper card
[20:22.860 --> 20:29.160]  That honestly and I don't want to make this whole episode about hyper hyper card, but to this day
[20:29.160 --> 20:31.160]  I don't think that there's a
[20:32.060 --> 20:35.140]  replacement that is as neat and as accessible to
[20:35.140 --> 20:40.880]  To more people as hyper card. It was also very very
[20:41.620 --> 20:43.740]  Macintosh II in terms of the
[20:44.540 --> 20:50.300]  Spirit of Macintosh, you know, which was only the whole platform was only six years old in 1990, you know
[20:50.300 --> 20:57.660]  It was still relatively new. It was you know way newer than even it was like about the age then of Apple watch now
[20:57.660 --> 21:02.940]  Apple watch just turned five, you know, so think about how new Apple watches now, that's how new the man hides
[21:02.940 --> 21:04.260]  and
[21:04.260 --> 21:09.160]  Hyper card was also developed by Bill Atkinson who who was like one of the key
[21:09.660 --> 21:15.980]  Macintosh developers so like this was his vision of what the Mac could be and you know
[21:15.980 --> 21:20.460]  I have to say we compare it to Apple script hyper talk to Apple script
[21:21.060 --> 21:28.300]  There's no comparison hyper talk was way easier way more understandable for people who didn't have a programming background
[21:28.820 --> 21:30.460]  and
[21:30.460 --> 21:33.900]  The things that people made with it were astonishing
[21:33.940 --> 21:34.460]  Yeah
[21:34.460 --> 21:41.460]  really was and nothing has ever ever come to that ever that level ever again and there's great stuff like super card and
[21:41.860 --> 21:44.680]  live code now and whatnot that are kind of similar, but
[21:45.260 --> 21:49.980]  They've never quite gotten to that level of elegant simplicity
[21:51.100 --> 21:57.180]  I'll just just to name one example. I remember I had a calculus teacher at Drexel who I mean the number one
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.220]  He was a very smart guy
[21:58.220 --> 22:03.360]  He was he was like one of the heads of the Department of Mathematics at Drexel
[22:03.360 --> 22:09.340]  So, I mean he was obviously, you know, not a dummy, but he was a mathematician not a programmer or computer scientist
[22:09.340 --> 22:11.340]  he had for his
[22:11.860 --> 22:17.100]  like freshman level calculus courses hyper card stacks that he himself had written and
[22:17.540 --> 22:25.140]  They were extremely graphical and I remember a I really was I was pretty good at math going into college
[22:25.140 --> 22:29.820]  But like, you know really ran up against even my freshman year
[22:30.300 --> 22:33.980]  So it was the calculus itself was like man. I got to get out of this
[22:33.980 --> 22:37.380]  I got it. I got to take as little as possible
[22:37.380 --> 22:43.340]  But the the Mac nerd in me was blown away by I was like this guy is not even a programmer
[22:43.340 --> 22:48.020]  You know, it's like this is amazing. They were very graphical and they did and they were animated
[22:48.020 --> 22:53.220]  You know that you know the aspects of calculus like the way curves approach a limit
[22:53.220 --> 22:56.100]  It was like the approaching the limit was animated
[22:56.580 --> 23:03.260]  This guy's not a programmer. He didn't like have a grad student from the computer science department build these for him
[23:03.260 --> 23:08.380]  He just did this on his own in the way that college professors spend time on course materials
[23:08.500 --> 23:15.180]  He built software that was incredibly cool and it really was useful
[23:15.180 --> 23:21.220]  It was not like a gimmick like oh the guy was also a hobbyist on the Mac and and wasted time on this
[23:21.220 --> 23:25.380]  It really did help illustrate the material. It was good. It was good stuff
[23:25.380 --> 23:29.100]  And I don't know how he would do it without hypercard. There was no way he was gonna do it
[23:29.180 --> 23:33.580]  He wasn't gonna drop into Pascal or C and write real applications to do it
[23:33.580 --> 23:37.980]  it required a level of expertise that you couldn't expect from a math professor and
[23:39.500 --> 23:42.860]  Afterwards after hypercard faded away. Nothing really took that spot
[23:43.900 --> 23:47.300]  But then so my point though, is that going from 0 to 99?
[23:47.300 --> 23:54.740]  the tidbits as a hypercard stack was extremely Macintosh II the fact that you could get a new issue and have it within your
[23:55.420 --> 24:00.740]  instance of hypercard on your Mac collapse into the same stack and you'd collect the issues there a
[24:01.100 --> 24:06.980]  super Macintosh II like idea like right like like like like part of what it meant to be a
[24:07.780 --> 24:12.580]  Macintosh Mac like back then was elegance elegance in computing, you know
[24:12.580 --> 24:16.660]  And and not to go we could any one of these could be a two-hour rant on their own
[24:16.660 --> 24:19.300]  But the fact that Mac files you just yet
[24:20.260 --> 24:23.560]  In hindsight is another one of those numbers you had 31 characters
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.980]  So you were up to 32, you know 32 is one of those magic numbers, but you could use any characters you wanted
[24:28.980 --> 24:31.280]  You know, you could put spaces in your file names
[24:31.720 --> 24:37.620]  Nobody used file name extensions except for files you'd share over the internet like a stuff at archive
[24:38.780 --> 24:45.300]  And then only it was you know, because you were leaving the Macintosh universe and putting it in putting it somewhere where you you know
[24:45.300 --> 24:47.300]  It needed that
[24:49.780 --> 24:55.420]  Going to plain text with C text was sort of a I get why you did it
[24:55.420 --> 25:01.140]  I think it was probably the right way because it was more, you know plain text is the universal format still is to this day
[25:01.140 --> 25:03.140]  in 2020
[25:03.380 --> 25:11.340]  But it was sort of a concession to the practicality of plain text versus the magical
[25:11.340 --> 25:15.220]  Elegance of something like hypercard. Yeah
[25:16.500 --> 25:18.460]  indeed, and I think
[25:18.460 --> 25:25.860]  What I ran into and I honestly don't remember the thinking behind the switch all that
[25:25.860 --> 25:27.860]  Well, I mean this was
[25:27.860 --> 25:29.860]  1992
[25:30.460 --> 25:34.940]  But I think well I had made one mistake in the hypercard stack
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.460]  which caused it to grow too large larger than it needed to on each import and
[25:40.460 --> 25:43.340]  And there was no way to fix no way to back patch that
[25:44.020 --> 25:48.260]  For various reasons and so that was one thing that was bothering me about the stack
[25:48.740 --> 25:53.500]  but I think what it came down to was it felt like I
[25:54.720 --> 25:57.500]  Could just reach so many more people
[25:58.220 --> 26:00.580]  Because there were a lot of Mac users
[26:01.620 --> 26:05.140]  Whose Macs couldn't connect to the internet in any way shape or form?
[26:05.140 --> 26:12.500]  That they they could read email at work or they could tell that in to read use elmer pine or whatever
[26:13.060 --> 26:18.700]  But there was just no way they could get a hypercard stack from that point on to their Mac
[26:18.700 --> 26:25.780]  Yeah, that because we didn't really this really is 1991 1992 and it's not easy to get on the internet in
[26:26.180 --> 26:30.180]  Any way shape or form and so, you know, that's why again
[26:30.180 --> 26:36.620]  we we we distributed to Apple link and Bix and CompuServe and Delphi and genie and
[26:37.260 --> 26:39.260]  Did I get him in alphabetical order? Whoa
[26:39.780 --> 26:42.980]  So, you know basically every imaginable
[26:44.340 --> 26:50.300]  Online service because that was many ways an easier way to get files than the internet and
[26:51.100 --> 26:54.300]  It there is something and it's to this day
[26:55.100 --> 26:58.180]  Literally as we speak there's like this really nice
[26:58.180 --> 27:00.180]  resurgence in
[27:00.580 --> 27:04.900]  Newslet email newsletters. Yeah, and what makes them
[27:05.540 --> 27:08.500]  Resurgent today is what made them nice in
[27:09.300 --> 27:14.580]  1992 also where even if you could get the
[27:15.580 --> 27:20.180]  Bin hex stuff it file of the stack to your Mac fairly easily
[27:21.380 --> 27:25.980]  Nothing beat there. It is in your email tidbits issue
[27:25.980 --> 27:32.460]  110 and you click it and there you are and you're reading and now you're just spacebar spacebar spacebar spacebar
[27:32.460 --> 27:37.340]  And you go down. It's right there right the fact that it's right there. Yeah, here it is and
[27:37.860 --> 27:44.180]  Truth be told part of you know that the essence of tidbits from the get-go has been the writing
[27:45.300 --> 27:49.220]  It is yes, we had no graphics for many many years
[27:49.220 --> 27:53.660]  I was actually trying to think about that like I don't remember when we first started putting graphics and we started linking
[27:53.660 --> 27:56.620]  to them before we could put them in of course
[27:56.620 --> 28:01.540]  I mean, we'd have like a literally a URL so you could click to go see the graphic. I sympathize
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.500]  Yeah
[28:07.700 --> 28:11.300]  But you can't beat that convenience or you know, maybe you read in
[28:11.820 --> 28:18.420]  Usenet, you know and and the usenet experience was very much like if you were going in through, you know
[28:18.420 --> 28:24.620]  Talnet, you know, it was purposefully very similar to using elm pine or whatever your email client was
[28:24.620 --> 28:29.300]  There was only you know arrows to go up and down to select groups or mailboxes you go in
[28:29.300 --> 28:33.460]  There's a message and then you read the message and there it is and if tidbits could be right there
[28:33.660 --> 28:39.060]  There you are. You're reading it spacebar spacebar go down the 32k thing though is fascinating
[28:40.180 --> 28:46.060]  We also didn't have the the there was a switch away from the Macintosh enos of
[28:46.060 --> 28:53.100]  Hypercard, but we didn't lose all of that. Hmm, and that was thanks to an application called EZ view
[28:54.940 --> 28:56.380]  Viewer
[28:56.380 --> 29:01.820]  Written by a guy named a keef Eiler who was Turkish and and he's still around
[29:01.820 --> 29:04.540]  I heard from him just a few months ago and
[29:05.860 --> 29:08.260]  He I forget how we met
[29:09.020 --> 29:14.060]  But you know, I think he was starting in on this and of a text on the screen
[29:14.060 --> 29:17.540]  on this and of a text file viewer and
[29:18.260 --> 29:22.460]  I said, hey, would you like to support see text? He's like, oh, that's so cool
[29:22.460 --> 29:28.660]  Can you give me this back and so we share and and he did and so it was great because you could get right back
[29:29.180 --> 29:30.500]  to that
[29:30.500 --> 29:35.140]  elegance of like everything in your easy view archive, right and
[29:35.660 --> 29:39.540]  But he also built in support for other formats, too
[29:39.540 --> 29:46.660]  so you could have other easy view documents that would you know, like index info Mac archives in fact because those were mbox formats and
[29:47.300 --> 29:52.580]  and so but that gave us all of that kind of brows ability and
[29:53.620 --> 29:59.620]  Archiving this keep in mind. My mother was Cornell University archivist for many years. So archives are in my blood and
[30:00.820 --> 30:07.220]  But at the same time as you say the ease of its email you just look at it and you can read right then and there
[30:07.220 --> 30:15.180]  It yeah, I do remember easy view and I remember using it. I think what I used to do as the sort of borderline
[30:16.300 --> 30:21.580]  Obsessive compulsive pack rat was I would I would read a new issue of tidbits
[30:21.580 --> 30:26.100]  However, I first saw it, you know, whether it was email or usenet, you know
[30:26.100 --> 30:29.300]  And I would like look both places so I could read it right away
[30:29.620 --> 30:34.460]  But then eventually I would download it so that I'd keep every issue archived in easy view
[30:34.460 --> 30:36.300]  Mm-hmm
[30:36.300 --> 30:39.620]  Well, one of the things that I remember from those days also
[30:39.620 --> 30:42.860]  I'd be curious gonna have to go back and look see how long I kept this up
[30:43.420 --> 30:44.540]  but
[30:44.540 --> 30:52.660]  keep in mind we had the the magazines were a big deal Mac world Mac user Mac week and they had reviews but there was no
[30:53.220 --> 30:58.180]  Index and so every issue of tidbits I would actually
[30:58.180 --> 31:06.660]  Actually have a quote-unquote article. That was a list of the products that were reviewed in the magazines that I'd received
[31:08.020 --> 31:10.680]  So if you wanted to know what you know
[31:10.680 --> 31:16.060]  Where there was a review of Microsoft Word 6 or 5 or 5.1 whatever version it was at that point
[31:16.060 --> 31:23.660]  If you searched in your archive, you would actually find out that you know Mac user of January of 1992 had that
[31:23.660 --> 31:29.380]  Review in it as well and you could actually like probably go to a library or maybe you got it on your shelf
[31:29.380 --> 31:31.700]  You had on your shelf, but you could never find it in there
[31:32.340 --> 31:37.940]  So that was another kind of you know thing we did to bridge the the digital analog gap
[31:38.300 --> 31:43.620]  I've told this story before but I I wanted a subscription to Mac week so bad
[31:45.180 --> 31:50.340]  But but the idea was and and like if you're young enough this is gonna seem crazy
[31:50.340 --> 31:55.440]  But there were like two types of print period print periodicals of the time
[31:55.440 --> 32:01.060]  The monthly magazines were just regular magazines and the big two big ones here in the US for Mac world Mac user
[32:01.940 --> 32:02.980]  and you you know
[32:02.980 --> 32:09.420]  You could either subscribe like you subscribe to any magazine today or get them on the newsstand and that was that and you just bought
[32:09.420 --> 32:13.700]  Them Mac week was a trade publication and trade publications
[32:14.380 --> 32:16.380]  Were not sold on newsstands
[32:16.380 --> 32:23.020]  Mm-hmm, and and you couldn't no matter what you couldn't just say well, here's take my money. Here's my credit card
[32:23.020 --> 32:29.060]  Send me a subscription you you you had you had to like apply and give them your credentials
[32:29.380 --> 32:31.940]  For how you were in the trade, you know
[32:31.940 --> 32:36.620]  And so if you were do you do you remember the size of those application form because they were tablets
[32:36.620 --> 32:40.580]  And it was a full page of really tiny little boxes. You had to fill them all in
[32:40.780 --> 32:43.620]  Yeah, I and you would to lie through your teeth. I remember I remember
[32:43.620 --> 32:46.060]  to my utmost shame
[32:46.060 --> 32:51.420]  I I remember because I applied several times I and I even thought maybe they're keeping track of my name
[32:51.420 --> 32:53.420]  I tried like under a fake name
[32:54.580 --> 33:00.780]  And I never never heard back never heard back from from them. Oh, really?
[33:00.980 --> 33:03.380]  So for years I had to read if you didn't lie
[33:03.380 --> 33:04.820]  Well, I had to read maybe you didn't lie
[33:04.820 --> 33:09.220]  Well, I guess and but I I like to think of myself as a talented liar. So I
[33:10.060 --> 33:13.260]  That's why I'm ashamed of it. I mean I made up job titles
[33:13.260 --> 33:17.580]  I said that I worked I'd like looked up real businesses, but like the problem was
[33:18.500 --> 33:24.140]  the problem always was that like I could I could figure out a way that would make it look like
[33:25.220 --> 33:27.820]  My I had a job or worked at a company or whatever
[33:28.100 --> 33:32.640]  But like how do you fake a mailing address? Like I still needed it mailed to me
[33:33.540 --> 33:38.020]  Like it's pretty obvious why the ones I had sent to dorms at Drexel didn't work
[33:38.660 --> 33:42.980]  Getting it sent to my parents home was no good because I didn't go home often enough
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.420]  You know, I mean what good would it have been? I don't know that that would have worked anyway
[33:46.420 --> 33:52.060]  But what good is it getting 20 issues of Mac week at Thanksgiving, you know, like right? Yeah, right
[33:52.060 --> 33:58.300]  Yeah, so that was always and you know apartments were never I think it was always the mailing address that gave gave me away
[33:58.780 --> 34:05.260]  Interesting. So that was the only reason I ever went to the Drexel library ever. I don't remember ever going for classwork
[34:05.260 --> 34:09.980]  I just but they had a Mac week subscription and so once a week I would go into the library
[34:09.980 --> 34:13.140]  At Drexel and and read read Mac week. I
[34:14.020 --> 34:20.160]  Don't remember. I don't remember an issue with the addresses, but it may just have worked out for me
[34:20.500 --> 34:23.820]  but but you know worked at Cornell as a student and
[34:24.420 --> 34:29.260]  in the CIT with computing computing information technology Cornell information technology
[34:29.260 --> 34:34.060]  And so yeah, you would lie on the application form like pretending you were Cornell
[34:34.060 --> 34:40.260]  right because I was in charge of hundreds of Macs if you counted all the public rooms that I was in charge of and
[34:41.340 --> 34:45.700]  And so I got Mac week and info world and PC week
[34:46.380 --> 34:51.300]  Because you know those were the end and they were they were being they were like, you know
[34:51.700 --> 34:55.220]  You know, they could be you know, 40 or 50 pages a week
[34:56.500 --> 35:01.140]  And and they were fabulous because this is also the time when you wanted to read the ads. Yeah
[35:01.140 --> 35:04.680]  Yeah, definitely the ads were partly why you got it
[35:06.180 --> 35:10.220]  So and I did I did I didn't remember when I finally you know
[35:10.220 --> 35:14.100]  a couple years later when I started meeting the people who actually worked at Mac week and
[35:14.980 --> 35:19.140]  and hearing their stories and what they said was is that
[35:19.780 --> 35:24.460]  They basically just worked harder than all of the the PC
[35:25.220 --> 35:29.860]  Publications and that was because they they had no resources and etc, etc
[35:29.860 --> 35:34.820]  But they all loved what they were doing and just you know
[35:34.820 --> 35:39.060]  Did more and that was that was because the Mac week was always a step above
[35:39.580 --> 35:43.340]  Info world and PC week. Yeah. Yeah, they were really corporate and
[35:44.580 --> 35:49.780]  and so the Mac week did have to appeal to what they called the volume buyers all the people they
[35:50.420 --> 35:56.500]  were giving it to so they could get the ads but and they remain fascinated by the fact that
[35:56.500 --> 36:01.520]  That huge publications there was there was a massive advertising market
[36:02.380 --> 36:05.980]  Despite the fact that there was far less money in the ecosystem, right?
[36:06.780 --> 36:11.660]  and I I've never figured out how that has has you know,
[36:11.700 --> 36:16.900]  We've got so much more money in the ecosystem and advertising is so much less of a part of it now
[36:16.900 --> 36:21.580]  I don't know either I can only guess that part of it and whenever there's you know
[36:21.580 --> 36:27.220]  Every periodically somebody will stumble upon their stash of old Mac weeks or Mac users or any, you know
[36:27.220 --> 36:33.420]  PC publications in their closet or their basement and scan a few ads and the one thing that jumps out to you is how much
[36:33.420 --> 36:40.960]  More expensive everything was you know, it would turn out somebody had like a thing where they were just linking to all of the various
[36:41.340 --> 36:46.000]  C compilers for PCs in like the late 80s and you know number one
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.780]  Nobody pays for C compilers anymore and at all like it's it seems crazy
[36:49.780 --> 36:54.100]  But back then it was a huge thing and and they were all you know hundreds of dollars
[36:55.860 --> 37:01.220]  Yeah, well and you bought one app that was you know you researched it
[37:01.220 --> 37:07.500]  It's like this is gonna be the word processor that I use and you paid your couple of hundred bucks
[37:07.500 --> 37:14.900]  Yep, and and and because in part you'd put in the research and you'd paid the money you were loyal. Yeah
[37:14.900 --> 37:20.260]  Right. That was that was your tool and and you got good at whatever your tool was
[37:20.900 --> 37:24.580]  So, you know, I mean those of us who were in the industry and got review copies
[37:25.540 --> 37:29.780]  Were really unusual because we had used multiple different things and could compare them
[37:29.780 --> 37:34.500]  That's why the comparison articles were so popular because you really wanted to know which one were you gonna pick
[37:35.060 --> 37:41.300]  Once you paid your money, it was not a good thing to have to to switch off right? It was they were comparison articles were
[37:41.300 --> 37:45.940]  Comparison articles were were essential to the both the magazines, you know
[37:46.100 --> 37:52.900]  And the weeklies and and they're they're still useful even today because a good comparison article just takes time
[37:53.380 --> 37:59.780]  To do but at that time it was it was like you almost nobody would have the access to do
[38:00.100 --> 38:04.340]  How do you review three different five hundred dollar word processors or whatever they cost?
[38:04.580 --> 38:09.460]  Yeah, you had to be associated with mac world or mac user and and it was interesting for me
[38:09.460 --> 38:14.580]  Actually, I remember the first app or first product that I was ever given for review
[38:15.140 --> 38:19.380]  Was now utilities 2.0. Oh, man. What a great what a great and
[38:20.480 --> 38:27.860]  Fabulous fabulous app fabulous collection of apps obviously wonderful utilities and I reviewed the hell out of that thing
[38:30.820 --> 38:35.160]  I wrote so much because I couldn't believe they'd given me this free software
[38:35.160 --> 38:41.000]  you know and before that I mean like you saved your money to buy stuff like quick key is in suitcase and
[38:41.400 --> 38:46.600]  You know, you you really agonized over the fact that you could spend fifty dollars on this app
[38:47.320 --> 38:52.840]  And you know and when you got it, you were just like, oh, this is the best thing ever and and so yeah
[38:52.920 --> 38:57.960]  So and it was always terrible when you had the best thing ever and then someone came out with a new one
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.640]  And you had to decide whether or not you could justify
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.580]  Switching to this new app. That was the same as yours but better because it was newer in these ways and
[39:08.780 --> 39:12.460]  Uh, yeah the compression wars. That was the other big thing that was going on back then
[39:13.100 --> 39:15.420]  All right. Let's let's pick it up at the compression wars
[39:15.500 --> 39:18.940]  I'm going to take a break though and thank our first sponsor my good friends at linode
[39:19.500 --> 39:26.460]  Hey linode is where I host staring fireball and look you probably have more time on your hands now than you have lately
[39:26.700 --> 39:28.700]  if one of your ideas
[39:28.700 --> 39:31.100]  Has been to move where you're hosting your website
[39:31.580 --> 39:35.340]  Go ahead and take a look at linode linode is absolutely terrific
[39:35.340 --> 39:42.540]  They have 11 data set data centers worldwide enterprise grade hardware and their next generation network
[39:43.180 --> 39:49.420]  Anything that you think of you know, the type of stuff you put on a web server the quote-unquote lamp stack, you know
[39:49.980 --> 39:51.980]  Apache my SQL
[39:51.980 --> 39:59.220]  PHP pearl that type of stuff traditional stuff easy to do all the new stuff. Do you want to host a game server?
[39:59.500 --> 40:02.700]  From minecraft that sort of thing. That's a fantastic thing
[40:02.700 --> 40:07.100]  I've suggested this here a lot of parents with young kids of like, you know, I never really thought about that
[40:07.100 --> 40:12.140]  What a great way to do it. Well, guess what linode they still have a plan called the nanode plan
[40:12.140 --> 40:14.900]  No, because it's small starts at just five bucks a month
[40:15.580 --> 40:18.880]  Absolutely fantastic for hosting a minecraft game server
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.000]  so whether it's something just personal like a minecraft server for you and your kids or
[40:23.720 --> 40:24.880]  totally
[40:24.880 --> 40:29.620]  Deep into the technical woods full-time IT enterprise scale
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.360]  Hosting linode has you covered native SSD
[40:35.200 --> 40:37.920]  Everywhere every plan 40 gigabit network
[40:38.760 --> 40:42.540]  Just you name it. They've got it great Python command-line interface
[40:42.540 --> 40:49.180]  In interface API's if you're into that sort of depth of expertise, but also a really really easy
[40:49.580 --> 40:54.580]  Visual control panel if you just want something simple turn it on set it up. Let it run
[40:55.660 --> 41:01.660]  Really great stuff. They also have a new thing object storage, which is an API compatible version or
[41:02.420 --> 41:05.200]  competitor alternative to Amazon s3
[41:05.700 --> 41:07.740]  You can take code written for s3
[41:07.740 --> 41:14.900]  Hook it up to their object storage and just switch right over really great. Here's what you do to find out more go to

[41:51.500 --> 41:53.220]  Go check them out
[41:53.220 --> 41:58.740]  That storage war are the the compression Wars compact Pro versus stuff it
[42:00.180 --> 42:03.300]  and then disc doubler doubler and
[42:03.300 --> 42:09.300]  And oh gosh, there was there was a company Alice's. Yeah. Oh
[42:10.100 --> 42:12.980]  They had slightly dodgy software
[42:14.140 --> 42:19.540]  Because I mean, this is compression. So you'd care do they was touching every freaking file on your heart. So this
[42:20.860 --> 42:24.280]  My story on this I was a disc doubler person
[42:24.660 --> 42:31.580]  Yeah, and just so I was great. I had I told you I had a Mac LC came with a 40 megabyte hard disk and
[42:31.580 --> 42:36.500]  I had no money to buy an
[42:37.140 --> 42:44.180]  External hard drive which were exorbitantly expensive at the time. So like I told you earlier, I spent a lot of money on floppies
[42:44.660 --> 42:47.580]  So anything I really wanted backed up would be backed up to fly
[42:47.580 --> 42:53.540]  But if you have a 40 megabyte hard drive and your floppies are 1.4
[42:53.540 --> 42:56.500]  I know I you know in the 90s we were up to the double density floppies
[42:56.500 --> 43:01.940]  So they were all 1.4 megabytes. Remember how you could buy a single density one and then use a hole punch
[43:02.700 --> 43:10.420]  Yes, yes, click punch the other side of it. So number one house. I mean, I I I don't know it then
[43:10.420 --> 43:12.420]  I never had one go bad
[43:12.500 --> 43:20.300]  But it does seem really loose and loosey-goosey with your data integrity that you just took took a floppy that was certified as 800
[43:20.300 --> 43:26.220]  Kilobytes used a hole punch to punch a hole through the plastic because that's how the disk drive mechanisms
[43:26.220 --> 43:31.740]  They just shown a light through the you know, does the light go through? Yes. Okay high density
[43:32.380 --> 43:33.980]  And it worked
[43:33.980 --> 43:39.620]  But anyway, I can assume is it was one of those things. It wasn't worth making the drug the quality worse
[43:40.300 --> 43:45.180]  You know like you work you work up your manufacturing line. Why would you make it worse?
[43:45.420 --> 43:48.980]  All right, so I never had troubles either. So I
[43:49.540 --> 43:55.180]  I'm gonna crack up so many times telling this story and people who are young enough not to remember this are gonna think it's not
[43:55.180 --> 44:02.940]  true, but disc doubler was a utility commercial utility sold for a reasonable amount of money because it was it was consumer not not
[44:02.940 --> 44:08.500]  You know not sold just to businesses. It was advertised the heck out of and Mac user and Mac Mac
[44:09.020 --> 44:12.740]  World, you know, I don't know 50 bucks. Maybe let's say 50 bucks
[44:12.740 --> 44:16.940]  you'd buy a copy of disc doubler and then when you installed it, it would
[44:17.460 --> 44:24.380]  It would install a system extension on your Mac and then it would automatically compress your entire
[44:24.380 --> 44:26.380]  disc and
[44:26.860 --> 44:30.620]  Promised roughly to double that's the name disc doubler
[44:30.660 --> 44:34.460]  So with 50% you know compression it would double, you know
[44:34.460 --> 44:38.180]  if you had a 40 megabyte disc you'd effectively have an 80 megabyte disc and
[44:39.260 --> 44:45.020]  And then this is the part number one already sounds a little too good to be true and number two
[44:45.100 --> 44:52.220]  They said it hardly hardly noticeable performance wise like they you know, and you can't say it's not noticeable at all
[44:52.220 --> 44:56.860]  But they you know, they had numbers in their ads and they'd say it's only like 5% or something like that
[44:57.260 --> 45:02.740]  So for like a 5 to 10 percent trade-off on disc performance, you could double the space of your drive
[45:04.020 --> 45:06.100]  So it sounds way too good to be true
[45:06.100 --> 45:12.860]  But I remember reading reviews and reviewers of trusted magazine said it actually works it actually everything
[45:12.860 --> 45:14.100]  They say is actually true
[45:14.100 --> 45:20.980]  I was like hmm because I could really use this because I every every week I keep putting stuff from my drive onto floppies
[45:20.980 --> 45:26.140]  You know and I was running that 40 megabyte drive at about 37 megabytes
[45:26.580 --> 45:31.540]  all the time and then you know you get closer to 40 and you know, and then you
[45:32.060 --> 45:38.580]  Find some empty floppy disks move some stuff off onto floppies so you could keep going. That sounds good
[45:38.580 --> 45:40.980]  But the thing is here's the really scary part
[45:40.980 --> 45:48.660]  You didn't stall it if you didn't have and I didn't like a 40 megabyte drive to copy your current drive on to
[45:48.660 --> 45:51.080]  Just in case it was it was
[45:51.780 --> 45:53.820]  You're on the trapeze with no net
[45:55.540 --> 46:02.500]  Right, like if I had installed if I had tried disc doubler and it had just corrupted my drive in the way that I kind
[46:02.500 --> 46:05.620]  of thought there must be a very high chance that it would I
[46:06.420 --> 46:11.500]  just lost everything that wasn't already on a floppy disk and if I had to restore it would be like
[46:11.500 --> 46:15.300]  You know one megabyte from this disc one megabyte from that disc
[46:15.300 --> 46:18.140]  But anyway, long story short it it friggin worked
[46:19.860 --> 46:22.940]  Though that software was just amazing. I mean the
[46:24.420 --> 46:26.420]  the the the oh
[46:26.980 --> 46:33.460]  Thrill of seeing it work because it was truly magic to have your drive
[46:33.700 --> 46:38.260]  suddenly have twice as much space and you know, I can't remember the amount of
[46:39.620 --> 46:44.340]  Performance hits as you say, but I do remember there was you only saw it when you
[46:44.340 --> 46:50.120]  Saw it when you opened and closed right right like because it had to expand into memory and then recompress
[46:50.820 --> 46:56.420]  And you know, but that's not a time when you're really all that stressed, right? Well, you were working at full speed
[46:56.420 --> 47:03.380]  It was just you know, opening and closing was a little slower and and disk IO even on a hard disk was so slow at the time
[47:05.220 --> 47:11.500]  You know, I think that's the you know, the layman's explanation for how could it possibly be true is that
[47:11.500 --> 47:19.020]  the yeah, the the compression algorithm that ran on your CPU as it read the bytes of your drive
[47:19.820 --> 47:24.540]  Was fast enough and efficient enough and the drive was so slow
[47:25.180 --> 47:29.900]  Even if you weren't compressing everything that it it could be made to work
[47:29.900 --> 47:35.420]  It was in and that's the secret is that even if you weren't using disc doubler reading a file off your hard drive was
[47:35.980 --> 47:40.140]  Incredibly slow you just knew you know, you know wait for this. Here's the watch cursor
[47:40.140 --> 47:45.660]  Yeah, you'd wait for stuff. But also things were just smaller too. Yeah, so, you know, I mean
[47:46.860 --> 47:51.500]  I've been doing a lot of disk testing recently to do a failed SSD in my iMac and
[47:52.060 --> 47:58.620]  And I'm kind of dealing with this performance issues and I was like boy, you know, I just don't remember max being slow
[48:00.140 --> 48:05.420]  In the past, but that's partly because we we moved so much less data around. Mm-hmm
[48:06.220 --> 48:07.580]  and
[48:07.580 --> 48:13.420]  and and they could be pretty quick, you know for how what the users saw
[48:13.980 --> 48:19.180]  Even if the actual like throughput, I mean was just insanely bad
[48:20.060 --> 48:22.060]  Yeah, well, I mean at that time
[48:22.620 --> 48:25.660]  Like, you know by the early 90s think everybody's you know
[48:25.660 --> 48:30.220]  It's like you had like a 20 or 40 megabyte hard disk in your Mac when you got a new one
[48:30.220 --> 48:36.700]  But they were still that the ecosystem was still there from the era before hard drives. Yep
[48:36.700 --> 48:42.380]  And so the assumption was that you might just be running your app off a floppy disk
[48:42.540 --> 48:45.100]  and so the app and all of its documents
[48:45.740 --> 48:47.100]  needed to be
[48:47.100 --> 48:49.100]  on a floppy disk which
[48:49.340 --> 48:51.340]  in practice
[48:51.340 --> 48:54.700]  Was I've always thought it harkened back
[48:55.340 --> 49:01.980]  Or are harks back quite a bit now to the way iOS works where you you don't really have
[49:01.980 --> 49:09.820]  files in a file system and when you delete the app you delete its data and it's all just there like the idea that
[49:09.820 --> 49:16.140]  Like your word processor and all of your word processing documents were on one floppy disk was yes
[49:16.140 --> 49:18.220]  You know sort of conceptually similar
[49:19.740 --> 49:23.340]  No, you had a word processing disk. Yeah, that's that's absolutely true
[49:23.340 --> 49:27.820]  And yes, you had a spreadsheet disk and you had a database disk and you didn't mix them
[49:27.820 --> 49:32.220]  You didn't mix them partly because you only had one disk drive right most of the time
[49:33.660 --> 49:38.060]  So yeah, no that that I think that is conceptually conceptually fair. Yeah
[49:41.180 --> 49:43.580]  But I have to say the one thing that was even more
[49:44.280 --> 49:50.220]  Magical than disk doubler and I I remember when this came out at mac world and covering it in tidbits
[49:51.020 --> 49:53.020]  Was kinetics's ram doubler
[49:53.980 --> 49:55.980]  the first virtual memory system
[49:55.980 --> 49:59.820]  And and again, it was the same thing, right? They were just compressing ram
[50:00.700 --> 50:07.100]  You know and moving some stuff off to disk and you know all the little virtual memory tricks that are kind of standard now
[50:07.100 --> 50:09.100]  We didn't think about
[50:09.180 --> 50:16.700]  But that was you know, that was a back when memory was so mind-bogglingly expensive, you know hundreds of dollars per megabyte
[50:17.420 --> 50:22.620]  All right, however expensive I was thinking and just complaining that hard drives were ram was
[50:22.620 --> 50:28.780]  Way more ram was like, you know, like it was like getting the uranium and back to the future
[50:28.780 --> 50:32.140]  It was like, you know, forget about it. You had to like know somebody
[50:33.740 --> 50:41.100]  And so yeah doubling your ram through virtual memory, but the crazy part of that is you think like well virtual memory
[50:41.100 --> 50:43.100]  We're all used to it, you know, so
[50:43.340 --> 50:49.260]  Sure, I can believe it the crazy part compared to today was that it came from a third party
[50:49.260 --> 50:55.580]  It wasn't like yes, apple has enabled this feature called ram doubler and you could turn it on and double your ram
[50:55.900 --> 50:58.300]  It was a utility you bought from a company
[50:59.180 --> 51:06.380]  That modified mac os to have virtual memory and it it was an operating system that didn't have virtual memory
[51:06.620 --> 51:08.860]  Like that's that's yeah crazy today
[51:10.300 --> 51:14.700]  And and my understanding and uh, you know, I was not a computer person a computer science person
[51:14.700 --> 51:20.700]  So my understanding though, is that the concept of virtual memory was pretty well known at that point in time
[51:20.700 --> 51:24.640]  Yeah in the unix world, you know, this was not a an astonishing
[51:25.480 --> 51:32.780]  revelation that connectix came up with it was more that apple didn't do it and so connectix did and
[51:33.660 --> 51:37.740]  That's just fascinating. You know, I mean you can't that doesn't happen anymore
[51:38.460 --> 51:40.700]  No one can get into the operating system to that level, right?
[51:40.700 --> 51:45.100]  and uh, you know, and I think that it's it it comes down to the fact that
[51:45.740 --> 51:52.460]  Just by the nature of the machines everything even the mac which was conceptually in terms of when you turned it on
[51:53.420 --> 51:56.780]  Presented itself in a way that abstracted the computer, you know
[51:56.780 --> 52:01.180]  Like it was a big deal that the 1984 mac when you turned it on
[52:01.180 --> 52:05.180]  What was the first thing you saw when the screen went on you saw a smiling mac logo?
[52:05.180 --> 52:11.340]  You didn't see some kind of fixed width
[52:12.040 --> 52:19.900]  monospaced font telling you, you know initializing dot dot dot and then a couple of things stream by and then the graphics kick in it it
[52:20.380 --> 52:23.980]  It was completely encapsulated in a you know, a graphical interface
[52:26.140 --> 52:27.580]  But still
[52:27.580 --> 52:30.380]  It the truth is it ran very low to the metal
[52:30.380 --> 52:37.260]  By today's standards and and they're just it just wasn't that much there. So a very clever talented team of
[52:37.820 --> 52:40.860]  third-party developers from outside the company could
[52:41.500 --> 52:48.620]  Just sort of dissect it figure out how the whole thing worked and figure out. Well if we just patch right here
[52:50.700 --> 52:52.300]  We
[52:52.300 --> 52:54.140]  We can control the system's memory
[52:55.500 --> 52:59.740]  Now did you ever go to mac hack? No, I never want I never went to mac hacks
[52:59.740 --> 53:04.380]  So I I I I knew about mac hack for many years
[53:04.380 --> 53:09.100]  I'd write about it in tidbits because there was always the hack contest mac hacks contest
[53:09.100 --> 53:12.060]  Which was different spelled different slightly differently there were issues with that
[53:12.540 --> 53:16.620]  Um, and then at one year someone said, you know, like oh are you going to mac hack?
[53:16.620 --> 53:21.180]  I was like, well, no, i'm not a programmer and I was like, oh really? I thought you were there last year
[53:22.140 --> 53:26.860]  And i'm like, okay if people are assuming that I should be going and I was there and they just missed me
[53:26.860 --> 53:30.300]  So I went and I had more fun than could possibly be imagined
[53:31.180 --> 53:33.580]  But what was most amazing about it
[53:34.380 --> 53:36.380]  was
[53:36.620 --> 53:38.620]  The level of creativity
[53:39.420 --> 53:47.020]  That came out of the best programmers in the macintosh world sitting in a hotel lobby for 72 hours drinking jolt cola
[53:48.380 --> 53:55.980]  So for people in programming non-stop, so for people who don't remember just give the the high level overview of what mac hack was
[53:55.980 --> 54:02.540]  So mac hack. It was a programmer's conference and so only for developers and it dates way back
[54:02.540 --> 54:08.540]  I don't actually quite remember when the first ones were probably in the 80s late 80s. If not, uh, if not before
[54:09.180 --> 54:15.980]  And it happened in dearborn, michigan in a uh in a holiday inn. I think it was a holiday
[54:15.980 --> 54:17.500]  I just love it and
[54:17.500 --> 54:24.220]  Well, but the point was that there was nothing else to do right right you went to this holiday
[54:24.220 --> 54:29.260]  And it had a great lobby and then everyone would sit around the entire time
[54:29.820 --> 54:35.260]  in this big lobby and at tables with lots of power bricks and everything and and
[54:35.660 --> 54:37.100]  you know chatting and
[54:37.100 --> 54:42.700]  Just dusting about the best ways to do things and hack this and you know what you could do to get into the system this
[54:42.700 --> 54:47.180]  Way and that and everyone was developing the hacks
[54:47.740 --> 54:50.780]  Which were just to demonstrate
[54:50.780 --> 54:55.660]  Interesting facts or techniques or something that this programmer knew
[54:56.620 --> 55:03.100]  And they weren't meant to be useful. And in fact when you demoed it if it was useful the audience would derisively yell useful at you
[55:04.620 --> 55:08.140]  If you and if you talked it up too much then they would yell marketing at you
[55:09.180 --> 55:11.820]  marketing was a dirty word, uh, and
[55:12.860 --> 55:16.460]  And this but it was it was just completely
[55:16.460 --> 55:22.060]  Developer centric and of its era. I mean the keynote on the first day started at midnight
[55:23.740 --> 55:24.940]  And
[55:24.940 --> 55:28.140]  People literally didn't sleep the entire time
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.460]  So I guess the idea the idea was everybody would fly into michigan and during the day
[55:35.180 --> 55:39.900]  Then you'd go there and dump your stuff. I don't even know did people even get hotel rooms? I guess
[55:40.460 --> 55:42.460]  Oh, it was everyone stayed in the hotel
[55:42.460 --> 55:46.860]  Right, but you never left the hotel and then by the time you'd like unpack and you know
[55:47.660 --> 55:50.460]  Then the conference just started that night. There you go. Yep
[55:50.860 --> 55:57.900]  Yep conference started and you would you would you program straight for 72 hours and then it culminated with the the presentation of the hacks
[55:58.540 --> 55:59.340]  and
[55:59.340 --> 56:05.500]  Scott boyd and some of the other blue meanies from apple or uh the people who ran the mac hack mac hacks contest
[56:06.220 --> 56:08.380]  And they would come up with these wonderful
[56:08.380 --> 56:13.820]  Um, and the best one was um a victor a trap mousetrap
[56:14.780 --> 56:16.780]  Because a traps were
[56:16.860 --> 56:20.220]  Something in programming. I don't even remember if I knew that
[56:20.860 --> 56:26.540]  And so it was it was if you won the the victor a trap that was a badge of honor
[56:27.100 --> 56:31.340]  And and showed that you you were you know, like the best of the best
[56:31.820 --> 56:35.660]  But the things that came out of here were the ones that were the best of the best
[56:35.660 --> 56:39.420]  The best of the best but the things that came out of here out of that, you know
[56:40.140 --> 56:45.340]  Um, we had in the energizer bunny, you know where someone actually programmed something to jump
[56:45.660 --> 56:51.580]  It was a little the energizer bunny beating his little drum walking from macintosh to macintosh over the network
[56:53.980 --> 56:58.140]  You know, that's where oscar the grouch came from when you threw something away in the trash the grouch came out
[56:58.220 --> 57:04.460]  Was that really a mac hack? I didn't know that i've talked about the grouch extension many. I probably was pretty sure it was eric
[57:04.460 --> 57:06.060]  Shapiro. Yeah
[57:06.060 --> 57:11.980]  And um, uh, let's see then. Oh, john gato who still does um default folder 10
[57:12.220 --> 57:14.460]  Um still around still still programming great stuff
[57:15.020 --> 57:21.740]  He broke his his his powerbook screen on the way to the conference one year, but didn't completely break it
[57:21.980 --> 57:25.420]  So it was like just the upper triangle out of the upper corner broke
[57:26.140 --> 57:30.860]  And he somehow rewrote the video driver to map out those pixels
[57:30.860 --> 57:32.860]  Yes
[57:32.860 --> 57:36.220]  So it was a fully functional screen with just like a chunk taken out of it
[57:36.220 --> 57:39.340]  But you didn't miss anything behind there because I didn't know those pixels existed anymore
[57:40.700 --> 57:47.040]  And someone someone figured out how to do a firewire virus where all you had to do was plug into firewire
[57:47.580 --> 57:49.580]  And and you would be infected
[57:49.900 --> 57:53.020]  Um stewart shasher did the first wi-fi
[57:53.660 --> 57:54.540]  um
[57:54.540 --> 57:59.900]  Uh scanner so he actually he pulls up his his app in the demonstration, you know in the program
[57:59.900 --> 58:05.100]  He's got we got wi-fi at this point. Um, this is a little later and he pulls it up pulls it up and it starts
[58:05.820 --> 58:10.140]  Showing on screen all the images from the web pages people in the audience are loading
[58:11.980 --> 58:14.060]  Because it was unprotected wap at the time
[58:15.180 --> 58:16.620]  so as it just
[58:16.620 --> 58:19.100]  amazing stuff and a lot of it really was proof of concept of
[58:19.740 --> 58:20.860]  We think this is a problem
[58:20.860 --> 58:25.420]  I've got 72 hours to explore and i've got the people who know more about this including
[58:25.420 --> 58:31.100]  the developers of the operating system a lot of the times a lot of apple people went stewart shasher among other things it had
[58:31.180 --> 58:37.740]  Invented bonjour networking, which we still we don't even really talk about it anymore, but it's still yeah, it's just there
[58:38.780 --> 58:43.980]  It just works. So right so you had you had access to the smartest people in the community
[58:44.460 --> 58:46.860]  And so you and you'd have an idea and you're like, you know
[58:46.860 --> 58:50.780]  You could go over and talk to this person or that person if you got stuck, right?
[58:50.780 --> 58:57.340]  And everyone just helped everyone else and you know, and and so and you know half the stuff barely worked
[58:57.340 --> 58:59.260]  I mean you just had to get it working enough to demo it
[58:59.580 --> 59:03.900]  It was never meant to be a product almost nothing ever shipped out of mac hack
[59:04.220 --> 59:10.860]  That wasn't the point the point was just to this was your time to to experiment and to explore and you know
[59:11.500 --> 59:12.940]  as
[59:12.940 --> 59:14.940]  As a as a writer
[59:15.180 --> 59:19.100]  It was it was the ultimate time because you could talk to everybody
[59:19.100 --> 59:22.080]  Everybody you could just sit and hang out in these conversations
[59:22.620 --> 59:24.620]  and and learn
[59:25.180 --> 59:29.260]  More about what was going on in the in the macintosh world than any other way
[59:29.660 --> 59:35.340]  It's incredible. Well, I I always wanted to go it it was always sort of out of my budget
[59:36.140 --> 59:41.340]  Slash too young and just never got around but I remember when you started going
[59:41.980 --> 59:43.980]  And I remember you sort of you know
[59:44.300 --> 59:45.740]  telling
[59:45.740 --> 59:49.580]  Putting it the same way you just did here where it was like you always thought it was for programmers and they're like
[59:49.580 --> 59:52.220]  No, you should come and then you started writing about it
[59:53.020 --> 59:59.340]  And it it suddenly became and it wasn't like it was a secret thing. It wasn't that nobody it wasn't that it hadn't been
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.660]  documented
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.420]  Because it wasn't it was secret
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:08.380]  It's just that there wasn't a writer who went and you know, you weren't going to patch any a-traps
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:13.420]  So you wrote about it and I just remember loving that I just remember appreciating it
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.540]  Like i'd heard of mac hack kind of knew the gist of it
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.500]  but then once you started writing about it, it was like
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.180]  You know
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:25.180]  All of a sudden you are there like any, you know good journalism. Yeah
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:34.060]  Yeah, and it was it was so wonderful also to really meet the people because we had email back then
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.100]  but it really was email and private mailing lists and things like that and
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:44.140]  You know, you didn't have the immediacy of social media of twitter or facebook of even chat
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.740]  People did IRC a little bit but not so much and that wasn't where the good stuff happened
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.420]  And so you'd know these people
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:57.100]  But you really didn't get a chance to meet them a lot of the time until you went to something like mac hack or mac
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:02.800]  World, I mean, you know, that's kind of where i've met, you know, a lot of the people who i've become friends with subsequently
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.060]  and you know you just
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.780]  You know, you just you you could actually spend
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.860]  Real time with them. Yeah, you know, it wasn't even like mac world was great, but mac world was more like meet and greet
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.580]  Mac hack it was sit down and you know talk for an hour. Yeah
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.420]  All right. Let me take a break here. Thank our second sponsor. It's our good friends at feels fea

[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.580]  All right. Let's go back to tidbits. Um
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:06.940]  But I you know, we've set the stage, you know, it's the early go-go years the 90s of the internet
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.700]  One of the things I have all I always found
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.140]  Interesting right away. I mean tidbits grab my attention
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:22.300]  And truly, I mean, I don't even know what else, you know, the only other thing I could really think of as an inspiration before
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.860]  during fireball
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.220]  Would be uh, matt deathridge's mdj
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.100]  mdj mwj, uh as
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:35.580]  online publications that weren't like
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.980]  And i'm not putting down the
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:46.800]  The idea of blogging certainly there were hundreds and hundreds of good good blogs before daring fireball started in 2002
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:53.020]  But there weren't any that seemed like this is what somebody wants
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:59.580]  You know, this is a this is meant to stand toe to toe with any publication in terms of its
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.740]  editorial merit
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.100]  integrity
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.220]  Usefulness any good adjectives you can throw at it and the thing about tidbits that was really interesting
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.820]  And the thing about tidbits that was just like a thunderbolt to me
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.460]  as a college student in the early 90s was
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.300]  This is a hundred percent serious like and it wasn't pretentious
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:24.940]  It was always, you know, you know the writing style the editorial voice is consistent through to today
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.540]  It was from the user's perspective, right? It was very much
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:37.340]  Always, you know, we're all in this together. We're like you we're just writing this but it never felt like oh tidbits is just
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.060]  You know adam and tanya angst trying to get jobs at macworld, you know
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.940]  And then they'll then they'll go to macworld and tidbits will go away
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.380]  Yeah
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.100]  It's an interesting realization. I sometimes
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.980]  consider this in terms of you know, like
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.420]  Tanya and I are very much, you know gen x
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.820]  and
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:05.980]  We're kind of the bottom of the population curve and we got out of college at a time when the economy wasn't doing so well
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:11.740]  And I think there's a little bit of I don't inferiority complex isn't quite the right term
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:16.140]  But we felt we needed to seem professional
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:22.460]  We knew we were faking it, right? I mean, you know, I started tidbits when I was what 23
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.820]  So, you know, I was faking it like crazy
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.580]  but
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:33.580]  It was definitely one of those things where you tried as hard as you could
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:38.220]  To emulate the big boys, you know, the macworlds the macweeks whatnot
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.340]  And it turned out you could do that. That was merely work
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.460]  I mean you you could learn how to write well and you know and do those things
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.620]  I didn't like I don't have a I don't have a degree in journalism
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:55.580]  You know, I didn't I didn't have any training in this on my degrees in hypertextual fiction and classics for goodness sake
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.180]  so
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.700]  it was
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:04.940]  It was a learning curve, I think but one where we knew what we were going for
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:12.080]  I but but it was yeah, it was clearly aimed to be at the standards
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:19.020]  Of like the big boys, but it in no way emulated the format, you know, it wasn't monthly
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.940]  It was weekly
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:26.860]  and it was you know, and then there was macweek which was weekly but was very much in and of the trade industry and
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:31.740]  And tidbits was very much not you know, it was clearly meant
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:37.020]  It was egalitarian and meant for everybody. I mean I joked about how hard it was to read
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.620]  uh
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.180]  Mac week
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:44.400]  But it really was and whereas you guys you just said like part of the reason you switched from hypertext
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.220]  To the plaintext ctext was to get make it as easy as possible
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:53.120]  Literally, like you went you you did everything you possibly could to make it as easy as possible
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:58.000]  for anybody who might want tidbits to get it and read it and who might
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.480]  Want it but has never heard of it to discover it
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.440]  And that was the same reason why we uploaded to all the commercial services
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.520]  Either and encouraged people to spread it further, you know in terms of bulletin boards or whatever
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:17.360]  You know tidbits has always been free and as always we've always really wanted people to read
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.840]  You know, that's what it's about
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.280]  and so, you know and not about trying to
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.720]  To to narrow it down or have a paywall or make portions of it available anything like that
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.560]  and
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.080]  And I really liked that that aspect of it the the one thing that I do remember
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.680]  getting criticized for this was actually more with the internet starter kit, um than tidbit specifically, but
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.240]  We wrote from the first person and we wrote active voice
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.560]  and
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:56.720]  That was actually pretty unusual at the time that tech writing was was was often third person passive voice
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.440]  Um back then but of course, it's horrible to read
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.480]  And not having a journalism degree or not having any any background in this
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:12.960]  I wrote what I knew and what I knew was in my voice. So I think that that I think people identified with that
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:20.560]  That you could easily put yourself into that eye. Yeah, and and it came it and that's what always made it so compelling to me
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.600]  And again, there's a place for the other styles and of course, you know
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.960]  Mac world was always a little bit more buttoned up and mac user a little bit more buttoned down
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:39.360]  And I think that you know as somebody who was a voracious reader of both
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.560]  I feel like the people I know who were involved in them
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.640]  I saw that a little bit more closely than those of us on the outside even though i'm a very I was a very close
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.080]  Reader of both but the people who were in the game at the time
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:09:00.400]  Really saw that you know that the mac world saw themselves as more serious like the new yorker of the monthly mac magazines and
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.440]  Mac user was a little more people magazine
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:10.960]  And eventually then we got mac addict which took it even further right right, you know into the gonzo journalism so to speak right and you know
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.480]  and I think as the years went on it blurred because people jumped ship and I know
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:22.000]  I think I at least I think I know that jason snell started at mac user and then wound up running mac world and mac user went
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.880]  Away and it blurred but but like at the time
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.960]  Like and I can't think of anything that better exemplified it than the fact that andy and abby and andy
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.640]  And that goes column was in mac user and and it was uh,
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:42.640]  You know and andy style just andy couldn't have been andy in mac world. It just wouldn't you know, well
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:49.220]  And in fact the I remember in 1992 was the one I first was asked to write for one of the magazines
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:56.400]  And I got a column I had a column it was actually only very short-lived unfortunately not doing my fault fault of mine
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.480]  I was told but um, it was called beating the system and it was all about ways to kind of hack the system
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:10.400]  and with utilities and and whatnot stuff that would go under the hood and um, and I and it was mac user and they
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.640]  For whatever reason they sort of reorganized the book and uh and and canceled that column as part of it
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.000]  But I was mostly happy because I got the t-shirt
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.400]  As as having written, I don't know two or three of them before they it was only a few months
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.240]  Um, and I got the t-shirt and I love that. I still have it somewhere
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.080]  But again that you know, that was uh, that was what you did back then today you got the t-shirt and you were good
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.480]  I've told this i've told this story before I should I should have andy on the show and do his show with andy
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.240]  But i'll tell it here. But the first time my name ever appeared on the show
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:52.800]  with andy, but i'll tell it here, but the first time my name ever appeared in a in a macintosh magazine
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.800]  Was
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:00.160]  Was andy, I think andy was co-rope co-byline the column with bob levitis
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.000]  Uh, it was like the mac help column and they would answer your questions you'd answer, you know
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.600]  You'd you'd write in like hey i'm running out of space on my hard disk. What do I do?
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240]  and they and and it was always very
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:18.080]  you know, I don't know how the heck it worked because the lead time on magazines was like four or five months back then and so like
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.960]  Even if like you wrote your letter and it got to them and they read it right away and thought this is a great question
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.560]  And they answered it right away for their next upcoming column
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.880]  It was still gonna like the answer was going to show up like months later. Like if it happened as fast as possible
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.520]  and you know and
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:43.920]  Bob and andy I were good together, but you know andy's style appealed to me more. I mean because he was just so
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.680]  Just odd, you know just crazy
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.640]  And so I I wrote a letter
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.920]  I wrote a letter and it had nothing to do with with
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:02.100]  Macintosh, I just wrote who would win in a fight the millennium falcon or the starship enterprise
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.300]  John
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:10.900]  Gruber philadelphia and I my honest expectation was that maybe andy would see it. I didn't know him
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.580]  You know, but I was just a fan. I thought maybe he'll see it and it'll crack a smile
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.860]  I hope it cracks a smile. I might even have like a ps. I love your call
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:21.300]  You know, I love your column, you know love and then like five months later
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:26.740]  I'm like reading mac user and there it is. I I had no idea they never called to confirm or anything like that
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:31.540]  I'd actually forgotten that I sent it in. I think I actually sent like a paper letter to do it
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:36.020]  I'm just flipping through mac user and there's my question and andy went into d
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.620]  I actually don't remember the answer
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:42.420]  So anybody out there who who has a stash of old mac users take a look and if you can find it
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.780]  I'll give you I don't know what i'll give you but i'll give you something
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:52.660]  but he took it seriously and just and it's just in the middle of like, you know, recommending now utilities to solve this and
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:58.980]  you know telling you how to set up style sheets and and you know page maker to to get around that and
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:05.620]  You know all of these actual answers to actual questions and in the middle of the column was andy going off about a star wars
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:12.500]  Spaceship versus a star trek spaceship and who would win and I I loved it which he must have just enjoyed so much
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:16.420]  I don't know. It was knowing andy. It was crazy and I gotta say like the
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.820]  Dope, even though it was just and it my my question was like eight eight words long
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.820]  But seeing my name in mac user was such a dopamine hit. I was like, ooh
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.820]  But you know what so
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:32.020]  One of the other things that was so striking you say you you like at cornell you you majored in the classics
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:36.980]  So one of the my favorite bylines in tidbits was matt newberg
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:43.620]  Oh who was my professor right of the classic? He was actually my greek. He was my greek professor
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:50.580]  I mean literally greek ancient greek like the real not the easy greek like going to greece now we're talking, you know
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:55.460]  Plato and socrates and and and archimedes and you know old school
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.860]  But also
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.060]  You know perhaps better known if you don't remember you don't know his byline from tidbits
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:11.060]  But you might as a listener of this show remember that he's written a fantastic. He's one of the greatest pro
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:15.700]  Not the greatest my favorite programming books ever written are matt's
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.980]  He wrote the apple script definitive guide
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.740]  Which if you want to do anything even to this day if you want to do anything in apple script
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.140]  If you don't if you don't own that book
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:33.220]  I don't know how you do it because apple script is such a bizarro weird language with
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.300]  Edges that can be bitten and matt somehow figured it all out
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:43.620]  All sorts of other books over the years, but well, in fact, it's actually it plays
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:48.260]  Into his strengths because he really he is a classist, right? So greek latin
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.620]  you know other languages as well and
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:56.660]  To give you an idea when I took a class with him the class I took was greek composition
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.020]  And so you're we were translating english
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.620]  25 sentences of english into greek every week, but this was a class for two people
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:12.020]  Me and another guy and matt wrote a textbook for us
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.540]  Because he wasn't happy with all of the other ones out there
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:22.420]  So you can see where he goes he takes that and then he moves it into other languages like apple script
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:30.500]  And now his ios programming books, I mean and swift and whatnot. So it's actually in some ways a really understandable path
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.540]  But you wouldn't have expected it at the time
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.620]  And you know and and he would have you know, well that was also one of the things I mean
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:45.940]  Just tidbits was a magnet for really good writers. I mean, that's where I got introduced to glenn fleischmann and
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.940]  Just there's a tidbit style and the the writers who were drawn to it were
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:59.300]  You know drawn to that sort of mindset, but their individual voice is always shown through
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.380]  And and one of the things that we tried to do
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:11.220]  That again may not be obvious in today's world is that magazines had hard word limits
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:19.140]  Yes, you were if you had a 600 word article you wrote 600 words or if you wrote more they just cut them
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.540]  Because they didn't have any more space
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.180]  It was physical space limitations
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.940]  And so one of the things that was interesting about tidbits is we did you know?
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:33.540]  For a while have that 30k limit, but we could just put out another issue right if we needed to I mean
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.260]  We didn't we weren't we weren't constrained in any real way
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:42.820]  And so one thing that I always told people was is you write what you need to write to explain
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.140]  The top the subject and I don't care how long it is
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:53.220]  Nowadays, I try to I try to rein people in a little bit because sometimes I feel like people can just keep going
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:58.020]  on and on and on but uh, but the overall
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.740]  the concept of being able to
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.660]  write to the comfortable length or the length of the
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:08.660]  subject needed was actually really unusual
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:13.220]  and and so yeah, there were people like matt and glenn and
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:17.140]  You know lex friedman, um wrote for us for a while
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.660]  And what a lot of people did is they wrote to us for a while
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.220]  for us for a while. Um, and what a
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.540]  For a while. I mean we were obviously been friends with jason forever and
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.660]  To an extent tidbits was seen as a farm team
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:35.780]  You know that someone would write for us and then i'd get email from jason saying, you know
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.420]  Hey is you know so-and-so's pitched an article or i'm looking for someone. Do you know someone?
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.700]  And i'd say well here you go tidbits can't pay them but you can so please do
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:49.940]  You know at the time we just had we had no money so we couldn't pay people but you know
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:55.220]  heaven was happy to write for free and sometimes it turned into serious careers for these people
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:18:02.580]  Yeah, definitely. Uh, I mean, you know and some of them are still, you know as much in the game as as ever, you know
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:07.140]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know glenn obviously going strong and you know
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.580]  and obviously we were at some point we managed to get our finances
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.580]  Changed around so that we could pay people because of course, you know
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.100]  because of course you want to be able to do that, um, and
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.900]  I don't I don't actually don't think it changed that much
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:25.620]  um, it was more that we had the same people writing but now we could pay them as opposed to uh,
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.340]  You know feeling feeling badly that we weren't
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.980]  One of the things that a lot of
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:40.820]  Well, I you know matt we just said has a bunch of great programming books under his belt
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.460]  you
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:47.140]  wrote the internet starter kit, which was a
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.860]  Sensation
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.420]  In the 90s. I mean I we really have to talk about it. I mean, I know it's 30 bits 30
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.460]  It's 30 years of tidbits, but the internet starter kit. Yeah
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:03.380]  It's hard to fathom how important a book could be but and it was more than a book because it came with a cd
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.540]  So it would have you know
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:13.940]  And first one was the floppy disk because you didn't have cd roms didn't have we weren't even up to cds
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.060]  So
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.060]  But that floppy disk was actually
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.100]  The key to the whole thing. Mm-hmm. And the reason for that was that
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.700]  We in 1993 when this book comes out
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.260]  There was a small amount of graphical internet software
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.380]  And so for this, you know internet
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:38.260]  Getting on the internet was a command line thing. You do it via a terminal of some sort and
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.140]  That was about the only thing you could download stuff you that we had, you know file transfer programs and whatnot
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.140]  but not much more than that and
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:53.300]  The graphical stuff required a tcp stack transmission control protocol is one of the core protocols of the internet
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.340]  And it came from apple only apple could make it
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.180]  But it cost 60 dollars
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:04.100]  And you couldn't just go to an apple store to buy it because there were no apple stores
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:10.900]  So an apple didn't like make it available via mac connection and mac warehouse and all of the mail order stores
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.780]  I mean, this is really hard stuff to get and it was 60 bucks
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:20.900]  So i'm i'm working on my book and my my acquisitions editor is a woman named karen whitehouse at hayden and karen was
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:27.220]  Amazing. She's one of those women who just doesn't take no for an answer which is kind of how I ended up writing the book
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:34.100]  She didn't I didn't say no, but I I didn't say yes instantly when she asked if i'd write the book but uh,
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:39.800]  So she asked what I want on the disc and I was like well, you know, it'd be great if you could get me mac tcp
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660]  something called um
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.940]  Uh mac slip, um from intercon software that was the thing that that
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:52.740]  Dialed your modem and would get me but it would instead of just giving you a terminal connection
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:58.900]  Mac slip would give you an ip address and your mac was on it as that was the ip part of tcp ip
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:06.340]  so you needed those two things and um, and then I was like, oh and you dora and fetch and
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.540]  I can't even remember if there was anything else in that first one. Um, so stuff it stuff it expand, right?
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.220]  You need to add head stuff because you couldn't you otherwise you couldn't couldn't expand it. Yeah
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.980]  So and so mac t so so I did totally didn't expect karen to do that
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:24.340]  I did totally didn't expect karen to be able to get mac tcp because it was
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:30.420]  Commercial serious commercial software and on the other stuff was either shareware or free software. Otherwise
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.100]  and
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:39.780]  She somehow talked apple into licensing mac tcp for five thousand dollars, which was a ton of money at the time
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:44.340]  But hayden had was in a funny situation. They were a new imprint of
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.620]  Oh gosh prentice hall or mcmillan one of the larger companies at the time. I can't remember
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:54.820]  and they were just told to get market share so they could spend money and so
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:02.260]  So karen goes and gets mac tcp and we put it on the disc and that makes it a complete system with one more thing
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:08.660]  which was that I was like, oh who are you gonna call and not ghostbusters, but um, the
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:14.420]  The you needed an isp and there weren't just isps at that point in time
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.700]  I mean there was like one in every city maybe if it was a big enough city seattle had one
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:26.680]  And the seattle isp was a company called northwest nexus and i've been working with them since I moved to seattle in 1991
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:31.140]  um, so i'd actually connected with another group that they'd merged with, um for
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.100]  You know sort of when you just shared internet connections
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:39.300]  And so I went to see them and I said, you know, hey i'm looking for an isp to do this
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.780]  Do you know of anyone I just assumed they wouldn't want to do it because this was going to be a national book
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.780]  if not an international book
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:49.220]  And the guy ed moran said that's a problem. We'd like to have
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.180]  I'm, like, oh, okay
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.100]  And so we ended up having all the software
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.540]  And a flat rate internet account
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:02.660]  Which was the first one?
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.660]  So before that you paid by the minute
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.780]  So the longer you stayed online you could see that racking up
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.660]  So you talk about 10 bucks an hour to call amy in pittsburgh
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.380]  Yeah, well that was the same thing with your internet connection
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:21.620]  Plus I mean actually it was worse than that because it was long-distance phone call possibly and the internet
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.860]  Yeah, the cost of the internet connection. So
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.780]  This was so popular. We actually had people calling
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.620]  Internationally from japan to seattle because it was cheaper than getting internet access in japan
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.420]  That's crazy. It was 30 bucks a month
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.940]  and so so yeah, so that book I mean
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:46.100]  You know, obviously you you do the best work you can i'd never written a book before I was just you know, I was like
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.660]  Giving people everyone giving everyone everything I knew and at that time it literally was everything
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.600]  There was to know about the internet and the macintosh
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.940]  And i'm pretty confident of that because we actually held the book for another week or two
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:06.580]  So I could get stuff about um, the first web browser mac ww in it and um and stuff like that
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.860]  And stuff like that. So that was just happening
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.740]  And so we were the fifth book about the internet rather than the fourth because of holding it for an extra couple of weeks
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.140]  So I could cover the web
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.100]  I remember reading it and I remember that
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740]  I was a uh
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:29.620]  Voracious enough mac nerd on the internet at the time that I knew just about all of it
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.700]  I definitely learned eudora stuff from you. I mean, how could you not? I mean nobody
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.500]  Only steve dorner knew more about eudora than you
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.340]  uh, so I definitely did learn stuff and or or or
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:46.740]  relearned stuff that I had forgotten but I just enjoyed reading it as the you know,
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.380]  It was like a reinforcement of encyclopedic knowledge, you know
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:55.940]  I I can completely confirm that it felt to me like this is everything you could possibly
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:02.740]  Possibly know about getting a macintosh onto the internet. Yeah, I I think the thing that's so crazy in hindsight
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:09.460]  It's so hard to remember and like you think like well how the hell could mac tcp be something apple tried to sell for
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.300]  $60
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.180]  it
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:15.320]  And it wasn't I don't think so much a proprietary
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.700]  money grab
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:23.300]  But just the way the industry had just grown up around, you know, like in the way it was clueless
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.140]  Yeah that pc floppies and mac floppies were different file formats
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.180]  So you couldn't put one even you know, you just couldn't put one into the other
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:36.260]  well, there were also different networking protocols and you might have a novell network if you had a bunch of pcs and you had
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:40.260]  A local talk network if you had a bunch of macs and that you know
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:46.820]  And and and there were just other proprietary things that you know token ring. I never saw one but I mean it's
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.760]  I remember reading about it and it was very expensive
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:56.020]  But you just networking was just one of these things where you'd have to like make an investment
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:02.900]  You know or file formats, you know what I mean? Like you'd have mac, right and somebody else had word and somebody else had nisus and
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.900]  none of the files
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.900]  could be interchanged and that was that and
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:13.380]  And and networking was like that and and even at first tcp networking was just sort of seen as another one
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:19.780]  Okay, nobody owns it. It's out there, you know, it's it's open source or we didn't even call it open source at the time
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:25.380]  But it was just seen as an alternative and so, you know the stacks from microsoft
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.420]  I mean were just commercial products like everything else
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.980]  Well, they were and they weren't actually at that point in time
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.060]  um
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.140]  TCP ip was mostly an academic thing
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:42.340]  And so in fact apple mostly site licensed it. Hmm
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:48.100]  So so if you were cornell, right? You got a site license to mac tcp and just gave it out to everybody
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.300]  And so that was what was kind of tricky about it was is
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:55.940]  is for most people you didn't even think about buying it because you just got it as
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.820]  At work if you were at the appropriate place
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:03.540]  and that's why it was so weird that they sold it for sixty dollars because
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:09.140]  no one could possibly need it if you weren't at a university or
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:13.300]  Possibly a big business, but most corporations really weren't doing this at this point
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:17.860]  So it was this really weird outlier product. Um, the the
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:22.040]  The the funny thing that happens is the book comes out in september of 1993
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060]  And I go to macworld in
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:31.780]  Uh, actually before this happens before I go to macworld in late december. I get a cease and desist letter from apple. Huh?
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.660]  And i'm like i'm freaking out
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:40.820]  This is apple legal like I mean apple legal who is known to be like you throw raw meat to the lawyers in the pit
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.580]  Kind of apple legal
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.580]  And so I am scared
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.320]  Witless by this, um, you know and they send it to me which is worse like if they send it to the publisher
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.760]  You know like and i'd heard about it. That would have been bad enough, but they sent it to me
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240]  And i'm like on the phone immediately
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.600]  um, and so
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.800]  You know when they publish this, you know, talks me down like we'll deal with this. Don't worry
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.560]  But they basically said that we had the wrong sort of license
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.680]  They didn't mean to they didn't you know that karen somehow sweet talked them into something they didn't mean
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:17.640]  and so i'm i'm i'm stressing about this for weeks over christmas and everything and then we go to macworld early january and I
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:23.880]  Meet up with a guy named gary hornbuckle who was the product manager for that entire division. Um at apple
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.840]  And as you know, I met him, I know just actually on the floor literally just ran into him
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:34.120]  He's like, oh adam, so nice to meet you and i'm i'm all worried right because they threatened to be sued
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.760]  and he's like, you know, and he's like
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:42.860]  Don't worry about the lawyers. I will I will deal with them. You have sold more copies of mac tcp
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400]  In three months than we have ever sold
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.800]  Because we've sold like 20 000 copies of the book in that first three months
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:57.480]  And so from I mean like from his perspective I was a gift like I had made his product popular
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.440]  Right like in a certain sense as the product manager and and clearly, you know, there were people
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:11.400]  It wasn't company-wide. It was like it was like a a a slice of apple that got the internet right away
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.480]  And you know clearly the team doing mac tcp was that group. They just wanted max to be on the internet
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.460]  Yeah, yeah, I mean because that was back in the days when ftp.apple.com
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.480]  Was a 2ci sitting under mark johnson's desk
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.880]  So, yeah, I mean it and he was in
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.400]  Dts, he was in developer technical support. He wasn't even in the networking division
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.360]  You know, I mean that was and he ran apple's ftp server
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.480]  So right, so I mean the internet was wasn't even on the radar of these companies
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:53.900]  I mean, it's fascinating because the guy who um introduced the internet to microsoft. Um, steve sonovski
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:30:01.100]  He was actually tanya's ra at cornell resident advisor. Uh, I did not know that. So, you know, huh? Yes
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:04.160]  Yes, we've known steve sonovski since 1985
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:12.860]  But he goes back to cornell he's he's working as bill gates his like personal assistant he goes back to cornell
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:17.740]  And sees what cornell is doing with with tcp now tcp ip networking
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:24.700]  And including at that point. See you see me, which is the first video conferencing. I remember the postage stamp size postage stamps
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.580]  Um, and he writes the memo
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:35.100]  To bill that that starts microsoft down the path of the internet. I've actually got a co I've never seen it until quite recently
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:40.700]  In fact, i've got a copy of it and it's just fascinating because I can see him like walking around campus
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:47.100]  Talking to these different peoples like oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, because when he left he I mean he was he was obviously older
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:53.900]  He was on his ra so he must have left in like 86 or 87. It was before that stuff had really hit
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.340]  So it wasn't until he comes back. I think it was on a recruiting trip
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:05.180]  Um, and he sees what it's happened at cornell and he's like microsoft has to go here, right and then and and and and
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:10.380]  Eventually ran up ran up running all of windows for microsoft. Yeah, right
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:18.460]  Yeah, that got him somewhere I guess so so yeah, so it's been a it's it's it's really hard to remember just how
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:26.060]  Difficult it was for people to to wrap their heads around this stuff. Yeah, it really it really was
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580]  Um

[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:49.320]  Uh, all right, somehow we've got to cover like 20 years of tidbits history in the last
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.280]  It is
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.440]  Daunting sometimes when I think back about just how long i've been doing this because I never started with this intent
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.840]  It wasn't like oh, this is gonna be my career. It was just this thing which I did
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.240]  Where what what's the point? Here's my question
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.680]  What's the point where was there a point in high or in hindsight?
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.320]  Does it seem like there's a point like what's the point where it felt like?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.320]  Hey, this is here to stay
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Well
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.600]  Probably in some sense it it
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.760]  Became real to me. In fact when we moved to seattle so in
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.800]  in 1991
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.840]  tanya got a job at microsoft supporting microsoft word and
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:43.480]  And the so we moved from ithaca to seattle and I had been doing apple consulting
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.520]  Mac consulting say apple now, but it was all mac. There was nothing else
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:53.400]  Doing mac consulting in ithaca and suddenly I knew no one, you know, it's a completely different area
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.680]  And there's probably a lot more business there if I'd had the context, but I was completely completely at sea
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:04.440]  And so I basically just kind of doubled down on tidbits and that was what I did
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440]  And so that was when we started
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.680]  We started our sponsorship program. In fact, that was the first advertising on the internet
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:19.720]  And I don't know google has yet to say thank you. So well, let me say thank you. I thank you
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.320]  I'm glad you you can earn a living now that we have advertising on the internet
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:31.320]  But but yeah back in in in 1991 1982 that that era we had the acceptable use policy
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:38.840]  Because we're still moving kind of off of the arpanet and you know who national science foundation was sort of in charge of stuff
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.680]  And this national science foundation acceptable use policy said you can't do
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.800]  Commerce on the internet and it wasn't really quite clear what that meant
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.840]  It was actually another guy who's still around brad templeton had done
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:59.080]  Actually a commercial service called clarinet that had syndicated content like, you know, dave barry collard
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:06.280]  You had to pay for that and that was on usenet but uh, but tidbits was the absolute first advertising on the internet and um,
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920]  and I think that was when it
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.760]  I don't want to say sunk in that it was real. But when I was like, okay
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.400]  You know now I have to do this like this is how I earn a living
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.680]  and
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.720]  That really you know that that that that made the difference and keep in mind
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:31.160]  It's not all that much longer that I write internet starter kit for macintosh which sold some insane number
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.880]  I don't know five six hundred thousand copies over over three or four years. So
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  That changed things in many ways even more
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.000]  but
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.440]  I was always really clear about how tidbits had to keep going because tidbits was the only reason why I
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.680]  Got to do the internet starter kit
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.760]  And you know fast forwarding a bunch of years tidbits is the only reason why
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.720]  Our take control book series was was was successful, right? So
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:02.360]  So i've always kept tidbits as like this is my foundation. This is what I work from
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.320]  and you know, it's
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360]  It's it's not it's um
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.560]  It's not conceivable. Like I don't know what life would be like if I didn't have a monday deadline to put up an issue
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.880]  I've done it 1510 weeks now or something like that. So
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.960]  You know, it's just it's just who I am. Well that gets to the sort of
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.920]  to me the the defining transition is
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200]  To a website and
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.160]  And I got hung up on this
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.920]  for
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920]  many years
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.320]  uh, well define many at this point, but
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.840]  but uh, like I always say like I was at drexel from 91 to 96 and
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:54.040]  And the defining thing for me was my participation at the student newspaper where I went from a columnist
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:00.600]  To an editor and learned quark express and graphic design just really so that I could make my own columns look better and
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:06.600]  Then wound up being the editor in chief of the whole paper and we had a great little team at a school
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:12.200]  That had no journalism program at all. Everybody was from like mechanical engineering and but we you know
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.920]  Just absolutely terrific and people who went on to careers at you know
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.480]  Real publications like the wall street journal and the associated press and photographers who've gone on to win awards at newspapers
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.040]  It was a really neat little team. Um
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.840]  But I got out of there in 96 and I knew I wanted to do stuff on the internet and when I got out of there
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.560]  In 96 and I knew I wanted to do stuff on the internet and wanted to make my own stuff
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.080]  but I couldn't figure out the format and I was too hung up on the idea of issues like and
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:50.680]  You know and it took a while for like the just let go of it, you know, like somehow it took me six years
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.600]  to get to
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:57.320]  There in fireball, you know, I just publish stuff when you come and think of it and tidbits does that
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:03.720]  It's not like you have to wait a week and only new stuff shows up at tidbits.com on mondays like so i'm curious
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.560]  how you made that transition because the early ones were
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:14.840]  Definitely issues, you know the hypercard stacks the the weekly ctext ones. It was once a week here it is
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.640]  30 kilobytes and
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.200]  And there's your issue and then you'd wait for the next issue to get more
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.240]  Yeah
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.240]  it's an interesting question and it's
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.680]  It's an it's it's an evolutionary process
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.720]  so
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.720]  I would say that it
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:42.520]  Gosh, I can't even say when it happened exactly because first we had the website that andy affleck made for us at dartmouth
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.360]  And then at some point we brought that quote unquote in house
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:53.480]  And in fact, it was hosted at glenn fleischman's point of presence company. He was running an internet provider at the time
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.840]  and
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.840]  um and on webstar
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:05.640]  But it was still that wasn't the source right that was just where the issues went after I finished them
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:13.800]  And then the next step actually was jeff duncan who was working with us for many years, um
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.880]  was was fiddling around with file maker and um
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:26.440]  Util I can't remember what they're called. They were like utilities that that allowed you to link file maker to a web server
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.760]  I remember that I don't remember what they were called either, but I I remember doing it at drexel
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.200]  I it was like one of the first
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  ways I made money in life
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.360]  was
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.400]  Yes
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.320]  And so so so he he he said oh, this is interesting I can I you know
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.320]  I just like he at some point sort of pops up. He's like, let me show you something and and
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:52.120]  It pops up. We talked on the phone every day because i've never had an office. It's always been run out of my house
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.160]  um, and and jeff was working at home too, and so
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.320]  um, he we would call we'd spend just hours on the phone and
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:04.680]  But he's like i'm going to show you something and so he went he showed me a website that he had built that was
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.440]  a live
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:11.240]  Searchable archive of everything we'd done which he had imported into file maker
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.400]  and so
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.400]  But at that point it was still
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.680]  Just importing the issues. I mean, so we sort of we sort of backed into this concept of a website
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.360]  And so only at some point quite a bit later and I can't really can't remember what I have to go back and look
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.880]  Did we come up with the idea that we had a website and we could post articles throughout the week?
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.200]  And then collect them into an issue
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.760]  And that's been our process
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.640]  For many many years now, um and that
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:46.440]  I'm, trying to think at some point glenn fleischmann wrote wrote our content management system was called the tidbits publishing system in pearl
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.400]  And it was it was wonderful did exactly what we wanted
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:53.160]  But it was also very brittle because it did exactly what we wanted and nothing else
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.320]  and but that was one of the concepts we had which was
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.240]  That you could publish and edit everything live
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.760]  But at some point you like push a button and it collects all the stuff that hasn't yet been published
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:13.320]  And and builds this email issue and it spit it out in different formats and things like that so we could we could post in different places
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.040]  and so we really did sort of
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.400]  Feel our way into what we have now
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:27.880]  Yeah, and you know every every publication that continues to have issues still does that I mean, you know
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.000]  You can still I believe it or not. You can go buy a printed copy of the new york times every day
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.480]  Yes, and my parents are unhappy about the sun not getting the sunday times right now
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.680]  howard stern had a funny bit where he
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.520]  Is his parents are obviously a bit older and his his dad?
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:51.960]  His dad is reading the new york times and howard stern is a famous germaphobe. He wants him to read it with the gloves on
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.520]  He's like god damn it howard. I'm not reading the new york times with gloves on
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.120]  I've always told my favorite star. It's a total aside, but I can't I I will never not tell this story is
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.040]  I was at starbucks
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.920]  At this point. I think I first told it on the show with glenn and glenn. Of course you when you get to the punchline
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.120]  Love it, but probably about four or five years ago at this point. Not too long ago, but four or five years
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.520]  I'm at starbucks. I'm waiting for my drink and
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.440]  You order and then you go over to the place where you wait and there's
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.680]  Two young women, I would I would guess, you know late college, you know, 21-ish two of them and
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.280]  It was a sunday
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.600]  and there was one of them had bought the new york times at the starbucks and
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.360]  She was explaining it to the other girl and the other young woman had obviously really wasn't familiar with the printed newspapers
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:51.160]  And she was like, wait, they they do this every day and then she goes well the sunday one is thicker
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.000]  But yes every single day and then the other the other young woman said why would they do that?
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.280]  And I was just so blown away I was like, you know what when you really think about it and you're like
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.440]  Yeah, you think about like how much goes into it. It's it is an insane amount of work
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:15.960]  and if you're you, you know, it's kind of crazy really why why would you put all that work into into having to make all your
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:22.280]  Text and graphics fit into print when you can just have it on the web where it doesn't matter right and and as successful as the times
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.600]  In particular, you know a couple of the newspapers have done a trend
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:32.760]  Terrific job in their their I wouldn't say anybody's thriving in today's literally today's media landscape
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:39.240]  with the with the quarantine and all the stuff that's going on but in general at the start of 2020 the new york times
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:46.200]  in the washington post in a wall street journal which 25 50 years ago were very well-regarded successful newspapers
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.280]  continued to thrive in the internet age, but they all had rocky transitions from the
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.900]  Today's paper to the hey, wait, we have an article at four in the afternoon
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520]  And it's really interesting
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:05.720]  To this day. It's a little awkward. So whenever apple announces something on a monday drives me up the wall
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.560]  Right because I feel like it has to be in the internet
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:16.040]  So I'm always interested in how something like tidbits which had that weekly mindset made the transition
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:20.680]  And and to this day, it's a little awkward. So
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.880]  Whenever apple announces something on a monday drives me up the wall, right?
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:30.760]  Because I feel like it has to be in the issue because otherwise it may it'll be on the website
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.760]  No question, but it'll wait a week
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.500]  And you know to get back to what we were talking about earlier with the email newsletters
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.120]  I mean we have about 24 000 subscribers now
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.120]  and
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.880]  I think
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.120]  The majority of them really see tidbits as a weekly newsletter
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.000]  Hmm, that's that's how they see it. They do not see it as a website and
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.800]  and you know
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:05.160]  Honestly, they've been with us for a long time. I mean we have people who've literally been subscribing for
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:12.460]  20 25 30 years. I mean the bulk of our subscribers actually came because of the internet starter kit in 1993 and 94
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.120]  so
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.880]  so there's
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.520]  That sense that yeah, we're still a little weird and old in that regard
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.600]  But it's also where my core is. Yeah
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.680]  And and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna disappoint them, you know that that these are people who
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.040]  That they've figured out how they want to read
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:36.980]  information and
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:43.320]  Email newsletters are hard to beat they've come around on the guitar, but it's you know for these people
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.440]  That's just the way it's always been and I mean we've actually had features on our website
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.320]  at various times over our history that would allow you to
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:00.920]  Get a back issue via email you could email it to yourself because people wanted it in their email
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.080]  I remember I remember when imdb was email you would
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:14.440]  You would send imdb an email with something like a query in the subject and then they would email you back
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:21.160]  With the information from the movies that the query and their subject had done and it was really useful
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.280]  I remember taking film classes in college and it was really useful
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.240]  Because it was like you didn't really have to keep notes on like the you know, some old, you know
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.840]  Like rear window alfred hitchcock, you know 1956 or whatever year it was
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.720]  Well, it was like that. You didn't have to keep notes. You had it. It was right there in your email, you know, there it is
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.800]  Yeah
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.600]  There was I mean that was in fact how our sponsorship stuff started. It was email autoresponders, right?
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:48.140]  You could send email to a particular address at tidbits.com
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:54.680]  And you would get you know, whatever you wanted back from that and needless to say this was before
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.480]  Spam, I mean literally before spam
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.600]  before they very
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.440]  Good
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.920]  Yeah, let me say this to wrap up and and this is a dangerous question
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720]  as with a wrap-up question
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:17.080]  But if we can do it concisely i'm curious as to your thoughts and and it's this what why apple
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.060]  Why why the focus on apple?
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.060]  Apple
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:34.620]  So in 1990 when we started this
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:43.020]  Tanya and I had been using max for a couple years at an se 30. I had built my own hard drive
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:45.820]  um, it's an se 30 so I had an I had a
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:51.340]  A 13 inch apple color display as a second monitor. I've had some second displays since the very beginning
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.220]  um
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.620]  It was
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.340]  The right topic
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:04.220]  That had a void that needed filling
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:07.500]  Um, and let me see if I can explain that
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.780]  Things happened on the internet back in those days
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.580]  because
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.940]  They needed to because they because there was a solution that did not yet exist
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:26.940]  And if you saw one of those and you could fill it you did
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:31.740]  And
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.100]  what I
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:38.220]  You know, I have this degree in hypertextual fiction and ancient greek and whatnot from cornell
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:44.220]  And I I loved it, but it was academic, you know, it was it was fun
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:50.780]  Um, I was under no I mean professor wanted me to apply for a melon fellowship and go to grad school and i'm like
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:56.380]  You know, I love this but it's not a career. You have to wait for people to die to get a job in this field
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.620]  and
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.620]  What I loved doing
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:02.780]  was
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:08.540]  playing around with the computer and not playing games on the computer but playing around with the computer and
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:12.860]  I mean res edit and f edit and you know
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:16.860]  Figuring out how things worked. I mean you talked about laser writers. I mean
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:22.780]  Laser writers could be controlled programmatically with postscript. It was a language
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.340]  and
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.340]  It was this incredible
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.060]  real world colossal cave
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:35.520]  Where all of these twisty little passages were just there to be explored
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:40.940]  And what I wanted to do was explore them and share that
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  Share that
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.420]  And
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.940]  it was I mean
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.780]  apple was just
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:49.820]  it was
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:52.780]  And I don't think I actually knew that much about the company at this point
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:58.140]  It was just this mac that was in front of me that I could get into in so many ways
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.580]  And and share what I could find
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.180]  And so that's I think why I mean
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.980]  That's that's sort of a longer
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:13.100]  More abstract answer the really short answer is that it was tanya's idea
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:19.660]  She was working at microcomputers and office systems at cornell the group that sold computers
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:26.380]  But this is also the group that sold copiers and fax machines and so her co-workers were not computer people
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:33.340]  They really had very little idea how to sell computers and and her her position was new technologies consultant
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:40.620]  And so she sold max and next machines and things like that and she was frustrated that her co-workers didn't really know
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:44.620]  Very much about what's going on in the industry. And so she decided that she was going to use her page maker skills
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:48.220]  Left over from being in the mac user group and being the newsletter editor
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:52.860]  To do a little newsletter for her co-workers about what was going on in the industry
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:57.420]  And so she comes home one day and tells me that she's had this idea and I was like, that's a great idea
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:59.820]  I'll help you do it again avoid to be filled
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:06.140]  but I want to put it in hypercard because hypercard was the coolest thing ever at that point in time and I just
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.660]  loved
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:10.540]  trying to figure out how to do stuff in it and
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:14.780]  The page maker print version lasted two weeks
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:22.060]  Before I don't even remember why it was it just was deemed too much work or they didn't appreciate it or whatever
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:26.780]  And the rest is history, but it was it was just
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:31.980]  What we want to do and and I and I mean maybe you've had this too, but it was something we could do together
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:36.380]  I mean like this was this is very much a joint effort
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.420]  I mean tanya
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:45.260]  Doesn't deal with the day-to-day of tidbits anymore except on the on the kind of the financial financial aspect of things
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:52.460]  But she certainly knows what's going on and I can talk to her about any article or any topic at any moment
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:57.180]  And she knows exactly what i'm talking about. And so just the ability to
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.580]  Share that with some be able to share that experience with someone
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.940]  Was unbeatable
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:11.260]  And you know, I I guess unusual I didn't know what was at the time because I was young it was all I knew but you know
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.500]  We we were just you know
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:16.300]  In it together the whole way
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:20.220]  Well, that's a good answer. Yeah, that's a good answer. Yeah, that's a good answer
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:27.180]  Well, that's a good answer. Uh, let's end it right there. That's fantastic. I thank you so much for your time
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.100]  Here's the 30 more years
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:33.420]  No pressure. All right, people have said that i'm like i'll be 82. Yeah, that's good
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:38.460]  Like I really don't know about 82. Although I have to say we have a tidbit reader who's 102 now
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.140]  so
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:42.140]  82 sounds like kind of easy
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.260]  uh, my thanks to our sponsors squarespace linode and feels and
[01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:50.080]  Uh, my thanks to adam angst at tidbits.com
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.580]  And uh, of course on twitter, what's your twitter handle?
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:58.940]  Uh at adam angst. All right. I'm adam angst just about everywhere. There's only one more of me on the internet
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.340]  Well, my thanks to you. I gotta go
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:16.860]  Uh, thanks. Adam. It's been wonderful. Uh anytime
