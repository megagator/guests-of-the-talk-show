[00:00.000 --> 00:11.320]  Did you hear something just go ping no good as the new set up working it's great it comes
[00:11.320 --> 00:18.520]  with all these dials see that's my old setup this is my old setup was just a mic and
[00:18.520 --> 00:22.920]  then add a USB and the USB goes in your computer and that is it there's there's nothing
[00:22.920 --> 00:39.080]  else yeah this one has here's the box right here it's an onyx black jack premium
[00:39.080 --> 00:45.960]  2x2 USB recording interface from Mackey and it's got a bunch of these dials and stuff
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.560]  you know looks serious I mean it makes me feel very professional it's a very nice piece
[00:50.560 --> 00:55.640]  of equipment but but now I've got all these dials to turn Marco told me how to set it up
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.080]  he just sent me a picture and just said just turn all the dials do this yeah so I did
[01:00.080 --> 01:10.840]  that all right man that thing wow really you're the one that's on Amazon yeah this is
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.320]  so many dials where this one six did like all of them this one has all of them no this
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.240]  one is looking at as like a hundred and twenty dollars no no this one is five five dials
[01:22.240 --> 01:30.720]  two inputs okay something for the monitor and then this looks like when you're bad your
[01:30.720 --> 01:37.920]  bad interfaces of the day a week or whatever it looks like it looks like an access database
[01:37.920 --> 01:44.720]  gone wrong are you sending it by Skype or are you sending it I see it I see it
[01:44.720 --> 01:54.680]  oh my god if that had shown up if I had just done what Marco said and this had shown
[01:54.680 --> 02:01.600]  up in my door I would have just yeah it would have been very cinematic it would have
[02:01.600 --> 02:04.640]  been one of those things where I would have opened you know you open the cardboard box
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.360]  from Amazon and then I would have seen this and then I would have just set the box down
[02:09.360 --> 02:16.960]  and I would have gotten my keys went into the ocean yeah just started driving just drive
[02:16.960 --> 02:23.280]  right to the Atlantic coast okay so you have the onyx blackjack two by two yeah yeah
[02:23.280 --> 02:29.600]  oh god if I got this I just that looks that's more manageable you know what though to me it
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.680]  looks like it might as well be this this well it's five more dials than you're used to have
[02:35.680 --> 02:40.960]  yeah it's five more dials than I can handle it's five times as complicated as what you're
[02:40.960 --> 02:48.720]  using before I'm tired I don't know if it's because I'm I'm getting older I don't know I think
[02:48.720 --> 02:52.080]  maybe it's a little bit of column A a little bit of column B like I don't think I've ever been
[02:52.080 --> 02:59.120]  very smart about dealing with complex interfaces but you know it's everything with the Apple
[02:59.120 --> 03:06.160]  music stuff you know and and and the iCloud photo librarian stuff I need I need it to be one dial
[03:06.160 --> 03:12.640]  I like right you know I like one dial right so I don't know but you say I sound good so we'll
[03:12.640 --> 03:17.600]  take it from yeah yeah no I think so what do I know yeah you've got crackerjack ears right
[03:18.800 --> 03:27.520]  right I am not no I've actually been struggling I bought a couple of Bluetooth
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.080]  headphones when I got the Apple watch yeah and I was gonna like write up a thing about it but I
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.320]  just I don't even feel like I can do it because I don't first of all there are neither one of them is
[03:38.320 --> 03:43.360]  good so which one to do I don't feel like I have a recommendation I got cheap ones I got really
[03:43.360 --> 03:46.400]  cheap ones and I feel like I and that's the other thing is I feel like I should try one that's like
[03:46.400 --> 03:53.600]  a hundred bucks because I got one so we're like thirty and they're terrible so it's like that's
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.520]  so far that's the only advice I have is don't buy one's or thirty which I don't feel like is
[03:57.520 --> 04:04.960]  great advice yeah I don't know if you remember I would when Joanna Stern was on a few weeks ago
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.480]  back in April we're talking about we both bought the same ones these beats ones which are
[04:08.480 --> 04:14.560]  overpriced I mean yeah great that's what I've heard too so I didn't want to buy those but it was
[04:14.560 --> 04:20.560]  work okay yeah I think so I spoke well the thing was is that we both were complaining about
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.120]  latency and then it was follow-up a week or two later some kind listener of the show was like
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.560]  dude you got to get the firmware update and I'm like firmware update for headphones I mean what the
[04:30.560 --> 04:34.480]  hell is that but it was honestly got truth you go to Beats Audio and you tell them you got the
[04:34.480 --> 04:41.680]  beats whatever they're called Bluetooth and then you get a download and once you got once I got
[04:41.680 --> 04:46.480]  the download and installed it it really did I wouldn't say it fixed the latency because I'm still
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.280]  you know I'm used to the zero latency of a wired headphone right but it's the latency after installing
[04:53.280 --> 04:59.200]  the software update on these on these beats was like what you would expect from Bluetooth headphones
[04:59.200 --> 05:06.240]  you know it's there's like a fraction of a second latency but it's reasonable yeah well one of
[05:06.240 --> 05:11.680]  these would not when was skipping and the other one the other one was and I wanted to run
[05:11.680 --> 05:20.880]  running and the other one was rattling so well I do think Marco tweeted the other day asked if
[05:20.880 --> 05:29.440]  anybody running iOS 9 beta is experiencing like some skips and fallouts with Bluetooth headphones
[05:29.440 --> 05:35.920]  and I hadn't really thought about it but I think I was I think I am and it's so it's it's like
[05:35.920 --> 05:41.680]  the beauty of you switching to Bluetooth headphones is that now you're susceptible to software bugs
[05:41.680 --> 05:47.600]  and regressions right like we've taken this we've taken this work complicated we've taken this
[05:47.600 --> 05:55.200]  thing that worked perfectly since before we were born right like 1970 whatever when we were born
[05:55.200 --> 06:00.000]  or you know for you 68 whatever the hell it is you know there were headphones you plugged them in
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.880]  and then you hear what you're supposed to hear and it works right until you step on the headphones
[06:04.880 --> 06:09.280]  there's something and now we've replaced it with something that when you upgrade your operating system
[06:09.280 --> 06:16.160]  maybe your headphones don't work so you know from where right you need a firmware update yeah you
[06:16.160 --> 06:23.520]  did you you must have had speakers with that big jack right yeah well headphones headphones I mean
[06:23.520 --> 06:29.200]  no well now I have a new pair that I'm wearing as we speak right now because oh they probably
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.840]  yeah this this thing has that big jack doesn't it yeah and so at Marco say hey right now
[06:33.840 --> 06:38.160]  Marco told me I had it you know he was like you have an adapter for that I'm like well I'm sure I do
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.320]  but God you know who the hell knows where it is and he goes well then you should get new headphones
[06:42.320 --> 06:49.200]  too so I got now I'm wearing a pair of Marco approved headphones as well well thanks to cleaning
[06:49.200 --> 06:56.240]  out my basement I know exactly where my adapter is really you you organize that stuff I saw it yeah
[06:56.240 --> 07:01.680]  it's one of those big coil you know it's a it's a long cable and it's one of those springy
[07:01.680 --> 07:06.800]  cables too so like I could I could I could walk around because you know back in the day you want
[07:06.800 --> 07:11.760]  to listen to music and walk around the room and do stuff and boy could I do that that was what
[07:11.760 --> 07:17.440]  that was that was Bluetooth headphones back then it was really really long cable because you
[07:17.440 --> 07:22.800]  couldn't move your stereo oh you still need to move around and it wasn't like you could put it
[07:22.800 --> 07:26.560]  in your pocket I mean that was like no I probably had I probably got that thing before
[07:26.560 --> 07:31.600]  you know I probably had that I probably had headphones for that kind of jack before there was
[07:31.600 --> 07:37.120]  before the walkman came out yeah yeah nice big fat headphones right so anyway yeah rather than buy
[07:37.120 --> 07:47.520]  a $2 adapter I bought that's $200 pair of headphones but but in my defense my my the headphones
[07:47.520 --> 07:53.280]  I had been wearing were they still work and so I can't say that they're you know somewhere
[07:53.280 --> 08:00.080]  my depression error grandparents are coming out of the grave to kill me but they still work but
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.960]  they they date back to to like when I was doing the show with Dan Benjamin I mean they're pretty
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.000]  old and the the leather on the the thing that goes over your head is all peeling all right I guess
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.440]  it's not even leather it's you know quote unquote leather yeah that is all happened to me right
[08:15.440 --> 08:19.920]  and so like every time I record a show now or until I got these new headphones that things are
[08:19.920 --> 08:23.280]  falling out of here well when I was done with the show the first thing I would do would be like
[08:23.280 --> 08:30.800]  to shake my shake my hair and get all the flakes of leather at out so I thought why not splurge
[08:30.800 --> 08:37.040]  and get a new shirt you're worth it you deserve it after how many years if I guess thing
[08:37.040 --> 08:44.960]  like a year two years oh well this show right this version of the show now this show is
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.360]  uh up gotta be up to three years now right because this is episode one twenty seven yeah yeah three
[08:51.360 --> 09:03.200]  years oh my god we're old everything's old uh so what else is going on uh so do you have uh well
[09:03.200 --> 09:08.240]  if you probably talked about music on like 20 other podcasts right now well you know what though
[09:08.240 --> 09:15.760]  we should talk about though I talked about it with Dowermple and and it was the day that Jim posted
[09:15.760 --> 09:22.960]  his well I lost forty seven hundred songs and then the show went into editing uh I think we're
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.840]  I don't know why but it wasn't gonna air for like four days and in the meantime you know he got called
[09:27.840 --> 09:32.880]  into apple and he wrote like a follow-up and he straight down and so you know it was his call but he
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.400]  you know he was like I'm gonna take some of the music stuff out because it's not relevant you know
[09:36.400 --> 09:41.680]  it's the danger of recording a podcast as opposed to live broadcasting I thought it was funny
[09:41.680 --> 09:44.720]  um but he took some of that out but we could that we should definitely talk about because I don't
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.880]  even know what the hell he took out but I mean have you what's your experience been like anything
[09:50.880 --> 09:56.080]  like his or I have hardly done anything with it that's the thing exactly yeah we were on vacation
[09:56.080 --> 10:01.120]  when it first came out and I signed up for it so who knows maybe my music has gone I don't know
[10:01.120 --> 10:10.320]  I haven't looked but I signed I signed up for it you know because it's free for a couple of months
[10:10.320 --> 10:16.480]  and I wanted to try the radio stuff out which is new to me I mean I'm you know I'm on the old
[10:16.480 --> 10:22.960]  guy who'd never tried the streaming stuff yeah I guess I've tried Spotify but it didn't really
[10:22.960 --> 10:30.560]  stick for me and I tried the radio but it's it I don't know I haven't really done anything it
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.680]  seems like all my music is still there but I am terribly confused though because I'm I'm another
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.280]  one of these people where I do pay for iTunes match I do have thousands of songs that I ripped
[10:41.280 --> 10:50.400]  from CDs but now I've got the Apple music right what about you yeah I mean well I didn't count
[10:50.400 --> 10:58.560]  my songs before I joined service so I have no I have no way of knowing if anything's missing or
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.360]  not actually as far as I can tell I mean other than going back and looking for specific songs
[11:03.360 --> 11:10.080]  which I'm not going to do so I have not I can't say that I've I've experienced any loss of things
[11:10.080 --> 11:18.480]  that I brought to the table and the funny thing is about Jim's post was that I had I mean I had
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.920]  used it and kind of liked it I mean I like listening to the curated playlists and I like
[11:23.920 --> 11:30.960]  listening to the radio stuff and then I kind of just forgot about it a little bit and and because
[11:30.960 --> 11:38.080]  that's kind of the way I've been using streaming services anyway is I'm I have these playlists
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.640]  that I make of music that I own and I usually end up listening to those and then when I get bored
[11:42.640 --> 11:48.640]  with those I will go out and do discovery through some streaming service basically just say okay
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.640]  there here are some songs that I like play me some other stuff that's like this stuff and then
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.600]  usually what I do is I go out and I buy this stuff that I like just because I'm 110 years old
[11:58.320 --> 12:04.240]  so I kind of like you know I'd gone into that other that phase again where I was just listening
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.440]  to things that I owned and then Jim's post reminded me oh yeah who music is out there and I
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.640]  went back and I tried it again and I still I mean I agree that the interface is kind of confusing
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.720]  like I really don't quite understand the differences between some of the tabs but I do like it
[12:20.720 --> 12:28.960]  for music discovery quite a bit I think the playlists are good and I generally find something that I
[12:28.960 --> 12:35.520]  want to keep anytime that I start listening to it for an extended period of time and then the
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.560]  other thing that I recently just tried which I hadn't tried the time before was picking a song
[12:40.560 --> 12:46.720]  and then saying to telling it to make a channel off that song which I think works really well
[12:46.720 --> 12:53.280]  so as far as for using it for music discovery I really kind of like it and then the other thing
[12:53.280 --> 12:59.520]  that I like about it is because I do so many playlists because I manage my playlists myself
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.520]  it will sync those through the cloud now so I don't have to sync back and forth between my phone
[13:06.240 --> 13:13.040]  and the Mac where my music is on to get the playlist on there yeah I don't I haven't done playlists
[13:13.040 --> 13:20.240]  and years really it's where you just what do you do you just pick songs that you want to listen to
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.440]  immediately yeah I don't know about most part I don't I don't really listen to a lot of music
[13:25.440 --> 13:34.320]  is the is the realization that I've come to it's not a service for you I am really looking forward
[13:34.320 --> 13:41.840]  to it I want to get it in my car somehow yeah I think I need like a new car I guess
[13:41.840 --> 13:45.520]  use that way you yeah because I have I mean I base because I have my phone on my car I
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.720]  I have it on my car yeah I well I can put my phone on my car but I can't really hook my phone
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.920]  up to my car okay well you just might just need a new stereo well yeah but on a
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.400]  when I bought a $200 pair of headphones but you don't necessarily have to go out and buy a new car
[14:02.400 --> 14:10.880]  again it'd be a lot easier to just buy a new car that had the had a lightning jack honey
[14:12.080 --> 14:15.840]  I need to get Apple music in the car so we're gonna have to buy a new car
[14:18.400 --> 14:19.920]  here's sign this
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.440]  cosline this lease with you
[14:23.440 --> 14:33.200]  oh cosine oh she's she's she's the only name on it but no thing on her
[14:39.920 --> 14:47.600]  I thought that the so you got your license back is what you're saying oh I did I got that back
[14:47.600 --> 14:56.080]  a couple years ago okay um I I I I think it's such an ambitious undertaking the whole Apple
[14:56.080 --> 15:04.480]  music thing and I totally understand the um I you know the the one foot on the shore one foot on
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.680]  the boat you know it's kind of hard to make this shift from being a download focus service that
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.960]  you don't want to just pull the plug on and that you still want to support so if people do just
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.440]  want to buy albums you can still do it to this new streaming thing you know I totally realize how
[15:21.440 --> 15:27.120]  complex this is um and I agree with you that on the content side I think they nailed it I think
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.320]  you know from everything I've heard people really like these stations you know the ones that are
[15:32.320 --> 15:39.120]  human curated people really like even like beats one yeah which exactly I don't I can't I can't bear
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.560]  I mean that to me that's like that was the whole purpose of this digital music process was to get
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.840]  away from that kind of thing like I don't want to hear somebody talking so that it's not for me
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.040]  but I'm kind of amazed that so many people seem to like it yeah I to me I think it's sort of
[15:56.160 --> 16:01.920]  trying to be what MTV was in the 80s yeah it's you know here's what everybody's listening to
[16:01.920 --> 16:07.360]  you know where everybody is people who care about new music but you know I mean like when we were
[16:07.360 --> 16:14.560]  in like in the 80s there was just one MTV that was it and like you know the top 10 countdown
[16:14.560 --> 16:20.160]  every day at five o'clock or whatever time it came on would play everything from Motley crew to
[16:20.160 --> 16:27.600]  Madonna to you know Lionel Richie you know there were it it wasn't really segregated by genres
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.840]  you know it was just here's popular music of everything from heavy metal to dance music or whatever
[16:33.840 --> 16:39.200]  you want to call it and you know here's what's new and I feel like that's sort of what they're
[16:39.200 --> 16:46.320]  trying to do with beats one yeah that's what seems like but on the flip side you know somebody
[16:46.320 --> 16:53.280]  has to make an app that presents all this and I do think it's kind of complicated yeah and the
[16:53.280 --> 16:57.200]  other complaints that I've heard from some people and you know maybe it's just the nature of the
[16:57.200 --> 17:04.800]  sort of people who like to read my stuff you know that it's picky people but the thing that seems
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.160]  to drive some people really crazy is that if you don't sign up for Apple music and you'd not
[17:10.160 --> 17:19.600]  even interested in it the new music app is like there's tabs that just don't apply to you anymore you
[17:19.600 --> 17:26.000]  know and the other thing I know that people have complained about is when you do sign up for Apple
[17:26.000 --> 17:34.800]  music it puts my music last in the tabs right and I thought that was sort of like a weird thing to
[17:34.800 --> 17:40.080]  complain about it's sort of like you know is the is the rightmost tab the least important tab I
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.480]  don't know but I brought that up to my wife and she Amy agreed she was like oh yeah that kind of
[17:44.480 --> 17:49.600]  to me she thought that implies you know that's the least important thing in the app whereas it's
[17:49.600 --> 17:54.640]  really like it might be you know depending on the size of your music library you might have like
[17:54.640 --> 18:01.040]  40 or 50 gigabytes of music and it's all stuffed into one tab in the lower right right yeah I mean the
[18:01.040 --> 18:07.280]  nice thing that one of the improvements that I found was going in and you can turn off connect
[18:08.400 --> 18:17.040]  in what is it's like restrictions I think because it's sort of a you know it's like the like you
[18:17.040 --> 18:20.560]  you don't want your kid you want your kid to have the iPod touch but you don't want your kid to
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.800]  see like musician swearing or something like that I don't I guess that's what that's for but you
[18:24.800 --> 18:29.600]  could turn off connect and then when you turn off connect it puts the playlist tab in the spot
[18:29.600 --> 18:35.280]  where connect is hmm so that was kind of nice that actually made it a lot better because since I
[18:36.000 --> 18:44.080]  you know use playlist so much and you don't really man if you don't really connect that often
[18:44.080 --> 18:51.200]  and I truly connect that often right I never leave the house so why would I need connect? I haven't
[18:51.200 --> 18:56.080]  really that's one of the things I haven't really heard anybody follow up on like is connect working
[18:56.080 --> 19:02.480]  is it is it are people using it is it taking off is it really just is it or is it is it
[19:02.480 --> 19:09.200]  ping all over again and nobody's using it or is it somewhere in between yeah I haven't seen anybody
[19:09.200 --> 19:16.400]  talk about it really no not since it came out it just it seems like it's just like kind of a
[19:16.400 --> 19:25.040]  blog for the artists in a way I mean they just seem to post where they are posts and pictures
[19:25.040 --> 19:34.160]  and maybe a little commentary but it I didn't find it very interesting or useful at this point
[19:34.160 --> 19:39.200]  anyway and they had stayed written something about like saying that they were you know they were
[19:39.200 --> 19:44.160]  going to bring more to it later but at this point that was not really it's just not the kind of
[19:44.160 --> 19:52.160]  thing that I'm interested in yeah so are you an iTunes match customer no I haven't been
[19:54.240 --> 19:59.840]  so I know that makes it better yeah I feel like that's the point I feel like that's the problem
[19:59.840 --> 20:05.600]  yeah or the perfect storm of the problem I don't know and it never worked that well I don't know
[20:05.600 --> 20:08.720]  I think I was to see this one of the things I don't know if it got cut but I'll just tell the story
[20:08.720 --> 20:13.840]  again where Amy where I tune I forget if you can even sign up for a family plan there but
[20:17.040 --> 20:22.960]  Amy has I don't know how many gigabytes of music but she's got enough music where it's like her
[20:22.960 --> 20:30.000]  total it's pretty big and it's like she could never sink her whole library to her phone unless
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.600]  otherwise it would fill up so she got the 128 gigabyte iPhone and now she can sink her whole
[20:37.600 --> 20:43.280]  library and have tons you know it's one of those things where like I think with the 64 gigabyte
[20:43.280 --> 20:50.240]  phone it combined with like a photo library and stuff it would be tight and with 128 then she has
[20:50.240 --> 20:55.200]  plenty of room including every single song she has in her iTunes library which is what she wants
[20:55.200 --> 20:58.640]  so that if she can you know gets into mood to listen to something she can listen to it
[21:00.480 --> 21:07.360]  and I don't know she's had like Jeffrey Zeldman luck with like cloud services it's like
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.040]  I would like set her up and it would say that you know she wants it all there she doesn't want to
[21:11.040 --> 21:15.280]  have to stream it she doesn't want the cloud you know icons she wants all of her music on the phone
[21:15.280 --> 21:20.960]  because she paid for the giant 128 gigabyte phone and it looks like it's all there and then it's
[21:20.960 --> 21:26.480]  there and then like you know a couple months ago she came back from the gym and she's mad at me
[21:26.480 --> 21:32.000]  not mad at how cool she's mad at me because all of her music is in the cloud and I'm like well
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.560]  that can't be and then I look at her music app and every single song is in the cloud
[21:37.840 --> 21:44.000]  and I can't explain it I don't understand so the way and I was that was before music
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.800]  yes before album music so the way I fixed it for her is I just turned her turned off I
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.240]  cloud match iTunes match whatever it's called and just hooked her up by a USB cable to
[21:54.240 --> 22:00.400]  remark and just synced it like the 2007 way you know just hooked her up to iTunes said sink all
[22:00.400 --> 22:07.120]  of the music all over playlists and I said I fixed your iTunes cloud and she said thank you and
[22:07.120 --> 22:11.040]  like she went and now she thinks that iTunes cloud works perfectly
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.720]  but wasn't it that wasn't the whole thing with match that you could just you would just sign
[22:16.720 --> 22:23.040]  up once and it would match your like previous catalog and then you know basically give
[22:23.040 --> 22:28.240]  you rights to everything that you got from Napster or whatever and then then you don't have to
[22:28.240 --> 22:32.880]  then you just can cancel your subscription after the you know for the second year you don't really
[22:32.880 --> 22:38.000]  need it unless you want it I mean so like in her situation she doesn't even want it in the cloud
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.880]  so she wouldn't really pass that first year have any need to have
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.680]  iTunes right but there was supposed to be a way that you could just say but I also want all
[22:45.680 --> 22:51.280]  my music on the device you know yeah yeah I don't want to have to pull it down by right onto man
[22:51.280 --> 22:55.120]  but anyway and then that is definitely currently the one thing that I find
[22:55.120 --> 22:59.520]  completely fiddly and I don't quite understand yet is because I like having it all in the
[22:59.520 --> 23:04.640]  device too partially because I have a sonos and I want to play and I want to play something on
[23:04.640 --> 23:10.080]  a sonos it has to be on the device at least until they get Apple music which they said they're
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.560]  going to be doing but if I want to play something on the sonos it has to be online
[23:15.760 --> 23:20.640]  my phone right oh yeah I have to have something I have to have it physically some place in order
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.560]  to play it obviously I can't play it from Apple's cloud because someone still doesn't know
[23:24.560 --> 23:32.400]  anything about Apple's cloud so and just trying to to do that often would be fuddles me
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.840]  but I think it's gotten a little bit easier with an update they recently did because I think
[23:35.840 --> 23:39.840]  and maybe I just it was there before and I just missed it but now you can go into
[23:41.040 --> 23:46.400]  like a playlist and just say make this entire playlist available offline
[23:48.480 --> 23:54.480]  yeah I don't know and it should download all the music so my suggestion my suggestion
[23:54.480 --> 23:59.520]  and it was just a flippant offhand and you know I you know maybe I'm just waving my hands here
[23:59.520 --> 24:05.440]  and there's good reasons for it but my suggestion that I tossed out there is why not make it an all-new
[24:05.440 --> 24:10.640]  app just have an Apple music app and then if you sign up for Apple music you use the Apple
[24:10.640 --> 24:17.680]  music app and it streams all the radio and it the thing I'm thinking just loosely maybe I'm
[24:17.680 --> 24:22.400]  you know being stupid somehow maybe I'm overlooking something and yes if you have an iTunes
[24:22.400 --> 24:27.520]  library of songs that you already own that app could just see those songs and show them to you
[24:27.520 --> 24:33.760]  but it would never try to like delete them or do anything magic with them and then you'd have
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.480]  two apps and then if you don't want Apple music you could just keep using iTunes which would
[24:38.480 --> 24:44.480]  play your music and then iTunes could be iTunes and then Apple music could be this app that
[24:44.480 --> 24:53.840]  much like the new photos for Mac app is like a clean slate both in terms of like the interface
[24:53.840 --> 25:01.280]  it presents and in terms of the online syncing stuff that it's supposed to do and there were a
[25:01.280 --> 25:07.120]  bunch of people like reactions you know a lot of the stuff I write often gets polarized reactions
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.800]  but this was so completely polarized it blew me away where like it seemed like half the people
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.520]  responding to that were like yes exactly you know this is exactly what Apple should have done and
[25:17.520 --> 25:23.760]  the other half were you're an idiot you're completely missing the fact that the entire but here's
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.000]  which funny I kind of agree with both sides obviously I agree inside that says this sounds like an
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.920]  interesting idea and the people who say I'm an idiot which is like half the the reaction we're
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.280]  saying the entire point of this is to have all of your music in one app you know one what was the
[25:37.280 --> 25:46.480]  the slogan at WWC was one thought about music and I see the appeal of that but my my response to
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.800]  that response I guess is one thought about music sounds good it sounds like a good idea but I'm saying
[25:52.800 --> 25:59.120]  that if you look at the actual software especially iTunes on on Mac or I guess windows which is
[25:59.120 --> 26:05.840]  probably the same it it's it's just it's more complicated now than it ever has been and we've been
[26:05.840 --> 26:12.560]  complaining about how complicated it is for years at least since like the iPhone came out right I mean
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.640]  sometime around that era is when people started complaining that iTunes was getting you know
[26:18.640 --> 26:24.400]  had too much on its shoulders and now with Apple music in there too it's more than ever it's
[26:24.400 --> 26:32.240]  all of the store it still has you could still buy iOS apps in the iTunes so it's all the music
[26:32.240 --> 26:40.640]  store the entire iOS app store but not the Mac app store all of your music that you own and now
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.800]  it's got all of the Apple music stuff that you subscribe to it to me that's an awful lot that
[26:44.800 --> 26:55.440]  you're asking one app to do it seems like yeah yeah I mean it does seem like it it should be
[26:55.440 --> 27:02.080]  broken apart and it's easy to say that because we don't know any of the real reasons why it's
[27:02.080 --> 27:08.080]  actually one app particularly right but but at this point it's just right and I want to
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.640]  believe it's unwieldy right Marco mentioned it too in his post that you know that you
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.120]  it's easy to think of a lot of reasons why they didn't go that route why they made it fully
[27:17.120 --> 27:21.440]  considered it and decided not to go that route and I'm not saying they should have I'm just
[27:21.440 --> 27:27.360]  tossing this as an idea of maybe they could have and maybe things would be better the one thought
[27:27.360 --> 27:34.160]  that occurs to me about it is it might have taken a lot longer I mean look how long photos from
[27:34.160 --> 27:40.640]  Mac took it was announced at WWDC last year and they even said when they announced it it would
[27:40.640 --> 27:47.520]  be early 2015 I think they said early 2015 or at least they said it's you know not coming soon
[27:48.560 --> 27:53.520]  and it still didn't ship it didn't come out of beta until like April or May I mean it was very
[27:53.520 --> 28:01.120]  close to a year after they announced it at WWDC 2014 before photos from Mac shipped not as a beta
[28:01.120 --> 28:10.160]  for Mac it absolutely takes longer to start over even if your goal is to have a simpler less complicated
[28:10.160 --> 28:16.480]  interface so maybe that's the main reason I don't know that it's always easier to just keep
[28:16.480 --> 28:25.520]  tacking on to iTunes then take the time to start something new yeah everyone's well you read one of
[28:25.520 --> 28:32.960]  these opinion pieces or someone says that apples the new Microsoft which I think is ridiculous but
[28:32.960 --> 28:38.640]  this is like one instance where I actually think it's kind of does apply in that iTunes does seem
[28:38.640 --> 28:46.240]  like it's just become so overburdened with added features that it's like office was back in the
[28:46.240 --> 28:54.480]  early 2000s well it is as a general rule the idea that you just keep tacking into this one app is
[28:54.480 --> 29:00.000]  sort of the Microsoft in loose you know general terms it's sort of a Microsoft way of doing things
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.200]  and not the Apple way of doing things yeah and they've never gotten they've never gotten rid of
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.240]  anything right I mean and just in the Apple it seems like you know we used to go through this
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.240]  through the throughout the 2000s where you know like by movie and things like that where they would
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.960]  take something and then just like blow it up and start all over again and you'd lose things
[29:18.960 --> 29:26.720]  but in you know often you'd end up with a better app and in this instance they just they don't
[29:26.720 --> 29:35.840]  seem to be doing that at all what about did they still have podcasts in iTunes I know on iOS
[29:35.840 --> 29:42.000]  that see that's another that's a perfect example right so on iOS they yeah so in iOS they they
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.600]  created an entirely separate podcast app and on the whole it's it's what matters anyway because I
[29:49.600 --> 29:55.360]  mean I know from the stats from this show that most people listen to podcasts on their phone or
[29:55.360 --> 30:00.560]  some kind of mobile device so it's you know make sense but it's crazy that on the desktop they
[30:00.560 --> 30:07.600]  still have podcasts in there too right it's in and maybe that's another sign of the Mac as a second
[30:07.600 --> 30:12.960]  class citizen iOS that they don't make a standalone can you tell what the client is can you tell
[30:12.960 --> 30:21.520]  what the biggest usage by client is yes yeah podcasts app or something else well for me it's
[30:21.520 --> 30:28.320]  overcast yeah right there's a little bit of selection by us there yeah without question it's
[30:28.320 --> 30:35.200]  because you know during during fireball readers and listeners of the show are way more likely to
[30:35.200 --> 30:42.400]  you know to even know I've heard of overcast let alone you know be smart enough to actually sign
[30:42.400 --> 30:50.960]  up for it and somebody sent me after I tweeted I think I tweeted that I tweeted that the stats
[30:53.600 --> 31:00.800]  that I get from soundcloud which is where I host the audio for this and they said that they're
[31:00.800 --> 31:06.720]  like the producer on like a general interest podcast seem pretty popular it's you know some like
[31:07.600 --> 31:16.160]  20 or 30,000 downloads per episode and for them overcast was way down I mean it wasn't even
[31:16.160 --> 31:21.680]  close because it was even it was even behind other iOS clients just because it hasn't been out
[31:21.680 --> 31:32.080]  as long but you know but I don't get it I'm trying to look it up here where's the stats it
[31:32.080 --> 31:39.520]  doesn't say podcast for iOS it's called like it's the background process that does the
[31:41.120 --> 31:47.600]  downloading oh okay so you probably can't tell if it's the difference between that
[31:47.600 --> 31:53.520]  apple core media yeah if it's the difference between that and like iTunes on a Mac
[31:54.160 --> 32:00.480]  well no you can tell my platform no but then it says so here's my here's my stats for
[32:01.200 --> 32:04.960]  the previous episode with Jason Snell episode 126
[32:08.960 --> 32:15.040]  so for the RSS version which is just about everybody overcast is 29,000
[32:15.040 --> 32:24.480]  apple core media iPhone which I take to mean the podcast app on iPhone this is about 17,000
[32:25.120 --> 32:29.680]  then there's iTunes which is 4500 and I think that's iTunes on the Mac
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.800]  Apple core media iPad so it's interesting I do get it set broken out between iPhone and iPad
[32:37.280 --> 32:44.800]  is 2700 Mozilla is 2400 and I think Mozilla means see this is where I have to guess
[32:44.800 --> 32:49.520]  I think it means anybody listens in any browser because you know how like every browser says that
[32:49.520 --> 32:57.120]  they're like Mozilla right because there's no freaking way that Mozilla would come the actual
[32:57.120 --> 33:07.040]  Mozilla would come in ahead of Safari and then downcast at a respectable 1900 pocketcast at 1700
[33:07.040 --> 33:14.880]  Instacast Castro and then way down at 200 poor old apple core media for iPod
[33:19.440 --> 33:26.640]  ah ah very sad not many and I think I would have said a year ago to joke that one of them
[33:26.640 --> 33:33.360]  was John Syracuse but now he's got an iPhone that's right now so I do have good stats like that
[33:33.360 --> 33:40.080]  that's interesting but to me it's crazy that they still stick I podcast in the iTunes
[33:41.520 --> 33:47.920]  I don't even know why yeah and I wonder if some of it is just about they feel like if they put
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.360]  it in a different app now that people are gone not open the other app but really for you know
[33:53.360 --> 33:59.040]  like a new service like music well and I guess and I guess it's so that there's you know I mean
[33:59.040 --> 34:04.560]  they're called I even tweet this or blog and I always forget but you know it's funny that we call
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.800]  them podcasts but nobody listens on iPods anymore everybody listens on iPhones and stuff
[34:12.080 --> 34:18.960]  but if you do listen to it on your iPod and it's not an iPod touch it's you know like an iPod
[34:18.960 --> 34:26.320]  iPod then I guess you still need to sync it from iTunes right so I guess I guess I understand why
[34:26.320 --> 34:30.880]  they haven't taken it out for people who need to sync to an iPod but for anybody who just wants to
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.640]  listen to it I really think it ought to be a standalone app even on the Mac that you know works just
[34:36.640 --> 34:48.160]  like the iOS podcast up yeah but what do I know maybe that's next yeah I don't know keep
[34:48.160 --> 35:02.720]  putting well that in the app store for the Apple TV someday they'll come all right let me take a
[35:02.720 --> 35:10.480]  break and thank our first sponsor it is our good friends at Casper Casper makes an obsessively
[35:10.480 --> 35:18.000]  engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price just the right sync just the right bounce the
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.080]  don't give you all these different types of mattresses to choose from they've got one type of
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.360]  technology they combine latex foam and memory foam they come together for one style of mattress
[35:30.240 --> 35:37.360]  and you're gonna sleep great on this thing free delivery painless returns and their mattresses
[35:37.360 --> 35:43.120]  are made right here in the USA right here in the USA here's the prices you've you know anything
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.320]  about shot if you if you shop for a mattress anytime in your adult life you know that it it's a
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.160]  there's no other word for it than a racket it's an absolute racket you go to like mattress USA
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.360]  or something like that and you shop the ceiling or whatever brand you want and you write them down
[35:59.360 --> 36:04.720]  you write down what they cost what the model names are you drive across town to you know mattress
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.120]  king or whatever the hell the next store is called and you look at the same brand and you look at
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.200]  the mattresses they all have different names and they so there's no way to compare they do this
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.000]  on purpose so that they it really is it's like a racket where each store gets their own like
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.280]  model names from the same manufacturer so that you can't price compare and all the prices are high
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.760]  anyway and they've got you know 11 mattresses set up that you're supposed to like lay on them in the
[36:29.760 --> 36:38.080]  retail store gross number one gross that's a good place it's a probably a very good way to get
[36:38.080 --> 36:45.360]  lies uh here's the prices from Casper and uh 500 bucks for two uh are not for two for twin size
[36:45.360 --> 36:51.360]  mattress 950 for a king size mattress and then in between twin and king or you know all the price
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.560]  points in between five hundred nine fifty nine hundred fifty dollars for a premium king size mattress
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.520]  is crazy you're never going to beat that at like retail mattress stores it's an outstanding price
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.640]  point for a great mattress here's the thing though you don't get to try it beforehand you don't
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.280]  even get to the you know sit on it or anything like that you got to trust it but here's the deal
[37:11.280 --> 37:20.640]  they have uh uh guaranteed i think it's like 40 days i don't know 100 days 100 day uh guaranteed
[37:20.640 --> 37:27.440]  so you buy this thing it shows up for free and and a vacuum packet in in this crazy box it's
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.880]  like the size of like a big big dorm room refrigerator shows up they give you a special tool you
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.040]  take it up to the bedroom where you want it you open this thing up and it makes a really cool
[37:37.040 --> 37:40.800]  sound and then it sucks up all the air and then all of a sudden you've got a mattress
[37:42.240 --> 37:46.080]  you've got a hundred days from that point to sleep on this thing and if you don't like it
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.880]  you just go to their website uh no hassle they did just go there you say i don't like this mattress
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.040]  give me my money back and then they take care of they send like a UPS guide to like get the
[37:57.040 --> 38:01.280]  mattress out of your house and that's it it's gone that's how sure they are that you're going to like
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.880]  it uh i i don't think anybody ever takes takes them up on it it's a great mattress they sent me
[38:06.880 --> 38:13.280]  one last year it's it's like brand new right now um so here's where you go to find out more you
[38:13.280 --> 38:17.680]  shop them for a mattress you cannot beat these guys uh the other cool thing i don't know how many of
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.080]  you guys live in New York but my understanding is that if you live in New York city they you can get
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.280]  this like same day and they bring it with like a guy straps it to his back and brings it to your
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.040]  house on a bicycle that's that's how crazy these the boxes are that these things are so it might
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.760]  be worth it to buy one of these just to see the guy show up with a mattress on his back uh
[38:39.760 --> 38:46.960]  here's the deal go to casper.com slash the talk show it used to be casper sleep.com they got a
[38:46.960 --> 38:55.600]  better domain they upgraded it's casper.com c-a-s-p-e-r.com slash the talk show and by using that code
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.120]  the talk show i think if you just go to the URL the coupons applied um otherwise just remember the
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.040]  coupon the talk show all one word and you'll save 50 bucks so they're already low prices you'll
[39:07.040 --> 39:12.320]  save 50 bucks uh terms and conditions apply i don't know what the terms and conditions are but
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.400]  it's a good deal and i know a lot of listeners have taken them up on this and i've gotten a lot
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.840]  of feedback from people who are like it really did sound crazy to buy a mattress from a podcast but
[39:21.840 --> 39:28.000]  i did and it was great so my thanks to casper one of the conditions is no ice yeah no ice
[39:30.640 --> 39:34.800]  nobody is ever nobody is ever late on this mattress before tea lights free
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.400]  uh how about the um because just the thing i wrote the other day is just thinking about apple
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.800]  music and the problems people are having and the comp my problems it seems to me like everything's
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.760]  working for me it's just that i'm confused about how it's supposed to work right compare and contrast
[39:53.760 --> 40:02.240]  with the new iCloud photo library which i was more worried about because i care much more about
[40:02.240 --> 40:09.360]  my photos than i do my music um and i have backups of everything and i've you know i've got stuff
[40:09.360 --> 40:15.200]  but i just i don't know i just worried that it wasn't gonna work um and you know i and i backed
[40:15.200 --> 40:21.440]  up my phone beforehand so that if if i turned on this thing on and it erased my photo library on
[40:21.440 --> 40:26.320]  my phone i could just restore the phone to where i was before i turned it off i did you know i backed
[40:26.320 --> 40:32.720]  up my mac i backed up my phone and i turned this thing on you know a couple weeks ago whenever um
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.320]  and it you know again everybody's had the same sort of first reaction if you have thousands of
[40:38.320 --> 40:46.880]  photos i think i've got like 17 or 18,000 photos total um from my old iPhoto library and what i
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.880]  took on the phone um it did take a while for them to sink initially i don't know a couple of days
[40:52.880 --> 40:59.600]  something like that um and then but lo and behold like you know maybe like a day or two two days
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.160]  after i signed up for this thing and turned it on on all my devices all of my devices have all
[41:04.160 --> 41:10.080]  my photos and when i take a photo with my phone uh by the time i go to my mac if even if i'm
[41:10.080 --> 41:14.720]  just sitting here at my desk and i go to the photos app there it is it's right there at the bottom
[41:14.720 --> 41:23.920]  of my you know all your photos uh it is you know and for people who say apple never gets cloud
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.720]  services right or something like this i would say the photos thing seems like an example where they
[41:28.720 --> 41:38.400]  did have you tried it i have not i'm actually filling with it right now okay um because just because
[41:38.400 --> 41:46.080]  i'm i was afraid of that initial sink process taking so long um and also that just the fact that
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.120]  i felt like i was going to probably have to upgrade the storage space because i didn't think i was
[41:49.120 --> 41:52.800]  going to because i think my libraries and that was the other thing i was trying to just figure out
[41:52.800 --> 41:57.760]  how big my library is but that's what always been my problem is that i just have too many pictures
[41:57.760 --> 42:01.760]  and a lot of them are just crap and should be thrown away but i don't want to go through that process
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.720]  of going through every single thing and trying to figure out what should go and what should stay
[42:08.000 --> 42:15.520]  so i have not done it yet but that's like maybe i should and you know and i tweeted so i guess i
[42:15.520 --> 42:20.240]  or i blogged about it yesterday and a couple people on twitter you know obviously it's not working
[42:20.240 --> 42:24.000]  for a hundred percent of all people there's some you know i don't know does anything ever work
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.240]  for a hundred percent all people i don't know but it seems to me like there are a lot fewer people
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.880]  encountering problems with the i i cloud photo library than there are people encountering
[42:32.880 --> 42:40.240]  problems with the music and conceptually to me it is very very simple right it's all of your photos
[42:40.240 --> 42:44.960]  and all of your hours across all your devices and if you you know you have two options
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.440]  download the originals to this device whether it's a mac or ios thing and that means you get the
[42:49.440 --> 42:55.360]  the original image that was taken from the camera or optimize you know and this is if there's
[42:55.360 --> 43:00.240]  something that's you know a little hand wavy it's what does this optimize photo storage mean
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.800]  you know it somehow it means you don't get on this device you don't get the full res versions will
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.360]  i cloud will resize them to you know make sense on your device and you know so i guess you get
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.160]  smaller ones on your phone and bigger ones on your mac but on either case if you turn on optimize
[43:18.160 --> 43:25.120]  storage you're not going to get the the original image the complaint i've seen on twitter from
[43:25.120 --> 43:30.400]  people is that even with optimize photo storage on it still takes up too much space that it's
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.600]  you know taking up ten or twenty gigabytes on people's phones and they don't have that much space
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.320]  maybe because they bought a sixteen gigabyte phone or twenty or thirty two or something like that
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.920]  which is a reasonable complaint but then if you have i guess the argument would be that if you
[43:45.920 --> 43:52.560]  have a space constricted device storing your entire photo library even optimized is not a good
[43:52.560 --> 43:58.160]  idea for that device right because i don't know what the solution would be i guess this i guess
[43:58.160 --> 44:05.280]  apple couldn't theory store even tinier thumbnails or something you know i'm not quite sure
[44:06.560 --> 44:12.640]  isn't that what the google sir i mean the google service goes down real well doesn't it
[44:12.640 --> 44:18.800]  i guess because and maybe that just is there web-based roots showing because you know something
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.680]  like flicker or any kind of web-based photo storage service it there's the idea that it
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.080]  even could download all your photos doesn't even make sense because there's no way to you know you
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.600]  only get five megabytes of local storage or whatever the limit is for a website with local storage
[44:33.600 --> 44:42.960]  mmm-hmm is that stored in yeah there is um oh no that's fine oh there's okay yeah so my my library is
[44:42.960 --> 44:52.960]  like almost 50 gigs your i-photo library my photos library oh because you you have upgraded to
[44:52.960 --> 45:00.320]  photos just i've upgraded to photos yes how many how many how many how many how many pictures
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.280]  is it 8500 yeah so i've got sixteen thousand five yeah the big things are probably the videos
[45:06.160 --> 45:14.880]  yeah probably yeah does it think the videos too yeah yeah yeah yeah they call it photos but it's
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.240]  it's it's just like photos on your on your phone on the phone it really means anything you
[45:20.240 --> 45:27.920]  shot with a camera yeah i mean i am it's certainly be very nice to have but i just i don't feel
[45:27.920 --> 45:36.000]  like paying for an extra extra service because that's not gonna fit no that is not gonna fit
[45:36.560 --> 45:41.360]  well what do you you still on that you're on the free tier yeah i'm still on the free tier yeah
[45:41.360 --> 45:49.040]  yeah that ain't gonna work but that raises a good point though that it's twofold would be which was
[45:49.040 --> 45:58.560]  a why is the free tier still just five gigabytes for this company with 200 again and it seems
[45:58.560 --> 46:02.720]  like it always comes up when you're on the show it's like let's spend him cooks money exactly
[46:02.720 --> 46:08.640]  and and so we'll put in our we'll put in our standard to claim disclaimer here that we understand
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.480]  we're not trying to say we're know it all's and we know more than apple how to spend money but
[46:12.480 --> 46:19.360]  uh you know and at the way that you accumulate two hundred billion dollars in cash is by you know
[46:19.360 --> 46:25.200]  maybe not spending your money really nearly on every idea that two idiots on a podcast say
[46:25.200 --> 46:32.160]  that you should spend money out i'm just saying it seems to me though given what other companies
[46:32.160 --> 46:40.400]  with less money than apple offer for free storage it just seems to me like maybe apple could
[46:40.400 --> 46:45.120]  be a little bit more competitive in that regard as to how big the free tier is and that it would
[46:45.120 --> 46:51.600]  be in their interest in terms of getting more people to use this uh you know the the photo
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.440]  syncing which i think they've put a lot of work into and would like people to use
[46:56.640 --> 47:05.440]  and then the flip side would be the the 16 gigabyte devices thing yeah completely because
[47:05.440 --> 47:14.080]  even if you know and this was like when i asked Phil Schiller on on stage last month part of his
[47:14.080 --> 47:19.600]  answer defending the 16 gigabyte devices is that more and more of people storage is cloud-based
[47:19.600 --> 47:24.480]  but even if you know as as these people responding to me on twitter pointing out even if you turn
[47:24.480 --> 47:33.520]  on optimized photo storage if you have a lot of photos it still consumes a lot of storage on your
[47:33.520 --> 47:41.120]  device or at least awful lot if you have a 16 gigabyte device yeah if you have a 16 gigabyte
[47:41.120 --> 47:50.800]  device you basically don't have a room to spare yeah it's really it's just it's and i lived with
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.520]  a 4 gigabyte phone for two years well i think it makes sense this is one of the differences
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.400]  between the music and photos if you just use the streaming for apple music i guess that makes a
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.040]  lot of sense on a 16 gigabyte device right that you don't have anything stored locally or almost
[48:05.040 --> 48:11.120]  nothing that it really is just cached and you're listening to the you know the beats one radio
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.920]  station or something like that that's fantastic right that you can listen to a wide variety of
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.840]  music you can search for music you can get the urge to listen to a certain artist and as long as
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.280]  you've got the bandwidth if you know you know you've got wifi or enough space on your cellular
[48:27.280 --> 48:34.160]  plan you can just listen to it without worrying about the storage but with the photos even again
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.960]  there's just no way to to to participate in this if you have a lot of photos in your library without
[48:38.960 --> 48:47.280]  using some significant degree of local storage and 16 gigabytes just is is pretty brutally
[48:47.280 --> 48:57.520]  short for that they don't really sell an 8 gigabyte phone anymore do they not new but they but not
[48:57.520 --> 49:04.640]  not top tier but if you go and buy like an iPhone 5c it's only is it still is it yeah absolutely
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.680]  oh my god yeah so yeah they still do yeah so for all my
[49:09.680 --> 49:14.400]  yeah i mean they still sell you know that side consider that selling it i mean you can
[49:14.400 --> 49:22.080]  you buy an unlock for $450 but yeah if there's a buy now if there's a buy now next to button
[49:22.080 --> 49:32.800]  next on on on the website i guess yes technically it is right but yeah i think your only choice
[49:32.800 --> 49:40.400]  yeah your only choice if you buy a 5c today is to get an 8 gigabyte and you know it's just the way
[49:40.400 --> 49:46.640]  that it works so if they don't move the baseline for the the brand new top tier success and
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.680]  and success plus which again i'm just guessing that's what they're going to do in September
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.560]  if they don't move the baseline up to 32 then i i don't know what they're going to do are they
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.240]  going to you know if they keep the storage tiers the same it seems like all the storage
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.960]  tiers will be the same and then the mid tier one is still going to be only 16 gigabytes
[50:04.960 --> 50:11.200]  and the low end one might still only be 8 gigabytes which seems crazy seems crazy that seems
[50:11.200 --> 50:19.040]  completely crazy i mean the good news is that they you know have have done the work to make
[50:19.040 --> 50:28.480]  iOS 9 require a lot less storage space initially to upgrade which is was definitely i mean they
[50:28.480 --> 50:35.840]  pretty much flat out said it was a problem at wc for i was 8 but for a lot of this stuff it
[50:35.840 --> 50:42.880]  really is it you couldn't even upgrade your phone right and it's like and it really it's really
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.000]  starts to with especially i think with the camera stuff really starts to directly conflict where
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.680]  it's like how can they brag about how nice the camera is and how how high the quality is of the
[50:53.680 --> 51:02.640]  video when you can store about four pictures right you can take one panoramic photo
[51:05.680 --> 51:12.800]  burst mode up to two images now i know we've talked i think we've talked about this before but
[51:13.840 --> 51:15.600]  would you would you go back to the four inch phone
[51:15.600 --> 51:29.280]  oh that's a great question i in theory i would and in fact i just spent almost a week using my
[51:29.280 --> 51:36.080]  four inch iPhone 5s because i had i put iOS 9 on it and i put my sim card in it so i could
[51:36.080 --> 51:42.480]  you know actually try it i've since gone and upgraded my my regular iPhone 6 to the the latest
[51:42.480 --> 51:48.400]  iOS 9 beta because it's that it's i at least for me don't you know if you go to switch to the
[51:48.400 --> 51:54.320]  iOS 9 beta and your phone dies don't don't complain to me but for me at least it is it seems
[51:54.320 --> 52:00.320]  at least to solid as iOS 8 so why not and i really really like San Francisco font and i you know
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.440]  it's good for testing and stuff but i spent a week using it on my 5s before i you know took the
[52:05.440 --> 52:13.040]  plunge with my iPhone 6 and i really really liked it really really i love i love the size and i
[52:13.040 --> 52:19.040]  know that the screen is smaller and you know i'm rocketing towards needing reading glasses
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.600]  so i appreciate the bigger screen size but just as something to carry around i i i would do it
[52:26.720 --> 52:30.960]  but the big but is here's here's how i think they're going to do the phones this year and i don't
[52:30.960 --> 52:37.120]  even think it's hard to predict i think they'll come out with an iPhone 6s and an iPhone 6s
[52:37.120 --> 52:45.920]  plus and they will be exactly at the prices of the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus and it'll have
[52:45.920 --> 52:52.160]  a new a nine system on a chip instead of a eight and it'll have a new camera in both
[52:52.160 --> 53:02.720]  i guess when people say the rumor is that there's going to be a rose gold option that makes
[53:02.720 --> 53:08.560]  sense to me and you know just like when they first went to the iPhone 5s was when they added
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.360]  the gold just so there's something that looks like some different yeah and you can tell it
[53:13.360 --> 53:18.720]  a change that you can tell it a glance this is the new one who knows maybe they'll even
[53:18.720 --> 53:23.920]  anodize the the aluminum differently go from space grade to space black or something like that on
[53:23.920 --> 53:30.640]  the black one but just you know just a color difference or something like that then i think one tier
[53:30.640 --> 53:38.880]  down they will have a new phone called the iPhone 6c which would be i think four inches
[53:40.400 --> 53:45.760]  possibly all new colors compared to the five c just being so well probably the iPod colors
[53:45.760 --> 53:52.480]  that's yeah exactly like instead of that sort of pastelli palette maybe more of like a bold
[53:52.480 --> 53:58.080]  bolder colors like the new like the new um iPods yeah exactly which is the i mean and they come
[53:58.080 --> 54:02.480]  in silver and gold too yeah well but i don't think they would do that with plastic you don't
[54:02.480 --> 54:06.720]  think they would do those with oh yeah because these aren't the iPods are not plastic no they're
[54:06.720 --> 54:12.480]  aluminum yeah right but i think colors like those colors yeah but i think it'll be you know the same
[54:12.480 --> 54:17.600]  type of plastic you case at that the five c has and you know yeah just just with new colors
[54:18.800 --> 54:27.680]  A8 A8 the camera from the six iPhone 6 um and because the case is thicker it won't have the little
[54:27.680 --> 54:34.560]  nubbin sticking out it'll sit flush um it'll be just like an iPhone 6 except a four inch screen
[54:34.560 --> 54:40.800]  and a plastic exterior which is a great phone and i'd be very tempted by it but i suspect i'll
[54:40.800 --> 54:47.120]  be an idiot and buy the the bigger one because i want the camera really even more than the
[54:47.120 --> 54:54.960]  faster system on a chip as i want the best camera possible i think i might get it i would be very
[54:54.960 --> 55:03.920]  tempted though yeah i think i think i i really just prefer that size and i'm and i held one of those
[55:03.920 --> 55:11.840]  uh a friend had one um the five c you know i held them before but i held it again recently
[55:11.840 --> 55:17.280]  and i really liked it and it just felt really good i mean the plastic even the plastic felt
[55:17.280 --> 55:24.000]  it's a nice plastic and the seams are well put together it's a it's a nice little phone so i've
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.920]  actually think i'm gonna go i'm gonna go down yeah i could see it what do you have right now
[55:29.920 --> 55:37.040]  a six yeah so it'd be same it's the same but the same phone just a smaller smaller size and
[55:37.040 --> 55:43.440]  plastic as long as i can get because i have a 64 so that would be i guess that would be a
[55:43.440 --> 55:51.760]  question is if i can get a 64 oh yeah i wonder hmm uh because i don't well actually no i think the
[55:51.760 --> 56:01.920]  what did they sell now with the iphone five six figure out 16 16 32 right yeah so what you need is
[56:01.920 --> 56:09.360]  you need apple to up the minimum right they would have to update that if they go 32 64 128 then
[56:09.360 --> 56:18.160]  the two tiers for the mid tier one would be 32 and 64 yeah i could see them doing it i really
[56:18.160 --> 56:27.600]  could and then and then i think the i guess the five s moves down to become the the that's weird
[56:27.600 --> 56:34.480]  though the free phone that's a little weird that's where it maybe they keep the five c around
[56:34.480 --> 56:40.400]  you know and i have the five c in the six c it is it is a little weird that's the bottom part
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.840]  yeah the bottom part is what's confusing to me what do they do down there because they have to have
[56:45.840 --> 56:52.480]  a free phone right and it i guess the reason it seems a little weird to have the five s be the free
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.360]  one is without turning it on and without knowing what the specs are of the system on a chip or
[56:57.360 --> 57:04.320]  the camera it just looks like it's the more premium device compared to the plastic five c right
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.960]  so i don't know doesn't seem like they could just do a five s i mean five s internals in plastic
[57:08.960 --> 57:22.560]  yeah but what would they call it they already have a five c five c yes this is the apple
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.840]  circa 1993 would have been done you're right the performer the performer the performer
[57:29.840 --> 57:36.960]  performer the performer 64 100 CD well of course it's called the CD it has a compact disc
[57:36.960 --> 57:48.240]  player that's the one i have the former six 40 i CD it has a Wi-Fi of course we have to put an
[57:48.240 --> 57:57.520]  eye in there what do you say what do you think do you think you think you're gonna go smaller
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.560]  i i miss if i can get 64 i think i will if if what we're describing is what it is if it's a
[58:02.560 --> 58:08.800]  if it's basically i found six internals in a plastic case in the cases are not the the current
[58:08.800 --> 58:14.880]  ones the colors are not the current ones they're the more like the current iPod ones than the
[58:14.880 --> 58:23.280]  current five c and i can get 64 gigs i will probably go with the what are we calling it six s
[58:23.280 --> 58:30.000]  six c six c i think it'll be called the six c yeah and i totally i do and having spent a week with
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.880]  it just now and i've never done that before you know like usually by you know nine months into the
[58:34.880 --> 58:41.760]  iPhone cycle i can't go back to the old one because it feels too slow you know but the five s
[58:41.760 --> 58:48.720]  to me totally holds up and it feels a little bit slower than the six but not much it's like a
[58:48.720 --> 58:54.160]  really good phone five five s is to me like probably the best phone they've ever made like it's
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.120]  it's hold it's held up past its prime better than any previous phone yeah and i and i missed
[58:59.120 --> 59:05.680]  that form fact right that and then that phone to me is like was the pinnacle of my phone
[59:05.680 --> 59:10.880]  technology and i just the way that the sides are flat and the size of it it feels to me like i
[59:10.880 --> 59:16.560]  couldn't drop it if i wanted to like just it just feels like undropable whereas you know the six
[59:16.560 --> 59:22.160]  just feels just still feels like you know it's it's it's slippery it's a bar of soap every time
[59:22.160 --> 59:30.880]  you take it out yeah well they don't listen to us so nope never really listen to you but
[59:30.880 --> 59:40.320]  that wasn't me let me do another sponsor and it is our good friends this it is a coincidence
[59:40.320 --> 59:45.200]  yeah i don't set these sponsor schedules but to me it's it's the happy sort of coincidence that
[59:45.200 --> 59:52.000]  works out um you know it just shows that we're living life right john it's our friends at hello
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.880]  hu-l-l-o they make you know what they make they make pillows you ever try to have ever tried a buckwheat
[59:58.880 --> 1:00:09.680]  hole pillow i'm sorry a buckwheat hole pillow uh popular i may have it's popular it's been popular
[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:15.520]  for centuries throughout Asia yeah so yeah so it is a matter of fact i have it's it's you know in very
[1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:21.120]  broad terms it is like sort of like a beanbag pillow but they're not it's not beans it's a buckwheat
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:26.400]  holes um sounds crazy i know when i first heard about it i thought well that sounds stupid
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:32.800]  um but it's not you get it it's also very heavy it's very heavy it's it's a pillow stuffed with
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:40.240]  these buckwheat holes you know you shake it it shakes like a like a beanbag um here's the thing
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:46.800]  it is it makes it much more adjustable the pillow uh conforms perfectly to the shape of your head
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:52.160]  and your neck uh and it really works no matter how you sleep just sleep flat on your back
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:58.800]  or your belly or your side doesn't matter the pillow uh you know just puff it up a little bit
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:03.120]  and it fits perfectly um air here's the big difference one of the big differences and i've
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:09.680]  noticed this the air flows freely through the the buckwheat holes fill the fill keeps it cool all
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:16.160]  night long like the pillow doesn't get hot because of your hot sweaty disgusting head uh like a
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:22.000]  like a traditional western style pillow uh how do you adjust the thickness what if it's what
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:27.200]  if you think that the pillow as it comes out of the box is too thick easy all you do did just
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.120]  unzip it there's there's a cover you take the cover off your unzip it and you just take some
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:35.760]  of the buckwheat holes out and then you have a thinner pillow just take them out it's it's couldn't
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:42.720]  be easier uh here's another product that is made in the USA with quality construction quality
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:50.560]  materials that's really really nice pre shrunken and durable twill cotton case uh a high quality

[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:39.360]  and you go to the URL and this is welcome daring fire bowlers there you go with you see that
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:43.440]  there you go you're already buying a pillow
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:52.160]  because i'm really considering it i use one in japan um slept fine yeah it's it sounded crazy to me
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:56.720]  apparently it again i it's not i know it's part of the the the material they gave me but it
[1:03:56.720 --> 1:04:02.080]  it's from what i've gathered it actually is very common in in in asia yeah and that's
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.920]  the one thing that it does really well is to look like support you're like if you have got
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:10.560]  next support problems this is probably a really good solution because that and that's what i
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:16.080]  spend i spend most of my day configuring my pillow for next support for before i go to bed
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:28.560]  i guess i'm because i'm old so something like this helps a lot i know it's it's one of those
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:32.480]  things where you know let's face it a hundred years from now we're they're going to look back at
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:36.800]  us and everybody's probably going to be a vegetarian you know all the stuff we're doing
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:42.080]  savages well i would do or that like that grown that meat grown in a lab
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:47.520]  i yeah that's what i'm hoping for hope but time i'm an old man hopefully we'll we'll be able
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:51.600]  to switch to that because i was going to say isn't it it is kind of disgusting to think about
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:56.880]  the fact that a lot of you know a lot of us have slept a lot of time in a sack full of plucked
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:03.600]  bird feathers like if you don't call it a pillow and you just call it a sack full of plucked feathers
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:11.040]  it's it's weird it well we're laughing because it's weird and gross but if you step you know
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:15.680]  take a deep breath and think about it it seems a little inhumane i have to say and which i
[1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:20.320]  realize like there's like a naked goose walking around someplace right which is you know
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:25.040]  this is cruel i don't know which is a little bit of you know hypocritical from someone who eats
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:32.720]  two or three steaks a week like i realized that somewhere there's a cow about to be slaughtered
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:37.280]  to be turned into a steak who is like hey if you want to pluck my hair out i much prefer
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:45.760]  right let's make a deal do you see that the thing with that El Chapo guy
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:53.120]  down in Mexico no you didn't see this the drug the drug guy who who broke out of prison
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:58.320]  oh i saw i saw an oblique reference to that weight so you fill me in on that
[1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:06.320]  so this it i forget his real name but everybody just calls him el Chapo he's a Mexican drug lord
[1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:12.560]  kingpin sort of uh who is the guy who was the head of the metagame carto uh back in the 80s
[1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:17.760]  was real famous and he's like you know he's a guy who's you know like hundreds and hundreds of
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:23.120]  millions of dollars in drug profits and you know a couple years ago they caught him and they locked
[1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:30.480]  him up and he busted out of prison and he went on the lamb and then you know the US got involved
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:37.120]  and uh last year they caught him again and apparently with you know but they said what is it kind
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:41.920]  of an interesting story it's it it it it's is that the official story was that it was with some
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:46.560]  intelligence from the United States and then the Mexican you know national you know they're equivalent
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:52.800]  of the FBI busted the guy like like what a resort hotel somewhere in Mexico
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:59.040]  you know like life on the lamb was apparently really tough for this guy
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:06.400]  um but there's reports now uh from other people that it wasn't even the the Mexican special
[1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:15.840]  police it was US DEA agents wearing the Mexican federal police uniforms just for the optics
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:20.880]  you know that they you know that it didn't look it doesn't look good to people in Mexico if you
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:25.680]  US you know law enforcement agents are running around Mexico but they arrested the guy
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:31.760]  and the US said let us take this guy extra item let us charge him in the US come on the guy busted
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:38.560]  out um and and as they were arresting him and they you know arraigned him whatever they call it
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:42.960]  the guy swore he stood up and he said you know I'm gonna bust out again
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:52.000]  and the Mexican government said no you're not not this time we're putting in a super max prison
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:00.640]  you know you're it's unbreakable and uh and yeah the guy broke out again he broke it busted right
[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:06.720]  out my my joke is that they run the place like Arkham Asylum you're right but there's video in
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:12.160]  his room never in the first place so the story that they said the day after he broke out is that
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:17.920]  they uh somebody you know sympathetic to his cause some of the guys from his his you know his cartel
[1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:24.160]  they uh they started making a building there was a building that was put up like a cinder block type
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.440]  you know very very simple structure about a mile outside the prison and then inside this building
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:34.240]  they they dug a hole and they started digging they dug a tunnel underneath the prison
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:41.040]  right into his cell and then they cut like a little 20 inch by 20 inch square hole in the shower
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:47.200]  in the shower in the in his cell and so there's video footage his cell was under 24 hour seven
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:51.600]  day a week surveillance video surveillance so they have the footage he just he's in there
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.760]  pacing for a couple of minutes and then he walks over to his bed and puts on a pair of shoes
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:09:00.960]  and he walks into the shower and he and he just disappears he just goes down all
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:10.560]  and apparently they're they're really good his cartel is is sort of uh has you know like
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:15.040]  mining level expertise digging these tunnels because apparently that's how they get a lot of
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:20.560]  the drugs into the united states that they've got like a of course they've got like a network of
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:27.280]  tunnels like this but uh you know but it's a mile and a little you know hand hand uh dug tunnel
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:32.320]  but uh but they had like a little track down there it's pretty cool they have pictures of it you
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.760]  know they've shown the media they they rigged up like a uh like a dirt bike like a little motorcycle
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:43.040]  on the track so he didn't have to crawl the whole way and they had like lights down there too you
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:47.680]  know but then he could just get on this little bike that's on a track and then it would uh
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:50.720]  it just scooted him right out to this building and now now he's gone
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:10:00.800]  yeah lighted it says lighted and ventilated tunnel nearly a mile long yeah but now it's there's uh
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.040]  there's some there's some there's some controversy about it though because apparently they have not
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:10.720]  let anybody from the media uh they've let people from the media down into the tunnel and they've
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:16.080]  let people into his cell and look at the hole that was dug and shine like a flashlight down there
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:21.760]  but nobody has verified that the tunnel goes all the way from this building right into his
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:27.520]  cell and there's the so the conspiracy theory is that he didn't even have to do that he that
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.880]  that part was faked so there'd be like some kind of cover story but that for him getting out
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:37.920]  but yeah but that the corruption is so bad so no so somebody like just waltz them out the front door
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.560]  yeah that you know somebody you know decided you know and there's there's a couple people who work
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:47.120]  in the prison who've been arrested already for you know not doing their jobs but that maybe they
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:51.200]  took it you know maybe he cut them a deal where it's like you know I'll send your family so much
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:55.360]  money you know you'll do right a couple years you know you'll do five years or whatever but
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:59.280]  I'll make it work through a while and they did you know and then they made this fake tunnel just to have
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:06.240]  a cover story I don't know either way I like I don't know I like the like the like the previous
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.160]  I like the thing that they made the whole time yeah I do too that's just that's much more that's
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.720]  much more romantic the other one is disappointing that it's just simple corruption
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:30.640]  I don't mean to laugh I mean it's you know yeah it's not it's got grace that he's out
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:34.800]  but right I'm gonna go there I didn't kill anybody on the way out but
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:41.040]  he'll probably get somebody oh and the other thing the this is the other part that makes it so
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:52.000]  amusing is that he got into it or somebody with his official Twitter account gotten to a bit of a
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:02.080]  ruckus with Donald Trump have you heard this was I asleep all week yeah I guess he busted out
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:08.880]  and Donald Trump it this fit right into Donald Trump's narrative that you know that the Mexico
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:14.080]  is not to be trusted and you know that there's you know sort of a criminal elephant running
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:19.120]  wild down there or whatever I don't know Donald Trump shot his mouth off that if he were president
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:24.800]  you know nobody'd be breaking out of yeah you know I did see that I didn't understand it
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:36.160]  and I didn't know who will chaper was but then after he shot his mouth off there is some like like
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:44.720]  an unofficial Twitter account for El Chapo that tweeted it Donald Trump better will shut his mouth
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:59.840]  and watch back El Chapo's media intern fired back angrily that's gonna look interesting on a resume
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:09.920]  it was a social media manager for El Chapo I just like the idea that the guy busted out of second
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:15.360]  you know like the the most present in all of Mexico for the second time with all this publicity
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:20.560]  and then he gets on Twitter and starts getting upset that Donald Trump is talking bad about him
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:34.480]  so anyway if anybody out there is listening from El Chapo's crew we're highly respectful
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:42.240]  we are we are and you know hats off to you for escaping no no it's not implied
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:49.280]  we don't need any trouble El Chapo put what to say here I just I just google this
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:56.640]  El Chapo puts a hundred million dollar bounty for Donald Trump dead well that's from TMC I don't
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:03.520]  know if that's true oh yeah but yeah only if it only becomes straight from El Chapo's Twitter account
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:14.480]  can you can you trust it I wonder if he has the check mark
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:26.560]  did I'll provide verified El Chapo all right what else is going on I better follow up
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:32.080]  better follow up on with Jason Snell on the previous episode we had talked about the new
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:38.880]  Pebble Time smartwatch and I complained about the the my two big complaints about the one
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:42.560]  that I bought where that the screen it was very very low contrast I couldn't read it
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:50.960]  and the fonts are too small and that the the the vibration alert is way too strong and powerful
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:58.320]  so they came out in the meantime I guess they did listen to my show they put out a software update
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:01.920]  that gives you a little bit of control over the screen and over the
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:07.840]  Taptic response and so I got some email from people who are like holy cow you just complained about
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:14.480]  this you know they fixed it it doesn't really fix either of them in my opinion the Taptic
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:20.960]  thing maybe a little bit but it still is is Taptic thing it seems to me I installed the update
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:25.520]  it does seem like turning that down less than the feeling like I'm getting an electric shock
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:32.640]  when it vibrates on my wrist but it's still loud I still can hear it and the brightness thing
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.200]  doesn't solve any of the problems at all because the brightness is only when the backlight is on
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:43.040]  and it is brighter and that can help a little bit but it doesn't help the contrast at all
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:48.000]  and it doesn't help at all with the lack of contrast when the backlight isn't on at all
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.720]  so I still have to give a thumbs down to the to the pebble time
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:04.640]  I'm assuming the pebble is in the smartwatch
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:14.480]  market share numbers that came out I guess so yeah that's a that's part of the news from this
[1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:20.400]  week where yeah the smartwatch it doesn't say specifically just as Apple Samsung and others
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:26.000]  and Pebble I don't know this pebble I would think Pebble would be bigger than Samsung but I
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.080]  really have no idea yeah I don't know about that Samsung might be ahead of Pebble but Pebble's
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.720]  got a rank somewhere on there I mean it's they've sold you know the only the only a three
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:38.800]  Apple Samsung and others so this is a strategy analytics
[1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:47.280]  saying that Apple watch captures 75% global smartwatch market share and Q2 2015
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:52.880]  which doesn't I mean you know that doesn't seem terribly surprising
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:01.120]  even though nobody really knows how many they shipped no nobody knows so
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:10.640]  so there but on the other hand you know you're wrong on the other hand nobody knows how many
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:15.280]  Samsung has ever shipped because Samsung stopped reporting all those numbers for everything not
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:21.600]  just for watches but for smartphones and stuff too a while ago so yeah you know yeah I was
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:30.880]  talking about this with Dan and and Guy on our show and I just we weren't why why does Apple
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:36.640]  plays Apple the one that seems to report all this stuff and nobody else does yeah it's always a
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:41.440]  little funny to me at that Apple which as long had the reputation as being the most secretive of
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:47.600]  companies is the one that you know reveals the most about its sales and stuff like that
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:53.680]  yeah and and now that they're not there's they're still being held to a different standard
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:01.120]  Amazon doesn't even know how to put a label on an axis
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:11.520]  I like that people like report numbers Snell Snell when he was tweeting or posting some of the
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:18.080]  results you know from all the companies that posted stuff you know in the last week or two because
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:22.720]  in the interim Apple is reported it's quarterly results and a couple other companies did too
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:29.680]  he calls them Amazon charts so among the many charts he made for Apple's quarterly results
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:35.760]  he made one for Apple watch sales and it just has a bunch of quarters with nothing
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:43.360]  then a line going up then a line going up and with no access yeah Q3 up sales are up from
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:49.520]  since before it went on sale yeah the first quarter is really the best right
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:19:02.560]  they just shoot straight up I mean so what I haven't I haven't really been paying attention
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:07.440]  what has happened to Apple stock price since then I know overnight when it first when they first
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:17.200]  released their results their stock dropped something like 6% overnight yeah it looks like it's still
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:25.120]  down although it seems like it's returned a little bit down from one well from before they reported
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:36.240]  the results yeah so it's at one twenty two now yeah before they announced their results it was
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:42.800]  up around like one thirty yes it's still way up for the year yeah but it's kind of but it's been
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:49.680]  sort of flat since about February you know going I mean going up and down but not really getting
[1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:56.560]  out of that same range yeah which you know I don't know how I'm you know again what am I my financial
[1:19:56.560 --> 1:20:05.120]  expert but it it seems to make sense to me that a large very large and predictable company
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:15.040]  should have a relatively stable stock like I don't know to me it's it has been and I can laugh
[1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:20.560]  because I don't have my money in Apple but I and I worry sometimes I was thinking about the other
[1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:26.720]  day that I cracked jokes about the volatility of Apple's stock price and I occurred to me that
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:31.040]  there's probably an awful lot of people who read during fireball and listen to the show who it's
[1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:38.800]  not very funny and all funny and again and I don't think it's you know I don't think it's the
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.000]  knee jerk oh where they're you know there there are fans of Apple so they you know put their money in
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.560]  Apple I think it's probably because they're smart people and it's been a very good buy for a long
[1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:57.920]  time and I think that a reasonable person could reasonably expect that their future is remains
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:02.000]  bright you know so I just has nothing to do with you know investing in a company because you're a
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:09.440]  fan I think it's smart and I think that when they when they reveal record breaking quarterly results
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:18.160]  and this and the market cap drops fifty billion dollars in after hours trading it's not very
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:25.360]  funny at all where are we laughing I don't know I do think in all seriousness though I think
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:30.080]  and and again I'm not an expert I you know I know that you know one of the strategic differences
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:36.080]  the company has made in this Tim Cook era from the Steve Jobs era is that they've gotten involved
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:43.520]  in the stock buybacks and the what do you call it when they give money back to the show there's
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:50.640]  dividends the dividends I don't know maybe not so much but with the stock buybacks that it actually
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:57.360]  you know it's it's a way to mitigate that because presumably if if Apple's smart they wait until
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:04.160]  after they announced these results to do more right that you know if they could if they are smart
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:10.000]  enough to foresee that that the fact that there's so many people whose expectations were so
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:15.680]  high that this was considered disappointing even though it broke records you know that well I
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:19.840]  guess that's the nice that's the nice thing about being Apple investor currently is that even if
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:26.240]  the stock is flat there are other things that make it an attractive buy right right the you know
[1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:30.080]  just sit there and hold it and you're gonna make more money than you would right you know just
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:43.360]  compare to compare to interest rates right we're spending it like I do but the five you look at
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:49.360]  the five year that's it's pretty good it's got you know there's like there was a big there was
[1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:55.280]  kind of a run up in 2012 and then it came back down towards the end but since then it's been
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:04.240]  climbing fairly steadily yeah if you smooth out 2012 to 2013 it still goes up you know it went
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:11.840]  but it's you know it's in the long run it looks like a clearly an anomaly yeah yeah boy
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:19.040]  it seems like we got the we got over the fear that Tim Cook was not you know not the man for
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:26.320]  the job well it's but but the the the run up was under Tim Cook too because jobs died at the end
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:31.600]  of 2011 yeah I think there was sort of I think there was sort of a I think there was a mania in
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:38.880]  2012 where there was holy shit they didn't they didn't just shut the doors right they didn't
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:43.840]  just shut the doors it seems like the company is still you know employees are still showing up for
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:51.200]  work there's there the lights are still on in Cupertino so there was like a mania and they ran it
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.880]  up and then there was the the second half of the year which is boy some of the best claim
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:04.560]  chowder of all time where the the apple board should fire Tim Cook why is it taking so long
[1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:12.320]  for the apple board to fire Tim Cook those are good times good times but again I bet that was a
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:19.360]  great time to be Tim Cook not that he was worried I'm sure he wasn't worried no no not at all
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:31.840]  that was funny you know how gores online too Tim I've been reading it sounds I guess it's a
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:37.120]  little bit more like a Bill Clinton that's a little bit but still pretty good Bill Clinton's online
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:46.240]  three great for some reason to go in some line three I've been reading business inside of it
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:25:09.920]  Forbes Forbes contributor so the stock is doing well the company is doing yeah they have a lot of
[1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:19.040]  money and we still have five gigabytes of of iCloud storage in a gigabyte iPhone 5C's
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:25.120]  all right let me do another another sponsor and I roll this in because I actually it's a good
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:29.520]  it's a good segue remember my me I want to talk to you about the the new Steve Jobs movie
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:37.360]  okay but our next sponsor is our good friends at Fracture you guys know Fracture they are the
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:41.840]  company you send them you sign up we don't even sign up you just go there you send them your photos
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:50.160]  pick a favorite photo of yours give it to them pick a size they print it directly on pure glass
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:55.920]  your photo right on the glass they package it up comes right to you and it in the package is
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:00.480]  everything you need it's got a foam back you can just if it's big it's got everything you need to
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:07.200]  mount it on a wall they give you the screws you need for mounting on a wall you want to prop it up
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:10.880]  on your mantle or on your desk or something like that they've got everything you need for that
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:17.200]  it's amazing packaging amazing print quality but here's the thing it breaks you out of
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:24.560]  having everything digital and looking at your photos you know of your family everything places
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:30.240]  you've gone stuff like that it breaks you out of only experiencing these things on screens right
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:35.600]  your Mac your iPhone something like that it brings them into the analog world and and there's an
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:41.840]  emotional aspect to that that it's it's just hard to explain I'm trying to do it right here but it's
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:47.920]  hard but it really does mean something to me at least and and I know that you know in my house we
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:55.280]  you know we like having the pictures printed out and it really makes a difference and there's no
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:01.280]  better way to do it than fracture give your photos this is what they say give your photos the analog
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:09.760]  beauty they deserve and it's amazing to me given how good the the iPhone camera is how big you
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:15.200]  can print a photo that you've taken with your phone and I still have it look good when it's
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:21.520]  hanging on a wall printed out I still in my back of my mind I still think phone photo equals you
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:26.160]  know like 640 by 480 you know don't print it very big or you're gonna see the pixels or whatever
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:33.760]  it's amazing what photos from an iPhone 5S or 6 what they can look like when you're
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:38.720]  printing them real big and fracture does a great job of it so here's where you go go to their

[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:11.920]  picture complimentary just as you know part of our friendship they're them sponsoring the show and
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:19.040]  me saying good things about them they sent me a print of me and Phil Schiller on stage got it right here
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:27.760]  right here in my in my office as I speak. Is he talking about me? He did? He was cracking
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:33.920]  shows I like mulch that should have been the title of the episode I like mulch.
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:43.120]  So my resume. He was mad that I cracked a mulch joke as well he should be.
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:52.320]  You could say what you want about iCloud. You can say what you want about 16 gigabyte
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:57.680]  phones but you start crack at jokes about mulch and Schiller is that your door?
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:03.920]  So have you seen this there's a new documentary coming out about Steve Jobs?
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:08.480]  Oh the documentary. Yeah that's the one you want to talk about not the other.
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:15.440]  And it seems to me like they are they I mean I guess it was done I don't even know why it's the
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:19.840]  independent movie business seems so it's complicated to me because they screened it at South
[1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:31.920]  by Southwest this year which was March. Alex Gibney and I have seen some of his movies. I
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:38.080]  saw his Scientology movie going clear Scientology in the prison of belief which was really
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:45.600]  highly regarded and I find Scientology fascinating like it's just such a weird crazy thing like
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:53.760]  it's a religion like a religious cult for rich celebrities. Are you going to get letters?
[1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:59.120]  Well I don't know. I don't come into your door. What's up? Come to my door.
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:05.440]  You know I used to get a lot of Scientology paraphernalia. Did I ever tell you that?
[1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:12.320]  No. Well when I was growing up I read a lot of science fiction. A lot of science fiction.
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:20.720]  Yeah I consumed it vociferously was that the word? I read as much of it as I could get and at some
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:30.640]  point I read some of the books by Al Ron Hubbard. I forget the series. I don't know it was one of
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:34.960]  the you know something some crazy shit that he wrote late. Yeah it's the one that they made the
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:40.240]  stupid. No I read that one too. There was Battlefield Earth which was one novel and then there was
[1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:47.280]  another one which was like a series of ten novels and I didn't I didn't think it was good
[1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:53.280]  and it was weird it seemed I swear to god not making this up. I'm not making this up. It seemed
[1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:59.520]  weird to me and I was like 10th or 11th grade and it seemed weird to me that the bad guys in this
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:04.480]  is a space opera. It was something about aliens and you know most people on earth don't know the
[1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:08.720]  aliens are there and there's a good guy who's protecting earth and there's bad guys from another
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:13.280]  planet who are trying to you know take over the earth or something like that and the bad guys
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:23.840]  are like psychiatrists. Yeah well I thought that was a little weird until you look into
[1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:32.080]  singing Scientology and then suddenly becomes right but I guess I guess I like mail ordered the books
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:39.520]  or something like that. Well then I started getting Scientology stuff in the mail and I did not ask
[1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:45.280]  I did not ask for that and I didn't even know it was the same guy because you remember in the 80s
[1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:50.560]  there used to be commercials for the Dianetics all the time. Yeah yeah yeah right with the you know
[1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:56.400]  volcanoes exploding and stuff like that and you know they sent me stuff like that and my dad you
[1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:00.080]  know it wasn't like an intervention but my dad was like how come all this stuff is coming for you
[1:32:00.080 --> 1:32:06.000]  and I was like oh well I read this guy's like you know you know Star Wars type book and and I
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:13.520]  guess they signed me up. So my dad I guess I'm gonna cult now I guess my dad's advice was don't get
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:26.000]  into this shit. He was right. But anyway give me made a documentary about Scientology that was
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:32.640]  well regarded and and I enjoyed it but I didn't think I enjoyed it because I've interested in
[1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:39.600]  the subject but I thought it was a sort of a weird documentary but now he's made one about Steve
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:46.560]  Jobs. Right and this is the one that the Apple executive so objective too. Yeah like I did
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:52.800]  a pretty cute I think was the one who tweeted about how it was being spirited or something like
[1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:58.560]  that. Yeah not the man that he knew. Yeah and I guess he saw it at South by Southwest. Yeah I don't
[1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:06.160]  know I guess I hope he saw it I hope he's not saying it without having seen it. And the preview
[1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:12.160]  looks great I'll put the trailer in the in the show notes here I am copying and pacing it
[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:16.720]  right now so I don't forget. I think I've been doing a good job just as a meta note I do think
[1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:20.800]  I've been doing a better job lately of actually putting in the show notes everything that I
[1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:27.680]  claim to put in the show notes. The trailer looks interesting and it makes it look you know like
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:35.680]  it's a you know a fair and balanced look at the guy's life. But the poster to me is a little
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:40.960]  worrisome. Did you see that have you seen the poster? No I have not. Let me see if I can find
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:47.440]  a link to the poster. The poster is sort of a weird so this is Steve Jobs the man in the machine.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:56.720]  Yes not to be confused with the other popular movie X Machina. Also that's Steve Jobs.
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:05.360]  Which Steve Jobs builds a robot. Man where is the poster for this movie? I don't know gotta
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:13.280]  find the poster. Oh wow. The one that's just his face? Yeah it's like a weird Photoshop job because
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:19.760]  that's not what he had there you know it's they've they've sort of yeah definitely because
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:25.280]  you can find the original image for that and it's like they've made him look sinister. I don't
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:31.200]  know how else to say it but they've sort of sinister. Well yeah it's like it's all they've made
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:36.480]  the background black instead of right? Yeah it looks like he's in the shade the shadows instead of
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:42.560]  just standing in the room and they kind of gave him like devil eyes. You know what I mean? Like they've
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:48.400]  they've there's like a photo shop. Oh yeah the eyes do look different don't they? Yeah.
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:56.160]  Well he had you know very dark he had very dark eyes so his eyes wouldn't you know you wouldn't be
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:02.800]  able to see it looks at you know what I mean like if you have dark brown or black eyes you don't see
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:08.560]  the corny or not the corny of the what's that called the iris like that right but it makes it look
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.640]  you know sort of like the what happened to Anakin Skywalker when he went to the dark side.
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:21.920]  I don't know so I'm a little worried. I do think I know the prequels. I am going to watch this
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:27.760]  movie but I did not watch have you ever watched the the Ashton Kutcher one? I have not seen any of them.
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:33.760]  I did not see the Ashton Kutcher one because I didn't even see Pirates of Silicon Valley. I just
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:35.840]  I really don't have a lot of tolerance for these.
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:44.800]  Like I mean I would rather read a factual account and I guess this is this will probably be more
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:52.880]  factual but yeah yeah. So you're not going to go see this. I don't have plans to go see it.
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:57.760]  It's maybe it's too on point. I don't know it seems like
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:03.920]  it seems like the thing that I would go see so that's why I don't want to go see it.
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:10.320]  But it seems like they're beating and you know I get more power to them because I don't feel
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:15.760]  like this is a dirty trick but you know the Aaron Sorkin movie is coming out in October this
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:21.040]  documentary is coming out in September so it's a way to sort of you know clearly the documentary is
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:24.720]  going to have less you know it's as an independent production it's not going to have the
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:31.680]  you know the marketing behind it that the Aaron Sorkin you know Blockbuster stars studded
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:38.720]  fictional fictionalized fictionalized what do you call something? Yeah based on a two-story book
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:43.280]  you know the thing is going to have. So come out beforehand and you can kind of piggyback you know
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:51.040]  on the publicity yeah but I'm not quite sure how how it was screened it's out by southwestern
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:55.280]  March and isn't coming out until September I don't know if they have they you know I guess they
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:00.160]  show sort of a pre-release yeah was that like a rough cut or is that yeah probably yeah I don't
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:05.920]  know anyway any cue called it mean-spirited but I don't know maybe that doesn't mean that it's
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:11.120]  you know maybe that I don't know I like the guys previous films enough that I'm going to give
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:16.640]  it a shot it seems like you could you could kind of portray him
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:22.640]  in and you know depending on what you want to show you're going to portray him in many different
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:27.600]  ways yeah well I mean there's definitely there's definitely some things about Steve Jobs that weren't
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:38.320]  great I don't think anybody necessarily denies that but you know if you chose if you chose to
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:44.480]  just show those things though it wouldn't necessarily be an accurate depiction right so be curious
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:49.760]  you know it sounds as though you know you know he's he's gotten some people who used to work
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:56.800]  for him to to you know do interviews I'm interested to see how recently they worked for him
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:02.240]  like it is this all stuff from the 80s and 90s or is or it has anybody who's worked with them
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:08.640]  you know in the last 15 years you know opened up yeah because he per each you know certainly changed
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:16.160]  over the years yeah but not that he was ever like laid back but I think most of his
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:24.880]  his worst screaming was probably around the age uh third story you know okay well no no I think
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:29.200]  you're right I think you're right that most of it and we're stocked I'm just saying
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:36.160]  right but that there were still some good stories from recent years you know of of you know
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:44.000]  yelling and screaming okay trying to think what else is going on you got anything else going on
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:49.520]  you talk about specter you want to talk about specter oh we should talk about that but let me
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:53.200]  take a break yeah take one last break and thank our final sponsor and then we'll talk about
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:39:00.400]  specter that's a good one to finish up it's our another trailer that trailer I've definitely seen
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:08.960]  it's our good friends at igloo igloo software these are the guys who make the intranet
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:16.800]  intranet that you will actually like share news organize your files coordinate calendars
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:23.280]  manage projects all in one place they're latest upgrade they call it Viking that's the name of
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:30.160]  the upgrade to the igloo platform revolves around documents and how you interact with them how
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:36.080]  you share them how you gather feedback on them and how you make changes they've even added the
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:44.080]  ability to track who has read uh or downloaded uh documents to keep everybody on the same page
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:50.240]  it's uh effectively it's like read receipts for email uh but less annoying you only see them when
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:53.760]  you're when you're logged in it's not like they're gonna you know chase it down and bug you with them
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:01.120]  but it just helps you track whether people on your team people if you work with who have to read
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.960]  something uh have actually read it very simple idea uh now they've added it to the igloo platform
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:15.280]  really great uh if your company has a legacy intranet that looks like it was built in the 90s
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:22.880]  that's because it probably was built in the 90s uh you should give igloo a try uh they've got

[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:50.880]  because of what you um wrote yes okay yeah okay so i didn't get see i didn't get what your
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:58.800]  what your alluding to there um so wait where did you where did you read so chilling where did
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:03.760]  it say chilling connection between bond and his enemy oh that's on their website if you go to
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:10.480]  double o seven dot com and okay so i think i saw it on youtube or something yeah so i will put
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.840]  this in the show notes yeah i'm trying to remain as spoiler free as i can for this although not
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:19.840]  quite to the degree i'm doing for the star wars movie the star wars movie i don't i don't even
[1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:26.880]  that didn't even watch the second trailer oh my god um i swear god that's i'm going like full on
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:35.680]  like you say star wars and i i just go nana nana nana my ears are covered i just don't want to
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:42.320]  know it's goddamn thing uh with the with the specter trailer i did go there and i read it
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:47.920]  and that uh whiskus our friend of the show day whiskus vouched for me that this was not a
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:56.640]  um because he's got no self-control he has absolutely no self-control whatsoever so he if if they
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:02.960]  if they released a trailer called the spoiler trailer here's the spoiler trailer it'll spoil
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:07.280]  everything it'll tell you everything that's everything in the movie day whiskus would watch it
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:12.320]  and then regret it instantly but then he would he would watch it he vouched for me that the trailer
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.840]  the second uh then the new trailer for specter was not not spoilery and i agree with his
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:22.960]  conclusion having seen it i don't feel like i know the plot of the movie really um other than
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:28.080]  other than what the title alone tells you which is that you know all right specters yeah
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:36.320]  right um i was bothered though by the the insinuation that that there's like some kind of
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.680]  boyhood connection between James Bond and specter well and this maybe i'm wrong about that i don't
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:48.000]  does not say it does not say boyhood no no but does they connection but it does not say right right
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:55.600]  but i don't i got a bad feeling about it like i like indeed i yeah i i agree that if you're if
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  you're you're supposition is correct then uh i that it does seem kind of lame so the hoping
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:11.360]  it's not that the best the best email i got from a reader saying hey i don't think we should
[1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:16.000]  where i got to heat somebody wrote to me uh forget i forget everybody writes me out but there's
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:22.400]  here's what made me feel better about it this is my fear my fear is that uh uh uh uh
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:28.080]  Kristoff Waltz is blowfeld now so far so good if they're not saying it they're saying
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.720]  Kristoff Waltz is in the film they're saying that he's like the leader of specter if his name is
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:38.320]  blowfeld fantastic i but they haven't spoiled that i don't know if it is or not everybody is thinking
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:44.160]  maybe um that would be great my worry is that they're going to say jake james bond and blowfeld
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:49.920]  or like long lost brothers or something like that you know that there's some kind of like family
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:54.080]  relationship or something like that and somebody who reads during fireball said you know i was
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:58.080]  worried about that too but then i thought about it and realized that there's no way even even if
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:02.960]  they had the idea to do that they'd realized they couldn't because uh austin powers did that
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:10.240]  and they would realize they would realize that they've stepped into the realm of parity
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:16.000]  and goofiness because uh austin powers had already done that with dr even
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:24.560]  well so the worry the worrisome aspect would be if the people who making making
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:31.680]  specter haven't seen austin powers right and like they're putting the finishing touches on the
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:37.680]  edit right now they're doing the the color correction you know double double checking the spelling
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:41.920]  and all the titles you know the credits you know make sure everybody's you know got their name
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:45.920]  spilled right in the credits and they're putting some kind of accent in the editing room
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:54.320]  guys this is the plot to austin powers we're going to get crystal volts back in here
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:46:02.480]  we're gonna change some change couple scenes we've got it for November we're gonna have to
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:11.360]  rerecord some of these lines well the trail i mean the trailer itself i think looks great
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:15.680]  yeah it does look great it's you know it's got basically everything you want to see you know
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:24.320]  and james mon trailer yeah i also i like the idea that without any kind of single overarching
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:30.400]  plot that spanned all these films that they're tying together some of the characters from the
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:38.320]  entire um Daniel Craig era right um yeah you know with mr white who's played by here's his name
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:44.880]  j- who's a real creepy looking guy jester christians and he was the uh the bad guy pulling the
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:51.200]  strings and casino royale and then uh at the end of casino royale james bond shows up at his
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:57.920]  porch and shoots them in the leg right and then it's you know the the best part of quantum
[1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:02.720]  solace is that it opens like immediately afterwards and he's got he's got him in the trunk of his car
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:07.200]  which is really cool it was a kind of a cool thing because they never really did that with the
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:12.080]  bond movies you know they never really tied him together in any way yeah yeah i mean they were all
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:17.680]  for the most part i mean a couple references here and there and then a couple like dumb references
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:24.080]  like does never happen to the other guy right well my favorite example of like the opposite of that
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:29.600]  and back in the day when dan and i would you know review on all these movies they they used to
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:38.640]  recast they they just cast the same actor in totally different roles yeah and so in um in you only
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:47.280]  lived twice which is the one where bond goes to japan uh chon connery film uh i guess his fifth one
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:54.640]  after thunderball uh and he meets uh like the m i six agent uh he's like an old british older
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:48:00.080]  british fellow who's you know has been their station guy in tokyo for a long time and then he gets
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:07.200]  uh he's a very nice guy but he says to uh james bond it's kind of a famous scene he's he's
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:14.320]  gonna make him a drink and he says uh uh i'm gonna make uh vodka martini stirred not shaken right
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:20.320]  and of course that's backwards but connery being a gentleman just says sure you know good enough
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.120]  you know don't make a fuss don't make a scene and then you know the poor guy before i think before
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:34.000]  he could even finish the drink he got stabbed um well anyway it happens that same actor is the guy who
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:41.360]  plays blowfeld right and diamonds are forever two movies later yeah so like well it's like back then
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:47.200]  and it i mean in particularly like 60 60s early 70s the only way you would see the movie is if it
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:53.840]  came on tv you know yeah you see it again as if it came on tv right so they they they have a
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:59.760]  like you know sure we'll just use the same actor why not right we like the guy we know the guy
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:05.520]  but it didn't even put like makeup on him they didn't get like a wig or anything he looked
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.720]  exactly the same except that instead of wearing a kimono he was wearing uh you know whatever you
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:17.520]  call those suits that blowfeld wears yeah yeah narrow jacket right yeah exactly narrow jacket
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:25.760]  now you you had posted sort of a kind of a more more like an Easter egg right um from casino
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:33.120]  royale yeah someone at point yeah uh which was the guy who tosses in the car keys in the parking
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  lot so as part that tells him to park the car and then you like rams into into somebody's car
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:46.480]  um look like blowfeld no no no not blowfeld no no like you go finger go finger that's right
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:56.000]  like like gold yeah yeah and uh and then uh the license plate was a sort of uh what do you call
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  those things uh become hexadecimal or hexadecimal for like a goldish i it's the the license plate
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:08.800]  to me was stretching it because it's i feel like if they were going to do it on the license plate
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:14.720]  maybe it would have been more like the atomic number for gold or something like that yeah no i mean
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:20.800]  it sincerely that i i i i think the hex color was really stretching it it's not quite it's
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:27.760]  not really very goldish but it but his car was gold it was a gold colored like Lexus or something
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:35.440]  like that uh and he does it i mean it's like the exact same sweat i to me it's like beyond coincidence
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:39.760]  like maybe they weren't actually saying hey this is gold finger maybe they were just kind of goofing
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.000]  around and it's not really yeah that's what it seemed like to me it's like it's more like an
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:51.200]  easter egg than it's well yeah yeah just the funny thing to put in yeah yeah like we have to have
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:57.920]  a guy who's going to toss him in the keys and we want him to um you know he's going to he's
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:03.200]  going to be a jerk and purposefully back his car and do a thing so we're going to make the guy a
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:12.000]  jerk who just sort of assumes that you know that he's the the you know the ballet uh and then once
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.960]  you go down that path of making the guy a jerk why don't you make a gold finger it's kind of a
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:24.240]  cool joke i saw another thing too i'll i will put it in the show notes somebody i didn't tweet
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:28.880]  this yet though but somebody found out somebody figured out there there's a in one of the old
[1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:36.000]  uh in Fleming novels and it was on her majesty secret service um which was widely regarded as
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:43.760]  one of the best books that he wrote and that's the one that uh uh George uh Lazenby
[1:51:43.760 --> 1:51:49.680]  Lazenby played the role and is is polarizing i i it's my least favorite of the classic bond
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:56.880]  movies um some people love it though but anyway in the novel uh James Bond uh has to escape
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:52:05.040]  from somewhere and he doesn't have any weapons on him so he uses his uh uh Rolex as a quote
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.880]  unquote knuckle buster so it's like brass knuckles so he takes his Rolex off puts it around his
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:18.480]  fists and uses the uh stainless steel Rolex to you know bust some jaws and then he even said it
[1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:22.880]  was like in the novel it was like uh and then like the next day he like woke up and the first thing
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:27.680]  he did was go to like uh a jeweler to get a new Rolex because it's the only it's like the only it's
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:32.080]  like somehow it's like described as like the only watch that you can trust to like crack skulls with
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:39.920]  that um so somebody figured out by freeze framing and casino royale at the very end of casino
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:47.360]  royale uh in the the fight scene in Venice while the building is sinking um at some point when
[1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:51.280]  James Bond is fighting those guys there's a scene where it looks like he turns his left wrist
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.800]  upside down as though the way you would to take off your watch and then it cuts immediately
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.280]  but then if you look at all of the punches he throws in the next scenes you can see that Daniel
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:07.360]  Craig has a watch around his own it's very clear yeah very very very interesting and so the speculation
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:11.840]  is that you know but there's also and that's the one with the really really prominent product placement
[1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:18.720]  where um on the train where he first meets Vesper Linde and she's you know he's like well you
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:23.920]  you know you know and he she he says I'm good at poker because I can read people and he
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:28.640]  reads her and then she tries to read him and she says you know but you have a Rolex and he goes
[1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:34.080]  omega you know which is super super probably it not only is he wearing an omega wrist watch
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:39.520]  he he says it and he says it as though it means that you know it's better than a Rolex it's like
[1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:44.480]  the best product placement they could ever have the speculation nobody knows this but the speculation
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:48.480]  is maybe the you know they were going to use it that way and omega people are like we don't we
[1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:52.880]  don't want us you don't we don't want to see the watching them getting smashed into somebody
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:58.400]  I think they're nuts though I think if the omega people shut that down they're out of their minds
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:04.880]  I think that that's it it it would have like even doubled what was already the best watch product
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:12.080]  placement and bond history yeah but it was a cool thing to me people they'd pay
[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:20.240]  completely like car companies pay tremendous amount to see those cars destroyed right exactly yeah
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:25.520]  I mean like Mercedes was a big part of the Jurassic World
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:30.720]  oh I haven't seen any different cities you know like Jeep type things everywhere yeah
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:38.560]  and even when there's one there's one I thought was kind of egregious but I like the movie but
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:46.160]  the kids or the kids run off on their own they escape their sort of the person watching them
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:49.680]  and they run off in their own and they're like they because they want to have a good time and she's
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:56.000]  just like plotting them through the dumb stuff the dumb parts of the the park and and so the older
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.640]  kids says you know they go see something oh they guys they go see the giant like fish dinosaur thing
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:07.120]  and then the older kid says to the the younger kid let's excuse let's go see something else
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:14.080]  really cool and then they cut immediately to her Mercedes sitting there and then you know and
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:17.920]  like somebody walks in I mean it's it's a you know it's sort of a seamless thing but it's like
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:25.440]  I was just like oh god they clearly paid for that there's no way but yeah I mean those things
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:33.360]  all get like crunched up and yeah it chewed up and pooped out by dinosaurs yeah yeah so who knows
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:38.240]  maybe it wasn't maybe it was just cut out just just for the sake of cutting it maybe it wasn't
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:43.200]  even at their request who knows but it was a nice you know I swear to god I will put a link in
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:51.280]  the show notes but it was it's a nice homage to original Ian Fleming source material yeah yeah
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:58.160]  so and it came about somehow the guy who wrote about it was on a movie blog and he got the tip
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:05.920]  from a collector who bought the original prop that Daniel Craig wore for those scenes and it was
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:14.640]  a replica of whatever Omega Seamaster he was wearing at the time but with a steel band but with
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:23.600]  a was the watch itself was like rubber and he bought that original prop and it drove people it
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:28.080]  made him he was like I did you know somehow I guess he talked to somebody with the props department
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:32.000]  but it didn't make any sense that they would even have that prop and then he like went back
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:36.080]  and like watched the movie real closely and like freeze framed and figured out you know where
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:46.880]  it was used how many how many movies is he in for from here on that's a good question I think
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.160]  he's in for at least I think he's in for another one more yeah I think it's one too I was trying to
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:56.560]  just see if it was on his Wikipedia but I don't see it no I think it's at least one more and that
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:08.240]  would bring him to five right yeah yeah yeah which is you know and and it would also bring him
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:14.000]  to and you know the you don't want to run into the Roger more problem where you even right
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:22.400]  even with Hollywood makeup you look you just look too old yeah he's not that he's not that old
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:29.280]  he's not no no he's still is forties yeah yeah I mean out with Roger Moore was like
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:34.640]  he was like eighty three when he filmed the last one he was really old by the time I mean like
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:40.960]  those action scenes were just Bruce some guys struggling to move and then all of a sudden he's
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:48.000]  running crazy I think that was where he had to I think he had to like run up the stairs of the
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:54.880]  Eiffel Tower that's yeah exactly yeah and it really was like this yeah the stunt was just Roger
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:58:05.600]  Moore running up a flight stairs wiped him out this was no good for like a week after that
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:15.120]  to his credit you know he's on the record is that he he wanted to wrap it up after whichever
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:21.280]  when he made like nineteen eighty one or something like that and yeah they they were 20 Adam yeah
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:24.880]  and just you know and he made two more he made two more than he wanted to make
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:33.120]  anyway that feels like a show I don't have anything else on my list of topics to talk about
