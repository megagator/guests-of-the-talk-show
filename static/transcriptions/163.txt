[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  My favorite story of the last few weeks was from your colleagues at the Wall Street Journal
[00:05.360 --> 00:11.080]  Shalini Ramachandran and I know I think I got it now dice K. Wakabayashi
[00:13.280 --> 00:16.520]  Or did I don't know I don't know how to pronounce I just call him die
[00:20.080 --> 00:26.840]  They had a story that ran yesterday, I'm sure you saw it that apples quote hard charging negotiations with the TV networks
[00:26.840 --> 00:29.600]  Scrambled any sort of
[00:30.520 --> 00:35.160]  Attempt that Apple had to get like what Apple more or less wanted was to charge people 30 bucks a month
[00:35.320 --> 00:39.040]  Like I guess they would just you know, just like to have Apple music that have Apple TV
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.300]  You pay him $30 a month and you get a package of a bunch of channels and you could watch them whenever you want
[00:45.120 --> 00:50.300]  And there's a couple of things in this story that really amused me. I quoted both of them on during fireball
[00:50.300 --> 00:57.360]  But the one was that the Apple wouldn't show the team the CEO of Comcast the user interface and he said
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.040]  how about you just get shit on the back of a napkin and
[01:01.340 --> 01:06.140]  Apple officials replied that the software would be quote better than anything you've ever had
[01:07.800 --> 01:15.320]  Which a wouldn't take much and B sounds a little it worries me. It's a little it's typical Apple, but it sounds like Donald Trump
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.640]  The back of the napkin. No, the it's gonna be it's gonna be better than anything you've ever had
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.240]  Yeah, believe me. It's going to be you have to preface that with believe me believe me
[01:27.040 --> 01:29.400]  And then the other tidbit that was great was that?
[01:30.080 --> 01:36.260]  When he met with mr. Britt the CE the Time Warner CEO or time Warner CEO Jeff
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.400]  Bukes and and some other guy named Britt. I don't know who he is, but
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.640]  a big big meeting with Time Warner Eddie Q shows up quote ten minutes late and
[01:46.640 --> 01:54.320]  Was wearing jeans tennis shoes with no socks and a Hawaiian shirt says a person familiar with the bill with them. Yeah
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.640]  what I love about the stories like this is like obviously there's so much reporting that goes into a piece like this and
[02:02.040 --> 02:05.320]  It has to be you know, everything has to be written straight-faced
[02:05.320 --> 02:09.320]  I mean everything is like every line is combed over in a piece like this
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.040]  But it's like you want to laugh and you can only imagine like what they were left
[02:14.040 --> 02:18.320]  Like what what that like sentiment was when they were writing something something like this
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.680]  But it's like that whole sentence and then somebody familiar with the matter
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.460]  It's just like who was the tips who was the source or the tip on that?
[02:25.460 --> 02:30.960]  You know, and I've always I've long said that ever since I wanted to be a writer
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.780]  I've always wanted to be a columnist. That's well all that I've ever aspired to be
[02:34.780 --> 02:40.840]  I feel like you're probably in the same boat and it's I have I don't want to write straight news like that
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.520]  Never did but I have so much respect for the people who do for exactly what you just said is
[02:46.280 --> 02:51.440]  Right, right. How do you the other the other executives were wearing suits? Yes, period
[02:51.960 --> 02:55.080]  Yes, I forgot to add that which is essential to the story
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.560]  Yeah, no, I mean and it's funny that die is a really funny guy and he's a great reporter but yeah, it's a
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.480]  It's um, we also do these front-page stories called a heads. Yes, and
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.760]  Many of those also like the reporting is just like straight face, but like it's the funniest thing, you know die story
[03:14.760 --> 03:18.540]  He did one on the Apple watch in the nose the the nose interaction
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.940]  Forget what it was the you know that people use their nose to navigate their their Apple watch
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.940]  And the whole story is like not it's it's written in just like a great tone. That's just like
[03:28.940 --> 03:32.260]  What are you know this ridiculous thing that's happening?
[03:33.580 --> 03:36.860]  There is a lot to unpack here though. It's it's like
[03:38.780 --> 03:42.340]  You know like it's sort of like a there's like a nightmare you have where
[03:42.580 --> 03:48.460]  You show up for a thing and you're terribly underdressed or you didn't put pants on, you know, that that's it's a trope
[03:48.460 --> 03:50.940]  You know, everybody has that sort of recurring dream
[03:52.460 --> 03:57.580]  Eddie Q showing up for this meeting with jeans and a wine shirt and tennis shoes with no socks
[03:57.580 --> 04:01.380]  Eddie Q was not embarrassed at all. Right, right. That's the thing
[04:01.380 --> 04:08.100]  I mean many readers probably don't know that you know people Apple followers or people have watched interviews with him or have gotten to
[04:08.100 --> 04:12.600]  Meet with him like both of us, you know, we know that he didn't he really didn't give a shit
[04:12.600 --> 04:14.900]  Like he just got there and he was like, all right
[04:15.740 --> 04:20.460]  And part of it is Apple's own culture part of it is California culture
[04:21.580 --> 04:25.600]  Because I think that when Apple deals outside
[04:25.600 --> 04:31.980]  It's not just the valley but when Apple deals with Hollywood, which is the valley versus Southern, California
[04:32.100 --> 04:37.380]  The you know showing up for a meeting with jeans and sneakers is not a big deal, right?
[04:38.500 --> 04:46.060]  Whereas New York media world is still very, you know, you wear a suit to a meeting with the CEO of Comcast or Time Warner
[04:47.260 --> 04:49.480]  Yeah, I mean not me, right?
[04:49.480 --> 04:57.000]  I wear sandals, but it why ensure it also brings to mind I remember and I must have been like 12 years old
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.320]  I mean, why was he not wearing socks though? That is good. That is a good question like gross
[05:01.320 --> 05:04.880]  You know, I mean like I hate wearing shoes without socks
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.360]  Sometimes I have to do it because I forget my socks someplace and like I have to get my shoes on
[05:09.360 --> 05:13.540]  I don't know really when I have to do it. I just think it's gross. That is my only objection as well
[05:13.540 --> 05:21.020]  Right, I mean well and he was photographed Eddie was photographed at the courtside at the the basketball game at the Golden State game
[05:21.020 --> 05:23.600]  And he was on the front page. He was wearing sandals
[05:24.620 --> 05:26.460]  Sandals are good. Yeah, you know what?
[05:26.460 --> 05:29.940]  I don't like sandals my thing about him wearing sandals to that basketball game though
[05:29.940 --> 05:32.940]  Is that a lot of times soda gets spilled and and you know
[05:32.940 --> 05:37.940]  I mean like I feel like but maybe because when you're courtside they there's like maybe like a no soda rule because
[05:38.940 --> 05:40.940]  So maybe it's okay. I don't know I
[05:40.940 --> 05:45.740]  I think yeah in particular pretty sure next time I meet with him
[05:45.740 --> 05:48.300]  I'll be asking about his feet and how he feels about
[05:49.300 --> 05:55.340]  The sweat that happens when you wear sneakers without socks. It's just there's there's sweat, you know your feet sweat
[05:55.340 --> 06:01.660]  Maybe he doesn't start to smell maybe everyone does it happens. I wear Toms. I have these Toms shoes
[06:01.660 --> 06:05.680]  I don't know if they I think they make male Toms, but Toms are the same thing
[06:05.680 --> 06:08.980]  You're not supposed to wear them with socks, but even that in there your feet sweat
[06:08.980 --> 06:10.980]  Mm-hmm
[06:11.340 --> 06:14.620]  My happy we had this conversation about this feet my feet are
[06:15.460 --> 06:19.220]  Extremely I I think half of my sweat glands are in my feet
[06:19.220 --> 06:24.260]  I have very very sweaty feet right sometimes before I go to bed. My feet are so sweaty put my feet in the shower
[06:25.820 --> 06:27.820]  I've always a recurring theme
[06:28.100 --> 06:33.060]  It's a recurring theme on the show that I in the winner. I you know, I work at home my feet get cold
[06:33.060 --> 06:37.020]  I like to wear slippers. I have I have a hard time finding slippers that I like because I don't like
[06:37.020 --> 06:40.260]  Open back slippers. They just go flying off your feet
[06:40.260 --> 06:46.500]  I like to have the back and so a couple years ago Amy got me for Christmas. She got me a pair of Uggs
[06:47.100 --> 06:50.900]  slippers and they're real there's like all this I
[06:51.660 --> 06:56.140]  Don't know what it is like wool or fake wool, but all this like fuzzy stuff on the inside
[06:56.780 --> 07:00.420]  And you're supposed to wear them with no socks and within 24 hours
[07:02.100 --> 07:04.320]  24 hours it was all coming out
[07:04.320 --> 07:06.240]  I
[07:06.240 --> 07:09.840]  Completely sweated through and destroyed them in about about a day and a half
[07:10.960 --> 07:15.480]  Like my feet are not meant for something like that. But those are they're really comfortable
[07:16.160 --> 07:19.700]  That's what she said she and that's why she got them for me and I had to agree though
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.760]  For like the few hours before my sweat started destroying them. I agreed
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.600]  But anyway the whole gist of this story is what Apple, you know the the earnings call Tim Cook said how you know
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.080]  Excited he is about products that are out of the box for them that they're working on
[07:36.600 --> 07:39.680]  Maybe maybe sandals or maybe maybe yeah footwear
[07:40.760 --> 07:45.760]  The whole point of this story though, it would be funny, you know, like there's that huge cult following around sneakers
[07:46.200 --> 07:51.660]  Right, it sort of feels like the same kind of people that follow Apple in a way. Yeah, I could see now
[07:51.660 --> 07:56.760]  They line up for shoes. They line up for phones. I don't know just just a thought here, but let's
[07:57.280 --> 07:59.640]  You would like to move on from the sneakers. I feel well
[07:59.640 --> 08:04.720]  I'm you know, but I've noticed you know, but people who keep and they keep their sneakers like in pristine condition. Yeah
[08:05.240 --> 08:07.240]  Yeah, I saw
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.600]  Sneaker heads, right? Yeah, I saw last night. I watched Seth Meyers
[08:12.400 --> 08:15.960]  late night because it was like live after the
[08:16.440 --> 08:22.980]  Democratic convention and Colin Jost and Michael Michael Che from Saturday Night Live were on to talk about it because they were there and
[08:23.440 --> 08:25.440]  Che had on a pair of
[08:25.440 --> 08:31.200]  Vintage Michael Jordan Carolina blue Air Jordans that were I was like, whoa
[08:31.200 --> 08:36.360]  Those are those are totally, you know, probably like super expensive and of course they were mint condition
[08:37.380 --> 08:42.260]  Yeah, see I'm not as I like don't I don't I got it sounds like very impressive, but I'm not a sneaker
[08:42.340 --> 08:48.900]  I'm not a sneaker person. Yeah, I'm I know enough about basketball shoes just because I used to follow basketball but otherwise no anyway
[08:48.900 --> 08:53.960]  The whole gist of the story was not about any accused sartorial choices
[08:53.960 --> 09:00.940]  It was about apples hard-charging negotiations and that their their stance on this has blocked them from putting together the package
[09:01.060 --> 09:06.100]  being able to offer the package they want to offer and I think it's so transparent that the
[09:06.380 --> 09:11.340]  The the cable companies are talking to the press and you know talking to the Wall Street Journal
[09:11.340 --> 09:19.040]  To try to press the matter and they're making it sound like Apple is being I don't know what the word is. I
[09:19.960 --> 09:23.600]  Arrogant arrogant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas I think the pompous
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.280]  Yeah, and I think the truth is Apple Apple is the one that can afford to wait they can wait forever
[09:28.320 --> 09:32.360]  They can never offer a TV package and there they'll be okay, right?
[09:32.360 --> 09:39.120]  Well, it seems like also there's there's things that Apple is asking for like they won't be upping the rates of the of the shows
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.860]  I guess that's a typical thing that happens. Yeah. Yeah. They're certainly hard-lining to
[09:45.660 --> 09:49.880]  To get this in their favor. Yeah, because it's as Apple does it's totally different worlds
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.360]  like the cable world is a world where it's like maybe when you sign up for cable, there's like a
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.040]  promotion where it's like hey for
[09:58.160 --> 10:04.020]  $89 exactly $89 a month you get this internet and then this TV package
[10:04.020 --> 10:11.400]  But then once that promotions over the your cable bill just starts going from like 89 to 93 to
[10:12.040 --> 10:13.120]  96
[10:13.120 --> 10:16.360]  72 to 101 dollars and 32, you know
[10:16.360 --> 10:18.360]  Like you get these weird bills that are like that
[10:18.360 --> 10:23.040]  Apple's world is if they say it's 29 99 it's 29 99 and it's not it's right
[10:23.040 --> 10:30.120]  It's not gonna go to silently change to 31 dollars and 23 cents just so the ESPN can get 5% more
[10:30.120 --> 10:37.160]  Right actually in Apple's world. It's usually no 99. So it's probably just 29. Yeah, exactly. You're right actually zero zero, right? I mean
[10:38.320 --> 10:44.780]  Yeah, I just I just actually went through this with my cable company. I'm desperately trying to get my bill down
[10:44.780 --> 10:46.040]  I returned my router
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.260]  I returned the other box
[10:47.260 --> 10:52.200]  You know or the modem and then other another box that we had that we just don't use enough and you go in the store
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.760]  And they sort of like well if you sign up for the special deal we can actually knock
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.620]  You know $20 off your bill a month for the next six months and it's like, okay
[11:00.620 --> 11:01.760]  So I'm gonna go through all of that
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.520]  But then in six months, you're gonna raise it again probably more to than what I'm paying now, you know
[11:06.520 --> 11:08.920]  They do all of these behind the scenes
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.840]  Frankly, they're scams really
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.120]  Yeah, it's yeah, it's a low-grade scam, but it's definitely a ski. It's a it's a bait-and-switch
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.960]  Right. I mean mostly just like when I read that article is like oh Apple hates the cable companies as much as we do
[11:23.280 --> 11:24.720]  like
[11:24.720 --> 11:27.240]  yeah, I want to work with them obviously, but and
[11:28.160 --> 11:31.420]  That they specifically mentioned that they don't want like somebody all you know
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.280]  Unnamed but said that you know, we're not we're not like them those music guys who Apple, you know took advantage of
[11:37.600 --> 11:39.000]  I
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.360]  just think that they're just not quite where the music guys were like when and and
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.960]  It is very different because when Apple started with iTunes way back last decade
[11:48.960 --> 11:55.000]  it was Mac only and the Mac was very small and it was no, you know, we were years away from the
[11:56.520 --> 12:00.000]  iPhone and any sort of large market share and there was
[12:01.720 --> 12:08.600]  You know, see ya seemingly overlooked in their negotiations was even the possibility that Apple might offer iTunes for Windows, right?
[12:08.600 --> 12:13.560]  But also what you know, what we were what we didn't have was it was like a pre app world, right?
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.120]  We listen to music through one
[12:16.120 --> 12:19.760]  Service and that was a local service most of the time
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.640]  And so now we live in a world where we are, you know, and this is kind of app
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.720]  You know, obviously Apple's created it but even on the TV they've they've really pushed it that the futures apps, right?
[12:29.720 --> 12:37.820]  And so for many of these companies, they already have a solution that works for them right CBS or NBC or I don't know
[12:37.820 --> 12:43.080]  FX they make you sign in with your cable information and they've still got this presence there
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.640]  Now that makes it really hard for cable cutters, of course, but they have a presence on these digital platforms
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.480]  There seems like less incentive in you know, then when we were in this pre app world for them to want to join it
[12:56.320 --> 12:58.320]  yeah, and I think that
[12:59.940 --> 13:07.040]  You know and the trend is obvious that it may take a what you know, it's it's just it applies to so many things
[13:07.040 --> 13:11.440]  There's that great Hemingway quote about a character. Like how did you go bankrupt and it's you know
[13:11.440 --> 13:13.440]  slowly then quickly
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.040]  And that's how all of these things take all these disruptions is slowly then quickly and it's right now
[13:19.040 --> 13:21.040]  We're at the point where slowly
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.760]  More and more people are not paying for cable TV in their house
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.920]  I mean, I know that listeners of this show are way off the charts in that direction, you know, absolutely
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.320]  People who read your column are surely way off the charts in that in that
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.520]  And they know I need to I need to get behind it. I just there's some things can't live without
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.680]  We're that's how we are. I mean it's for me. It's a couple of sporting sports things and for Amy
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.760]  It's a couple of shows that she likes that don't have
[13:49.100 --> 13:52.920]  You know that they're they're not right. There's no way to get him. Otherwise, right?
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.240]  But we're close and Joan I'll tell you Jonas are you know, he's 12 years old
[13:58.240 --> 14:03.040]  He doesn't watch anything on TV except stuff that we make him watch like get down here and watch Hillary Clinton
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.560]  Give this, you know, he doesn't watch anything on TV if I watch YouTube. Yep, YouTube and and
[14:07.560 --> 14:14.280]  And now a net snapchat Netflix Netflix Netflix, right if we if we Netflix is just I mean
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.280]  This is the summer of Netflix in my opinion. I mean, yes also them raising rates and
[14:18.840 --> 14:24.760]  Issues with their I don't know financial situations, but it's just the stuff they're putting out right now is great
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.480]  If our Netflix like if our credit card that we have on file with them
[14:28.680 --> 14:33.320]  You know needed to be renewed because the expiration date was up Jonas would know within an hour
[14:33.320 --> 14:35.320]  You
[14:36.320 --> 14:43.520]  Would get his his seven or whatever you pay $9.99 and dollars in cash and just say deal with this dad Netflix and YouTube
[14:44.440 --> 14:52.240]  it's you know, and and they you know, it's a reckoning that is coming for them where it eventually they you know,
[14:52.240 --> 14:59.440]  The gravy train of everybody pays for cable and everybody, you know, frankly pays too much for cable is going to come to an end
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.360]  Right, right. Well, we're gonna see put some of this play out in the with the Olympics in a couple of weeks. I mean
[15:06.040 --> 15:08.040]  They are you know?
[15:08.920 --> 15:13.840]  NBC subscribers you need this your cable information to log into a number of different apps
[15:13.840 --> 15:16.160]  That's that's the way they still want to play. Yeah
[15:17.240 --> 15:22.560]  I'm really I hope I have not been following along like trying all these betas over the summer
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.360]  But I'm really looking forward to hopefully everybody getting on board with the Apple TV with that thing that they announced at
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.360]  WWDC where you can say yeah
[15:30.680 --> 15:36.800]  Huge sign in cable thing once and then we will vouch for all of these apps that you are a cable subscriber
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.400]  I know there's like times where I like it happened with the FX app
[15:40.400 --> 15:46.420]  Like I was like put it off as I really want to watch something in here and I just don't remember my cable login
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.240]  You know you like you set up the the rest of your other apps on there and then I'm like, you know
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.560]  And I spend I don't I really probably did spend 30 minutes trying to recover that information and then punching it in
[15:56.560 --> 15:59.400]  There was one a couple of weeks ago. I think it was HBO, but I might be wrong
[15:59.400 --> 16:02.880]  But one of them I was on the Apple TV and and it forgot
[16:02.880 --> 16:08.760]  I've already done it and it like made me do it again and it wouldn't work on my phone for some reason and so I
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.560]  Had to actually go up state which is I mean that's cruel going up a flight of stairs at 11 o'clock at night
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.760]  Cruel and unusual in your slippers. Yes in my head slippers in your sweaty slippers, right?
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.280]  And my sweaty slippers to do it at the desktop, which seemed ridiculous
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.160]  um, so anyway, I think something's going on there, but
[16:27.400 --> 16:33.200]  Well, yeah, it is certainly an interesting report and humorous report
[16:35.560 --> 16:42.480]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor it is our good friends at back blaze back blaze offers you unlimited
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.760]  native
[16:44.760 --> 16:47.040]  backup for your Mac and PC
[16:47.040 --> 16:53.680]  I don't know what a Windows PC is, but apparently it works on it. No credit card required to start no risk
[16:53.720 --> 17:00.240]  You get a free 15-day trial at back blaze comm slash daring fireball
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.960]  Access to all backed up data you get it with the day of an iOS app
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.680]  What you do is you go to back blaze you install a little thing and installs it on your Mac or your Windows computer
[17:09.960 --> 17:15.360]  On the Mac it is written by former Apple engineers. This is not some kind of crappy Java thing. It's not ugly
[17:15.360 --> 17:21.320]  It's just a little system preferences thing that runs in the background and it just automatically backs up everything on your Mac everything
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.240]  Do you have an external like three terabyte hard drive plugged in with like all of your videos and stuff like that?
[17:26.400 --> 17:29.680]  It'll back that up too. There's no limit it did there is you think well
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.120]  There's got to be a catch like over a terabyte you have to pay more. Nope
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.840]  Everything you have in your Mac
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.960]  Just goes right up. It's just five bucks a month for each computer
[17:38.960 --> 17:43.420]  So if you have two computers and you have to pay five bucks a month for each of them sounds fair to me
[17:43.420 --> 17:46.220]  No limit on the amount of data backed up
[17:46.220 --> 17:52.700]  They have collectively at back place over 200 petabytes of data that is stored by them
[17:54.180 --> 17:58.620]  When you need your data back you can use their app you can get one file at a time
[17:58.620 --> 18:05.140]  You can browse the website has your everything listed download one file download a folder you can get it on iOS or Android
[18:05.540 --> 18:08.100]  So it's a great way not really even just for backup
[18:08.100 --> 18:12.820]  It's just a great way to access your desktop files from the phone while you're on the go
[18:12.820 --> 18:19.020]  Or in a case of an emergency something really goes wrong. You need everything but it's like well what I got three terabytes of data
[18:19.020 --> 18:21.940]  I can't just download all this right you can just get them
[18:22.260 --> 18:26.780]  And they'll put it all on a USB hard drive and overnight it by FedEx
[18:26.780 --> 18:32.220]  And you'll just have it next tomorrow morning ding-dong your doorbell rings, and then there's all your data
[18:32.660 --> 18:36.420]  This is an absolutely great deal. I've been using these guys for years
[18:36.420 --> 18:40.240]  I would recommend them to you even if they weren't a sponsor. I cannot say enough
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.020]  I think you should have some kind of backup right there on your desk some you know time machine stuff like that
[18:45.340 --> 18:48.140]  Definitely have stuff like that you can't back up too many different places
[18:48.140 --> 18:53.780]  But an online backup just to make sure you have something off-site so that if something you know if you get robbed
[18:53.780 --> 18:58.060]  Or there's water damage or something like that your roof leaks and gets your desk soaked
[18:59.220 --> 19:00.780]  You're not screwed
[19:00.780 --> 19:04.780]  Can't tell you how much better I sleep at night knowing that I've got stuff backed up at back place
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.980]  So go to back blaze comm slash during fireball
[19:06.980 --> 19:12.040]  They'll know you came from here, and you get a free 15-day trial 15 days to try it before you pay a nickel
[19:14.420 --> 19:16.420]  You love that you love back place
[19:16.980 --> 19:21.020]  I need to figure out my whole backup situation actually you know what I need to do
[19:21.020 --> 19:25.340]  And I haven't done it, and it's criminal because I tell people to do it. I need to sign my parents up for back place
[19:25.860 --> 19:29.380]  And I'm not it's good. I'm not even gonna make it a gift. It's not like I'm gonna say you know
[19:30.020 --> 19:32.140]  Happy Father's Day. It's you know you got back up
[19:32.140 --> 19:37.140]  I'm just gonna do it next time I'm at their house and just pay for it and just not even tell them or
[19:37.300 --> 19:43.540]  You're gonna be like the cable companies, and then raise the rates in like two years exactly and start sending my parents a bill. Yeah, I
[19:45.260 --> 19:49.540]  Want to talk to you because I love your opinions on laptops and tablets
[19:50.140 --> 19:53.660]  What do you think is going on with Apple's lineup of Macs?
[19:54.340 --> 19:57.900]  That has not something I have not been updated in
[19:57.900 --> 20:02.980]  I'm I'm at I mean like I'm eager obviously I love gadgets, and I love
[20:03.620 --> 20:07.780]  Reviewing things, and I love you know helping people get better stuff
[20:07.780 --> 20:13.460]  But I really care about myself right now, and I have a MacBook Air that as you know
[20:13.460 --> 20:18.320]  I you know clung to for many years, and I love the MacBook Air, but it's time
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.380]  It is really time for me to get another computer
[20:21.380 --> 20:27.820]  And this thing is really on its last legs and I need something now like I need something in September
[20:27.820 --> 20:31.080]  Or October so the timing really works for me Apple
[20:31.660 --> 20:34.340]  to release this new rumored MacBook Pro
[20:36.180 --> 20:41.260]  Please please just do it. I feel like and also don't be bad like I need it to be good
[20:41.260 --> 20:46.100]  I feel like there should be like a crew of volunteers who stands outside Apple stores right now
[20:46.100 --> 20:50.440]  And when people go in they say what do you want to buy and if they say they want to buy like a MacBook Air
[20:50.440 --> 20:52.500]  Or MacBook Pro they say no no no don't do it
[20:52.500 --> 20:56.940]  I mean, I'm happy to take that on I just did that in a very public way for the iPhone
[20:56.940 --> 21:01.260]  Yeah, I saw that it's you know do not buy an iPhone right now. I
[21:02.380 --> 21:07.020]  Mean, it's just you know for us like and listeners of this podcast and many readers
[21:07.020 --> 21:13.340]  You know it is obvious, but it really is not obvious to many many people who ask me every year
[21:13.980 --> 21:17.920]  When should I buy an iPhone should I buy the next iPhone should I buy an iPhone right now?
[21:17.920 --> 21:20.200]  I mean, it's still the most common question
[21:20.200 --> 21:25.420]  I get being in this industry and many people you know will head out to the store in in
[21:25.420 --> 21:28.220]  August and go buy a new a new phone
[21:28.220 --> 21:30.900]  And I just don't think you know and I especially don't think that
[21:30.980 --> 21:36.240]  The the rumors that this next phone won't be a big update is even reason to say okay fine
[21:36.240 --> 21:38.620]  I can go buy an iPhone right now. It just isn't
[21:39.780 --> 21:44.940]  But yeah, I don't really I mean there's there's very few Apple products. I would let anyone go by right now
[21:44.940 --> 21:48.540]  I mean the only one I would recommend would be the the one port MacBook
[21:48.740 --> 21:53.220]  You know which was yeah right right didn't refresh a couple months ago, which right in line
[21:53.220 --> 21:58.900]  but other than that even then even then I think there's a decision for many people to make like I'm in the situation where
[21:59.220 --> 22:06.880]  I actually think that MacBook it could do it could be my computer. I wrote this in the in the HP and MacBook review
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.420]  I did a couple weeks ago. It could be but I think there there could be something else
[22:11.420 --> 22:13.940]  That's actually gonna meet my needs a little bit better
[22:14.540 --> 22:16.660]  And that's you know a little bit more power
[22:16.660 --> 22:23.280]  And more some more ports I can make I could probably make do with the port situation now
[22:23.280 --> 22:26.420]  I got one of these hyper drive attachments to the MacBook, and I love it
[22:27.860 --> 22:29.580]  What's that?
[22:29.580 --> 22:37.260]  It's a you know. It's plugs into the USB C port and it's got a SD card reader. It's got a two USB ports. It's got
[22:37.900 --> 22:43.820]  It's also got a display port, but it doesn't really work. Oh, I think I saw that in a I think I think
[22:43.820 --> 22:50.660]  Deeter bone was using that at the keynote early early or maybe a competing one. What's it called the hyperdrive?
[22:50.660 --> 22:52.940]  It's called hyperdrive. I think it's
[22:54.300 --> 22:57.740]  Let's see and a lot of people actually emailed me about it after
[23:00.660 --> 23:04.360]  It's a pain I used a MacBook Air 11-inch
[23:04.360 --> 23:10.980]  Which I loved I really did love the size for years years and years. It was one of my favorite MacBooks. I've ever had
[23:10.980 --> 23:12.700]  But
[23:12.700 --> 23:16.420]  I remember the one time I was at WWDC and I wanted to download all the
[23:17.020 --> 23:22.440]  IOS betas and stuff that they had released and the Wi-Fi there was no way you could possibly it was like, you know
[23:22.440 --> 23:26.240]  This will take 17 days over right and so they had all these Ethernet
[23:28.140 --> 23:32.240]  Things and you could download and it was like super fast Ethernet you could download it in like five seconds
[23:32.240 --> 23:35.540]  And of course, I forgot to pack my Ethernet dongle
[23:35.540 --> 23:41.460]  Yeah, eventually I found a friend. It's you know, that's lucky that I have know lots of people there and I rec
[23:41.460 --> 23:47.100]  You know found somebody who I knew and I was like, hey, can I borrow that and did but I just saw somebody a friend
[23:48.260 --> 23:50.060]  Not a friend, but somebody who I follow on Twitter
[23:50.060 --> 23:55.400]  It was at the Democratic National Convention here in Philly and was like I need an I need a service like uber that will
[23:55.540 --> 24:00.860]  But will deliver a USB Ethernet adapters to the to the convention
[24:02.780 --> 24:04.780]  Yeah, I mean
[24:04.780 --> 24:06.780]  Yeah, this thing's called the hyperdrive USB
[24:07.300 --> 24:13.040]  Type C five and one hub if anyone's interested, but um, I will put it in the show. Yeah
[24:13.040 --> 24:19.640]  I mean, I don't know I like I think that this next MacBook Pro is probably the answer for me
[24:21.640 --> 24:25.760]  But I don't know I don't know where it is, I mean it's there it's got to be coming
[24:25.760 --> 24:30.320]  I mean, it's been so long. It's it's got to be coming and it's to me. What's odd is that it didn't come before
[24:30.320 --> 24:35.320]  Back-to-school, but it wouldn't really work with with Apple's timing on the max
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.680]  Yeah, I mean it's it's a tough situation to tell students what to buy right now
[24:42.320 --> 24:43.320]  because you know
[24:43.320 --> 24:49.880]  This is a computer that should last them for the next four years and I don't think the MacBook Airs is good enough
[24:49.880 --> 24:55.620]  You know, it's sure it's it's definitely the lower end option, but you know some I don't know
[24:55.620 --> 25:01.860]  I just wanted to be a better product. I've said it a few times that my my really biggest regret with my interview with Phil Schiller
[25:01.860 --> 25:05.700]  And and Craig Federighi at WWDC was that I didn't bring this up. I
[25:06.340 --> 25:10.980]  Really wanted to I almost did and then I lost it just got lost in the flow of the conversation
[25:10.980 --> 25:12.740]  And it didn't seem right to go back to it
[25:12.740 --> 25:14.940]  And I really regret it because I think it's an important topic
[25:14.940 --> 25:18.180]  I really would have been interested to hear Schiller's take on it
[25:18.180 --> 25:21.340]  And the other thing about it is at the time of the interview
[25:21.340 --> 25:27.480]  So there's like second week of June the day after WWDC and when I was sort of kind of hoping that they'd have a surprise
[25:27.480 --> 25:29.180]  announcement with a new MacBook Pro
[25:29.180 --> 25:35.380]  That it was only like a one-day-old wound in my psyche that they didn't have a new MacBook Pro
[25:35.380 --> 25:39.660]  I didn't really I didn't feel at that moment
[25:39.900 --> 25:44.540]  Just how weird it was going to feel this summer that the whole summer is gonna go by
[25:44.540 --> 25:50.580]  it was like it just felt like at that moment in June the MacBook Pro was a little old ready for an upgrade and
[25:50.580 --> 25:56.940]  The addition of this summer and in particular with especially with I think with with notebooks
[25:57.100 --> 26:01.500]  The thing about summer is like you said back to school and which is a big time to buy
[26:02.180 --> 26:04.180]  notebooks
[26:05.180 --> 26:09.420]  Just how weird that would it if it feels so much older now
[26:09.420 --> 26:13.560]  Like I know it's only like six weeks after WWDC right now as we speak
[26:13.560 --> 26:20.720]  But it feels like it's it it crossed a border from being a little old to being like ridiculously old
[26:20.960 --> 26:24.080]  Yeah, yeah, I mean and when you look at what?
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.840]  What Apple's done like on the rest with the rest of the line? It's not there yet
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.480]  You know, it's there's there's stuff that needs to be flushed out. So I
[26:34.440 --> 26:40.460]  Don't I don't know. I mean look I I want to think it's gonna be in during the September event
[26:40.460 --> 26:44.860]  But I think there's a lot to cover in the September event. I don't know
[26:46.060 --> 26:49.260]  Well, when do when do we when do we expect I?
[26:50.700 --> 26:57.660]  Think the September event but only because or mainly because it's just it has to when else would it be they're not gonna have two
[26:57.660 --> 27:01.660]  events and you know, I in theory they could have like a
[27:03.140 --> 27:09.300]  Like a boring update to the MacBook Pro that just adds, you know, an updated CPU and GPU or something like that
[27:09.300 --> 27:13.580]  But if they do that it then it just seems ridiculous that they that it took them so long
[27:13.580 --> 27:17.340]  Like I don't think that's happened. I think there's something else I do too
[27:17.340 --> 27:22.260]  I mean also it's there with Sierra right? Like there's some hints in Sierra about
[27:22.820 --> 27:25.940]  Things that should be improved in the hardware. Yeah
[27:27.100 --> 27:33.220]  So I maybe then that's the you know, the timing I don't know in Sierra. What do we did the fall right? They just say fall
[27:33.220 --> 27:38.740]  Yeah, maybe I don't know I don't have any sources or any insight to
[27:39.420 --> 27:42.380]  The Mac line right now. Yeah the last two years
[27:42.380 --> 27:46.200]  I think the schedule has roughly been a early September event
[27:46.300 --> 27:50.260]  with the iPhone new iPhone coming out like the next week and
[27:50.360 --> 27:55.300]  the new iOS coming out at the same time or like a day or two before right the phones and
[27:56.060 --> 28:01.180]  Then the new version of Mac OS comes out like and they'll tell you in September
[28:01.180 --> 28:03.960]  But it would that it'll be out at the end of October or something like that
[28:04.620 --> 28:06.620]  All right, so maybe there's something in October
[28:07.060 --> 28:12.380]  Yeah, the question is do they do iPads at this first event, you know the iPhone event?
[28:13.740 --> 28:16.740]  And there's been some rumors of new Pro a new Pro
[28:16.740 --> 28:21.580]  I mean, I don't understand how that's really gonna be updated in a big way. But um, I
[28:22.340 --> 28:24.340]  Think there's been some leaks of that
[28:24.420 --> 28:29.620]  Well one thing I've when I've been I've speculated about this on Twitter and other places people have said no
[28:29.620 --> 28:33.360]  There's no way they're going to you know, they don't want to share the stage with the iPhone
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.460]  But the truth is the last few years. They've actually always shared the stage with the iPhone
[28:38.460 --> 28:42.180]  They use the fact that the world's attention is on them for this announcement
[28:42.260 --> 28:48.360]  Everybody's iPhone iPhone iPhone iPhone new iPhone and they use it but spend most of the event on other things like two years ago
[28:48.420 --> 28:52.620]  It was here was like everything. Yeah last year was Apple TV and the
[28:52.620 --> 29:00.680]  And the Pro right and the pencil and all that all the third-party apps that already, you know, they'd given pre-release access to the pencil for
[29:01.620 --> 29:03.820]  Yeah, they had the three, you know at the end of the event
[29:03.820 --> 29:09.560]  They had the three big demo rooms, which was like honestly like the iPhone was the smallest part of the thing to see
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.100]  Yeah, I remember but like oh crap. I got to go see the iPhone
[29:14.100 --> 29:19.940]  And yeah, there was that whole big room for the Apple TV the whole big room for the Pro and then iPhone
[29:19.940 --> 29:23.780]  Yeah, and I always take notes on the time like it, you know how much you know
[29:23.780 --> 29:30.300]  When when new products come out on stage and I remember I don't think the iPhone took more than 20 or 25 minutes
[29:30.300 --> 29:32.740]  It was you know, it was like hey hello
[29:32.740 --> 29:39.820]  here's Phil Schiller and 20 minutes of here's the new iPhone success and success plus and then the rest of the show was Apple TV and
[29:40.860 --> 29:46.540]  iPad Pro. Yeah, I think I think if you look at the heart, I think if I think there's there's hardware
[29:46.540 --> 29:53.940]  To come in three places in the fall. I think it's iPhone. It's Mac and I think it's watch
[29:54.980 --> 29:57.140]  and I think iPad
[29:58.540 --> 30:03.980]  The reason I say that is because of the software like what we saw at WWC there were clear hints about
[30:04.740 --> 30:09.620]  Hardware improvements that would be that would optimize for the software or vice versa
[30:10.220 --> 30:13.660]  I don't feel that way about iPad, but
[30:13.660 --> 30:15.660]  You know, I don't know
[30:16.700 --> 30:21.940]  and you know like with iPad there's so many software things that I feel like need to be fixed and
[30:23.100 --> 30:27.500]  Or with you know as it moves to the Pro and I feel like we didn't give a sense of that in iOS 10
[30:28.380 --> 30:33.060]  Yeah, and and there have been rumors Federico to teach you who's you know?
[30:33.060 --> 30:39.340]  The guy by far and away go to guy the guy at Mac stories the go-to guy for iPad productivity
[30:39.340 --> 30:44.540]  I mean this guy's been like living his life with all these crazy workflows and stuff like that on the iPad
[30:44.940 --> 30:46.940]  He does all of his work on the iPad
[30:47.460 --> 30:51.820]  What he heard was that it's I don't know what they're gonna number it
[30:51.820 --> 30:57.820]  but that it's more or less that the major improvements to iOS with a focus on the iPad Pro and and
[30:57.980 --> 31:03.420]  Pro users is sort of like an iOS 10.1 type thing that might be like January or February
[31:04.140 --> 31:06.140]  That's a great. That's a great
[31:06.140 --> 31:09.860]  Report a rumor. Does that mean that that would make more sense?
[31:09.860 --> 31:14.740]  I don't know how much that those wishful thinking like yeah, right. We all want them to write like
[31:15.660 --> 31:17.660]  So true. I'm like
[31:17.860 --> 31:24.460]  Whose podcast was I on where I was like, I feel like many times Apple rumors are just what people want
[31:25.340 --> 31:29.660]  like the Android for I'm I message for Android rumor like and
[31:30.140 --> 31:31.760]  We should talk about that because that you know
[31:31.760 --> 31:35.420]  I think both of us sort of were hoping for something like that at WWC
[31:35.420 --> 31:42.060]  But you know and it was pretty unreliable sourcing on that, you know, but it's like everyone wanted it
[31:42.060 --> 31:48.580]  So everyone said yeah, this is a rumor that you know, the people wrote it and I mean, I'm not saying it's it's unreliable
[31:48.580 --> 31:54.400]  Maybe somebody really did have good sourcing on that. But that felt like one which was like, oh, yes, that's what I want
[31:55.100 --> 31:57.100]  It was Mac
[31:57.140 --> 32:04.940]  Daily news which is a weird website that has been around for ever. I'm almost certain it predates during fireball
[32:04.940 --> 32:08.020]  I think it's been around since like the late 90s and it's
[32:09.020 --> 32:13.540]  I don't know if he's secret and I don't even know if it's really he I don't know
[32:13.540 --> 32:17.240]  I'd say but the whoever it is who writes it doesn't never puts a byline on it
[32:17.240 --> 32:23.940]  So like when I linked to that rumor and he doesn't usually have news. It's usually more like he points to things elsewhere
[32:24.460 --> 32:29.420]  Yeah, he writes he'll usually link to my stuff. I didn't realize that's where it started. Yeah, he
[32:29.420 --> 32:35.660]  He he said, you know, it was his original thing that he heard from a reliable source that Apple's working on
[32:36.780 --> 32:40.620]  iMessage for Android and that it's going to come out at WWDC and so when I linked to it
[32:40.620 --> 32:46.140]  I was like because I always like to put the name of whoever wrote it like the reporter, you know
[32:46.140 --> 32:50.420]  I don't like to just say the Wall Street Journal says I like to say, you know
[32:50.660 --> 32:53.260]  Here's the reporter writing for the Wall Street Journal, right?
[32:53.260 --> 32:59.540]  Because I think that's important. And so for his I wrote whoever the hell it is who writes Mac, Mac Daily News
[33:00.580 --> 33:03.900]  I have heard I can say I
[33:04.540 --> 33:05.580]  Haven't seen it personally
[33:05.580 --> 33:11.620]  But I have spoken to people at Apple who have seen the mock-ups of iMessage for Android
[33:11.660 --> 33:17.500]  So I don't know that it exists like that. They have like an app that's been made but there is absolutely been
[33:18.500 --> 33:21.660]  consideration of it. Yeah, but the guy and I think it makes sense and
[33:21.660 --> 33:25.900]  and Cook has said and I forget there was two interviews where he said
[33:26.780 --> 33:32.540]  We we are making it a priority to bring service our services to other platforms
[33:33.780 --> 33:37.900]  I think it was around the music launch or something around then
[33:40.620 --> 33:46.220]  What I heard and this makes total sense and sounds very happily was that it was a series of 10 mock-ups of
[33:46.220 --> 33:53.700]  What I mess complete mock-ups of what I message for Android would look like ranging from like on one would be
[33:55.180 --> 34:01.660]  Just looks exactly like the iOS version and 10 is looks as much like pure
[34:03.060 --> 34:05.060]  What what's the Google UI?
[34:05.860 --> 34:10.140]  theme called material design as as
[34:10.140 --> 34:17.020]  Pure material design as possible with like two through nine being a continuum of how much it looks like that
[34:18.020 --> 34:23.120]  Which is also to me an interesting thing in terms of the difference between Google and Apple where Google stuff on
[34:23.340 --> 34:30.060]  iOS is very popular and but yet really looks a lot like material design and Apple music on Android
[34:30.060 --> 34:36.740]  I think is actually pretty you know on that scale of one to ten. I think is sort of like a seven or an eight
[34:36.740 --> 34:40.020]  It's it's much more Android like than iOS like to my eyes
[34:40.740 --> 34:47.540]  Yeah, I actually can't say I've ever used it. So well, I've I've installed it on my little I've seen the screenshots
[34:48.780 --> 34:52.660]  Called it and poked around just to see like what the sharing sheet looks like and stuff like that
[34:52.660 --> 34:53.860]  but anyway
[34:53.860 --> 34:57.460]  I and here's my argument for my argument for putting some credibility on it is
[34:57.780 --> 35:03.500]  Like some when that rumor leaked a lot of people wrote to me and said no way would Apple do this because they sell
[35:03.500 --> 35:07.620]  Hardware, they you know, it behooves them to keep iMessage proprietary
[35:07.620 --> 35:10.580]  But my answer to them is nobody buys an iPhone to get iMessage
[35:10.700 --> 35:16.000]  It's it's a nice thing to have once you have an iPhone and you're in the Apple ecosystem, but nobody buys it
[35:16.100 --> 35:19.340]  That's not a selling point. It's just a nice thing you get afterwards
[35:19.540 --> 35:24.620]  I think where Apple could make some money on this is if they if they add payments to iMessage
[35:24.740 --> 35:28.260]  Yeah, if I can send you money by Apple pay over iMessage
[35:28.260 --> 35:32.060]  Then I think it makes all the sense in the world for there to be an Android version, right?
[35:32.060 --> 35:36.700]  I do question nobody buys an iPhone because of iMessage
[35:36.700 --> 35:44.380]  I think it is one of the lock-in apps that sort of like I wouldn't consider going to an Android phone
[35:45.140 --> 35:49.740]  Mostly because of iMessage like there's a fit. I have a family conversation
[35:49.740 --> 35:54.180]  I have a friend conversation all of you know, these groups in my life and they're on iMessage
[35:54.260 --> 35:58.420]  that's a good point and I don't think I can get them all to pick up and go to
[35:58.420 --> 36:03.660]  Whatsapp or or Facebook Messenger, but I don't look I don't think
[36:04.100 --> 36:05.420]  I don't know
[36:05.420 --> 36:10.740]  I don't know enough about the market of how big that market is for people who feel like iMessage is the reason
[36:11.660 --> 36:17.500]  You know, there's there's plenty of other great things about an iPhone. That is probably what that is a good point
[36:17.500 --> 36:21.860]  I actually I'm gonna I'm gonna say that you changed my mind. I changed your mind. Yeah
[36:22.900 --> 36:26.500]  because you know what I was I was too focused on the upfront idea of
[36:26.500 --> 36:31.100]  Buying an iPhone whereas once you have an iPhone and you're used to iMessage
[36:31.100 --> 36:34.300]  It absolutely is a reason that you'd be a little reluctant to switch
[36:35.020 --> 36:38.900]  Right. So it is it's the lock-in angle that it more than the upfront angle
[36:38.900 --> 36:40.900]  Like once you have it, you don't want to lose it
[36:41.140 --> 36:45.300]  I just couldn't like even when I'm reviewing an Android phone. I
[36:46.300 --> 36:50.220]  Try, you know, I'll put my sim in but I'll still keep my iPhone on
[36:50.220 --> 36:58.820]  Wi-Fi or whatever because I got it. I gotta get my iMessages and I hear about my syncing with my Mac, but you know, I
[36:59.860 --> 37:05.780]  Think that like many times I think Apple it's not like Apple doesn't enjoy lock-in features
[37:05.780 --> 37:11.780]  But I don't think that they prioritize them over other things and I don't think that I think whatever lock-in advantages
[37:11.780 --> 37:14.680]  They see with iMessage being iOS only for mobile
[37:15.740 --> 37:18.340]  could easily be overruled by the
[37:18.340 --> 37:22.800]  the the money they could make by having Apple pay as a
[37:23.980 --> 37:25.980]  device to device payment method
[37:26.100 --> 37:27.580]  Mm-hmm
[37:27.580 --> 37:31.300]  But there is a trade-off there. There's definitely a trade-off. I mean, I'm going through right now
[37:31.300 --> 37:35.940]  It's just like I wish that I mean and maybe it will be with the new iMessage in iOS 10
[37:35.940 --> 37:38.900]  like Venmo will be easily integrated into the
[37:39.820 --> 37:41.820]  What are they called message apps? Mm-hmm
[37:42.700 --> 37:46.820]  But I don't see why Apple doesn't just do it itself. Hmm. You know what I mean?
[37:46.820 --> 37:49.740]  Like why doesn't it just power through Apple pay?
[37:49.740 --> 37:55.060]  I you know say I want to send $15 to to Gruber and I you know
[37:55.580 --> 38:00.580]  Inside an iMessage window. I hit my I hit touch ID and it goes through. Mm-hmm
[38:00.980 --> 38:07.140]  Yeah, I think it definitely should right it should just happen. I don't know. I'm writing my column for next week is all about
[38:07.660 --> 38:13.180]  The chip card disaster and so I'm very very into payments right now. I
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.820]  I love payments. I love I'm Apple paying everywhere
[38:19.140 --> 38:21.140]  Yeah, it's just great. I
[38:21.260 --> 38:25.340]  Was just talking about this last week on my show with Glenn Fleishman that
[38:25.980 --> 38:32.380]  it somehow I don't know if it if if it just is coincidence, but a whole bunch of places here in Philadelphia have just
[38:33.020 --> 38:35.180]  upgraded their their terminals
[38:35.700 --> 38:38.560]  And put in the chip readers. Yeah, and they
[38:39.080 --> 38:41.960]  They all have handwritten stickers. Yeah. Yeah
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.020]  No chip chip networking chip doesn't work yet. No chip yet. Don't chip here
[38:48.220 --> 38:51.660]  Yeah, I'm like, I've spent a lot of time reporting this story
[38:52.940 --> 38:58.860]  I'm excited about it because it's been such a disaster in New York too. It's been a national disaster. It's a headache. It's just a
[38:59.740 --> 39:03.460]  But um, I actually think I'm not gonna spoil my column here. Yeah
[39:05.140 --> 39:08.500]  Basically, I think that this will push us all to use our phones
[39:08.500 --> 39:15.500]  It's actually the best thing that could have ever happened to Apple pay and to Android pay because all of the terminals that are being installed
[39:16.100 --> 39:21.420]  Have NFC in them. And so it's basically a software upgrade on the point of sale
[39:22.660 --> 39:24.300]  people
[39:24.300 --> 39:28.220]  Companies have spoken to to enable that for that for the retailers
[39:28.220 --> 39:33.620]  Yeah, and the thing that's interesting to me is that you don't need to see the Apple pay logo for Apple pay to work
[39:33.620 --> 39:40.140]  It's just like the one that just looks like a little almost looks like a Wi-Fi symbol and it right it always it always works
[39:40.140 --> 39:44.100]  There was work. Yeah, there was one time last week where it didn't work for me at Starbucks
[39:44.100 --> 39:46.500]  It gave me it like I don't know I got in some kind of circle
[39:46.500 --> 39:49.700]  But then the next day I went back and and it worked again
[39:50.340 --> 39:53.140]  With no Apple pay logo on the Starbucks one, right?
[39:53.140 --> 39:53.380]  Yeah
[39:53.380 --> 39:59.300]  It's weird because Starbucks does support Apple pay and they never have signs that say we have this there and that's one of the things
[39:59.300 --> 40:04.180]  I'm writing in this piece is that you know set up your phone for Apple pay and just try it first
[40:04.180 --> 40:07.260]  I mean, yeah, you're already gonna lose a lot of time out yet with the chip
[40:07.260 --> 40:09.180]  I get it, but you know
[40:09.180 --> 40:14.320]  It's kind of like the same amount of time to just try it. It doesn't work. You have your credit card. I
[40:15.420 --> 40:19.860]  And it's so funny because Apple pay what was it two years ago where it first came out?
[40:20.580 --> 40:25.500]  Yeah, and it's and and Whole Foods had it and I'd use it there and I'd get the Wow
[40:25.500 --> 40:30.020]  What was that? You know, like holy heck that you know, what are you doing there? And now all of a sudden that it's working
[40:30.020 --> 40:33.920]  At all these other places. I'm getting it all over again. Like people who've never seen Apple pin
[40:33.920 --> 40:36.160]  You're like, what did you just do and I'm like, oh it's called Apple pay
[40:36.220 --> 40:39.820]  You'd like just take a picture of your credit card, you know, go to the wallet app
[40:39.820 --> 40:41.620]  Take a picture your credit card
[40:41.620 --> 40:45.940]  And then you can just go up to places and just put your finger on the thing and they're like that is the coolest thing
[40:45.940 --> 40:49.580]  I've ever seen. Yeah, I think a lot of people don't even know that it's there and
[40:50.460 --> 40:55.060]  Especially also now that it you know, it's it's gonna probably work more on more and more phones
[40:55.060 --> 41:01.260]  It's it's I think it's a the chip thing has been a disaster, but I think there's a silver lining in it
[41:01.260 --> 41:04.440]  I noticed it was a very interesting to me as a
[41:05.740 --> 41:12.740]  user experience critic I bought some shorts at J crew and they had the chip thing and
[41:13.700 --> 41:17.220]  Your shorts did know how the the terminal. Uh-huh, and
[41:18.740 --> 41:24.220]  I put my I put my credit card in for the chip and then went through the chip process and
[41:24.220 --> 41:31.380]  When it was done, it was like authorizing you wait a second. And then when it was done, it made this terrible noise like
[41:34.580 --> 41:40.000]  And on the little terminal it says remove card now remove right now in all capital letters
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.300]  And so somebody decided that to make sure nobody forgets their credit card. Yeah, right better make a scary sound. Yeah
[41:47.900 --> 41:53.100]  It's the complete opposite of Apple pay where when Apple pay is confirmed you get this beautiful
[41:53.100 --> 41:57.980]  I sometimes I sometimes I'm going through the video right now and I'm trying to collect these sounds
[41:58.940 --> 42:03.460]  So like we're at we're gonna like we actually have to hold the mic up at the at the register
[42:03.460 --> 42:07.380]  You know to get the the sounds but you're totally right. I know exactly what you're talking about
[42:07.380 --> 42:13.020]  So with Apple pay you get this beautiful ding and it just feels like hey, you just did something cool
[42:13.020 --> 42:17.980]  You're living in the future and with the chip you get like this. Yeah, it sounds like the Star Trek
[42:17.980 --> 42:21.940]  You know red alert when the Klingons are attacking like you're about to die, right?
[42:21.940 --> 42:28.580]  No, the whole the whole situation is just like who yeah, I mean it does feel like taking 15 steps back
[42:29.300 --> 42:31.860]  With the whole payment system is like I get it secure
[42:31.860 --> 42:38.460]  but like I'm having this hugely awkward 10 seconds where I don't really know what to do and you know
[42:39.620 --> 42:46.860]  Yeah, I've also like I mean New York City store clerks are sort of fed up with me because I've been going into stores and doing
[42:46.860 --> 42:53.060]  Six methods of payment. So like I collect all this stuff and I like I'm like, I'm gonna actually need to put this on six separate
[42:53.580 --> 42:55.580]  cards
[42:56.300 --> 43:02.260]  Did it at Trader Joe's which is like typically the longest lines in New York City and the woman was like just dying
[43:02.260 --> 43:04.740]  She's like this is so cool. Who's gonna win next?
[43:07.300 --> 43:11.740]  Yeah, so I'm payment obsessed but uh, I look forward to it
[43:11.740 --> 43:16.100]  I think that it's it's just so interesting to me that it seems like
[43:16.100 --> 43:18.100]  Apple pay was
[43:18.740 --> 43:22.580]  Ahead of its time because it's already here and ready to capitalize on this
[43:23.820 --> 43:28.060]  Seemingly mass turnover and point-of-sale terminals that that's happening right now
[43:28.460 --> 43:32.200]  Yeah, and it's actually it's I've been thinking back on this because you know now
[43:32.780 --> 43:39.260]  Being in the industry for almost a decade you sort of get to to really see those moments when a company does
[43:39.740 --> 43:45.180]  You know as it usually typically is Apple takes what has been going on and makes it
[43:45.180 --> 43:50.060]  Really really seamless and you know, I was thinking back to Google Wallet, you know
[43:50.060 --> 43:54.980]  I was one of the people who wrote about the first impressions of Google Wallet and you know
[43:54.980 --> 44:00.500]  It was like this hugely clunky thing where you had to hold the phone up to the right thing you had to launch the app
[44:01.140 --> 44:04.180]  You know, it only worked on the Nexus. What was it the Nexus?
[44:04.860 --> 44:06.380]  Might have been just the Nexus
[44:06.380 --> 44:12.340]  Samsung Nexus, you know and it only worked at like one retailer in the country and it just didn't work, right?
[44:12.340 --> 44:16.100]  And then so, you know, you had a couple of iterations of that and then you know
[44:16.100 --> 44:22.900]  Then Apple pay comes out of whatever. It's actually probably like four years later Apple pay, you know requires the fingerprint
[44:22.900 --> 44:23.820]  It works really well
[44:23.820 --> 44:28.460]  It launches the thing and that we have Samsung pay that basically does the same thing
[44:28.740 --> 44:33.580]  Even better because it works at more places and we have an Android pay that also does the same thing
[44:33.580 --> 44:38.300]  So, you know, there's took it a little bit of time for us to get here
[44:38.300 --> 44:43.700]  And there's certainly a uphill battle as you know, a lot more retailers have to try and support this
[44:43.860 --> 44:50.340]  But it really does feel like there was this turning point with Apple pay. Yeah, I really want to see this NFC stuff
[44:50.780 --> 44:54.540]  go elsewhere to like I really want to see the
[44:55.900 --> 44:58.820]  airports switch from those infrared scanners to
[44:59.460 --> 45:05.820]  To NFC. I hate I just hate putting my phone down like when they want you to like let go of your phone and put
[45:05.820 --> 45:09.380]  It on the glass. I don't like to let go of my phone. You know what I mean? Right? Yeah
[45:09.660 --> 45:11.460]  Just let me put it in here
[45:11.460 --> 45:15.420]  And I so badly wanted in a minute the subways and metro cards
[45:15.420 --> 45:20.940]  It's just I'm constantly not sure how much money is on my card and you lose the card
[45:22.340 --> 45:24.260]  Yes, absolutely
[45:24.260 --> 45:28.820]  Yeah, there's so much more potential and I mean I really do think at some point, you know
[45:28.820 --> 45:36.260]  The phone is obviously the wallet but there's just you know in terms of identification as well. All right
[45:36.260 --> 45:40.580]  Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor. It is our good friends at igloo
[45:41.500 --> 45:43.580]  igloosoftware.com slash
[45:43.980 --> 45:46.500]  TTS the talk show TTS
[45:47.580 --> 45:49.780]  Anybody who's worked in a corporate environment knows how painful
[45:50.420 --> 45:52.420]  Intranets can be the content is stale
[45:52.420 --> 45:57.720]  The interface is ugly and it doesn't work on your phone and because of all those things nobody updates it
[45:57.720 --> 46:04.440]  Igloo is a modern internet that you will actually like because it is designed for the user
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.720]  It is not designed for like a bunch of IT guys. It is designed to be like nice
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.200]  It gives you the flexibility to get your work done
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.880]  How you want to where you want to and on whatever device you want it scales right down to your phone
[46:17.880 --> 46:20.220]  It looks great on your giant 5k iMac
[46:20.840 --> 46:23.660]  it is truly a modern product for
[46:23.660 --> 46:28.740]  2016 not for 1997 and it is easy to configure too
[46:28.740 --> 46:33.580]  So if you're the point person on your small team and you're the one who's going to set up the igloo internet
[46:33.580 --> 46:40.220]  It is easy to do. It's all drag-and-drop. It's visual. It is logical. It is sensible. It's humane
[46:40.220 --> 46:45.740]  It is not like you have to get in there and enter but you know config files or something like that. Nothing like that
[46:46.440 --> 46:51.080]  Totally modern easy for a non tech person or designer type person to just set up on your own
[46:51.080 --> 46:57.660]  You can share news you can organize files coordinate calendars manage products projects all in one place
[46:57.660 --> 47:03.380]  And everything can be social with comments and like buttons. So it's like you can have your own internal private team
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.860]  Internet where you post a little micro post like Twitter. You can collect likes you get comments
[47:09.580 --> 47:11.100]  and
[47:11.100 --> 47:14.720]  Just really really easy drag-and-drop for all the configuration
[47:14.720 --> 47:20.240]  Go to if you've got a small team go to igloo software comm slash
[47:20.760 --> 47:27.280]  TTS you'll get a free trial. They will know you came from this show and you'll get started in like five minutes
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.680]  my thanks to igloo a
[47:31.040 --> 47:37.420]  Couple other things and you've been writing about him you wrote I thought a really interesting column on the $50
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.200]  I
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.680]  Forget what it's called. The blue are one HD, which is kind of a mouthful. That's this is the phone that
[47:44.920 --> 47:50.440]  It's made by a company called blue and the Amazon selling it for 50 bucks. And how much is the one with more storage?
[47:51.600 --> 47:53.600]  60 bucks
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.140]  It's just so funny like with Apple it goes up $100 to get more right? Yeah. Yeah, it goes up $10. I
[48:02.160 --> 48:04.160]  Know it's yeah
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.600]  100 $60
[48:06.600 --> 48:13.920]  A pretty decent Android phone and the biggest catch is that when you're the lock screen is full of Amazon's
[48:14.440 --> 48:15.920]  special offers
[48:15.920 --> 48:18.600]  Yeah, it is the catch a big one. I
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.120]  Think that Amazon could have some serious success with this
[48:25.120 --> 48:26.040]  I I don't know
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.920]  I don't want to bet on it because I feel like Amazon's never really been able to sell phones
[48:30.080 --> 48:32.720]  But I feel like if anything's gonna work, it's this
[48:33.800 --> 48:35.800]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean
[48:35.800 --> 48:42.640]  I think I think if they had some higher-end phones with this model, it could be really interesting
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.520]  I think in these in these lower-end cases, I think certainly there's certain good
[48:48.160 --> 48:50.640]  Substitution or burner phones in a way like, you know
[48:50.640 --> 48:56.640]  If you're you've broken this is actually the the CEO blue told me this that one of their biggest markets is people who break
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.080]  iPhones or Galaxy phones and don't have the money right away to go buy a new one, you know
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.920]  Especially now that people are buying phones outright and might not have insurance, etc
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.480]  So they buy these phones and sort of hold on to it for a couple months
[49:10.240 --> 49:17.000]  Or you know, it's used for travel or it's used for kids. So there's sort of like lower-end phones in that sense
[49:18.200 --> 49:20.200]  But yeah, I think for for Amazon
[49:20.200 --> 49:26.240]  This is sort of makes the most sense and even I think they're I think even even without the ads
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.000]  I spoke to an analyst even without the ads
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.800]  They could probably stand to take to bring down the price and take a hit if they're really loading up with some of their services
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.560]  Right because when you get the phone you log in to Amazon and it sort of logs you into all the Amazon apps
[49:41.920 --> 49:47.720]  So, you know music and Alexa and Kindle shopping and Kindle exactly. Yeah, exactly
[49:49.320 --> 49:55.400]  You know, it's a pretty good experience for for if you're really all-in on Amazon and it's
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.880]  It seems so much better than the fire phone that they tried like two years ago
[50:01.880 --> 50:05.480]  Which really was I mean hats off to them for trying something new
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.040]  but it just seems like that whole project went way off in the rails once they started going in the direction of
[50:11.720 --> 50:16.120]  having the the user interface that tilts in 3d as you move the phone, it's like
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.040]  you know cool demo but like
[50:19.040 --> 50:25.800]  Terrible idea for actual usability and they got they were too close to it to recognize that and actually brought it to market
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.680]  You know, yeah, and they also were cutting off Google services
[50:28.680 --> 50:35.800]  Which is just like what are you you know, you're you know, in many ways Amazon's a perfect complement to Google on the phone
[50:37.120 --> 50:39.120]  But it's not a replacement, right?
[50:39.640 --> 50:46.760]  Amazon doesn't offer email, right? Yeah. Yeah or any what Maps do with what Amazon offer, you know
[50:46.760 --> 50:50.640]  a calendar right it's like with with the
[50:52.160 --> 50:57.360]  Alexa what's in my device called when I talk to my Alexa X echo. Yeah my echo. Yeah
[50:57.360 --> 50:59.800]  I just want to call it my act my Alexa
[51:00.360 --> 51:02.560]  If you want to get your calendar on there you you know
[51:02.560 --> 51:08.280]  The best really the only integrated calendar is Google Calendar because Amazon doesn't have a calendar product
[51:08.560 --> 51:13.720]  right and you know in terms of Amazon's bottom line and trying to get you to buy things like
[51:13.720 --> 51:20.120]  a Google doesn't try us to really get us to buy things other than it's sort of the ads it wants us to get to
[51:20.120 --> 51:21.320]  I mean
[51:21.320 --> 51:27.640]  You know with with Amazon that it's sort of integrated experience of books and movies and music
[51:27.640 --> 51:32.400]  I mean, yes, obviously Google also has their solution there, but that's it's not the first thing that comes to mind when I think about
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.400]  Google
[51:34.680 --> 51:38.920]  Yeah, so I mean it's it's a pretty good experience for for an Amazon user, you know
[51:38.920 --> 51:44.840]  I I wasn't crazy about the ads on the lock screen. I just think it's a pretty personal thing and it's I mean
[51:44.840 --> 51:48.700]  It's funny you kind of like, you know, you want to keep looking to see what the next one's gonna be
[51:49.160 --> 51:51.160]  But I feel like that would get a little old
[51:51.200 --> 51:54.200]  You've gotta have you've you've got your dog on your lock screen, right?
[51:54.200 --> 51:56.120]  I have my dog at my lock screen, of course
[51:56.120 --> 52:02.480]  and so when you're trying the blue phone and instead of seeing your your dog you see an ad for
[52:02.480 --> 52:10.160]  No, I saw I was seeing I was seeing photos of other dogs that are not as cute because I was getting ads for for
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.840]  Dog food. Oh
[52:11.840 --> 52:16.880]  So yeah, that's a little that's a little too on the nose. I know
[52:17.560 --> 52:19.560]  We're not cute dogs
[52:19.880 --> 52:22.200]  So, you know, it's yeah
[52:22.200 --> 52:26.560]  I mean there but there are other ones too, which I was like I got one for a few like a dietary supplement
[52:26.560 --> 52:31.600]  It's like what are you trying to tell me Amazon? And then one of them was that for typing tutor and it was like
[52:31.600 --> 52:35.880]  What why would I am a great typer? I'm the best typer. I know
[52:37.680 --> 52:39.680]  Just like Donald Trump, yeah
[52:40.280 --> 52:45.480]  I've seen you type you are believe me. I'm a great typer. You're love typing
[52:46.880 --> 52:50.680]  It is true though. Like you do take those things personally. Yeah
[52:52.360 --> 52:55.600]  I don't need to go in a diet. I mean, I probably do but whatever I
[52:56.240 --> 52:58.240]  Don't need Mavis Bacon telling me
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.400]  It
[53:00.400 --> 53:08.080]  Definitely interesting and I mean what's what's really interesting is how cheap that hardware is and how impressive it it is for the price
[53:08.080 --> 53:14.440]  You know, I'm impressed that their CEO was so honest with you, you know that this is a phone people buy when they you know
[53:14.640 --> 53:20.640]  You know can't afford to you know, they just broke their two-year-old $700 iPhone or a galaxy
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.660]  Yeah, I mean at a $50 price point, but they have phones at a hundred and thirty dollars
[53:24.660 --> 53:31.780]  But but you know, probably not great cameras, but certainly good enough for many people and they're selling a lot of those too, you know
[53:32.680 --> 53:38.440]  It's the it's and there's this whole phenomenon happening in Android phones. The best Android phones right now are $400
[53:38.800 --> 53:42.960]  They're great. This one this new one plus is amazing for the price
[53:44.220 --> 53:49.440]  You know a great camera fingerprint sensors work great good builds good screens
[53:49.440 --> 53:56.520]  You know, you're when you when you want to go up and you want to get sort of the iPhone equivalent in Android or Samsung
[53:56.520 --> 53:58.800]  that's what you're paying six hundred and fifty dollars for but
[53:59.280 --> 54:04.520]  Look, if you want a good phone and you do want to pay $400 you're getting an Android phone. Yeah, it's funny
[54:04.520 --> 54:09.160]  I guess you're getting a S an SE right? I mean s no an SE is
[54:10.440 --> 54:17.080]  What is an iPhone se costs 450? Yeah for 99. I forget maybe 399
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.400]  I think it might start but that is 16 gigabytes
[54:20.120 --> 54:22.200]  Yeah, so I always I just pretend like it doesn't exist
[54:23.040 --> 54:26.100]  Right. I think it's like for 99 to get like a reasonable amount of it
[54:26.100 --> 54:29.400]  Well, that was my scoop of the summer and that was the my you know
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.080]  The the next iPhone will start at 32 gigabytes my sources say oh, that's great news
[54:34.520 --> 54:40.760]  Yeah, that is I hope you're I really hope you're sure. Oh, I mean I reported it in that piece on
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.720]  You know don't upgrade your iPhone right now or don't buy an iPhone right now is sort of hidden in there
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.080]  But that was that was the best I could dig up on the on the new iPhone
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.240]  I missed that but that is actually wonderful. I would have been on that
[54:52.240 --> 54:57.800]  I have no inside information on that whatsoever, but it's just my gut feeling that it's just preposterous
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.580]  If yeah, and then I think Apple heard that but I think also the cost of storage is so down that it doesn't affect their
[55:04.580 --> 55:10.720]  Bottom line anymore to just give us 32 the question and what I couldn't get sources on was sort of the tears
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.720]  That would be happening after that
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.040]  Obviously, there's these rumors that will go all the way up to 256 and I believe that
[55:18.760 --> 55:20.360]  So
[55:20.360 --> 55:25.920]  Because of the camera in my opinion. It's the single biggest reason is that these cameras that
[55:26.800 --> 55:29.800]  The still images are like if you have live picture on
[55:30.680 --> 55:36.240]  They're like 13 megabytes. Yeah, I think yeah, this was my argument in the in my success review last year
[55:36.240 --> 55:44.040]  um, which was that you know two things absolutely need to be improved and number one was storage or number one was battery life and
[55:44.040 --> 55:50.120]  number two was storage and it was because the camera that I had gotten better and you want then we had added 4k they had
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.120]  added 4k video and
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.240]  We were still stuck with a base of 16
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.280]  4k video at a 16 gigabyte storage card is it's right
[56:00.280 --> 56:04.800]  It just does not it doesn't job and it's and look it's not enabled out of the box
[56:04.800 --> 56:10.920]  But I'm Apple was marketing that this was this was a 4k capable phone and they were certainly I mean
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.240]  the biggest marketing point was the live photos which were three times the size of your regular photos, so
[56:15.980 --> 56:20.360]  You know give us the storage and it sounds like we're gonna get the storage so I'll stop complaining
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.240]  Yeah, I don't know if I'll stop complaining about battery life, but we'll see about that
[56:24.560 --> 56:31.760]  Yeah, so it's $4.99 for the 64 gigabyte SE and it is $3.99 for the 16 gigabyte SE
[56:32.640 --> 56:34.280]  alright, so
[56:34.280 --> 56:35.960]  Yeah
[56:35.960 --> 56:37.960]  All right, so there's decent
[56:38.960 --> 56:40.560]  um
[56:40.560 --> 56:46.160]  Decent value in comparison to the $400 Android phones on the Apple side. Yeah, I
[56:47.040 --> 56:51.400]  think that's so unbelievable that the blue is just admits that you know, hey, that's what these, you know
[56:51.400 --> 56:53.400]  some of the market for this is people who just need a
[56:54.120 --> 56:57.720]  Stopover phone just pop your sim in there and get by for a while
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.120]  Yeah, you know
[56:59.120 --> 57:05.640]  I actually I might end up buying one because what I usually do is I have this new process which I wrote about last year
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.440]  Which is that I will sell my iPhone about a month ahead of the new launch
[57:10.880 --> 57:16.120]  To make back a good amount of money on it, and then I'll put that money towards the next iPhone
[57:16.920 --> 57:18.480]  Instead of doing these upgrade plans
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.440]  This has just worked for me and I'm lucky enough to have enough phones lying around that
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.000]  I have a phone a loaner phone for the month of you know, August or September
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.880]  But you know, the blue is actually a great option for people who are just like I know I'm gonna get the next iPhone
[57:33.880 --> 57:40.560]  I want to make you know, 500, you know, 550 depending on what size phone you have and you know
[57:40.560 --> 57:45.400]  Sell it at the end of August or beginning of August and use the blue phone. Yeah
[57:46.440 --> 57:47.560]  I
[57:47.560 --> 57:52.960]  Also think and you were saying about how a lot of the the Android phones, you know, I'll have good screens
[57:52.960 --> 57:53.920]  I'll have good cameras
[57:53.920 --> 57:58.880]  It's I've noticed that too and it's not surprising because I think that it's the you know
[57:58.880 --> 58:05.280]  This is the single most competitive market in all of consumer electronics. I mean, it's everybody has a
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.600]  I just call them phones now, but everybody has a smartphone
[58:10.360 --> 58:17.360]  And it's funny how that the technology the the water finds its own level fairly quickly where just a few years ago
[58:17.360 --> 58:18.160]  I mean
[58:18.160 --> 58:23.600]  I remember that even the top of the line Android phones had the worst color on those OLED screens
[58:23.600 --> 58:26.800]  Like it it and for someone picky like me
[58:26.800 --> 58:32.700]  It was just unbearable like the way that like pinks would I remember the flicker logo
[58:32.700 --> 58:39.080]  it would like sear your retina because of that pink on the flicker logo because it like hit the sweet spot of OLED where it
[58:39.080 --> 58:45.560]  Just like went off the charts in terms of being like super saturated. Yeah, that used to be Samsung's huge problem
[58:45.560 --> 58:49.220]  Yeah screens and and it really made you know
[58:49.220 --> 58:52.540]  Like you could design around it in the user interface
[58:53.340 --> 58:56.460]  By picking colors that look good on OLED but like for a photography
[58:56.460 --> 59:02.340]  It was it was just dreadful because things it looked like you applied like a weird Instagram filter and your photo
[59:02.340 --> 59:04.820]  It was just like though. That's just your picture, right?
[59:05.300 --> 59:09.420]  Yeah, I mean that's that's that's over. That is it's like I haven't seen a
[59:09.980 --> 59:13.900]  Even medium to high level Android phone that has weird color issues
[59:13.900 --> 59:18.700]  I'm sure that you can you know that the experts, you know, you can look at them and see the fine differences
[59:18.700 --> 59:23.660]  But like just like to the just the basic eye of the eyeball test of looking at it. They all look good
[59:24.100 --> 59:30.740]  Yeah, I mean and then the Samsung phone is just it's is beautiful now that the screen is beautiful
[59:30.740 --> 59:33.420]  Yeah, and I think that the cameras are all decent
[59:33.420 --> 59:37.660]  I think I still think that the iPhone has a pretty, you know a noticeable advantage
[59:38.900 --> 59:42.660]  Maybe not over to the highest end get the new galaxy, which is yeah
[59:42.660 --> 59:48.740]  It seems to have a good camera, but that's a new that's brand new phone but over like the mid mid market Android phones, but
[59:49.100 --> 59:51.100]  even there the cameras are
[59:51.580 --> 59:56.940]  Really good compared to even like standalone point-and-shoots from a few years ago. Oh, yeah
[59:56.940 --> 01:00:03.260]  Yeah, I mean the the camera on that blue that $50 blue was horrendous. I mean like
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:10.460]  Horrendous when you go up even to a $200 Android phone Huawei makes a really good $200 phone with I think it's like a
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.060]  13 megapixel camera who knows what kind of sensor but
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.020]  That is a that's like, you know
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.960]  certainly
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.960]  passable for many people
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:21.780]  but yeah
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:28.640]  The $400 phones certainly don't take as good of shots as the s the s7 or the iPhone, but yeah, they're good
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.460]  Let me take one break before we wrap up the show
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:38.420]  And thank our third and final sponsor of the show and another one of our longtime good friends longtime sponsor of the show
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.820]  Fracture fracture is a photo decor company throughout to rescue your favorite images. We're just talking about photos right here on the show
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.860]  What do you do with them once you have them on your phone?
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.140]  Take your favorite ones and get them printed out
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.180]  Fracture is a place for you. They you send them your photos
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:57.420]  They print them directly onto glass and they add laser-cut rigid backing
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.520]  So they're ready to display right out of the box. You give them your photos you pick the sizes
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.460]  Couple days later you get them back in the mail and you just open them up and they're ready to hang up
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.980]  They even include the wall anchor if you get the smaller ones
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:15.000]  They have a little built-in thing you pop them up on your desk edge to edge. No frame necessary
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.020]  You don't need to put them in a frame. They don't have a frame
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:21.080]  They're just a piece of glass that you just hang up edge to edge and it is amazing
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.260]  I can assure you like people who haven't heard of it you hang them up on your wall when people come in your house
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.540]  They're gonna be like, how did you do that?
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.580]  because they've never seen anything like it because when you print pictures to traditional way on
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:37.220]  Paper and then put them behind glass. You have to have a frame behind it. You get this edge-to-edge effect
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.800]  That looks it almost looks futuristic. It is amazing
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.580]  All of their pictures that you buy from fracture come with a 60-day. They call it a happiness guarantee

[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:52.780]  Is I want to talk to you about this whole windows 10 upgrade thing because this is like I'm vaguely aware of it
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.820]  But my weird like I don't use any windows stuff
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:00.120]  Means that I'm not really aware of it. Can you explain this to me? Sure
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.140]  Okay, you ready for the for the deep explanation yes, okay
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.860]  So it's actually pretty complicated and I said in that piece that like it's you know
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.900]  these I don't understand why Microsoft didn't just do these updates in one fell swoop, but
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.420]  So last year a year ago today
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:27.060]  a day yep, right a year ago today Apple really Apple Microsoft released Windows 10 is a free update for Windows 8 and Windows
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.660]  7 users
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.300]  Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:36.940]  So you've been able and I'll just point out for those who don't remember they skip Windows 9. They did skip Windows 9. That's right
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:42.420]  And so for the last year you've been able to upgrade for free
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.060]  but today
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:51.820]  Tonight at 11 p.m. Hawaii time, which is the most random time zone ever
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.340]  You will no longer be able to upgrade for free
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.700]  so
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.700]  That is what today is
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.740]  Is everyone with me? All right, then on August 2nd, which is
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.860]  next
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.780]  Monday Monday
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:19.620]  next Tuesday Tuesday the anniversary update goes out so people who have had Windows 10
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:26.220]  For the last year or the last couple months. We'll get this push about
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.700]  download Windows
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:32.460]  10 anniversary update and that update adds
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.740]  very few new features some good stability
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:44.280]  fixes in Microsoft Edge browser, which is kind of a big deal because it's like what most people use on their on their computers
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:50.300]  It has extensions now. There's a lot of new stylus tricks that they have that you're actually pretty cool
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560]  Cortana does some more things
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.720]  it's you know, it's small it's sort of like a
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.200]  you know the equivalent of a El Capitan release for for
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.940]  um grapple right a year a year in
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.000]  But yeah, it's kind of confusing right one day was the end of the
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:18.160]  Free updates for all for all users and then next week is this and then if you were one of the people who just updated
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.700]  Right now like today to Windows 10. You won't actually get that anniversary update for a month or so. So
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.560]  Yeah, it's pretty staggered
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.840]  Why would they do this? I think well the answer I got was basically it was two separate teams
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.440]  It was timing of two separate teams
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.560]  Yeah, yeah
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:44.720]  Why is there like an accounting angle like where where for accounting purposes?
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.220]  They can't just continue to give Windows 10 to other people for free
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.920]  No, I mean, I think that was just like us. I think that was if an offer and that was a marketing push
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920]  You know, it was a marketing push. I think
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.320]  Um, they're still in the business of selling window idea, right?
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.560]  They're still in the business of selling windows, but they are you know, there's definitely hints that windows as a service or a subscription
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:13.880]  Could be something that happens. I certainly think they're they're setting up for that
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.160]  But I don't know and I don't know
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.560]  Yeah, I just don't know what they're really sort of thinking in terms of
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.760]  And it does seem to me, you know
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:35.160]  Somebody who casually looks at all these big companies quarterly reports when they come out just to keep an eye on you know
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.920]  Who's doing well and whatever it really does seem to me that under Saudi and Nadella Microsoft is very successfully
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.660]  weaning itself or maybe has already weaned itself away from being the company that sells windows and office that they have
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.700]  Serious significant, you know, same scale, you know
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:58.340]  The company is as big as it was as revenue that you know on these services that make up for it that they could definitely
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.020]  You know, it it doesn't seem foolish, you know, ten years ago
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.460]  It would have been ridiculous to say that they should just make windows free
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.380]  But it seems now it seems like well as a front end to these services that they're selling
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:15.060]  You know and to do it on a subscription model. It doesn't seem silly at all, right?
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.980]  Well, they want to obviously be a services
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:24.580]  Company and I think you know as they move into more of these, you know sort of
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:31.780]  AI or you know the Cortana's of the world and the other types of services they're trying to build into the operating system
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.500]  You know the more we come to lean on those types of things and the more we we sort of want to pay Mike
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.620]  Or we may we may use Microsoft services across our devices
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.820]  You know, especially on the iPhone Apple's done a
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.340]  Microsoft's done a really good job with some of those iPhone apps
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:53.820]  You know, maybe there's a chance they think you know you buy a you know
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:08:00.220]  You sort of lumped in with your office 365 subscription and you get all of this other stuff. I don't know. I don't know
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:06.060]  What about this whole thing where too many people are obviously getting like?
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:11.580]  A surprise your computer has been updated to Windows 10. Yeah, it's hugely a huge problem
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:16.660]  So like my understanding is that they have configured default settings or made it
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:22.820]  So that if you just click through set up like maybe like two years ago or whenever when you got your Windows 8 computer
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:29.420]  That it's all set up so that at some point overnight. It's going to update itself to Windows 10, which is a major update
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.260]  Yeah, and people are very upset about this. People are really upset about
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.700]  Ones in one. I think what happened was and I've gotten
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:43.340]  In general, I've never gotten so many reader angry reader emails as I have gotten this week
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:46.220]  It's not about what I'm about to talk about but it is about
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.780]  Huge customer service problems that Microsoft seems to have on this
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:58.060]  and you really want to talk about Microsoft needing to control the hardware and software experience is I
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.260]  Mean I see it in every single one of these emails
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:06.140]  Which I wish I could respond to so I'm sure none of these listeners are actually the people who have emailed me
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.820]  They're they're they're quite old. I can tell from the fonts and the
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.780]  signatures that I get in these emails, but
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.180]  they're just
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:21.980]  Infuriated that you know, they updated and their printer doesn't work they updated and the driver for their the graphics driver doesn't work
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.220]  You know there I and I and I have not had these problems
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.060]  I upgraded three old laptops in the last two weeks when I was writing that piece
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:34.380]  I actually think Windows 7 is Windows 10 is really stable and I really like using it
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:40.220]  There's a lot of similarities to the Mac when it comes to handling your your apps and stuff like that
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.500]  So yeah, I think I think it's a huge customer service problem
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:49.660]  But the issue on the upgrade what happened was there was a pop-up like I turned on these old computers and I had tons of Windows 10
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:56.300]  Upgrade pop-ups and my whole video is basically the pop-up interrupting my sentence because it I couldn't like
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.220]  I would launch these and it was like every five minutes, you know would say oh
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:05.260]  Did you know Windows 10 is up and your upgrades expiring and it's like I freaking told you to go away
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:11.100]  But what happened was was one of those pop-ups, I guess, you know, you don't read it very closely
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:17.340]  And so one of them said, you know, your computer will upgrade to Windows 10 tonight if you know at this scheduled time
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:22.860]  And you know if you have a problem with that, you know, kick cancel or whatever and people didn't hit those they hit the red X
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:33.420]  right and there it ended up just it didn't end up overriding the pop-up or whatever the command was to start upgrading and that's
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.420]  What happened right and it's the people just were like my computer upgraded overnight and I told them no
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.740]  Right, and it's one of those things that's always bugged me about Windows as a UI
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.140]  nerd and critic is the way that they often have those windows where there's both like
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.980]  Okay, cancel and a red X right and it's like I think it is if you're a that's a bad design
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.180]  It's a really bad design
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:02.620]  But if you're gonna do that the it is very natural to think as a just a normal person who doesn't think about the UI
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:09.340]  Just you know reacts to it that the red X means do nothing that it's like cancel right that that should not
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:16.940]  hitting the red X to close the window should not mean okay go ahead and do this super significant almost risky thing
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:21.740]  Right and actually it the pop-up that I put in the in the article I wrote this week
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:27.340]  It says, you know, sorry to interrupt, but this is important Windows 10 free upgrade offer will end July 29th
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:34.940]  Right. It's this big text, right and then underneath it says upgrade now within a box or remind me remind me later in a box
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:41.900]  And that's all those are the main options, right? But then in the bottom left hand corner and I'll send you this link
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:48.620]  It says do not notify me again in a similar purple to the purple pop-up
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:54.860]  So it's almost like so hard to see that it's like it you wouldn't you wouldn't notice it, right?
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:59.420]  Like if you get this pop-up, you just want it to go away either hit the X or you hit remind me later
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:05.260]  Right because you don't have any other option is this in your survival guide to perpetual windows. Yeah
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.420]  Yeah, I've already got that link. I've got that purple, you know the and it's crazy
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:17.420]  It's just like that's not fair to people but and then and you know what I couldn't get and and I think this is something that happens
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:23.020]  It's happening and I think this is actually a separate piece. It's happening to every all of our operating systems
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.820]  I talked about in this piece, but you know Android iOS it doesn't matter Mac Windows
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:34.460]  These companies want to get you on their newest operating system. They want to do it for a couple of reasons
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:40.220]  You know in in Microsoft's case, it's actually a little bit unclear. Obviously. They would love everyone to be on it
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.820]  I think there there is some some data mining going on that I think really does benefit
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.320]  Microsoft in the cases of Apple
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:52.380]  It always seems like it's security and it seems like a bragging right that they get to say
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.420]  Everyone is on this latest operating system
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:02.180]  But certainly security and features play pretty high on the top of the list of why they want people on the new software
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:08.620]  Unless there's something else I'm missing. I mean, what is the other main reason these companies want us on their latest software?
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.940]  No, I think you hit them. Yeah, I think you know security is one
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:18.300]  I think new features that they want people to have access to or another, you know, I know with with iOS
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.780]  Mac OS to a lesser degree I think but
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.100]  With iOS, I know that there are and I've written about it many times
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:33.820]  There's often complaints from people with like three-year-old iPhones who find that their experience degrades after they go ahead
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:41.300]  And do what is obviously what Apple wants you to do is and I think that they've changed it
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:47.220]  I don't think that it automatically updates, but they've made it even more aggressive. I think starting last year in terms of yeah
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:52.620]  automatically, but it will say it's I think there's the same options upgrade now remind me later and
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.300]  You know, there's oh, I think what they've changed. I know it
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.840]  I know what they've done is that they've changed it where it's like upgrade now and like the next schedule it
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:08.300]  Yeah, the next button which makes you think like it's maybe like now don't do it really means I'm gonna do it when you plug
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.500]  Me in. Oh, right. I'm gonna schedule it. Yeah
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:17.620]  Yeah, that's what it is. And it's a you know, it's nowhere near as sneaky as I think what Microsoft is doing
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.820]  But you could argue that it's it's not bad UI design. It's sort of
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.940]  sneaky UI design
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.560]  Right. It's definitely the case that the security issues are real though. Like oh, yeah for sure
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:35.660]  I was talking on this show last week with Glenn Fleishman about these these bugs that were fixed in this
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.820]  these image format things where you know,
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:44.500]  all these bugs were discovered where the the way that you could send somebody an iMessage with a
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.640]  Maliciously designed image and just by looking at the iMessage you you know
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.960]  You could be exploited and they fixed it but they've only fixed it in the very latest versions of iOS and Mac OS X and
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.940]  At least to my knowledge. They haven't done like so if you're along like, you know
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.740]  Yosemite still you do, you know, you don't have a fix for this yet
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:08.460]  So the only way to get these fixes is to stay like totally up-to-date
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.480]  Mm-hmm, right, right, which yeah, I mean
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:18.980]  That's certainly the the right incentive to also tell users because that's that's scary
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:22.460]  That's you know, you don't want to be put at the put it blame for that
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.700]  Yeah, anything else that you wanted to talk about this week Joanna
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.780]  So many things to talk about I don't know I
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:36.660]  don't know if there's only one more thing I'd pick your brain about is I
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:45.140]  Looking at everybody's results some strong quarters from lots of people Facebook and and Google both did really well online advertising Twitter
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.660]  Not so good
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.100]  And I I don't know. I'm not a business expert. I could be totally wrong
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:55.180]  I have a gut feeling like Twitter is not long for this world as an independent company
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.020]  I think somebody is gonna acquire them and I my question is who?
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.500]  Like a question if Verizon bought Yahoo, why not Verizon I
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.300]  Think Verizon's got all this money and they want content, right? I'm not saying it'd be a good idea
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:16.860]  I'm not saying that Verizon would be good or bad as a parent, but I could see them being interested in it. I
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.860]  Could see that too. Also just for the sort of TV integration to yeah
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:27.300]  Comcast is would be another one that I would think might because they have more money than they know what to do with and are
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.020]  Sort of looking to own
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.020]  content, right
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.420]  Right, just a gut feeling I want to be I want to be able to say I was right when Twitter ends up being acquired
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.540]  sometime in the near future no, I think I think that's a
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.260]  Yeah, I don't know where where makes sense. I don't know
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:50.540]  I don't know that makes sense is the right way to think about it because I don't think it makes any sense for
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.140]  Verizon to buy Yahoo's web, but they did it, you know
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.420]  I think that's maybe that's what I've the it's the Yahoo thing that put put it in my head to where
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.300]  Verizon buying Yahoo doesn't make much sense to me
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:07.660]  Mm-hmm, but then I realized like so stop thinking of who would make sense for what to buy Twitter and just think who would do
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.980]  it
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:13.240]  Hmm, and that's what made me think like Comcast or Verizon or somebody like that
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.940]  right
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.980]  Yeah, I mean I think the when you think of Twitter as like, you know
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:26.580]  I said a couple of months ago and piece I wrote, you know Twitter really isn't a social network. It's a it's a media site
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.740]  Yeah, and they don't they don't know it themselves
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:34.300]  They don't know it now, but they're starting to get into it a little bit more
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.580]  I think also the focus on periscope who there's been a lot of updates to periscope, which is
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.620]  it's a sad things now everyone's not using Facebook live and it's gotten tons of buzz this summer and
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.900]  You know, this was an opportunity Twitter really could have been a head out on that and they weren't
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.020]  Yeah, and it seemed like just in the last two weeks as a political junkie watching that the two conventions
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.900]  It seemed like whenever they were talking about people streaming stuff from their phones
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.620]  it was always it was just
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:06.460]  Facebook live was what it was almost like, you know and like in Chelsea Clinton's speech last night when she was talking about her grandkids
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.900]  Talking to Hillary Clinton. She just said FaceTime, you know, like FaceTime is the thing right when you talk
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:18.140]  That's just what people say and for this like broadcasting. I'm here and I'm gonna broadcast to people on social network
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.900]  It's Facebook live definitely and I like periscope and I hope periscope, you know continues to thrive
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.940]  But it seems like Facebook live just swooped in and ate their lunch, right, right
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.380]  I mean because people are there and also periscope really not till like a couple of months ago
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.420]  It was really sort of integrated in the Twitter experience, right?
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:39.700]  I mean, it's sort of like was like we own this thing and you can get your Twitter followers integrated here
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.940]  But like, you know watching one of those through the Twitter apps and stuff was not a was not a thing
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.340]  And now they've worked on that integration more
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.680]  Yeah, that was that was my last thing Joanna Stern, thank you so much for your time
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:59.160]  I want to ask you one question. I've been thinking about the the Apple watch a lot lately because I finally I
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.880]  I'm gonna I took mine off for a couple of months. I just did not find it
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.920]  useful
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.920]  for for things that
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.240]  mostly I use the Apple watch to tell the time and when I was working out and it's sort of like I
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.060]  Just got tired of working out with it on it would just it lost its its relevance to me
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.200]  What do you think?
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.080]  You think there's gonna be a new one in the fall? You know what? That's an excellent. I
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.320]  It's like everybody's saying iPhone iPhone iPhone. What's it? You know, it's gonna look like the old iPhones gonna have a new camera
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.640]  It's gonna be thinner. It's gonna be lighter. It's gonna be way faster, you know, blah blah blah
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.840]  Yeah, no headphone all this, you know
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.840]  Pages and pages and nobody's talking about Apple watch. I think that they're definitely gonna do a new Apple watch in September
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.500]  I don't know. I really only information about this at all, right and we've heard no leaks which is interesting
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.200]  But I only think that because of watch OS 3 and so as I'm wearing this watch again, you know
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.120]  I kind of keep thinking in the back of my head
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.160]  I have I don't have OS 3 on here
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.800]  But I keep thinking this thing's gonna be so much better with when I have watch OS 3 on here
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:06.560]  And then I sort of keep thinking well what what would the hardware improvements be that would make that even better?
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.640]  And I happen to think they all a lot of them are fitness related because that was the real focus at WWDC
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.600]  Yeah, I think fitness related
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.080]  I think that they've realized, you know with once it's out in a real world that the fitness stuff is off the charts popular
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.440]  So and it seems like there could be design
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:29.640]  Considerations to emphasize that more and I think now that they've rethought the way that the two buttons work the crown, right?
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.840]  But that's right. That's right. They've rethought the way they work in the OS
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:37.500]  I think for the better even on the old watch the existing watch that we know but if they're
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.080]  Rethought them like that in the software. Why not? I don't know what they would do
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:47.200]  I don't know but it's something to make them even more apt to the new purpose in the OS totally
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.260]  Totally and I think that and I think the thing could be thinner. Yeah for sure
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:57.240]  Yeah, so battery life possibly a little bit better, but you know, I find it crazy that there's no speculation about it
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.920]  I don't know if it's something to do with the fact that like somehow in this supply chain
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.560]  They've got a new you know
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.040]  They're doing it in a way that actually can hold the secret in a way that the iPhone supply chain obviously can't
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.520]  And and because of that if it doesn't leak through the supply chain
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:17.080]  It just doesn't percolate out to our speculation, but it seems crazy to me that there's not more speculation right now
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:24.640]  At the beginning of August end of July about a device that I think we're gonna hear about in like six weeks, right?
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:31.800]  Maybe it doesn't ship then. No, I just like they did it, but but this year they would have to ship before Christmas, right?
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:36.820]  Yeah, November. Yeah, they could ship as late as like early November
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:42.600]  I think but that I that's all and I I would expect that I would expect that the iPhone ships in September
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.800]  But that if they do announce a new watch, it'll be like October thing. Yeah, I agree
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.440]  Yeah, I I'm you know, I feel like that's one of the big, you know, hopefully we'll be surprised when we
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.140]  Go out there in September to hear about this stuff, but I'm with you
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.960]  I think that they're gonna do it and the fact that there's no rumors about it. I think it's just sort of
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.560]  I don't know what it is. I I guess I mean maybe I'm wrong
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.400]  Maybe there is you know, they're just heading to Christmas selling the same watch
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.240]  They've been selling for two years, but it seems crazy to me that it costs like a hundred dollars, right?
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.160]  200 bucks last year right like the the one who offered a target. I
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.160]  Mean and that's the one I see that's I see that one a lot
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:29.480]  I see women wearing the rose gold one that was offered on cheaper at Target and Walmart than most most of them, huh? I
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.480]  See a lot of women wearing them. I see more and more. I see an awful lot of them
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:41.560]  Yeah, I mean that's you know, New York workout scene. There's Apple watches and there's fitbits. There's fitbits, but
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:48.920]  That's like one of the things I'm also really excited about which is the competition stuff. That's you know, you can compare others
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.000]  I'm excited about that and watch OS 3
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:58.120]  Yeah, so I definitely think that that is I think it's just overwhelmed by that speculation about the new iPhone whatever they're gonna call it
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:05.560]  right, I definitely think it's coming and I think it'll be really really interesting because I feel like the iPhone is at a point where
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:11.520]  It's almost 10 years old and there it's not surprising to me that the new iPhone is supposedly so similar to
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.600]  the success because they've had so many times to iterate it that they're they've sort of
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:21.120]  Achieved the the platonic ideal of the form factor at least in their mind
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:27.320]  Whereas the watch they've only done one and it's like think back to like the early years of the iPhone and how?
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:33.880]  Quickly they you know went from the original to those plastic 3gs to the 4s or the foreign 4s
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.360]  You know
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.280]  They made significant improvements and changes to the form factor in just a few years and I feel like they could do the same
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280]  With the watch, right, right
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.920]  And last but not least if we're going to talk about that
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.080]  I do believe because I know people will ask I believe that if they do have a new watch that it will remain strap
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.280]  compatible with the existing watch straps
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.680]  Yeah, I think that makes sense. That's why that's why I put this new watch on I actually found this band
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.360]  It's like the it was the new felt band. What is it? What do they call these? Oh, I forget what that's called
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.120]  And I really like it
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.520]  Like, you know, it kind of like and I you know the whole band thing. It's really it's so smart
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:18.000]  I mean really the nylon one. Yeah, like yeah, it's not felt it's like braided not fabric. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.320]  I mean, it feels like a new watch to me. Yeah, that's my favorite too, especially for wearing it to like exercise
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.640]  You don't like to wear it when you exercise or you do. No, I do and I like but I I have the one with the the
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.640]  metal
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:39.280]  Link band, you know, which is more like a serious dress band and it just it just feels really weird to me to go out
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.280]  Yeah, I can't work out with that. Yeah, right
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.080]  It just feels too heavy and it just feels weird when you sweat on it
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.920]  And whereas this nylon fabric feels like it's almost like an athletic material. Yeah
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.880]  Yeah, my problem with it is that it like unlike the sport band. It's like can't get it that tight around my wrist
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.300]  So the heart rate monitor doesn't work as well if it's not snug like really snug
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560]  But yeah, it looks really nice
