[00:00.000 --> 00:24.420]  Oh boy, I'm way into this.
[00:24.420 --> 00:29.380]  You have no idea how long I've been, how I've been looking forward to this.
[00:29.380 --> 00:30.380]  Is that weird?
[00:30.380 --> 00:31.380]  Should I not?
[00:31.380 --> 00:32.380]  Should I play it cool?
[00:32.380 --> 00:33.820]  No, I don't think it's, I don't think it's weird at all.
[00:33.820 --> 00:36.760]  If anything, I feel like one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you about, I mean I've
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.720]  been wanting to talk to you about this ever since we were in Montreal last year and we
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.920]  were both, we both talked to each other into being super excited about the watch.
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.920]  Is that I feel like too many other people are playing it cool and they're trying to
[00:49.920 --> 00:50.920]  be credible.
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.920]  Reserving judgment.
[00:51.920 --> 00:57.240]  Yeah, and it's, and that's totally cool like to, you know, I think just being completely
[00:57.240 --> 00:58.240]  honest.
[00:58.240 --> 01:02.400]  There's a lot of things to complain about too, but I feel like, I don't know, I feel
[01:02.400 --> 01:03.720]  like not being excited about it.
[01:03.720 --> 01:04.720]  What's the fun in that?
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.920]  Oh no, this has got, I mean you, you got to treat this like Christmas.
[01:08.920 --> 01:15.120]  When I was probably seven years old, I got a transformer watch, a wristwatch that was
[01:15.120 --> 01:22.080]  a transformer for Hanukkah and I cried and I feel, tears of joy, tears of joy, yeah,
[01:22.080 --> 01:24.840]  tears of transformer Hanukkah joy.
[01:24.840 --> 01:30.120]  And I think that I, there's no reason I shouldn't have the same reaction, literally.
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.680]  As opposed, as opposed to the kid across the street who got a GoBots watch and cried.
[01:34.680 --> 01:36.440]  Because it sucked.
[01:36.440 --> 01:37.440]  Because it wasn't.
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.440]  Nobody wants that.
[01:38.440 --> 01:39.440]  It wasn't transformers.
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.440]  It was the GoBots.
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.440]  Oh boy.
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.740]  GoBots was like the original Samsung.
[01:52.740 --> 01:58.840]  So you, you know, you reminded me that I used to be a watch guy and I haven't.
[01:58.840 --> 02:05.040]  I haven't for so long, but when I was a kid, my grandfather was an accountant and one of
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.720]  his clients was a, I think a reseller of Casio watches.
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.880]  And so every, like once a year he would hand me down the, you know, like the last year's
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.440]  version of a data bank or whatever it was.
[02:18.440 --> 02:25.000]  And that, you know, that was just, you know, I think that was like just early gadget fetish
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  for me.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.480]  And, and like you said, you know, last year, last, you know, your last episode with multi,
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.280]  you were talking about how inscrutable those interfaces were and how you basically had
[02:37.280 --> 02:45.480]  to memorize like the equivalent of a, of a, you know, NES Contra code just in order to
[02:45.480 --> 02:48.360]  like get to, you know, timer mode or something like that.
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.240]  So it was like triple click the lower right button to get into the mode where you can
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.240]  set the alarm.
[02:53.240 --> 02:54.240]  Yeah.
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.920]  Which looked exactly like the mode for setting the time, except that there was a little tiny
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.320]  button like an A that would flash that meant, Hey, this is the alarm.
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.520]  And then you would just have to know that you were setting the time for your alarm and
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.480]  not changing the time on your watch.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.480]  Right.
[03:09.480 --> 03:11.800]  But once you got there, it felt so good.
[03:11.800 --> 03:12.800]  Yeah.
[03:12.800 --> 03:15.000]  One of the things that's just a little thing.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.660]  And I know that it's, I think, I feel like the two main points of like the big question
[03:21.660 --> 03:29.160]  marks is does, should anybody be excited about Apple watch in general as just like a thing
[03:29.160 --> 03:30.880]  they might want to wear the wrist.
[03:30.880 --> 03:34.840]  And then there's this whole other angle where I know that as time goes on, you say things
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.280]  and I keep seeing it on Twitter when people, you know, people like to complain on Twitter.
[03:38.280 --> 03:41.760]  I don't know if you ever noticed that, but then they'll say like, you mean, you know,
[03:41.760 --> 03:43.840]  and they just say like, this is really cool thing you can do.
[03:43.840 --> 03:46.840]  This is a nice part of wearing the Apple watch every day.
[03:46.840 --> 03:49.880]  And then they say, you mean exactly like every other smart watch on the market for the last
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.880]  two years.
[03:50.880 --> 03:51.880]  And it's like, okay, yeah.
[03:51.880 --> 03:55.640]  You know, maybe they, you know, give some points to some of these other guys for shipping
[03:55.640 --> 03:56.640]  first.
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.640]  I mean, but it doesn't take away that it's a nice part of the experience on the rest.
[04:01.640 --> 04:04.360]  And one of those things, one of those little things is that you never have to set the time
[04:04.360 --> 04:05.360]  on the watch.
[04:05.360 --> 04:06.360]  Yeah.
[04:06.360 --> 04:09.960]  It's like once you've paired it with your phone, it always just gets the time.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.960]  Yeah.
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.200]  I mean, that's, that's, that's one of those things that's completely invisible.
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.300]  I've not, I've not once thought about that fact, except that's just the time you take
[04:18.300 --> 04:22.820]  it for granted because, um, clocks set themselves now.
[04:22.820 --> 04:24.120]  That's what clocks do.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.120]  Right.
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.940]  And I was thinking about that with the context of those old digital watches, like I wrote
[04:27.940 --> 04:32.200]  about from my teenage years where I can't even remember whether some of them, and I
[04:32.200 --> 04:34.720]  guess I just went through them every couple of years.
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.680]  Cause they, they even back then, they weren't that expensive by the eighties, like in the
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.360]  seventies digital watches were really expensive and by the eighties they were, you know, you
[04:41.360 --> 04:44.240]  get them for your eighth grade son without thinking about it.
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.560]  But I think that I had some that, that you could set the month, even though it didn't
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.720]  show it like on the face because it was like too much detail.
[04:52.720 --> 04:57.740]  But then at least that way, when like April 30th rolls around and it goes to May 1st,
[04:57.740 --> 05:01.580]  it doesn't tell you that it's the 31st, I think.
[05:01.580 --> 05:04.880]  But it was like, you had to, it just was another thing you had to set though.
[05:04.880 --> 05:08.120]  Like if the battery, like when you did change the battery and had to start over from scratch,
[05:08.120 --> 05:12.300]  you had to set so many different fields, the hour, the date, the time, the day of the week,
[05:12.300 --> 05:14.000]  you know, all this.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.760]  But I think at that point in technology, we didn't, we, we didn't, I don't, I, this,
[05:20.760 --> 05:22.080]  I might be wrong about this.
[05:22.080 --> 05:28.040]  We weren't thinking that far in advance to, we wanted our gadgets to know how to do things
[05:28.040 --> 05:29.040]  themselves.
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.280]  I don't, I don't think that that was an expectation.
[05:30.280 --> 05:33.420]  It was almost like, no, of course it's like a manual transmission.
[05:33.420 --> 05:34.520]  You want that control.
[05:34.520 --> 05:44.960]  You want like to take out of the box, unfold the like 18 fold, mostly Japanese instructions
[05:44.960 --> 05:52.280]  and then figure out what is the, is the code you need to get to, to, to, to get to, you
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.200]  know, world time or something like that.
[05:54.200 --> 05:59.320]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not, yeah, I wasn't even complaining about it and I didn't complain
[05:59.320 --> 06:00.320]  about it when I did it.
[06:00.320 --> 06:01.320]  I thought it was a cool feature.
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.360]  I was like, Hey, this is great.
[06:02.360 --> 06:06.440]  This way when you know, a short month rolls around, I won't have to worry about it.
[06:06.440 --> 06:11.680]  I'll go through the hassle now of setting everything so that I don't have to do it again.
[06:11.680 --> 06:12.680]  Yeah.
[06:12.680 --> 06:17.360]  So are people asking you, I mean, obviously people on this, people online obviously, but
[06:17.360 --> 06:22.080]  people in the world, are they seeing your watch and saying, Hey, what do you, what do
[06:22.080 --> 06:23.080]  you think of that?
[06:23.080 --> 06:24.080]  Yeah, totally.
[06:24.080 --> 06:30.800]  I, I've, I'm about, I haven't kept her exact count, but if I had to guess, I would guess
[06:30.800 --> 06:38.120]  that I'm 23 out of 25 for when I use Apple pay at whole foods and that's probably about
[06:38.120 --> 06:41.600]  right because it's been a little bit over a month and I go there just about every day.
[06:41.600 --> 06:48.100]  Um, I'd say about 23 out of 25 times the cashier has commented on it even though I'm definitely
[06:48.100 --> 06:52.160]  trying to do it as subtly as possible because I'm trying as like I'm playing a game where
[06:52.160 --> 06:57.800]  I'm trying not to be noticed using the watch to Apple pay and yet they inevitably notice
[06:57.800 --> 07:03.440]  and out of the two times that they didn't, the one time it was a cashier who I'd had
[07:03.440 --> 07:06.700]  before and she was, she just kind of gave me the, Oh, you're the guy who already has
[07:06.700 --> 07:11.120]  the Apple watch and then there was one time where the cashier didn't, didn't make note
[07:11.120 --> 07:12.120]  of it.
[07:12.120 --> 07:14.720]  And she, she batted her eyelashes and you moved on.
[07:14.720 --> 07:20.040]  She was clearly impressed with your prowess, technological prowess.
[07:20.040 --> 07:21.040]  I used it.
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.320]  I used Apple pay this morning for the first time because I, you know, I've been preparing
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.200]  to be on, on, on your show and I wanted to do everything I could possibly do.
[07:30.200 --> 07:35.720]  Like exercise for instance, just so I knew that, you know, got the well-rounded experience
[07:35.720 --> 07:36.760]  this morning.
[07:36.760 --> 07:40.920]  I used Apple pay with the watch and my go to for Apple pay because I never remember
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.840]  where it's going to be is I go to McDonald's.
[07:43.840 --> 07:49.840]  So I went to McDonald's, I got my egg white delight McMuffin.
[07:49.840 --> 07:50.840]  Use the watch.
[07:50.840 --> 07:51.840]  Couldn't be easier.
[07:51.840 --> 07:58.960]  Cashier could, it did not give a shit.
[07:58.960 --> 08:03.440]  I paid it, you know, I guess it worked like it was supposed to.
[08:03.440 --> 08:08.840]  I took my sandwich out to the parking lot, ate it in the parking lot and went to work
[08:08.840 --> 08:13.760]  and now I feel prepared like with the, like I have no extra commentary on that experience
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.840]  except that it worked exactly like it's supposed to and it makes you feel like I've
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.640]  got a, I've got a currency device on my, on my wrist.
[08:21.640 --> 08:27.940]  That's the thing is, uh, that I'm noticing is, is just how all encompassing it is as
[08:27.940 --> 08:28.940]  a device.
[08:28.940 --> 08:33.000]  And I feel like what they've done is they've just prepared, like all of the pieces have
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.640]  kind of culminated in this thing that you now strapped to yourself.
[08:38.640 --> 08:39.640]  Yeah.
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.920]  And I, I can kind of see, I think this might be where you're going to, but I can kind of
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.800]  see how they've already laid like the groundwork for like the Apple watch from five years from
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.800]  now.
[08:50.800 --> 08:55.760]  Like not even just, not even just like a 2.0 from next year, but I'm thinking like a lot
[08:55.760 --> 09:02.600]  further down the road where all of the things that it doesn't have, like it doesn't do cellular
[09:02.600 --> 09:06.800]  networking on its own and it doesn't have its own storage where you can keep all of
[09:06.800 --> 09:09.040]  your videos and stuff like that.
[09:09.040 --> 09:12.140]  Um, I could just see where this would have it all.
[09:12.140 --> 09:16.600]  And then you would, you know, you could like have like your iCloud, your whole iCloud thing.
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.600]  Um, totally, um, I was, I was, yeah, I mean it definitely, that's where I wanted to get
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.080]  this conversation to, um, mostly because like, you know, just as a, partly as a response
[09:28.080 --> 09:36.320]  to people who are basically just like being negative nellies about where it is now without
[09:36.320 --> 09:44.960]  the presence of mind to remember what I've, iPhone version one is, what was, what it was
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.080]  and what it was like, what it was missing and, and how it iterated and how, you know,
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.760]  in the, in the previous, in the, in the next eight years it got to this incredible all
[09:54.760 --> 10:00.160]  encompassing tool that almost kind of feels like it's fully matured and that people don't
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.800]  necessarily step back outside of themselves and say, okay, this is what this device is
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.800]  now.
[10:07.800 --> 10:11.280]  I wonder what it's going to be five years from now.
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.280]  Like you said.
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.280]  Yeah.
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.440]  I'm trying to remember some of this stuff that wasn't in iPhone 1.0.
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.440]  I know there was no notifications, like so you couldn't slide down from the top to see
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.280]  any kind of notifications and there was no control center from the bottom.
[10:25.280 --> 10:29.680]  It was really just the home screen of apps and it was one home screen cause there weren't,
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.760]  there were no other apps and you would just hit the home button to go to the home screen
[10:33.760 --> 10:36.400]  and hit an app to go to an app and that was it.
[10:36.400 --> 10:39.520]  Like that was the scope of the whole system.
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.540]  You're either in an app and if you're in an app, the app had the whole screen and otherwise
[10:44.540 --> 10:47.440]  you were on the home screen and then you would use that to launch an app and that was it.
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.880]  And part of the brilliance of the design is how simple that was.
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.880]  Absolutely.
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.320]  And it almost had to be constrained in order to just teach us what the thing was.
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.380]  So we could get like sort of acclimated to the language and then, and then they could
[11:02.380 --> 11:04.360]  start to grow it out.
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.160]  And I want, so, so then I wonder how you extend that to the watch and what it's, I mean, there
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.000]  are things about the UI right now that I don't get naturally and I don't, and they kind of
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.040]  annoy me, you know, like the, the app, the home screen of full apps is fun to play with,
[11:23.040 --> 11:26.440]  but I don't necessarily feel like it's perfectly natural yet.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.440]  No.
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.480]  And I'm all, I still even a month in them, I tapped the wrong app.
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.480]  Right.
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.480]  Yeah.
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.840]  Yeah, tap tap targets are, are weird.
[11:36.840 --> 11:42.260]  They're not, maybe they're a little too small, but they're definitely too close to each other.
[11:42.260 --> 11:46.160]  That's the big, the bigger problem isn't necessarily the size cause I did, I think I said this
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.280]  with multi or with Joanne Stern, I actually took out a ruler and measured and they are
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.700]  a quarter of an inch, which is like the minimum, you know, it's just basically the minimum
[11:55.700 --> 11:58.180]  size for a tap target.
[11:58.180 --> 12:00.140]  But the problem is they're right next to each other.
[12:00.140 --> 12:04.000]  Whereas like on the iPhone, when you'd have like quarter inch tap targets, you'd still
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.880]  put some spacing between them.
[12:05.880 --> 12:06.880]  Right.
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.160]  And when, when you get it right, it feels like magic, right?
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.440]  But that, but unless it happens all the time that you get it right, it's not real magic.
[12:15.440 --> 12:16.840]  It's just the illusion of magic.
[12:16.840 --> 12:23.800]  I feel like one of the things that I realized is I use overcast a lot.
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.300]  That's probably my most frequently used app on the watch and overcast just would by default
[12:29.300 --> 12:34.760]  when the, when all my apps came over, when I sunk with the watch, a overcast ended up
[12:34.760 --> 12:41.640]  to the right side, the very edge to the very right edge and I realized, Oh, that's an easier
[12:41.640 --> 12:42.640]  tap target.
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.960]  So some reason, I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's mentally or yeah, because actually
[12:46.960 --> 12:47.960]  physically.
[12:47.960 --> 12:48.960]  No, that makes sense though.
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.760]  It's sort of like a Fitz's law, right?
[12:52.760 --> 12:57.560]  Where the menu bar on the Mac is easier to click on because you can, you can just slide
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.280]  your arrow all the way to the top and you can't go too far.
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.920]  There's a similar, I think there's a similar usability advantage to being at the edge of
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.320]  that app cloud because you can't, you can get sloppy on the side.
[13:09.320 --> 13:10.320]  You know what I mean?
[13:10.320 --> 13:11.320]  Yep.
[13:11.320 --> 13:12.320]  Yep.
[13:12.320 --> 13:15.240]  And I guess that was the story of my college years as well.
[13:15.240 --> 13:18.920]  Sloppy on the side.
[13:18.920 --> 13:21.480]  So there's a clock in the middle.
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.800]  That's what they called right.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.360]  So I guess it, does that work?
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.720]  Does that work in theory and in practice that the clock being in the middle makes it an
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.480]  easier tap target then do you just kind of hit a bullseye?
[13:36.480 --> 13:37.480]  I don't know.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.080]  Cause I almost never go back to the clock.
[13:39.080 --> 13:40.080]  Like oh really?
[13:40.080 --> 13:41.080]  Yeah.
[13:41.080 --> 13:48.200]  I just assume that, and to me it's, it's like the most underreported thing and I think people
[13:48.200 --> 13:54.640]  just sort of get it, but it's like the me, the thing that you have to get over with is
[13:54.640 --> 13:59.360]  in this thinking that it don't treat it like a little iPhone on your wrist and in the iPhone,
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.280]  whatever you were last doing when you unlock your iPhone, there it is again when you come
[14:02.280 --> 14:09.320]  back with the watch, just when you're done with whatever, like maybe you wanted to change
[14:09.320 --> 14:13.320]  to a new podcast cause you're using an overcast and then when you switch and you queue it
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.720]  up and you now you've got the new episode of whatever you want to listen to playing
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.540]  in your earbuds, then you just put your wrist down and you're done and next time you want
[14:21.540 --> 14:25.240]  to go to your watch, it's just right back on the watch face.
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.640]  You know, like you never have to clean up as soon as you're done doing what it is that
[14:28.640 --> 14:33.140]  you did on your watch, just put your wrist down and trust that it'll, it'll come back
[14:33.140 --> 14:34.800]  to the watch face on its own.
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.620]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[14:36.620 --> 14:42.540]  Do you have, um, what are things that you've experienced having done?
[14:42.540 --> 14:46.760]  So I remember when the, when the first iPhone came out, I had these moments all the time
[14:46.760 --> 14:54.280]  of um, of like, oh, I just did something like I just, I got a link in an email, I clicked
[14:54.280 --> 15:00.720]  the link, it opened up in mobile safari, I watched a video and then I closed it and I
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.140]  thought I could never have done that before, you know, six months ago.
[15:05.140 --> 15:08.480]  You know, I just did something that I, that I, this technology enabled that I could never
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.160]  have done before it existed and I feel like I'm having sort of similar things, like just
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.760]  those, those realizations of with the watch of, oh, this is why this exists.
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.160]  This is one of those little vignettes that they put in their commercials.
[15:22.160 --> 15:23.160]  Yeah.
[15:23.160 --> 15:29.920]  Uh, I think, you know, and again, I know that there are other smartwatches or whatever you
[15:29.920 --> 15:33.760]  want to call them that get text messages, you know, transcript, you know, zap them between
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.560]  your, you know, your phone and your watch.
[15:35.560 --> 15:39.920]  So I realized that it's not necessarily exclusive to Apple watch, but I've tried it.
[15:39.920 --> 15:43.800]  I've have the pebble and I've wanted the pebble and it's, it's a little different.
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.700]  For one, the Apple watch is pretty reliable.
[15:45.700 --> 15:50.000]  I find the Bluetooth connection to be really good.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  And with pebble, it was always flicking out, which probably isn't pebbles fault.
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.040]  It's probably the limits of third party apps versus Apple getting to have, you know, tightest
[16:00.040 --> 16:05.780]  possible integration at the os level on both the watch and the phone.
[16:05.780 --> 16:09.360]  But it's pretty cool when I, like I do all the grocery shopping, that's why I go to whole
[16:09.360 --> 16:10.360]  food.
[16:10.360 --> 16:16.200]  I go to the whole foods and I'm walking around and I feel my wrist go and Amy says, can you
[16:16.200 --> 16:17.420]  get OJ too?
[16:17.420 --> 16:20.000]  And then I don't even, you know, I don't know.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.920]  It just, just, it's nice cause then, you know, you don't have to go in your pocket and get
[16:22.920 --> 16:24.920]  out of your phone.
[16:24.920 --> 16:26.560]  You don't, you don't have to take it out of your pocket.
[16:26.560 --> 16:27.560]  Is that what you said?
[16:27.560 --> 16:28.560]  Yeah.
[16:28.560 --> 16:29.560]  Sorry.
[16:29.560 --> 16:30.560]  My headphones broke for a second.
[16:30.560 --> 16:31.560]  No, that's okay.
[16:31.560 --> 16:34.280]  Hey, let me take a time out here just real quick and let you know that if I start sounding
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.920]  like a terrible robot or something, tell me right away because it's a USB problem, not
[16:38.920 --> 16:41.600]  a Skype problem.
[16:41.600 --> 16:42.600]  Not an emotional problem.
[16:42.600 --> 16:43.600]  No.
[16:43.600 --> 16:44.600]  Okay.
[16:44.600 --> 16:48.320]  But I had to episode a few weeks, I should, what I should do of course is just as soon
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.680]  as we're done recording, go to Amazon and buy a new microphone and instead I start each
[16:53.680 --> 16:56.880]  show and then realize halfway through that I should have told the guests, hey, if I start
[16:56.880 --> 16:58.680]  sounding bad, tell me right away.
[16:58.680 --> 17:04.080]  Don't just, don't be, don't be polite and say, I don't care because it means my audio
[17:04.080 --> 17:05.240]  on recording is bad too.
[17:05.240 --> 17:06.240]  All right.
[17:06.240 --> 17:07.240]  Oh, that sucks.
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.840]  So it's like you've blown, it was, yeah, it was like the last half hour of the episode
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.320]  with Serenity Caldwell.
[17:14.320 --> 17:20.680]  And so I recreated my audio, I played it, listened and did it again.
[17:20.680 --> 17:21.920]  And I think it came out pretty good.
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.880]  I think it actually made me, it like, I tightened up a lot of my arguments.
[17:26.880 --> 17:29.740]  That's the French call it esprit de scaliae.
[17:29.740 --> 17:35.520]  So you could basically just go back and retroactively say smarter things.
[17:35.520 --> 17:36.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:36.920 --> 17:37.920]  It was perfect.
[17:37.920 --> 17:38.920]  That's exactly what it was like.
[17:38.920 --> 17:41.800]  Okay, I'm going to do that after we record.
[17:41.800 --> 17:46.580]  But it was the biggest pain in the ass ever, as I'm sure you can well imagine what it's
[17:46.580 --> 17:49.780]  like to, to, to have to redub it.
[17:49.780 --> 17:56.760]  And the crosstalk was just, you know, horrifying.
[17:56.760 --> 17:59.680]  But so which, what, what watch are you wearing?
[17:59.680 --> 18:00.680]  Okay.
[18:00.680 --> 18:09.600]  So what I ordered is the 42 millimeter space black steel with the black links and I'm not,
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.480]  like I said, I'm not a watch guy.
[18:11.480 --> 18:16.760]  So even that felt like it was bordering on a little too dressy for me.
[18:16.760 --> 18:23.320]  But as, as I, as I think is, is common, that one's being delayed in shipment pretty heavily.
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.960]  And I ordered it, you know, right after the store opened.
[18:26.960 --> 18:27.960]  Yeah.
[18:27.960 --> 18:30.060]  I ordered the same one and I ordered it first.
[18:30.060 --> 18:34.280]  I ordered it before Amy's or Jonas's or any of the bands and it's still, it has not shipped.
[18:34.280 --> 18:37.960]  I don't believe that one has shipped to anybody, but I could be wrong.
[18:37.960 --> 18:38.960]  Good.
[18:38.960 --> 18:39.960]  I could be wrong.
[18:39.960 --> 18:40.960]  But it doesn't seem like it.
[18:40.960 --> 18:43.240]  I haven't seen anybody post pictures of, of such a watch.
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.440]  Yeah, no, it's weird to feel the privilege of a delayed shipment.
[18:47.440 --> 18:48.440]  I don't know.
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.280]  Like just the fact, like there were, does that make it more precious when it actually
[18:52.280 --> 18:53.280]  comes?
[18:53.280 --> 18:54.280]  I don't know.
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.000]  Well, and it put, and I, you know, I, I'm in no place to complain because I've had the
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.680]  regular steel link bracelet for five weeks now.
[19:02.680 --> 19:04.480]  So is that the one you're wearing?
[19:04.480 --> 19:05.800]  Yeah, that's the one.
[19:05.800 --> 19:07.640]  That's the review unit from Apple.
[19:07.640 --> 19:12.300]  People have asked, I guess I should answer is that, uh, the typical review unit period
[19:12.300 --> 19:13.520]  from Apple is 60 days.
[19:13.520 --> 19:17.800]  I actually haven't even looked at the thing that I signed, but I, it's always been, it
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.040]  doesn't matter whether it's like a new Mac or a phone or tablet or you know, iPad, anything.
[19:22.040 --> 19:27.240]  It's always 60 days and they don't come knocking after 60 if you're still testing something.
[19:27.240 --> 19:31.980]  Um, I mean, I never like use them as my own, although I guess I kind of am with the watch
[19:31.980 --> 19:35.520]  because I'm still wearing it, but it's, my thought is, well, it's their fault that the
[19:35.520 --> 19:36.720]  one I ordered is delayed.
[19:36.720 --> 19:38.440]  I'll just keep wearing it.
[19:38.440 --> 19:41.860]  But I think that, you know, they would even rather have me still wearing it and being
[19:41.860 --> 19:45.740]  able to write about it then, you know, what does the watch mean to them for me to send
[19:45.740 --> 19:46.740]  it back?
[19:46.740 --> 19:50.240]  But anyway, I'll have this watch until mine comes and then I'll package it back up and
[19:50.240 --> 19:51.240]  send it back to them.
[19:51.240 --> 19:52.240]  Well, that's great.
[19:52.240 --> 19:53.240]  That's a, it's a loaner.
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.860]  They gave you a loaner just like your insurance company.
[19:57.860 --> 20:04.120]  So my insurance company is, is Roxanna's watch, which I ordered for her shortly after mine
[20:04.120 --> 20:10.340]  and actually everybody on the team here at sandwich got one and so they kind of staggered
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.340]  in.
[20:11.340 --> 20:16.480]  Um, I think JP's came first, he got the Milanese loop.
[20:16.480 --> 20:17.480]  It's really handsome.
[20:17.480 --> 20:25.080]  Um, but she, so I ordered her a 38 millimeter one, a steel, a stainless steel with the black
[20:25.080 --> 20:26.080]  sport band.
[20:26.080 --> 20:32.320]  And as soon as it came, I just said, this is mine now and what are you going to do?
[20:32.320 --> 20:36.960]  And she doesn't, honestly, she's, she's very sweet and she did, she, it's not important
[20:36.960 --> 20:37.960]  to her.
[20:37.960 --> 20:41.320]  She's just letting me wear it until I, um, until I get mine.
[20:41.320 --> 20:44.740]  And also I wanted to just like, I want it, it was so important to me that I get to spend
[20:44.740 --> 20:50.760]  time with it and um, you know, get to know it a little bit better on an intimate level.
[20:50.760 --> 20:57.040]  Um, so that I could start, uh, you know, let's say, let's say conceivably, this is what I
[20:57.040 --> 20:58.800]  do for a living, I guess.
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.120]  Um, so it was important to me that I know what the watch is like.
[21:03.120 --> 21:04.120]  Yeah.
[21:04.120 --> 21:11.560]  Uh, I mean in all seriousness, it is absolutely not inconceivable that you guys will be writing,
[21:11.560 --> 21:16.000]  directing and shooting, uh, a promotional video for some new product.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.120]  Part of which products experience is a watch extension.
[21:19.120 --> 21:20.120]  Totally.
[21:20.120 --> 21:21.260]  I can't wait for it to happen.
[21:21.260 --> 21:24.040]  We haven't done it yet, but now we certainly can.
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.040]  Right.
[21:25.040 --> 21:32.880]  And it's, you know, I, you know, you do, but you have to use it to get it.
[21:32.880 --> 21:34.100]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[21:34.100 --> 21:39.040]  And so I've got the 38, uh, watch face on and it's a little small for me.
[21:39.040 --> 21:43.200]  I think it's a little tiny and not because it looks tiny or dainty, like, you know, like,
[21:43.200 --> 21:49.240]  like you were saying it, it looks fine, but I want a bigger screen I think just like a
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.240]  bigger screen.
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.640]  I don't, I, I have actually no concept of how much bigger the 42 is going to look and
[21:55.640 --> 22:02.920]  feel on my wrist, but I know even incrementally, what is that four millimeters out of is like
[22:02.920 --> 22:03.920]  nearly a 10%.
[22:03.920 --> 22:06.520]  Oh, well it's a little bit more than a 10% increase, right?
[22:06.520 --> 22:07.520]  Yeah.
[22:07.520 --> 22:13.800]  But somehow, my guess is with you going from 38 to 42, when yours shows up, you're going
[22:13.800 --> 22:17.000]  to be like, you're going to have like 15 minutes where you're a little worried you think this
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.480]  might be too big and then like, but then like 20 minutes later you're like, oh no, this
[22:21.480 --> 22:22.640]  is right.
[22:22.640 --> 22:27.200]  Which brings me to a strange phenomenon, which is one of those first, you know, uh, just
[22:27.200 --> 22:32.560]  kind of like startling realizations that I had having spent very minimal time with the
[22:32.560 --> 22:33.560]  watch.
[22:33.560 --> 22:37.500]  It's just like, and I am talking about maybe 10, 15 minutes of having the watch on my hand
[22:37.500 --> 22:41.800]  after I paired it and I sunk it and put the phone back in my pocket.
[22:41.800 --> 22:46.640]  The next opportunity I had to take the phone out, it felt like a giant screen.
[22:46.640 --> 22:50.360]  Like did you have that experience too, or your phone came out and you're like, whoa,
[22:50.360 --> 22:53.640]  this is like a flat screen that I just took out of my pocket.
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.280]  Yeah, a little bit.
[22:56.280 --> 23:03.320]  Especially if you're trying to, you know, and, and I know it's, it, I don't think you're
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.120]  supposed to be dictating large amounts of text on a watch, but it's definitely works
[23:07.120 --> 23:08.160]  for texting.
[23:08.160 --> 23:13.400]  And I think that, you know, that the Siri transcription is really, really good, including
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.920]  when you're out on cellular.
[23:14.920 --> 23:17.160]  Um, yeah, it's great.
[23:17.160 --> 23:20.560]  Um, I, I don't, I don't, I haven't used it a whole lot.
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.760]  I mean, I've, I've used it a little bit, but you know, there's the whole kind of, um, social,
[23:26.760 --> 23:33.400]  uh, social acceptability of, of dictating into your watch in public or dictating into
[23:33.400 --> 23:34.400]  your phone.
[23:34.400 --> 23:38.480]  I mean, if you're at the market, you don't want to talk to your thing cause you sound
[23:38.480 --> 23:39.480]  like a dick.
[23:39.480 --> 23:40.480]  Right?
[23:40.480 --> 23:41.480]  Right.
[23:41.480 --> 23:42.480]  I feel like that's the case.
[23:42.480 --> 23:47.800]  Do you like, if you get a thing on your watch, if you get a text on your watch from Amy and
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.120]  you're at the market, you're at whole foods and you're not the only one in the aisle,
[23:52.120 --> 23:57.360]  do you like, do you respond or do you do like an emoticon even though, or an emoji, even
[23:57.360 --> 24:02.440]  though emojis are for children?
[24:02.440 --> 24:07.000]  I'm kind of, I'm a little self-conscious about it, but I try to, I just try to start
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.720]  walking in a direction where I'm away from other customers and, and, and I try to keep
[24:11.720 --> 24:13.160]  my voice down and cut my hands.
[24:13.160 --> 24:17.560]  But I do, I cut my hands around the, the watch, but I realized though that it does kind of
[24:17.560 --> 24:22.680]  make you look conspirational, like, you know what I mean, like you're going off and whispering
[24:22.680 --> 24:28.160]  into your own wrist, like, cause like I, the thing I'm self-conscious about is I don't
[24:28.160 --> 24:30.080]  want to be loud talking into it.
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.000]  Like I'll, I'll only do it in a way that it seems as though strangers aren't going to
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.640]  hear what it is that I'm dictating, even though that if they looked at me and gave two seconds
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.080]  of thought about it, they'd realize I must be talking to some kind of gadget.
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.720]  But as long as they can't really hear me and I'm not intruding on their conversations,
[24:46.720 --> 24:47.720]  I don't mind.
[24:47.720 --> 24:49.760]  And I feel like it's the way of the future.
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.760]  And God, yeah, it is the way of the future and God bless you for being polite and considerate
[24:53.760 --> 25:00.200]  about it and especially thinking about how many people probably out there and in the
[25:00.200 --> 25:01.200]  world wouldn't be.
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.120]  And also like, think about how far we've come that it used to be like people loud talking
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.400]  to their Bluetooth earpiece or whatever that were.
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.440]  And I, I also think that it's, you know, and it just became acceptable and it's just, you
[25:16.440 --> 25:19.360]  can't go anywhere in the Western world without seeing it.
[25:19.360 --> 25:26.600]  But at first, 10 years ago, it was really weird when you would see grown adults, like
[25:26.600 --> 25:33.940]  in public thumb typing into a three inch device with all of their attention on it.
[25:33.940 --> 25:38.120]  Like it just was a weird thing to be doing in public is sitting there pecking away at
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.560]  an electronic device like, you know, like an eight year old on a Game Boy.
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.520]  But yeah, but you're not, but now it's, it's, it's everywhere.
[25:46.520 --> 25:49.000]  Right now it's something we do.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.840]  And hopefully that the, the idea is that just like is in that movie, Her, where you see
[25:54.840 --> 26:01.840]  people on the subway and everybody's whispering softly into their earpiece or whatever.
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.840]  That that just becomes a way of life and nobody thinks twice about it.
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.740]  I think it's, hopefully it's going to happen.
[26:09.740 --> 26:15.120]  And hopefully it doesn't create a cacophony of, of environmental pollution.
[26:15.120 --> 26:16.120]  Yeah.
[26:16.120 --> 26:19.080]  Did you like her?
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.080]  Yeah I loved that.
[26:20.080 --> 26:21.080]  I loved it.
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.080]  I loved it too.
[26:22.080 --> 26:23.080]  Yeah.
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.320]  It was, it hit me deeply on an emotional level, but also it's just fun for future thinking
[26:28.320 --> 26:29.320]  people.
[26:29.320 --> 26:30.320]  Yeah.
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.320]  Hold that thought.
[26:31.320 --> 26:32.320]  Let's come back to that.
[26:32.320 --> 26:33.320]  I mean, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor and then we'll come back
[26:33.320 --> 26:34.320]  and talk about her.
[26:34.320 --> 26:37.320]  Cause I do think, I think the watch is a step in that direction.
[26:37.320 --> 26:38.920]  Yeah.
[26:38.920 --> 26:39.920]  It's a brand new sponsor.
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.040]  I'm really proud to have these guys on board.
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.680]  Rails tutorial, Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartle.
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.600]  So if you dabbled a little bit of you web web app developer, but you really want to
[26:51.600 --> 26:58.000]  know how things actually work under the hood, or maybe you've tried your hand at programming,
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.800]  maybe in like a language like PHP or something like that, and found it to be too messy, too
[27:01.800 --> 27:04.320]  inelegant, too much like you have to do everything yourself.
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.220]  Well, if you ask around about resources on learning web development, you'll probably
[27:09.220 --> 27:14.160]  hear about Ruby's on rail tutorial, sometimes just called the Michael Hartle tutorial, which
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.240]  teaches you how to develop web applications, surprise, surprise built with rails, the framework
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.160]  used by sites like GitHub, Twitter, Disney, Airbnb.
[27:23.160 --> 27:26.320]  I mean, we started listing all the sites that are built on Ruby on Rails.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.800]  We'll be here for the rest of the show.
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.240]  Been around for years, probably at least a decade now that I think about it.
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.600]  Cause we were building stuff on joint on rails back 10 years ago.
[27:37.600 --> 27:40.320]  So first of all, here's the thing you gotta learn about learn about this tutorial.
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.320]  It's free.
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.440]  The entire book is free online at the website rails tutorial.org not behind a paywall or
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.920]  signup wall.
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.780]  You can just go there and read the thing for free for those of you who want to watch step
[27:54.780 --> 27:57.840]  by step how to make rails web apps.
[27:57.840 --> 28:04.860]  There's also a nearly 20 hour screencast series available for purchase.
[28:04.860 --> 28:12.280]  You can also purchase EPUB, Moby, Moby is the, the Kindle format and PDF versions of
[28:12.280 --> 28:13.840]  the book available for purchase as well.
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.080]  So you want to read it for free, go to your web browser, go to rails tutorial.org read
[28:17.080 --> 28:18.080]  for free.
[28:18.080 --> 28:19.080]  You want to get the EPUB version.
[28:19.080 --> 28:20.480]  You want to get the screencast.
[28:20.480 --> 28:22.940]  That's where he makes his money.
[28:22.940 --> 28:23.940]  Really well worth it.
[28:23.940 --> 28:26.560]  Super, super well respected.
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.160]  So many people have learned a program from this tutorial.
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.600]  So if that's building websites or learning rails, even if you already know some other
[28:32.600 --> 28:38.920]  framework is something you want to do, this is a great way to get started by the end of
[28:38.920 --> 28:39.920]  the tutorial.
[28:39.920 --> 28:40.920]  Here's what you will have created.
[28:40.920 --> 28:46.700]  You'll have the source code and you'll have deployed a full Twitter style microblog rails
[28:46.700 --> 28:51.760]  application, including the ability to sign up and authenticate users and create a feed
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.760]  of their posts.
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.900]  Great example program, great type of thing that teaches you all the basics you need for
[28:56.900 --> 29:03.380]  any kind of thing like that with user accounts and authentication and stuff like that.
[29:03.380 --> 29:04.380]  Where do you go?
[29:04.380 --> 29:09.760]  I told you the website already rails, tutorial.org, but go there, add slash Gruber, my last name,
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.680]  go to rails, tutorial.org slash Gruber and by using that code, they'll know you came
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.280]  from the show and you will save 15% off with that coupon code.
[29:21.280 --> 29:22.600]  Just my last name, Gruber.
[29:22.600 --> 29:27.040]  So my thanks to rails tutorial, uh, by Michael Hartle.
[29:27.040 --> 29:31.620]  Go check them out if you want to learn how to make great web apps.
[29:31.620 --> 29:39.680]  So her, her, I thought it, it's so I think it's going to hold up really well.
[29:39.680 --> 29:44.540]  I liked the movie and I think even where 20 years from now when we're past the point they're
[29:44.540 --> 29:47.000]  projecting to technologically.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.380]  And so there's obviously they're going to have made some mistakes.
[29:49.380 --> 29:53.720]  I think it's going to look pretty good in hindsight though, sort of like the way 2001
[29:53.720 --> 29:54.720]  seems great.
[29:54.720 --> 29:55.720]  Sure.
[29:55.720 --> 30:01.000]  Or even or a blade runner like fashions are all sort of like weighted toward that era.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.080]  Weighted toward the early eighties with the shoulder pads and the angles and whatnot.
[30:05.080 --> 30:11.380]  Just like the high waisted pants in her are kind of weighted towards 2013 or 2014.
[30:11.380 --> 30:17.080]  I think it'll hold up and it'll sort of be emblematic of, of, of, of our version of futurism.
[30:17.080 --> 30:18.080]  Yeah.
[30:18.080 --> 30:21.520]  And I feel like, I feel like the thing that they got right and that Apple is clearly moving
[30:21.520 --> 30:26.320]  towards is that your gadgets still totally matter as much as ever.
[30:26.320 --> 30:32.320]  But your identity and your, your treatment, they're all just front ends to like a cloud
[30:32.320 --> 30:38.240]  based system, you know, and you just pick the size that you want at this moment.
[30:38.240 --> 30:39.240]  Right.
[30:39.240 --> 30:44.240]  And then, and, and what they did in her was they even removed a, like a lot of the visual
[30:44.240 --> 30:51.900]  component and just had it be so much, so reliant on, on voice and sound, which was an interesting
[30:51.900 --> 30:52.900]  way to go.
[30:52.900 --> 30:56.860]  And I don't, I don't know how, how far we're going to go in that direction, especially
[30:56.860 --> 31:02.960]  with like with Siri and the state that it's in now in terms of it's like it's ability
[31:02.960 --> 31:07.040]  to understand us and communicate back.
[31:07.040 --> 31:12.480]  I thought it was, it was interesting and also like just as a storytelling element by not
[31:12.480 --> 31:18.880]  inundating the technology with visuals, they allowed the, like the human elements to, to
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.600]  take more of a front seat.
[31:20.600 --> 31:21.600]  Yeah.
[31:21.600 --> 31:28.920]  And I feel like it's like the touch components on the watch play into that too, where it's
[31:28.920 --> 31:31.120]  not about what you're looking at.
[31:31.120 --> 31:35.400]  It's, you know, some other sense and it, you know, and, and like with her, a lot of
[31:35.400 --> 31:41.720]  the, you know, and cinematic, cinematically, it has to be, it can't be touch, right?
[31:41.720 --> 31:48.960]  I mean, at least not with the display outputs that we have at the moment.
[31:48.960 --> 31:52.340]  Although I guess you can imagine some kind of game that ties into like an Apple watch
[31:52.340 --> 31:55.920]  and like rumbles on your wrist at certain points in a movie, like the way that a rumble
[31:55.920 --> 31:57.040]  pad in a video game would.
[31:57.040 --> 32:00.120]  So maybe something like that is coming now that I think about it off the top of my head.
[32:00.120 --> 32:06.200]  But you know, it just had to be verbal because that makes for cinema and it lets Scarlett
[32:06.200 --> 32:08.960]  Johansson, you know, truly act.
[32:08.960 --> 32:12.960]  Basically the best vocal interface in the world.
[32:12.960 --> 32:23.340]  Like her voice was just like representative of what technology, AI should sound like without
[32:23.340 --> 32:25.520]  being a creepy perv about it.
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.120]  Like yeah, that's what I would want my robot to sound like too.
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.120]  Yeah.
[32:30.120 --> 32:34.020]  But to me it was the interaction that the characters had with the technology was so
[32:34.020 --> 32:37.960]  ambient and you know, you didn't have to break stride while you were getting off the train
[32:37.960 --> 32:41.280]  to walk to your office building and something, some kind of notification would come in.
[32:41.280 --> 32:42.800]  You don't break stride.
[32:42.800 --> 32:46.440]  And that to me is what the touch on the wrist helps to enable.
[32:46.440 --> 32:47.440]  Absolutely.
[32:47.440 --> 32:49.480]  Just it's, it's there.
[32:49.480 --> 32:53.080]  You just kind of ambiently feel it and like in a tactile way.
[32:53.080 --> 32:58.480]  Um, and so like, what do you feel like you, how's the, how's the taptic engine holding
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.480]  up for you?
[32:59.480 --> 33:00.840]  Do you enjoy it?
[33:00.840 --> 33:01.840]  I do.
[33:01.840 --> 33:06.500]  I enjoyed a lot and like more and more as time goes on, I've got my watch the sound
[33:06.500 --> 33:07.500]  off all the time.
[33:07.500 --> 33:12.840]  I never, it's some of the sounds are too annoying and I find that they're not necessary.
[33:12.840 --> 33:13.840]  Right.
[33:13.840 --> 33:17.920]  Um, I haven't really learned to distinguish between what the different sounds and the
[33:17.920 --> 33:20.960]  different patterns and everything mean.
[33:20.960 --> 33:24.800]  I think universally they just mean, Hey, look over here.
[33:24.800 --> 33:29.920]  Um, and I, you know, or glance over here rather, but I, but it's never a displeasing feeling
[33:29.920 --> 33:35.940]  to like to just have a small like little minute tap, even if it happens, whatever, 10 times
[33:35.940 --> 33:39.980]  in an hour or something or even, yeah, because something's going up, like some group chat
[33:39.980 --> 33:44.760]  that you're on is blown up and is getting messages, you know, a frequent barrage of
[33:44.760 --> 33:46.760]  messages from colleagues or something like that.
[33:46.760 --> 33:47.760]  Right.
[33:47.760 --> 33:51.800]  I mean, if you're doing something else important, like, like recording a podcast and like, and
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.320]  your wrist is blowing up, then that's maybe not as, uh, not quite, not quite as fun, but
[33:56.320 --> 34:01.240]  I, I, for the first few days after I had, I was wearing the watch, I was, I found myself
[34:01.240 --> 34:02.920]  wanting more taps.
[34:02.920 --> 34:09.600]  Like I wanted, like I'd be driving and I turned on navigation, um, even though I know exactly
[34:09.600 --> 34:13.040]  how the hell to get to where I'm going, I turned on navigation just cause it's kind
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.640]  of fun to get 12 taps, um, to turn right or something, which is that physically pleasing
[34:18.640 --> 34:19.640]  of a sensation.
[34:19.640 --> 34:22.920]  I forget if I talked about, I know I didn't write about it, but I maybe I may, but I did,
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.740]  I got driving directions to my accountant last month and so this was to get my taxes
[34:28.740 --> 34:33.320]  done and the during fireball LLC type, you know, it's a whole afternoon.
[34:33.320 --> 34:39.000]  Um, and it's, I don't know, maybe like a 20, 20 to 30 minute drive outside the city.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.340]  Uh, it was actually the first time I was driving with the, I think, um, and I wanted to test
[34:44.340 --> 34:45.340]  the directions.
[34:45.340 --> 34:47.040]  Now I've been going to the same accountant for years and years and years.
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.520]  So I know how to get there, but I wanted to try the directions, but it was actually kind
[34:50.520 --> 34:54.680]  of an amazing in one of those, like I know people do this every day, but I don't drive
[34:54.680 --> 34:55.680]  every day.
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.040]  This is just science fiction to me is, um, westbound out of Philadelphia.
[35:01.040 --> 35:02.240]  There's really only one road.
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.480]  It's called the school expressway and it's called the school expressway cause it goes
[35:05.480 --> 35:07.600]  right along the path of the school river.
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.640]  Um, and knowing how to spell the word school is a true test of being a Philadelphia S C
[35:12.640 --> 35:17.800]  H U Y L K I L L, um, old Indian name.
[35:17.800 --> 35:18.880]  Anyway you just go out.
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.600]  But anyway, it's, it's a notoriously bad road though because it's a lot of, a lot of the
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.760]  way it's only two lanes in each direction and so any little accident and it just dies.
[35:27.760 --> 35:33.600]  Uh, and I ended up, there was some kind of tractor trailer accident earlier in the morning
[35:33.600 --> 35:39.560]  and it had been shut down for a while and Siri gave me what I thought was crazy directions.
[35:39.560 --> 35:43.800]  Um, she was getting me off the school almost as soon as I got on it and I thought, well,
[35:43.800 --> 35:44.800]  I'll just go her way.
[35:44.800 --> 35:48.480]  And as soon as I took that exit and I looked ahead from what she steered me away from,
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.400]  I was like, Oh my God, I would have, there's no way I would have made the appointment.
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.920]  I would have had to like, and trying to reschedule an appointment with your accountant when it's
[35:55.920 --> 35:58.460]  already, I don't know, it was like April 4th or something like that.
[35:58.460 --> 36:02.240]  It's like you're already, you know, I mean, he would have helped me out cause you've belong,
[36:02.240 --> 36:04.480]  but it's still, I would have felt like I could dirt back.
[36:04.480 --> 36:08.080]  You don't, you don't stand your accountant up in early April.
[36:08.080 --> 36:12.600]  Um, so she took me this different way where I've never been before and I really didn't
[36:12.600 --> 36:13.600]  know where I was going.
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.280]  And so I didn't know at the time what the difference between the left and right taps
[36:17.280 --> 36:18.280]  were.
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.400]  Um, it was enough that I just felt something and you could just glance at your wrist and
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.640]  you know, and it would say 600 feet, make a left and it was great.
[36:27.640 --> 36:30.720]  I thought, Oh yeah, that's great.
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.360]  And the, the, the, the display that the, the, what you actually see on the wrist is, um,
[36:36.360 --> 36:40.520]  is so minimal that it doesn't get in the way you're, you can, you can sort of interpret
[36:40.520 --> 36:43.520]  it at a glance because you're supposed to be driving.
[36:43.520 --> 36:49.200]  Uh, and most of the experiences are audio and um, you know, I typically when I'm driving,
[36:49.200 --> 36:55.400]  I use ways I put, I mount my iPhone to the dash thing and I use ways and it ways has
[36:55.400 --> 36:56.400]  better directions.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.520]  It's smarter about traffic.
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.200]  It's a smarter in so many ways, but the audio quality sounds like it's coming through the
[37:03.200 --> 37:09.680]  telephone rather than, you know, like a built in library of, of, of, or an internal audio
[37:09.680 --> 37:10.680]  engine.
[37:10.680 --> 37:14.680]  I don't know what the, I don't know technically whether that's true except ways sounds like
[37:14.680 --> 37:18.360]  garbage and uh, Apple maps sounds amazing.
[37:18.360 --> 37:25.020]  Um, so to go back and get directions from the watch sounds amazing and feels amazing.
[37:25.020 --> 37:28.880]  And it's like, Oh yeah, it's, again, it's one, we should name one of those moments where
[37:28.880 --> 37:29.880]  you're like, this is the future.
[37:29.880 --> 37:31.920]  Um, this feels like the future.
[37:31.920 --> 37:37.240]  Uh, and, and, and even to, to, you know, pile on that.
[37:37.240 --> 37:45.560]  Uh, I had last week I had made a dinner reservation using open table, um, so I could meet somebody
[37:45.560 --> 37:53.400]  after work and I get in the car and then open table gives me an alert on my wrist because
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.520]  they have a watch, a watch app gives me an alert on my wrist that I've got my dinner
[37:58.520 --> 38:01.760]  reservation in like what, 10 minutes or something.
[38:01.760 --> 38:08.320]  And then I, I tap into the app on the wrist and go to the location and it opens up the
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.440]  map and starts giving me directions like, Holy cow, I didn't expect for it to do that.
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.600]  I didn't ask for it to do that, but that's what the, that's what the watch does in 2015.
[38:17.600 --> 38:18.600]  Hmm.
[38:18.600 --> 38:19.600]  Yeah.
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.000]  I, one of my first experiences like that was with, um, I think I, I, again, I don't want
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.020]  to repeat myself, but I think I said this the most, but it was on the Amtrak train and
[38:29.020 --> 38:37.160]  I had already saved the pass, uh, to my pass book on the phone and it just, when I got
[38:37.160 --> 38:42.520]  to Penn station, it just appeared on my watch and then when we got in a train, the guy came
[38:42.520 --> 38:45.120]  by and I didn't have to fish anything out, didn't have to switch.
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.840]  I just held my wrist up to the guy and he scanned it and boom, we're on the train.
[38:49.840 --> 38:50.840]  It's awesome.
[38:50.840 --> 38:55.360]  I feel sync between the watch and the phone is just really highly tuned.
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.120]  Uh, I haven't felt that lacking in any way.
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.040]  Um, and that's kind of enjoyable to watch when you see different sync services, um,
[39:06.040 --> 39:12.260]  between your devices kind of fail at more points along the way.
[39:12.260 --> 39:18.280]  Do you think it was a mistake for Apple to already have apps?
[39:18.280 --> 39:24.200]  Like I, and it's absolutely true in some cases where the basic thought when they, when they
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.760]  announced, um, the watch kit back in November and said, Hey, we're going to ship this in
[39:29.760 --> 39:31.200]  a couple of weeks.
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.640]  Way before the watch comes out, I just remember then this sounds like a bad idea because you're
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.440]  asking people to write software, even if it's a limited SDK and it really is limited, but
[39:40.440 --> 39:44.000]  you're asking them to write software for a device that they've never used.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.060]  And so they're not really know, they're not really familiar with how they're supposed
[39:47.060 --> 39:48.060]  to use it.
[39:48.060 --> 39:54.480]  Um, and I think it's definitely true that some apps really, really suffer from that.
[39:54.480 --> 39:55.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.600]  Um, uh, yeah, I have a number of them on, on my watch that really suffered from that.
[40:00.600 --> 40:05.920]  Now do you think, or do you know anecdotally or otherwise whether any developers were given
[40:05.920 --> 40:10.320]  early access to the watch specifically for making their apps better?
[40:10.320 --> 40:15.240]  Uh, I think you have to define layers of access.
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.480]  I don't think anybody got a watch.
[40:17.480 --> 40:20.080]  I think some people clearly got access.
[40:20.080 --> 40:26.560]  I mean, and obviously a lot of people got the developer lab invitations and I think
[40:26.560 --> 40:32.360]  in the middle there's at each level, there's a smaller number of developers who got early
[40:32.360 --> 40:37.440]  access to, I think to the labs though, not, not that they got to take a watch and wear
[40:37.440 --> 40:41.960]  it, but that they got to, you know, fly out to Cupertino and, and write stuff.
[40:41.960 --> 40:42.960]  Yeah.
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.440]  Um, but on the other hand, I think, well, I just think that for example, though, I don't
[40:47.440 --> 40:48.440]  know.
[40:48.440 --> 40:51.160]  I would assume Twitter is on that list of companies that had really privileged access
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.920]  and I think that their app is useless almost.
[40:53.920 --> 40:56.400]  Oh yeah, it's awful.
[40:56.400 --> 41:02.760]  Um, but on the, and then on the other hand, Marco's app is incredible and yeah, I have
[41:02.760 --> 41:07.280]  no idea how he was, how he, how he kind of figured out what user patterns would make
[41:07.280 --> 41:13.440]  the most sense without having the device in his hand except that, um, like I'm never wondering
[41:13.440 --> 41:19.600]  when I, from the very first time I launched overcast on the watch, I never wondered how
[41:19.600 --> 41:21.660]  anything worked.
[41:21.660 --> 41:23.560]  It was exactly where it was supposed to be.
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.560]  Yeah.
[41:24.560 --> 41:25.560]  I know he was worried about it.
[41:25.560 --> 41:30.680]  I remember cause I actually helped him beta test then before he shipped it just so that
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.340]  he, you know, I had the review unit and, and I could, you know, dude couldn't help much
[41:35.340 --> 41:39.040]  cause he was getting ready to ship, but at least a little bit of sanity checking.
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.920]  Um, his big concern was, or one of his concerns was that there wouldn't be any point to it
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.280]  because there's that now playing widget, which can work with anything.
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.900]  And it, his, his thought was, well, what's the point of even doing it at all if the now
[41:52.900 --> 41:56.600]  playing, um, handles everything.
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.240]  And I said, no, I, there's definite usefulness in even with just one day of testing overcast
[42:01.240 --> 42:02.240]  on the watch.
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.860]  It was absolutely useful because you know, there's no way with now playing to do anything
[42:05.860 --> 42:09.360]  really other than just play and pause, whereas overcast on the watch, you can switch to a
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.360]  new podcast and stuff like that.
[42:11.360 --> 42:12.360]  Yeah.
[42:12.360 --> 42:13.360]  I mean it's got context awareness.
[42:13.360 --> 42:19.140]  It knows what you're listening to, which is hugely important for a podcast library where
[42:19.140 --> 42:22.240]  people kind of listen to every thing differently.
[42:22.240 --> 42:24.960]  Um, and that's pretty awesome.
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.460]  Um, and I, you know, the, the now playing app is there, but I don't know exactly what
[42:29.460 --> 42:33.280]  it does and I don't know what it control, what it hijacks and what it doesn't hijack.
[42:33.280 --> 42:35.120]  And I'd rather just leave it, leave it alone.
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.600]  I wish there was, you know, it's just one of those apple apps that you just kind of
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.920]  put in a drawer somewhere.
[42:39.920 --> 42:40.920]  Yeah.
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.960]  I kind of feel like as a pundit overall that it's, and I, it's the sort of thing that I
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.340]  try to be cognizant of, but I know that I'm being guilty is it's like apple can't win
[42:50.340 --> 42:54.640]  because if they didn't have any apps, I would be complaining that there should be apps already.
[42:54.640 --> 43:00.720]  And now that they shipped with apps on day one, I'm complaining because the apps, some
[43:00.720 --> 43:04.600]  of them don't work so well and some of them don't seem to have been designed with the
[43:04.600 --> 43:06.640]  context, you know, in mind.
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.640]  Yeah.
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.040]  I can't wait till Slack's app gets good because I use Slack almost more than anything besides
[43:12.040 --> 43:13.040]  email.
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.960]  Um, and I, and I can't figure out how to actually respond to, to reply to, to a Slack.
[43:19.960 --> 43:25.800]  And if you just open up Slack, the Slack walk watch app, you get, um, you're presented with
[43:25.800 --> 43:31.920]  two icons, one of which is I think direct messages and one of which is, is mentions
[43:31.920 --> 43:39.120]  of your name. Um, and neither one seems to be great at tracking like what conversations
[43:39.120 --> 43:45.340]  I actually need access to. And then if you get an alert in Slack, which I always do,
[43:45.340 --> 43:49.360]  there's no, all you can do on the watch is dismiss it right away. You can't actually
[43:49.360 --> 43:55.880]  reply from, from that, um, from that alert, which I want to do because that's, I mean,
[43:55.880 --> 44:01.560]  Slack is all about two way communications, not broadcasting, broadcast of a platform.
[44:01.560 --> 44:08.200]  Well in the same way that you can respond to text messages, right? That's the fact that
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.200]  you can respond to text messages and dictate a little over the thing is what you would
[44:12.200 --> 44:13.520]  want to do with Slack.
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.320]  Absolutely. And which, which brings me to a point I was going to make, which is like
[44:18.320 --> 44:26.040]  how forgiving we now can sort of let us let ourselves be of like of dictating. Um, do
[44:26.040 --> 44:29.240]  you call it Siri when I do?
[44:29.240 --> 44:35.140]  I call it, I just call it. Yeah. So when you're dictating to Siri, even if it's like responding
[44:35.140 --> 44:40.840]  to a message, do you know how like you can choose like a sent from iPhone signature with,
[44:40.840 --> 44:47.760]  with mail with from, from mobile mail. And the idea behind that was, um, theoretically
[44:47.760 --> 44:51.580]  it was probably just so that you could see like the other person receiving it cut you
[44:51.580 --> 44:58.000]  a little slack for reasons of brevity or typos or whatever. I feel like dictated by Siri
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.040]  kind of needs its own little, and I, by the way, I sent, I turn sent from my iPhone off
[45:03.040 --> 45:08.720]  because I will like, I'll write a fricking novel in an email from my phone. It's just
[45:08.720 --> 45:14.720]  like one of my, I play my email on my phone, like, like Beethoven and I, and I take pride
[45:14.720 --> 45:21.300]  in that with italics and proper quote levels and everything. And, um, so it would shame
[45:21.300 --> 45:25.960]  me to tell some, to tell somebody to try to make an excuse. You wouldn't want to, I wouldn't
[45:25.960 --> 45:31.620]  want to do that. But, but then again, um, if you're trying to, if you're trying to respond
[45:31.620 --> 45:36.120]  to a message dictated into your watch and then be, and then go on with your business,
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.560]  you're not going to sit there getting frustrated because she misheard something and maybe it's
[45:40.560 --> 45:46.000]  clear enough, you know, maybe, maybe it's, it's like enough to get the point. Oh, I've
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.680]  had a couple of misfires, um, with badly dictated messages to, you know, replies to text. Um,
[45:53.680 --> 46:02.200]  but that's just kind of fun. I, it's partly because it, there's like a tipping point I've
[46:02.200 --> 46:11.000]  realized where as, as Siri dictation has is crossed some point on the curve between too,
[46:11.000 --> 46:16.040]  too slow and inaccurate to be useful. And it's reached a tipping point now where it's
[46:16.040 --> 46:21.040]  quick enough and accurate enough to be useful. And I, you know, and this has happened for
[46:21.040 --> 46:26.680]  me sometime in the last year. Um, you know, and I wrote a piece about it, about how it
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.280]  was so much better on my iPhone a couple months ago, like, and I think a large part them ramping
[46:31.280 --> 46:37.680]  this up for the watch. Um, but as it reaches that tipping point, suddenly you trust it
[46:37.680 --> 46:41.960]  a lot more. Whereas in the first couple of years where Siri existed and they had this
[46:41.960 --> 46:47.040]  dictation, I would double check every time before I'd hit send. And now I, a lot of times
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.680]  I I'm hitting send without really looking at it. And sometimes they are, there's some
[46:51.680 --> 46:53.640]  pretty bad typos in there.
[46:53.640 --> 47:00.920]  Yeah. Um, I accidentally texted to Roxanna the other day. She said, Hey, can you stop
[47:00.920 --> 47:08.800]  by the store on the way home? Um, and I think I did. I responded, I dictated, um, do you
[47:08.800 --> 47:14.120]  want me to stop on the way home or do you want to want me to come home first? And then
[47:14.120 --> 47:19.400]  I, like I dictated that and then I went on with what I was doing. What got sent was,
[47:19.400 --> 47:22.440]  do you want me to come home? Do you want me to stop on the way home or do you want me
[47:22.440 --> 47:29.280]  to come home first? I can't even know that sent. And she was like, what did you just
[47:29.280 --> 47:31.440]  say? What's with the attitude?
[47:31.440 --> 47:38.400]  That does sound that's cause it's like, it's like, it's like caddy. It's like kind of bitchy
[47:38.400 --> 47:39.520]  in the wrong way.
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.280]  Yeah. Usually if it's, if it's good, meaning like it's not, it's going to be obvious to
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.080]  your recipient, it's going to look like a homonym, you know, like if they read it out
[47:49.080 --> 47:52.600]  loud in their head, they'll, they'll take a guess. I actually kind of like that, like
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.600]  with Amy or other friends, you know, more technically inclined, you know, it's, let's
[47:57.600 --> 48:02.440]  face it, it's mostly who I'm texting. Uh, I like it when they can guess and they they're
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.320]  like Siri or, or vice versa. I'll do it to them and try to guess whether the weird typo
[48:07.320 --> 48:10.360]  in the message they just sent me was because of that. Like I feel like it's becoming a
[48:10.360 --> 48:14.880]  skill whereas that I can't even at the end doesn't sound like that. It sounds exactly
[48:14.880 --> 48:16.800]  like you're giving her a hard time.
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.800]  Yeah, it really does. Sounds intentional. Like Siri just manufactured some attitude.
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.040]  I can't, I can't believe you would even ask me to do that.
[48:26.040 --> 48:33.320]  What do you think of the fact that Siri doesn't talk back to you through the watch?
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.720]  That's a good question. It somehow feels natural to me, although I do feel like a lot of her
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.560]  personality is missing because of that, but it somehow seems right to me.
[48:43.560 --> 48:49.900]  True, but maybe we, we like, we know that personality so well already that's ingrained
[48:49.900 --> 48:53.200]  that we can kind of hear her voice. Maybe like you did, it took me a couple of days
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.120]  to realize it. Oh, like she's not talking, there's not, she's not talking through the
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.880]  speaker when, when I ask her something, she's just like, it's just coming out in text, but
[49:01.880 --> 49:02.880]  I already can hear her.
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.360]  Yeah. I guess that's why I was a little slow to answer is because it would, the fact that
[49:08.360 --> 49:15.560]  she doesn't talk or depending on your country and your preferences, he doesn't talk. It,
[49:15.560 --> 49:21.040]  it sneaks up on you on the watch and you realize only after you've really been using Siri a
[49:21.040 --> 49:23.360]  lot that it's, that it never talks to you.
[49:23.360 --> 49:32.240]  Right. I kind of like it. It's a little bit more private. Yeah. I had this thought that
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.280]  the watch is kind of, maybe the watch is what cracks Siri open more than much more than
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.400]  any other and anything else like the watch is kind of one of the, of the, of the many
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.640]  things that the watch is watch is like a Siri machine basically.
[49:45.640 --> 49:51.000]  Yeah. I think a large part of it, I think if you're not using Siri a couple of times
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.480]  a day, then you're not really getting the most out of the watch. Right. I really do
[49:54.480 --> 49:55.480]  think that's true.
[49:55.480 --> 49:59.920]  It's got a fricking microphone in it. I think that's one thing that's a lot of people aren't
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.880]  really thinking about is you're wearing something on your, on your wrist that has a microphone
[50:04.880 --> 50:11.000]  in it that you can just talk to and it can record your thoughts, which makes it even
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.280]  more frustrating to me that there's not a voice recorder app on it.
[50:14.280 --> 50:17.760]  Oh yeah, that's a little weird. Well, let's hold that thought and let's talk about the
[50:17.760 --> 50:23.560]  apps that are missing. But I, I want to do our next sponsor and it is our friends at
[50:23.560 --> 50:34.720]  hello H U L L O. Hello pillow. They make pillows, um, really good. Um, I got the wrong notes
[50:34.720 --> 50:39.840]  in front of the air. Hold on one sec. Here we go. Your favorite pillow guaranteed. Hello
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.000]  pillow.com. Um, have you ever tried a buckwheat whole pillow? I had never even heard of a
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.640]  buckwheat whole pillow until hollow became a sponsor of the show and then they send me
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.220]  one and it came in a box and it was so heavy. Actually they sent me two and it was such
[50:54.220 --> 50:58.720]  a heavy box. I could not believe that it was a pillow because pillow to me seems like something
[50:58.720 --> 51:03.640]  that's supposed to be light and fluffy and you take it out. Uh, and this is a thing that
[51:03.640 --> 51:08.760]  people have been using to make pillows for hundreds of years in Asia. Buckwheat pillows.
[51:08.760 --> 51:12.760]  They're, they're almost like they're filled with like seeds or something like that. Uh,
[51:12.760 --> 51:18.560]  really, really, uh, different than like a fluffy feather pillow type thing. Totally
[51:18.560 --> 51:23.200]  did not buy it at first. And then I tried sleeping on it and it was great. Uh, so part
[51:23.200 --> 51:29.320]  of the advantages to having a pillow filled with these buckwheat holes is that air flows
[51:29.320 --> 51:34.680]  through them. And so I've had this, I first got this back in December, so I've slept on
[51:34.680 --> 51:38.360]  it in the winter and now it's getting warm. It's in the eighties here today in Philadelphia.
[51:38.360 --> 51:43.220]  I've slept on it in the warm weather. So whether your house is a little warm or a little cold,
[51:43.220 --> 51:47.080]  the air flows through it and your head doesn't just kind of get stuck and sweaty on the pillow.
[51:47.080 --> 51:52.320]  Uh, you can adjust the thickness to your personal preference just by removing the holes. Anytime
[51:52.320 --> 51:57.720]  you just unzip it, open it up, take some of them out. It is made in the USA with high
[51:57.720 --> 52:02.460]  quality construction and materials, really nice materials, really good zipper. Everything
[52:02.460 --> 52:07.600]  feels super premium. Um, and they only use, they even go through greatly. You can go to
[52:07.600 --> 52:17.000]  their website and um, is that here? What are you on your end? I hear like a vacuum.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.840]  Vacuum cleaner or something. No, that's you. There's an airplane over here. All right.
[52:24.840 --> 52:30.320]  I'll just make a note of the time. Uh, I don't know what, I don't know what she's doing downstairs.
[52:30.320 --> 52:39.120]  Crazy. What is it? 53 minutes. I think if I told her, I think she's like grinding something.
[52:39.120 --> 52:42.880]  I don't know. Like it's doing something in the kitchen. Anyway, uh, you guys go to their
[52:42.880 --> 52:48.600]  website and you can even see the extraordinary lengths these go to to get high quality buckwheat
[52:48.600 --> 52:54.240]  holes. They, they, they're hand grown and milled in North Dakota. Uh, they've searched
[52:54.240 --> 53:00.180]  the world just to get like the best ones that they can. Um, the everything, even the zipper
[53:00.180 --> 53:05.200]  is nice. It's an environmentally friendly, organic product, no chemical based foams,
[53:05.200 --> 53:08.920]  no bird feathers, anything like that. Really, really good. Probably for people with allergies.
[53:08.920 --> 53:14.840]  Uh, even the cotton they use on the outside of the pillow is 100% unbleached certified
[53:14.840 --> 53:19.440]  organic cotton. So here's the thing. It's just like a lot of these products where it's
[53:19.440 --> 53:22.960]  like, Hmm, I don't know if I want to try a pillow that I've only bought online because
[53:22.960 --> 53:29.480]  some guy told me about it on a podcast. Um, they have a 60 night full guarantee refund.
[53:29.480 --> 53:35.000]  So get it, try it, start sleeping on it, give it two months and if you don't like it, just
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.720]  put it back in a box and they will send you a refund. No questions asked, no hassle. Uh,
[53:40.720 --> 53:44.160]  that's how sure they are that you're going to like it. They have three different sizes.
[53:44.160 --> 53:49.680]  Go there. Read, uh, tells you all about them. Uh, really, really good prices. Uh, you can
[53:49.680 --> 53:58.560]  save 20% on each additional, uh, that you buy and the URL that you want to use is hello
[53:58.560 --> 54:06.840]  pillow h u l l o p i l l o w dot com slash talk show a low pillow, uh, dot com slash
[54:06.840 --> 54:14.160]  talk show. So my thanks to them. I love buying crazy stuff like that on the internet. Just
[54:14.160 --> 54:19.280]  trying it out. Yeah, I'm telling you, we've been using it to get all this free stuff.
[54:19.280 --> 54:23.160]  So yeah, but I wouldn't still have it. You know, we still have both of them on the bed.
[54:23.160 --> 54:28.800]  It's, it's a great pillow. Great. Welcome Daring Fireballers. That's what you see when
[54:28.800 --> 54:33.440]  you go there. So what were we talking about with the, uh, no voice recorder app was the
[54:33.440 --> 54:41.980]  thing I said. Yeah. And there's no notes app. Um, no voice recorder app. Uh, like, yeah.
[54:41.980 --> 54:45.520]  So like, I mean, you don't even need both of those. You just need one or the other cause
[54:45.520 --> 54:50.640]  you could, I feel I don't, well, no, that's not true. Um, I know what you mean though.
[54:50.640 --> 54:54.400]  Cause the whole idea is you just have a thought in your head. You want to commit to the watch
[54:54.400 --> 55:00.920]  and addictive phone. You want to put it down. Yeah. So why not? Like I do that all the time.
[55:00.920 --> 55:06.520]  Do you do, I do, um, my number one use case for voice recorder app on the phone is when
[55:06.520 --> 55:11.360]  I, if I'm working with a composer and I don't like have an, uh, you know, I need to like,
[55:11.360 --> 55:15.920]  I'll often like sing a thing if I'm trying to express it and can't put it in words, I'll
[55:15.920 --> 55:21.840]  sing a thing and then I'll send it off as an audio thing. Or maybe sometimes we record
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.280]  temp voiceover with the voiceover app. Um, and every once in a while I guess I'm driving
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.320]  and I have a thought and I want to, um, and I want to record it so I don't forget it.
[55:31.320 --> 55:36.360]  Then that's the third use case. But to me, the fact that there's nothing like that on
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.960]  the watch is, is unconscionable unconscionable. Yeah. The closest thing I could think of would
[55:40.960 --> 55:48.000]  be like, at least with the built in apps would be like texting yourself. I guess so. But
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.960]  even then that seems, it just seems a little weird. Um, and there are definitely third
[55:52.960 --> 56:01.180]  party apps. Evernote has a pretty decent app. Um, uh, I forget what else I've tried. Um,
[56:01.180 --> 56:07.920]  you know, and it seems like it's fairly focused on, uh, the watch specific thing. I think
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.560]  if, if, if, if, and when the day comes that there's a Vesper thing for the phone, I really
[56:12.560 --> 56:18.600]  just be a big plus button and make a new note and that's it. Just hit plus, start talking,
[56:18.600 --> 56:24.200]  there's the text and then you're done. This is really all I really want. Sounds great.
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.440]  I wonder if you could use Siri and just say, Hey Siri, make a new note. I wonder what she
[56:28.440 --> 56:34.800]  would do. Um, yeah, I don't know. Does she know how to work with reminders that or, uh,
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.000]  or any notes out? It still confuses me what Siri works with and what she doesn't work
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.120]  with. Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't think that would work on the watch, although I'm not
[56:42.120 --> 56:45.880]  sure what happens versus the phone. You know, it's a funny thing when you're on a podcast,
[56:45.880 --> 56:52.040]  if you use the phrase, Hey, and then the name of the product, it, it, it will end up getting
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.760]  notes from people whose devices while they were listening to the show started going,
[56:55.760 --> 56:59.720]  I'm not saying we can't say it cause it's hard to talk about it without saying, Hey
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.280]  Siri. But it turns out though that it turns out that people who like listen, obviously
[57:04.280 --> 57:06.880]  if you're listening with headphones on, which is probably how most people listen to podcasts
[57:06.880 --> 57:11.000]  nowadays, it doesn't. But if you know, a lot, awful lot of people like my pal Brent Simmons,
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.680]  he just likes to listen to podcasts on the speakers at his desk while he works. You know,
[57:14.680 --> 57:17.840]  it's like he said, like haven't talked to, you know, the way, you know, other people
[57:17.840 --> 57:20.840]  like to have talk radio on, he just likes to have podcasts. It makes it sound like he's
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.720]  in a, you know, office full of friends or whatever, but then it makes like you're charging
[57:24.720 --> 57:31.240]  iPhone at your desk, like wake up. That's awesome. Um, so I mean that's dangerous also
[57:31.240 --> 57:38.840]  once, once Siri becomes more, um, you know, more, more aware of like operating the insides
[57:38.840 --> 57:44.600]  of a phone rather than just referring to the outsides and it puts great power in front
[57:44.600 --> 57:49.240]  of us cause we could do something like say the phrase that would initiate that and then
[57:49.240 --> 57:56.280]  immediately say, text my wife, I'm leaving you sent. Well that's dark. I was just thinking
[57:56.280 --> 58:06.480]  like, Hey Siri, make a fart sound. That's probably a little better. Um, what, uh, what,
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.080]  what are your favorite apps?
[58:11.080 --> 58:16.000]  I totally love the weather app. I think that the weather app has one. It took me a while
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.940]  to get used to it and this is one of those apps. This is the built in weather app from
[58:18.940 --> 58:24.720]  Apple and it's one of those apps where it's to me surprisingly deep cause it starts with
[58:24.720 --> 58:28.840]  all of the cities you've configured on your iPhone weather app. So it already knows the
[58:28.840 --> 58:36.240]  cities that you're interested in. Um, and you can scroll down to get details and you
[58:36.240 --> 58:42.840]  get like a 10 day forecast and all this stuff. You go side to side to switch cities and locations,
[58:42.840 --> 58:47.840]  but then while you're on a city, you can tap it and it changes from like the next like
[58:47.840 --> 58:51.480]  a clock style. It's, you know, and to me that's optimized for the watch. It's like the next
[58:51.480 --> 59:00.960]  10 hours of like precipitation, uh, the cloud cover and the temperature. My only complaint
[59:00.960 --> 59:05.880]  is I kind of wish that they combined the cloud cover and temperature ones cause I want the
[59:05.880 --> 59:12.240]  temperature and the, you know, whether or not it's like likely to rain.
[59:12.240 --> 59:16.960]  You pay attention to the weather a lot. I guess you would have to, uh, yeah, we don't
[59:16.960 --> 59:21.760]  live in Southern California. I don't, I never ever open a weather app, but I'm just, I'm
[59:21.760 --> 59:26.600]  looking through it as you're talking and yeah, it is really nicely done. Yeah. Well, and
[59:26.600 --> 59:29.840]  you know, April, April is probably a good time to have been trying it because April
[59:29.840 --> 59:33.800]  is the type of month where the weather is, you have no idea, you know, and, and just
[59:33.800 --> 59:39.800]  because it's really cold in the morning when you wake up, it might go up to 70 in the afternoon
[59:39.800 --> 59:43.200]  and you want to see that. So it's like just knowing, like looking at the temperature right
[59:43.200 --> 59:47.080]  now at 10 in the morning doesn't necessarily give you a clue as to what it's going to be
[59:47.080 --> 59:49.560]  like in the afternoon.
[59:49.560 --> 59:53.560]  So I think the weather app was probably when I first put on the watch and um, and it's
[59:53.560 --> 59:58.720]  loading the cities and I saw the status spinner. I think that's probably the first time I saw
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.160]  like, Oh, an app tape takes time. It's not, it's not instantaneous like on your iPhone.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.880]  Yeah, but sometimes it doesn't, I still can't quite figure out why sometimes it takes longer
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.040]  than others. And maybe it's because I'm not quite sure how much of it is to blame on Bluetooth
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:21.880]  and how much of it is like that the phone is checking the weather in advance already
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:27.760]  and already has up to date weather information. And then other times maybe the watch is like,
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.320]  you know, Hey phone, tell me about the weather. This guy wants to see the weather and the
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.080]  phone is like, Oh shit, I haven't checked in a while. You gotta wait. Hold on. And yeah,
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:42.000]  so it makes sense that they get smarter about caching that stuff and, and um, uh, smarter
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.280]  about just collecting the data when you need it and maybe collecting a little too much.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.640]  And maybe that's kind of like the, you know how like scrolling on the iPhone one wasn't
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:59.480]  quite as, as glassy as it is now. Maybe that's a kind of a, uh, sort of an analog to, uh,
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.040]  like waiting for data to load on the watch.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.480]  Uh, what about you? What are your favorite apps?
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:11.800]  Well, yeah, like, like I said, overcast is probably, I use it a lot. Um, remote is really
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.360]  cool. Then again, I've always been, I've always liked the remote app on the iPhone. It was
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.760]  I never did before when, when people would complain endlessly about it. Yeah. It takes
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:28.040]  forever to connect. Um, but I think it's probably, I'm still one of those people that's just
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.280]  kind of still impressed by the fact that I can control my, something on my TV with my
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.920]  phone and it just, it never doesn't, um, amaze me. Uh, and so now the fact that I can do
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:45.120]  that a little bit quicker and the pairing like sort of seems to last longer, I think,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:51.080]  uh, you know, before getting dumped and I have to then reconnect, I just think it's,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.080]  it's pretty cool.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.880]  I, I find that I have always, I mean, I, I just lose the stupid Apple TV remote. I lose
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.320]  it 10 times every time I watch a movie. I mean not and lose it. Meaning like, like is
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.340]  it on my left hand side of the couch, right hand side, 15 minutes. And all I wanted to
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:13.520]  do was quick pause. Uh, because you know, Amy's asking me a question from upstairs or
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.120]  in the kitchen or something and I just, just want to pause the damn thing. Um, I really
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.240]  like having it on the wrist. I, and, and, and it's one of those little things where
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.300]  I feel like you kind of have to take what people at Apple say at their word. Like when
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.920]  Tim Cook has said what he likes about wearing the Apple watch and he's, you know, I've heard
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.640]  him say it like three or four times that he likes using it as a remote control to control
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.780]  his Apple TV. Um, and as somebody who never liked the one on the phone, cause I always
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.760]  found then it's like it's even worse cause it's a device that's just as small and I can,
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.320]  you know, lose it between seat cushions. But then, you know, what are the odds that the
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.200]  current app is the Apple is the remote app. It's not because I'm probably texting people
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.640]  or checking Twitter because I'm doing two things at once and then I've got a double
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.560]  tap to switch. But the way that the thing works on the watch is if you're watching something
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.320]  actively watching it, it just automatically goes back to being the remote, not the clock
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.440]  face or anything like that, which to me is exactly what I want. It's as though the device
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  read my mind.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:19.520]  Totally. It's good for that. Um, a little tip we taped, uh, the remote, uh, sorry, the
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:27.040]  Apple TV remote in our bedroom. We taped it to like a little packet of Kleenex. So that's
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.920]  a life hack. But we, you know, the kids in bed with us playing with it and he'll drop
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.000]  it down the, between the mattress and the bed frame quicker than anything. Um, but yeah,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.400]  so that's, that's a fun one. Um, other than that, I think activity tracker is really cool.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:55.740]  Heart rate monitor is really cool. I like the fact that, um, so we worked with a Jawbone
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.840]  up as a client. We, we did something with Fitbit. Um, so I've had the experience of
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.400]  wearing these activity trackers, but honestly it was, it just always felt too cumbersome
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.900]  for me to like keep something like with me all the time that was dedicated to that purpose.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:18.080]  If I'm not going to wear a watch, then I don't really want to wear a wristband that only
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.440]  does that one thing. But now that I've got everything in that thing and the fact that
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.520]  it's an activity tracker, now I'm finally getting the value of an activity tracker.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.520]  And so just earlier today, if I can either take the elevator up to my office or take
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:40.080]  the stairs and I know that this stupid thing is going to remind me that, um, you know,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.920]  like I have like what, a hundred more calories to burn or something, then I'm, I don't know
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.520]  why I'm, I guess I don't have as much free agency as I think I do, but I'm going to take
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.480]  the stairs because I'm a child and I want a little, I want a little trophy.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.760]  I thought it was silly when I saw people say that it had been, somebody had a report, it
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.360]  might've been a wired magazine story, uh, like behind the scenes of the creation of
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.240]  the watch probably was cause that guy had the most access and that it's become common
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:17.520]  within Apple, like in the middle of a meeting for people to just stand up randomly because
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.120]  a watch that they're wearing said, Hey, you know, you know, there's like your last chance
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.480]  to get another hour where you've stood for a minute and it's just like become part of
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:32.640]  the, and again, it's like you can end within Apple. I'm sure that people would just chuckle
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.560]  cause they know why you're doing it and maybe you wouldn't do it if you were in a meeting
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.720]  with people from another company, you know, who aren't familiar, but that within the walls
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.020]  of Apple, this crate seemingly crazy behavior has become a norm that you can just stand
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.600]  up for a minute and kind of, you know, move your legs in the middle of a meeting, uh,
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.720]  because you want to make your watch happy. And I have to admit, I expected to turn that
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.520]  off and I still have it on.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:01.600]  Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of fun. It's task completion. Um, and, and I, you gotta
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.520]  think that an app is coming that's more like a game, almost like yo level of stupid simplicity
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.520]  where like it just reminds you, it sends you a reminder to like pump your fist and you
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.760]  have to pump, you have to stay, you have to like pump your fist no matter where you are.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.520]  And if you do it quicker, you get more points or something. And then just idiots are going
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.440]  to be pumping their fists all over the place.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:33.040]  I think that they did a really interesting amount of design on those activity like summaries
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:41.280]  and the stand reminders in terms of getting the balance right so that you keep using it
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:48.400]  and that it changes your behavior, which is the goal. But combine that with like, obviously
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.680]  the team that made the watch has been using it in some degree internally for a while,
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.400]  right? Like a year, maybe longer, uh, you know, testing these prototypes probably longer
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.920]  than that, that, you know, the people in the design lab have been wearing the early prototypes
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.000]  to try to fine tune the software. And I feel like once they got into it for a very long
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.160]  time, it would be easy to lose track of, I think this is how a lot of first run experiences
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.440]  go wrong, is that the team that makes it gets into it and gets it and understands it and
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.080]  loses track of what it would be like to have it on your wrist for the first day. And then
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.360]  you feel like, my God, this thing will not shut up about me standing. And I feel like
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.120]  they dialed it back to a level where it's, it's really well balanced between those two
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.720]  in terms of being frequent enough to get you to change, you know, some of your behavior,
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.600]  but not so frequent that you feel like, you know, why in the world would this thing be
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.240]  bugging me like this? Totally. If you, if you just, I think that's the case is if you
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.560]  ignore it, then it knows you're ignoring it. And instead of maybe instead of shutting
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.760]  itself off completely, it just gives you less frequent alerts. And so it's kind of like,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:02.400]  it onboards you. And then instead of you saying, this sucks, I'm jumping off. It does just
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.520]  very smart little things to keep you on. Uh, and that's exactly what happened with me is,
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.880]  is like, first I found it cool. Then I found it annoying. Then I actually gave in and wanted
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:19.760]  to do what it told me. Yeah. Um, I, I, and it has been a little bit of an eye-opener for me.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.680]  I've never worn any of those trackers. It's been a little bit of an eye-opener for me,
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:31.200]  like that there's definitely some, uh, uh, shockingly a correlation between a very
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:40.720]  productive day as a blogger and a very sedentary day. Like, uh, the day that I wrapped up the,
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.760]  the second sort of Apple watch review that I published like a week ago, uh, it was like,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.480]  my circles went nowhere. Like it was like, there was like, I finally got like on a chain,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.520]  like I finally got on a groove and I was in the zone and I felt like I had this article I'd been
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.120]  trying to get out for a long time off. And then it's like, when I finished it, I looked down and
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.440]  it looked like it looked like my watch usually does it like, well, you know, two in the afternoon.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.280]  Nice. You should win an award for that.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.960]  Right. There should be like anti, you know how they give you the, the,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.520]  have you gotten some of those awards? They give you like these.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.280]  Yeah. Yeah. I just got like this silver concentric circles one.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.000]  Yeah. They should give you like a booby, a booby award, you know, for, for when you've really
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.760]  screwed up. Yeah. Because you really sat there and did nothing. Right. And the thing is one of
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.880]  the things that's so interesting about this watch is and I feel like it's one of those things that
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.640]  we just, the first version of it, the one that you and I are talking about right now just has
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:43.040]  not even tapped into it, but the watch knows when you're wearing, right? It, it, as soon as you take
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.880]  it off, like to show somebody or to change the band or whatever, it knows it's off your wrist
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:54.400]  because the sensors are off and it locks the screen. And but that means that like, if you
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.280]  are not going to wear it all the time, if you're going to wear like your dress watch, when you go
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.120]  out at night or something like that, you're going to wear it. Sometimes the watch knows when you're
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.200]  not being active because you're not wearing it. And it also knows when you're not being active,
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.640]  even though you are wearing it, which is a big difference, right? Like if I just decide to wear
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.040]  my old watch for another day and I don't put the Apple watch on for a day, I'm not going to
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.160]  register any activity on the watch, but the watch also knows that I haven't been like a complete
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.440]  turd. Sure. Whereas if you are, if you're wearing it, I think that's so interesting.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.520]  And I, I feel like it could really come into play in a lot of different ways.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.840]  That that's true, but it, but it also entices you to keep wearing it until the moment you
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.040]  shut your eyes to go to sleep, right? Yeah, I totally underestimated that. And,
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.000]  you know, before I started wearing it is how much those fitness tracking things,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.760]  even as somebody who's not super into that, those features, but they still motivate me
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.440]  to keep wearing it and not wear my, my other watches because I want to get the credits.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.720]  Yeah. I, I went for a run the other night and turned on the, like, what is it? It's not,
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.680]  it's the, it's the exercise app. It's not the activity tracker.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.840]  Workout. Yeah, the workout app. And I told it I was going for an outdoor run
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:16.320]  and I went, I was running, I did, I ran for 24 minutes. I got home. It told me you should
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.960]  probably run for 30 minutes. I went back out and ran for another six minutes. I came back in.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.680]  I came back in the house. I took the watch off, but it was still going cause it was like,
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.920]  I didn't set a goal. I had just left, left it as an open exercise and I took off the watch and then
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.200]  like the bottom of the watch was glowing green and it frightened me. I didn't know why. And then I
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.320]  just, I like, I researched it a little bit and found out that the green light is how it actually
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.680]  reads your heart rate. Do you, do you know about that? Yes, a little bit. And I think it switches
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.000]  to a more powerful mode when you're in the midst of a workout, like probably, you know, and it's,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.960]  it's like, it pulls your heartbeat constantly as opposed to doing it every six, seven minutes.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.160]  Right. Which is weird to me because like, if you, if you, you know, you and I are both sitting,
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.640]  presumably if you go over to the heart rate monitor in your glances or whatever,
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.280]  then it's going to tell you like your heart rate was whatever three minutes ago,
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.520]  but now it's reading, it's taking a new reading. And that's, that's weird to me when I saw that
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.080]  the first time that three minutes ago, it was like, it was paying attention to my heart rate.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.160]  I didn't tell it to do that, but I think it's kind of awesome that it did. And so presumably
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.120]  there's like, I've got a whole day's worth of data. And if I were going through like medical
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.720]  stuff, that would be kind of interesting to my doctor, I would think. Yeah. Yeah. 69 beats per
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  minute a minute ago, but now it just took it again. It says I'm at 83. So I don't know. You
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.520]  got me, got me excited. I think I get nervous. I think I get nervous when I look at it and it
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:53.600]  makes my heart rate go up, but it was 60. I don't even want to say what mine was. I was 95.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.360]  Cause I guess I, yeah, that's why I'm cause I'm excited. Yeah. And I had a big lunch.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:09.760]  I think the workout app is an interesting app too. I like it. And I like the way that it is like
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.680]  just brain dead, super simple. Here's some big buttons for different types of workouts.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.640]  Go pick the one that you're going to start right now, tap the button and hit go.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:27.040]  Yeah. Although I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure what to do when I go for a run,
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.720]  whether I should tell it how far I want to go or how long I want to go.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.040]  Yeah. I think like the last, well, I didn't do either. The last item on the list was just open
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.960]  ended. Just measure how, how much I'm doing and then we'll call it done.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.080]  Yeah. I think, I think there's an interesting combination here. And, and again, I haven't
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.760]  used a Fitbit or any of those things, but I feel like one of the problems that never made me want
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.520]  to use one is that they didn't really show you anything. You just, you know, at least the one
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.840]  that like Amy has, it doesn't really have much of a display. It just, I don't know, like four bars
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.240]  that light up and then you have to plug it in your computer or sync it with the iPhone app and then
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:09.680]  use a different device to check what it thinks you did. Whereas I feel like a lot of, a lot of things
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.560]  with the phone to me are the key to their success is that the phone is both, both sides of the
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:22.960]  equation. And two examples are Instagram and like Periscope and Meerkat where it's the same device
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.640]  that people are using to shoot the photos and edit the photos and post the photos is the same device
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.720]  that everyone else is using to see the photos. And I feel like that's the way that the fitness
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.960]  tracking stuff on the watch to me works. And I know it doesn't have like everything. Like it's,
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.520]  it's, it's interesting where they cut it off. Like I think it shows you like your last workout,
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.640]  but it doesn't show you your whole workout history. You have to go to the phone app to
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.720]  see your workout history, but that's because the history is too much information for the watch.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.080]  It's just enough, but it's like, here's what I think you did today.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.920]  Yeah. And I think that, that, that kind of just speaks to the whole purpose of the watch in
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.680]  general is just enough and not too much because too much is just going to be, is going to make
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:13.440]  people, is going to turn people off to it. And I've noticed that just with like the notifications,
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.680]  do you use the Gmail app at all? No, I just use Apple mail.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.720]  I just use Apple mail.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:27.200]  Yeah. So Apple mail well, so sandwiches, email is all run through Google and Google,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.560]  like you don't get Google push email working very well through Apple mail. So I,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:41.600]  so what I do is I use, I use the Gmail app on my phone to right away push me an alert, you know,
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.720]  notification that I have new email. And then when I get that alert, I know to go into my Apple mail
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:53.920]  app and it'll go and fetch that email. It's kind of a roundabout way of being obsessive about email,
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:00.160]  but it works for me. So I use Gmail is basically like an alert. And so I've got Gmail alerts on my
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.280]  watch and what Gmail does when it notifies you have a new email on your watch is it only gives
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:11.440]  you a few lines of preview of the, of the message. Whereas Apple mail, when, when it tells you there's
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.640]  a new email, you can actually scroll through the whole email. But the, the weird psychological
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:23.040]  effect of that is because I'm obsessive about email. If Gmail tells me about, I've got a new
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.160]  email and I can see only the first few lines, then I know I can then kind of save it for later
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.880]  and then go back when I have time, go into my mail program and then I know I can respond to it then.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.320]  But if it shows me the whole thing, I think that I have to respond to it right then.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:46.560]  So that's another instance of just enough, just enough info to like know to do something later
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:55.600]  with it. And this is kind of like that time, you know, reevaluating your time that people were
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.080]  talking about early on that the, that the watch kind of affords you is like the opportunity to
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:08.880]  take your iPhone out less and less. Yeah. And I know I, I've gone back and forth. That's one
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.760]  of those things where I'm so, I feel like it's just, I'm lucky that I've had the watch as long
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:20.560]  as I have because then to me, and it's like my opinion has changed on it where at first I thought
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.560]  that it was that this whole argument that it's about taking your phone out less. I was like,
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:32.160]  I'm not taking my phone out any less. I didn't think I was, but then I thought about it and I
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.600]  realized I kind of was, it's like, and to me, the difference is do I want to do something? If I want
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.680]  to do something, I still go to the phone, but it's, it's like, do I just want to check? What
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.920]  do I want to check something? Then I can just look at the watch and I don't know. There's like
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.920]  a subtle difference there and I'm sure, you know, there's all sorts of things that are sort of gray
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.440]  areas where one, but if I'm just checking something, it's, it's, I'm, I'm using the watch
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.560]  and I'm not taking the phone out. So I am taking the phone out, but I'm not using it less. Like
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.840]  if it's something I really want to do, I'm still going to do it on the, on the phone.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.320]  Yeah. And you want to do stuff. I even want to do more stuff with the watch. That's one of the first
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:18.480]  thing I know for things I noticed is it because we're trained to do that. Like you, you, you check
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:23.840]  something and then you do something about it right away. It feels unnatural to check something, have
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.360]  it appear on the watch and not do something about it right away. So you have to kind of get used to
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.040]  that, or at least I did. And it makes me want to be able to do more with the watch, but I'm okay
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:45.200]  that I can't, I guess. But yeah, that's the end of that thought. Well, but I feel like email is
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.680]  almost like ground zero for that line of thinking because, and this is the thing that I thought,
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.240]  boy, that sounds really weird. But now that I've had the watch a month that kind of makes sense
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:02.000]  is that the watch has your email, you know, from the mail.app and on the thing, but you can't
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.640]  write. So you don't get to respond and you don't get to craft a new message. It's really just read
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.160]  only and it's, and I've been using email forever on all sorts of everything from, you know,
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:20.240]  terminals to, you know, dial up modems. And I've never heard of a read only email client before.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.200]  And it just didn't make any sense to me, even though I don't write that much email anymore
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.640]  compared to, you know, with Slack and instant messaging, picking up a lot of the smaller
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:35.760]  messages. It just didn't make sense to me, but I kind of think it is. Cause I think it's exactly
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.000]  that use case where you said, where it's really just, even though you can read the whole message
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.840]  on the watch, just in case, maybe it is important. It's really just about those first few lines. Like,
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:52.800]  is this something you want to go deal with right now? Yeah. And I do think, I do think there's an
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.960]  anxiety reduction in that. Absolutely. You're exactly right. It's anxiety reducing. Cause
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.000]  what's the alternative. You get a notification or you get a buzz in your pocket while you're
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.960]  having a conversation with somebody. It's rude to check the notification. So then you have the
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.400]  anxiety of not knowing what it is. So I think that's, that's it. That sums it up right there
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:22.160]  in an instant. It's just suddenly just from the, the ability to turn your wrist, you know,
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.200]  40 degrees up towards you and glance down at it. You know that you don't have to pay attention to
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.920]  it. And you go about ego, you go on with the rest of your conversation. Do you know who has a really
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.280]  cool app for, and part of it is for the phone, but I feel like the iPhone app is actually pretty good
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:42.560]  is the New York times. And I never had the New York times thing on my phone. I do read the New
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.560]  York times on the web a lot and I, but I never really used their apps. Um, but I wanted to test
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.920]  their watch app and they had, they had one of the apps that came out like way, you know, really
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.640]  early, like the day after I got the review unit. So it was like, really, there weren't that many
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:04.880]  third party apps in the app store yet to try. So I wanted to try it. And the reason why is that they,
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.240]  unlike every other news organization I've ever granted temporary permission to send me
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.000]  notifications for, they really do only send you notifications for important news. Like, so days
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.640]  will go by and they don't send you any notifications because nothing really happened.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.560]  But then, you know, like, um, um, you know, like the earthquake, when the earthquake hit over in
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.160]  Nepal, then it's like, well, that's something I, you know, that was, that was actually worth
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:37.680]  you tapping me on the wrist to tell me that it had happened. Um, and I, you know, um, I don't know
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.200]  where I was going with that. Well, no, I mean, just once again, it's just enough. It's just the
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:52.960]  important stuff. It doesn't need to ping you every time, you know, whatever. I don't like, I have the
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:22:01.360]  breaking news app on my phone. I have, um, circa and, uh, you can like scroll through the top five
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:08.640]  stories and, uh, and then you're good. And if you want to go any deeper, but like, so here's another
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:15.360]  question. Do you find yourself like lying awake at night, like in bed, you've got your watch on,
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.560]  you want to like consume more content through the watch other than because it's a new toy and you
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.440]  want to play with it only, only in the first few days when I had it. And that, that has totally
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.520]  worn off. Like I don't want to consume any content on the watch. Another example, it's very common
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.640]  for me. I mean, I'm guessing it's probably common for everybody who listens to podcasts. This is the
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:46.640]  whole reason I think people like podcasts is that we, as a, you know, the type of people that you
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.400]  and I aren't, we just cannot bear to be bored at all for like for 15 seconds. I cannot, I, you
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:58.080]  know, and again, it's, you know, Louis CK has the entire bits about, you know, how that just shows
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.840]  up what's wrong with us. But like, if I'm in a store and there's two people ahead of me at the
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.800]  register, I'm taking out my phone, I'm going to read Twitter or something because God forbid,
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.800]  I don't have something to occupy my mind for the next 45 seconds. It never tempts me to,
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.280]  to go to the watch. Like, cause the watch isn't a do something, don't bore me, you know, like again,
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.880]  if I'm taking action, I'm, I want to go find something not to be bored by. I'd still go to
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.720]  the phone. I think to go to the phone, like the watches for things that you don't even have to
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.760]  think about, you know what I mean? I don't know. There's like a certain, and again, you know,
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.840]  Apple's using the word, it's an official name of the featured glances. But I think it's a brilliantly
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:46.240]  chosen word. Hmm. What glances do you have? You know, that's a good question. I feel like I
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.000]  would have been thinking about it. Like I've been waiting for my, the other watch I ordered
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.760]  to come and I was thinking that I would set it up differently and probably have a lot fewer glances.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.840]  I seem to have a lot and I kind of feel like glances are like, you really should just make
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.840]  them your favorites. And then that's like the quickest way to get to those things that you do,
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.560]  because then you don't have to go to that home screen where there's these tiny little
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.120]  buttons you just swipe up and swipe over and there's your glance. Yeah. I mean, when,
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.120]  when I first saw the, the idea of glances, I thought that it was supposed to, you're
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.400]  supposed to consider it like your doc or something. Yeah. Those are your shortcuts.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.760]  But I, I think that's not what they intended it for it to be because theoretically you can
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:31.680]  access any of your apps pretty easily. Anyway, you don't need a shortcut. I think it's just for like
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:37.440]  the little bits of information that you want accessible to you very quickly without having
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.640]  to launch the app. That's what I think. But I don't have too many of those things. I mean like
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:49.600]  power, you know, battery power is one of them. What do I have? Yeah, but I find with the battery
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.200]  power now, maybe it's different for you and that I would be interested to hear that. I like right
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:25:00.400]  now mine is at 76%. So, and we're recording at it's nine o'clock Eastern. So I mean, it's,
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:07.600]  I've mostly through the day. Oh, that's pretty good. Yeah. Mine's at 59, but I pretty much
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:13.200]  obsessively like lift my wrist every time. Right. But I think that's a 38, 42 factor,
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.160]  you know, like Joanna Stern and I were talking about it. Like Apple's promised battery life
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.040]  is all for the 38. And then they just say in real small print, the 42 will get longer battery life
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.960]  in most contexts. And so, but they don't say how much more, cause they don't want people to feel
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.720]  bad about their 38. They just want you to get the one that's going to fit, fit you right. And I
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.760]  really think so. It's sorry. Go ahead. Well, I just think that the battery life is not an issue.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.080]  Yeah, it's not, it's not going to screw anybody at the end of the day. Like when they need to
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:48.080]  do whatever thing you get used to every day, every night you click in the charger
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.600]  and, and that's, and that's all you need to do. It's like, yeah, like you, like you said,
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.520]  you never have to think about it. And there are so many things like that, that you don't have to
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:04.880]  think about. And I, I think it's great. It's just becoming more in the tech is becoming more and
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:12.480]  more seamless and visible and invisible. I'm going to take a break. Thank our next sponsor.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.320]  And it is our good friend once again from fracture. Fracture is, you know, these guys,
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.960]  you go there, you give them your picture, they print it directly on glass. They've got a code
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.480]  during fireball, just all one word. You save 15%. You go there, they've got all the sizes
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.760]  that you want. Little square ones, big, I think 23 by 29. I forget what the big square one they
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.280]  have that 20 something inches if you have a square photo. And quite frankly, probably half
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.800]  the photos I take these days are squares because I'm framing them for Instagram. So it's a way,
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.960]  one way to think of it, take your Instagram and make it real. And then you send it to them and
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:55.200]  they print it on this beautiful glass. And then you've got this beautiful analog version of the
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.280]  photo too. So we can not be staring at electronic screen for 10 seconds of the day. Fracture makes
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.320]  it happen. Probably let's face it. By the time the show airs, it might be a little too close
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.840]  to mother's day. You should listen to me last week when I told you to get your mom or your wife
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.000]  or your sister or whoever else is celebrating mother's day, get them a fracture. Maybe you
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.320]  listen to me, maybe you already did it. But there's all sorts of other holidays coming up
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.920]  and it's never a bad time to buy one. So it's probably too late for mother's day,
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.960]  but it is a great gift. It is. They're wonderful decorations and they really,
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:33.680]  I just cannot say enough over and over again just how amazing the quality is and how convenient it
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.240]  is that you don't never have to worry about. You ever have like a frame, you get a picture,
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:46.160]  like a photo printed and then the piece of paper that the photo is on is off center inside the
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  frame and then you have to unhook this whole thing and take all these clasps off and take
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.320]  the cardboard off and then re-square it and then hope that when you put it all back together again,
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.920]  it doesn't shift again. You don't have to worry about any of that. It's just right there on the
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.680]  glass, edge to edge, no bezel, ready to go on a wall, ready to be propped up on your desk.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.160]  Can't say enough good things about it. People keep ordering them. That's why they keep sponsoring the
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.000]  show. But they're really, really good. They're a great company and I don't know if nobody else,
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.960]  to my knowledge, has a product, anything like this. So go to their website, fractureme.com.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.840]  That's their website, fractureme.com and remember the code during Fireball. You'll save 15%
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.520]  off their already delightful competitive prices.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.160]  You're getting really good at that.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.480]  I love Fracture. I love these guys. But they keep coming back. It's like you guys seriously
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.920]  want to sponsor every week and they're like, yes, because people keep buying pictures from us.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:45.040]  Wow. Well, last week you made me buy an automatic for my mom for Mother's Day.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.720]  Oh, man. That's a great Mother's Day gift.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.280]  She's going to like it.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.120]  A dingus for your car. How's your dad? Is your dad still over?
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.760]  He's back. He got back two days ago. Thanks for asking.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.600]  I was worried about him.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:08.720]  Yeah, he got out. So he was leading a crew of volunteers doing a dental clinic. He does that
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:15.760]  every year in Nepal. He goes to India as well and they do Guatemala. And so he was leading a crew in
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:23.040]  Nepal when he had been there for a few days when the earthquake hit. And it basically sort of shut
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.560]  down the building, damaged a lot of the building where they do the clinic. So they couldn't do the
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:34.800]  clinic. But then it was just about getting all of these volunteers out safely and flights were
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:44.240]  shut down for many days. And then once everybody was safe and out with very minimal communication
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:51.840]  with the rest of my family, we didn't quite know what was going on. He managed to get out and
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:56.800]  landed a couple days ago and he was on the news. And I haven't watched it yet. I have a link in my
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.040]  inbox. So that'll be fun. You can put that in the show notes.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:06.160]  That's an amazing story and it's a great thing that your dad does. Your dad was a dentist
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.160]  or is a dentist.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:15.120]  He's retired. He was a kid's dentist, the spaceship dentist. His spaceships were all
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:22.960]  basically sort of pseudo Star Wars themed with like mechanical doors, automatic doors.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.760]  That's in other words, that's what you as a patient would sit in like a little Starship
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.640]  captain's chair and then you'd get your teeth cleaned. Is that what you're saying?
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:35.920]  Yeah, there were video monitors everywhere. Old school, 80s video monitors. There was like
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:41.760]  Starfield. I think he had like real production designers do the interiors of the offices when
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.160]  he came up with this idea. And everything was in that light gray kind of Star Wars
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:52.720]  inside spaceship aesthetic. It's pretty neat as a kid and robots and things.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.960]  Yeah, it makes being a dentist cool. I mean, honestly. But anyway, what a great story. Glad
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.320]  to hear that he's okay.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.320]  Yeah, he's okay. Thank you for asking.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:05.680]  Well, of course. I love your dad. I haven't seen him in a while.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.840]  Yeah, no, he used to go to Macworld every year.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.360]  He's like the coolest dad ever. Spaceship dentist chairs and took you to Macworld.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.080]  Yeah, he's a good guy. I'll convince him to go again so he can come out.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.680]  When the earthquake hit, he was getting acupuncture done and he had like electrodes
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:35.120]  hooked up to his feet and he had his eyes closed and then opened his eyes and noticed that the
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:40.320]  whole world was shaking and things were falling off the shelf. Everybody was running out of the
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.440]  office where he was and he just ended up running out of the office with the electrodes strapped
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.160]  to his feet.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.800]  No way. I thought you were going to say that he thought that maybe the electrodes were
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.440]  too powerful.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.600]  Yeah, who knows what goes through your mind. It's not a natural thing for a human to experience.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.040]  No, definitely not. I mean, even though you guys as Californians are probably more accustomed
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:09.600]  to thinking about earthquakes, but I don't know. It would drive me. It would be the last
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.800]  thing that would occur to me. I would be like, what the hell is going on? And then like a
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.080]  minute later, someone would say, that was an earthquake dummy. And I'd be like, oh,
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:19.040]  of course. But it doesn't even occur to me.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.880]  Yeah, no. I mean, it was huge. It was huge. It was huge.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.240]  All right. Here's an idea that's been popping up in my head with the watch. And I hear what
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.160]  you think is as we go and trying to think zigzagging between nitty-gritty details on
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.840]  the watch today and big picture thoughts like what's it going to be like in five years
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:44.160]  is one thing I can't imagine not or having on the watch because I can't figure out how
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.400]  they would do the angles to make it practical is how would they put a camera on it?
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.200]  Yeah. I mean, it's interesting you said that because I think that's the number one
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:02.640]  missing thing right now hardware wise. And to me, it would be pretty natural. I don't
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:08.800]  think it would be a front facing camera that looks up at you because I think what the main
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:14.240]  use case of it is that you want to shoot a picture of something else besides your face.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:23.840]  It's not a FaceTime camera. You want to avoid that seven seconds delay between seeing something you
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.800]  want to take a picture of, reaching your pocket, launching the camera app, shooting the picture.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:35.440]  You want to avoid that. So you just raise your arm and the camera's pointing outwards and there's
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.840]  your camera. And I feel like that cuts the experience down to maybe what? Two and a half,
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.440]  three seconds. And I can already think of a number of times. I have a two year old. You
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:54.960]  can never know what amazing funny thing he's going to do next. And there have already been
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.240]  lots of times when I've thought if only I could raise my wrist and shoot that.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:07.440]  Yeah. Well, I think that for reasons trivial, like, hey, I want to be able to shoot my kid or
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:17.600]  my cat to the deadly serious. Like the current world where ordinary citizens have a phone with
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:25.520]  them within seconds of being launched at all times has changed the relationship with the police all
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.880]  around this country. Like a big part of what's going on with the protests in Baltimore and other
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:37.760]  cities is a lot of ways based on footage that's come out that people have shot on their phones.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.200]  And if news is breaking, it's just getting to be at this point where it just seems like
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.840]  we've always got a camera with us. And absolutely. And the lens can be anywhere. The lens is like
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:56.160]  sort of the easy part. It's the sensors a little bit more difficult than the capture mechanism is
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:02.880]  and the storage is more difficult than that. But I feel like it won't be too long where
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.680]  the lens is really on everybody's wrist.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.440]  So where do you think they would put it though? Like?
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.160]  Oh, I have no idea. I am not an industrial design person.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:20.960]  There was a Samsung phone or not phone, watch that had it built into the wrist strap.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:26.800]  And yeah, absolutely. And what my experience with that and I love telling this story is
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.720]  I was shooting a commercial where I was on camera and what they do when with wardrobe and
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.440]  continuity and everything is the second assistant director, it's their job to come over and take a
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.080]  picture of you after every scene so they know exactly what your wardrobe looked like. And so
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.880]  our second AD was all day throughout the shoot coming over with his little point and shoot camera
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:58.160]  snapping a photo, saving it for continuity. And then towards the end of the day, he said,
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.680]  oh, let me grab you real quick, take a picture. He didn't have his camera with him. So he held
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.400]  up his Samsung, what is it? Gear?
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.520]  Yeah. Well, I think they have a couple of phones called Gear.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.520]  Yeah. So he lifted up his Samsung watch and he snaps a photo and says, okay, we're good.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.920]  And I was like, whoa, I know that the Apple watch isn't going to do that, but I already want it to.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.320]  Right. I want the feature, but I know that they're not going to build it. And I can see why
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.560]  Samsung put it where they did on the strap, but it made the strap. Everybody, you know,
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.800]  a lot of the reviewers said it, you know, the strap is not comfortable because it's, you know,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:40.880]  it's got electronic circuitry between the side of your wrist and the watch face makes it thicker
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:48.480]  and it defeats what's clearly a central part of Apple watches design, which is this idea of band
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:56.160]  swap ability. So I wouldn't go there, but I can see why ergonomically they put it there. Anyway,
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.200]  the tension that I see is that it seems to me like the tension is I expect to have a camera with
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.560]  me at all times, but I also now feel like soon enough, I'll be able to go with just my Apple
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:12.400]  watch and you know, but yet then I wouldn't have a camera with me. So then I feel like
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.280]  therefore dot, dot, dot, they have to add a camera eventually.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.080]  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's going to be iterative in the first version of the camera on the watch.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.800]  If there is one is going to look like garbage, just like the first, you know, the first camera
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.280]  on the iPhone looked pretty bad. Do you ever go back through your, your photos library and look
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:35.200]  at the first photo or the iPhone pictures you took? Yeah, yeah, totally. And they look terrible.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.560]  Yeah. And, um, and that's okay. And there wasn't a front facing camera at first and that's okay.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.720]  And it didn't shoot video. Yeah. Not shooting video, not shooting video is one that every
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.360]  time it comes up. Now I go back and everyone, I go back and I'm like, wait, is that right?
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.280]  I got to double check that. And I go back and I go back and double check and I was like,
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.680]  Holy shit, it did not shoot video. It's such an integral, integral part of the product now that
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.680]  we would never be without that. It doesn't make sense that they would ever ship something without
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.760]  that. And, and, you know, and you just have to wonder how many of those things are not in the
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.480]  watch right now. Right? Uh, yeah, I don't know. I feel like there's gotta be some way that they
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.720]  could do it. I don't know if it would be, maybe it would be a front facing camera. So you could
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:22.800]  use it for FaceTime, but then if you turn your wrist away, you don't, you wouldn't be able to
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.760]  see the framing. You would just point your wrist at what you're shooting and hit the digital crown
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.760]  and it would snap a photo and then you could turn your wrist back to see what, what it captured.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.600]  PAUL Yeah. That, that, that seems like it would be, it would work. I mean,
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.440]  we're not all framing up our, our iPhone snaps pretty, you know, very specifically anyway.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.160]  PAUL Yeah. I don't know. I mean, that's the sort of thing where I could be off base and maybe
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.520]  there'll never be a camera on it, but I feel like, I don't know, it seems to me like everything gets
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:55.600]  a camera eventually. PAUL It does. And everything gets smaller and faster and everything. I loved
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.760]  that part of what, of yours and Molt's conversation where you were talking about the iPad
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:06.000]  and the rev cycles and your reasoning behind, was this your reasoning or was this somebody else's
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.960]  that you read, the reasoning behind people not updating as much? PAUL I, it was sort of what I
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.200]  was thinking, but it was, it was better put into words by that one comment on Dr. Drang's blog,
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.800]  like a reader of his blog. You know, that. PAUL Well, that was so smart. I mean, so you can
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.560]  recap it if you want. PAUL I probably won't do his case. Probably still won't do as succinct a job
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.520]  as that guy did, but it was the basic gist was that we're only five years into this. You know,
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.600]  the first iPad was five years ago. So we're still in the first upgrade cycle and seems like for a
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.640]  lot of people on iPad lasts, you know, four or five years. And so we still haven't gotten to
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:52.080]  the point where you kind of know how many people should be, you know, if Apple is doing a good job
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.400]  with making new products every year, how many people should be buying one every year because
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.640]  people are still on their first one and they're pleased with it. PAUL Yeah. And why wouldn't they
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:08.320]  be? It does, it does pretty much what you need it to do, which is it, you can browse the web,
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:17.120]  you can watch video, you can do some creative kind of stuff and the processor hasn't gotten that much
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:25.840]  faster. And yeah, Roxana's dad still uses the version one iPad that we, that I had originally
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:32.160]  bought and we gave to him because all he wants is to watch YouTube videos all day of like classical
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.680]  music and architecture videos and stuff. And it does, it does a trick for him. And I, and it's
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.560]  such a, is it weird to say it's kind of like a secondary device? It's not. PAUL No, I don't think
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.480]  it's weird to say. I think it's, you know, it is what it is, you know, and I think we're going to
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.280]  get, as time goes on, we're going to get more and more secondary tertiary. We're just going to
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.000]  surround ourselves with little displays, you know, and that's what the watch is another one. I think
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.040]  is that, I mean. PAUL Well, it could be, but it also could be a primary. Like I think that the
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.360]  second it gets a feature that is a must have feature that the version one doesn't have,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.800]  I think it'd be, it's not, it's no longer a secondary device and it's a primary device.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.960]  Like even, even like just, just consider what would happen if the next, if maybe two years
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:24.080]  from now it's got a camera and people start seeing that people who have just bought the new version
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.400]  to watch or take, are getting all these cool cameras or whatever argument sake, it's some
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.960]  other feature that you can only do with version two. And like, you know, the fact that the iPad
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:43.440]  got a lens on it was not that killer app that the iPad needed in order for people to buy more of them.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.800]  I think you, you can make an argument that the, the iPhone one suffered from enough
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:59.520]  feature constraint that version two was where people started to really buy into it.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.600]  And, and, and, and it allowed them to do more things. And, you know, how many people did you
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.080]  see using a version one iPhone even three years after the iPhone launched?
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:10.880]  Oh, all the time.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.000]  Oh, really?
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.960]  Oh, well, no, actually, I guess I would say the opposite now that I think about it.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.880]  Well, I mean, my question was kind of leading in the opposite direction. I feel like there
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.560]  weren't that many people. I feel like the iPhone one kind of disappeared quickly.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:24.800]  Yeah.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.280]  Could be wrong.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.360]  And because they didn't, in the grand scheme of things, they didn't really sell that many
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.000]  in the first place.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.760]  I guess so. Yeah, you're right. And it could be just like a parallel
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.200]  model with the, with the one.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.840]  Do you know what, do you know what made me jump on that and say yes was that there's
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:43.200]  one teacher at Jonas's school who was using an original iPhone until like last year and.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.960]  That's so cool. It's a beautiful.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:45.520]  It is.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.000]  It's a beautiful device. It's gorgeous.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.200]  I love the device. And, you know, I just don't think that he was, you know, he cared, you know,
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.680]  about the technology or whatever, but it was, he just shot to mind is, yes, I saw that one
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.920]  teacher who was still using an old iPhone.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:01.760]  Yeah.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.400]  But no, no.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:10.400]  I mean, like the argument I was trying to make is that the iPhone one lacked so many
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:17.600]  features that then came out in iterative versions that it became obsolete pretty quickly. That's
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.920]  what I, that's what I was, that's where I was going with it. And so that didn't happen
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.000]  with the iPad, but I think it will happen with the watch. I think the watch will start
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.520]  to get new things that only later versions of the watch can have.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.760]  Yeah. And maybe, you know, I think medical sensors and stuff like that too, you know,
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:38.880]  who knows what it'll be. I wouldn't, I probably would not have predicted it was the camera back
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:44.960]  then because I don't think our expectation was so low for cell phone cameras that I thought,
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.320]  well, of course these pictures aren't great. It's a cell phone camera and it never.
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.040]  Isn't that weird?
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:49.280]  Yeah.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.360]  That the landscape for video for mobile video back then was the flip camera.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:59.280]  Yeah. I was just thinking about that because when the first iPhone with video did come
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.240]  out it, I remember comparing it against the flip and the flip still had better picture.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.640]  And you think like, well, of course it had better picture. It's a dedicated camera. Whereas
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.040]  the writing was on the wall that they just could not compete with Apple in the long run.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.800]  And the sensor technology is advancing it. It's such an amazing clip that it didn't take long
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.000]  for there to be an iPhone that blew the, blew the flip away. And then, you know, just quality wise,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.120]  let alone in terms of only having one device in your pocket and already being on the internet.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:29.620]  Et cetera.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:30.980]  Yeah.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:38.480]  No, but we have, you know, we have tons of videos from the earlier years of Jonas's life where,
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:42.320]  you know, that were all shot on flips. I don't know. Well, now I do know where the files are,
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.520]  but it's, you know, it feels, it feels like a bygone era.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:55.120]  It does. And because, and like, I feel like there's no longer this idea of scarcity. Well,
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.920]  I don't know. It's an interesting question. Do you, do you feel like when you're,
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.880]  when you're rolling video on your iPhone, do you feel like storage is scarce and you want to keep
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.720]  it to it? Like you want to cut the clip short. Obviously you're not going to shoot a two hour
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.200]  video of like, you know, piano recital on your iPhone or something like that.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.200]  No, I don't do stuff like that, but I don't.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.640]  Most of the clips are going to be like a minute, two minutes at the most.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:25.920]  Yeah. Well, you know, the video story for us is weird because, so Jonas was born in 2004
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:34.640]  and so for, in January. And so for Christmas that year, my mother-in-law got us a Panasonic
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.800]  mini DV camera. She wanted to, you know, she was like, I want to buy you a camera. You know,
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.720]  I want, you know, lots of video. It was wonderful. And, you know, she said, what,
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.440]  you tell me what to get. And I got a, you know, I don't know, you know, like a consumer, you know,
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.320]  dad, it was a dad camera from 2004. I thought it was cool how small mini DV was, you know,
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:46:00.400]  but then, you know, but it's like, so first few years of his life, like 2004, 2005, 2006,
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:07.760]  especially, it's all shot on mini DV tapes. And I, because they were tapes, then you,
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.120]  to me, you're, once you get over halfway done with your tape, you're like, well, I'll just
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.240]  keep shooting because, you know, it'll say, you know, like a little sticker on the tape that says
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.480]  Mother's Day 2006 or something like that. But it's like, I might as well just shoot the rest
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:25.680]  of the tape though, because the next time I want to shoot something, I want to start with a fresh
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:31.760]  tape. So I think that those early years of his life where I was shooting mini DV, there's a lot
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.960]  of filler footage where I just let the camera go because I figured I'd rather just use up the tape.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.280]  And then the next era is the flip era where most of the videos were shot with the flip. And then
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.720]  there, the clips are like just as long as you want them to be. And it's, you know, we don't need to,
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.640]  we don't need footage of every single present being open on Christmas. This is good. We got
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.680]  the one where he, you know, was most excited and put it away. Yeah. And did you think that when
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:04.400]  you had a flip, did you think of those videos as files? No, no, not really. But I was always glad
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.360]  though that they would be more easily put on a hard drive, you know, and moved from computer
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.520]  to computer than the DVD, the mini DV tapes, which I've still never really dealt with.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:21.520]  Yeah. I'm just so thankful now that we're moving to this cliche, but the era of the cloud
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:28.560]  and that literally, you know, it took five days for everything to sync when I migrated to photos,
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:36.400]  but my 25,000 photos and my 2,000 videos that I've shot are all somewhere protected in the cloud.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.960]  And I never have to worry about cassettes. I never have to worry about, you know, obsolete
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.680]  disk formats, hard drives, all that stuff is just like, it's somebody else's problem now.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.200]  And, and it's not, there's no barrier to going and recalling it. I don't need a deck to play
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:57.200]  all that stuff. I don't need a special cable. It's just, it's just there. I think that's a
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:04.080]  beautiful, beautiful thing that, I mean, a lot of lip service is paid to it because everybody's,
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:11.840]  everybody's, you know, the cloud is, is what is the, it's the golden, I can't even think of the,
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:17.840]  you know, the words to express what I was trying to say. The cloud is so, whatever, it's just,
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:24.240]  it's trite at this point, but it's very real. Like that story, data storage is, is sort of
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.680]  disappeared and we don't have to worry about it anymore. Yeah. I like the way I, to me,
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.000]  it feels like magic when I take, and I take more screenshots with my stupid watch than those people
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.640]  because I'm thinking about tweeting things like about a stupid UI or maybe thinking about it for
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.880]  an article or whatever. But it's really cool to me that when you do it and you take a screenshot,
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:48.080]  it just shows up on your phone. And then I was like texting them from my phone to myself or
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.000]  air dropping them, air dropping them to my Mac. And then I thought, I thought, you know what,
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  I bet they just show up in the new photos app. And I went to the new photos app and they're,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.520]  you know, it says today, and there's all your screenshots. They just show up. You don't have
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.520]  to sit there and, and airplane around the air, drop them around yourself. You just wait a couple
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.800]  seconds and it just shows up in photos quicker than if you had sent there. I mean, it's, it's,
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.200]  it's obviously images are heavier data than something like a contact, but you remember
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.240]  that feeling of like when, when iCloud first got its shit together and you could add a new
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.640]  contact on your phone, it would show up in your contacts app in your Mac instantaneously
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.200]  or a calendar, something that's very lightweight data. It was still impressive that they got it
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.920]  all working, especially after like mobile me. But now that the fact that they can do that with
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:41.360]  images, which 10 years ago we would have just like, you know, we, everything would have choked
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:49.600]  instantaneously. I think that's incredible. It's, it's it's really fun to watch. And I think that
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.360]  the one thing that disappoints me is that Apple hasn't done a great job of like educating people
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:03.040]  on the fact that it exists and preparing them for what it, what it means with everything that
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.520]  everybody's like constantly collecting with their, with their devices. I still kind of feel like
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:12.640]  Apple's nickel and diamond people on the cost. I feel like the free tier could be significantly
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.040]  higher. Like I don't, I don't mind paying four bucks a month or whatever I am for 200 gigabytes
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.400]  or whatever, but I kind of feel like the free tier is way too stingy. Like there's no way it covers
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:28.880]  everybody's photos and videos. And then, yeah, I bet they opened that up pretty quickly though.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.760]  Yeah, I think so too. That's seems like that sort of thing that, that they'll just keep every WWDC,
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.920]  they'll announce new pricing and they'll always, by the time May rolls around,
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.560]  we'll always be bitching about, you know, how much it costs because it was prices were set a year ago.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.800]  All right. Let me take one last break and then we'll do the last stretch of the show,
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.760]  but I have one more sponsor to thank and it is our good friends at hover. You guys know hover,
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:59.280]  H O V E R. It's the best place to manage domain names ever created. They simplified domain
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:08.240]  management. They, everything from finding a new one to transferring old ones to changing the
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.120]  details of the ones you already have there, all of it with a great interface. They have hundreds
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:19.840]  of TLDs now, top level domains to choose from. I honestly makes it harder to find a domain because
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.320]  now you can get the word you want, but you have to choose your top level domain. And some of them
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:30.800]  are pretty cool. I saw you guys, you just registered sandwich dot video, right? Yeah,
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:35.840]  it was pretty awesome. A company in Vancouver that manages that domain, they knew the comp,
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:41.840]  they knew us. And so the guy emailed me there and I snagged it as soon as it became available.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.600]  So that's pretty awesome. Hover also has email. You can add email to any of your domains. So
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.480]  instead of using some kind of free mail thing for email, you could get, you know, your name
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.720]  at your domain.com, get your email right there through hover. And to me, here's the part that
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:05.680]  to me, it's, it is, it sounds too good to be true, but it's not, is that they've got this thing they
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.960]  call valet transfer. So you sign up for hover, you become a hover customer. And then if you're like
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:17.840]  me, you've got domain names registered from X, Y, and Z registrars from like 1995 until today,
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.000]  and they're all over the place. And the other companies aren't that great. And you really just
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.200]  want them all under one roof. You don't have to do all that work. Just give your credentials to
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.240]  log into, you know, whoever registrars you used before, give them to the people at hover and
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:37.840]  their experts. This is all they do is they, they deal with DNS and, you know, making sure all these
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.960]  transfers go by without a hitch. They'll just move all of your domains from wherever. And from
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.560]  whenever you first booked them, they'll move them all into your hover account. And then next thing,
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.400]  you know, like the next day, there you go, you go and log into hover and all of your domains
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:56.720]  are right there. And again, it just sounds too good to be true because you think, well, you got
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.400]  to pay, you know, probably have to pay through the nose for that. No, that's just the domain
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.200]  transfer thing is just part of the service of being a hover customer. It's just included in
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.960]  their customer service could not be less hassle free. It's it's, I can't even imagine how in
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:17.040]  theory they could make it less of a hassle to move all of your existing domains to hover,
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.760]  all sorts of other stuff. DNS management, bulk management tools for people who have
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.000]  tons of domains. You name it, they've got it. So go check them out. If you have any need for a new
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.040]  domain name, if you have an old domain name that you would like to move to a really cool company
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:43.120]  with really good UI for managing it, go check out hover.com. And they have a promo code. And
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.640]  here's what the deal they listen, this is gonna take some explanation, but they listen to the
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:51.760]  show. They're big fans of during fireball, they listen to shows like the talk show and ATP. So
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:57.200]  they pick the codes based on things that like I've been writing about or whatever. So this week's
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:05.440]  code is come back kit all one word C O M E B A C K K I D. And that's that's my my nickname for
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:11.120]  a young young New York Yankee named Alex Rodriguez who's who's having a good season.
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.160]  It's a comeback kid. It makes people angry. They don't be angry at hover they picked it,
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.440]  but I've been the one talking about it. But people get angry about it because what he's
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:24.080]  coming back for from is a year long suspension from performance enhancing drugs.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:27.680]  Come back, come back kid.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.720]  So my thanks to hover, go check them out hover.com and the code is come back kit and then
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:39.040]  they'll know you came from here and that you you don't even have to be a fan of Alex Rodriguez,
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:42.960]  but you could just type the code and you'll save some bucks and they'll they'll know you came from
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:49.440]  here. So that looks awesome. That looks awesome. I don't I mean, I was just I was looking at the
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:55.760]  site as you were talking about it. I'm going to use this to register a couple of things. I thought
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:02.960]  you needed to go to like shady places to to get the new TLDs. No, but yeah, I think you did it
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:09.920]  first. I think you did it first, but I did not anymore. Yeah, that's cool. I like when you say
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:15.040]  our good friends at cause it's almost there's a little there's something a little good fellows
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:22.000]  about it. You know this is my this is my good friend hover or this is our good friends at
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.080]  fracture. Well, you know what it makes me the thing that makes me happy about so many of these
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:33.440]  sponsors is that they come back and you know it's like to me if I I love new sponsors too and so the
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.840]  rails tutorial you know thing is great first time that they sponsored the show. I hope they come
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.400]  back. Hope they have great success, but the fact that the other three sponsors hello was here a
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.600]  couple months ago and they you know, like they only signed up for one the first time and then
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.440]  they were so happy with the results. They sold so many pillows. I mean, which is a crazy thing for
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:55.760]  me to say like I I I could definitely like 1015 years ago imagine a world where I had some kind of
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.080]  talk show. I wouldn't have known to call it a podcast at the time, but I could have imagined
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.480]  doing it and I could have imagined that the way that I did it was by selling ads, you know,
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.400]  because that seems to be how shows always did work and probably always will. I could not have imagined
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:17.280]  that like one of the happy sponsors of the show was selling pillows, right? I just doesn't it just
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.760]  would not have occurred to me, but anyway, it's pretty cool. I mean, yeah, however,
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:27.920]  anybody can do any kind of business they want to know. Hover has been a sponsor of this show as
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:33.840]  long as the show has had sponsors like years and years and years to some level of regularity,
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.520]  you know, at least every quarter they've they've sponsored a couple episodes. So
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.560]  I mean it and I sincerely mean that they're my good friends because they've, you know,
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:47.120]  been part of my business for for a long time and I think I truly think they have a great product.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.240]  That's super cool. Let's bring it home. What are your last thoughts on the watch? What do you what
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.040]  do you want to talk about that we haven't talked about yet? Well, I mean, just we talked about the
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.440]  future a little bit. I mean, I said the camera. What do you what what else do you think that the
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.200]  watch has in in two or three years that it doesn't have now? Well, I can't figure out how they'll do
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:16.560]  it, but I it to me it's got to gain its own networking. But then, you know, so you so you
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.520]  don't need an iPhone eventually. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, but it's I'm not quite sure,
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.800]  you know, maybe it's just Wi-Fi or probably would be at first probably the first step to that would
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:32.880]  be to have true Wi-Fi and I know that it this gets complicated because the watch does support Wi-Fi
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.680]  at a certain level, but it's really just using like that back channel Wi-Fi to stay in contact
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:42.800]  with your phone while you're on the same network. So like your phone can be all the way on the fourth
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.880]  floor and you're down in the basement, you know, getting clothes out of the dryer and it's still
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:52.800]  connected because it's on the Wi-Fi but your phone I mean your watch doesn't get on Wi-Fi like if
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:57.600]  your phone isn't with you period that's really cool. I didn't realize that that's how that
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.720]  worked because I'd heard that it had Wi-Fi but I didn't know right because Bluetooth I the gist of
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:08.960]  it is I think Bluetooth is a practical range of about 30 feet and you know I think it gets kind
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.600]  of sketchy at the but it definitely is true. I haven't some people have asked like have I
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  tested exactly how far away the phone can be now because I don't do reviews like that like I'm not
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.240]  going to sit there with a tape measure and measure whether I get text messages at 25 feet and do I
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:28.080]  get them at 26 feet and stuff like that but I've definitely had the phone way more than 30 feet
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.200]  away inside my house and I still get text messages and stuff like that. And that's so smart because
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.840]  the only places you're going to be that far away from your phone in the first place are places
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:42.960]  where you know the Wi-Fi you have you're on the Wi-Fi network and it's a friendly place right
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:48.800]  otherwise you're outside of a network and you're you're worried about everybody stealing your stuff
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.680]  so yeah so I don't know how the business of it would work because you know even if you buy a
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:59:00.320]  cellular iPad you still have to pay at least you know like 10-15 bucks a month to get some kind of
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:05.600]  thing and nobody wants to keep spending 10-15 bucks a month but there's got to be some kind
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.560]  of way I think that once they can shrink a cellular antenna and fit it in a watch and not
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:17.200]  have it you know decrease the battery to less than a day that it'll have independent cellular.
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.920]  PAUL Well is it okay to is it fair to say that I don't really want that like I don't
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:29.520]  yeah I feel like if I stepped back to 2002 when we were hooking our iPods up to through firewire
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:36.400]  to our Macs in order to manage the libraries on them if you asked me would you like if you could
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:42.960]  just have music on your iPod you didn't need to do it through your Mac or even the iPhone you know
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:47.520]  like the iPhone you still needed to connect to your Mac at the beginning and you asked me like
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:51.520]  would you want that to not happen so you could just do everything in one I'd probably say the
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:56.320]  same I'd probably say no I'm good I like keeping everything on my Mac and then you know just
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.960]  managing it there. PAUL Yeah I think you're underestimating I don't think it's because and
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:06.480]  again it's not because I think that you want to do a lot on your watch without the phone because
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:10.800]  again I don't think that's ever going to change but I do think though that you should be able to
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:16.080]  just not worry about how close you are to your phone like if you wanted to you know and for
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.480]  exercising I think that's a huge one is that you don't have to have your stupid phone you know
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:25.840]  strapped to your arm in a band or whatever and that you can just go for a run for five miles
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:30.240]  and if an important notification comes in you're still going to get it so I think it's got to
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:34.400]  happen eventually but I don't know you'd have to switch to some kind of plan where everything is
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:39.040]  sort of all a cart you know you just sign up you give Verizon $100 a month then you get all of your
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:44.560]  devices it sort of works like that with a family plan now but. PAUL Yeah I could see it I could
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.440]  see that. PAUL And I know because I'm not gonna I almost missed it but GPS is another one and I
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:54.000]  know that the people who run and bicycle are that's like the number one thing that they
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.120]  they feel like this first one's missing. PAUL That makes sense I mean the first iPhone didn't have
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:06.000]  GPS and it felt like you had to do this bullshit triangulating to get your location on a map which
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.120]  seemed like a jip but I feel like the way it's not a probably it's not a concern for me I'm not
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:20.080]  an avid sportsman so I like maybe it's that's why but I have GPS pretty accurate GPS on my phone so
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.840]  I don't think anybody's sweating. PAUL Yeah but the exercise you know the people who are really
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.320]  into fitness wanted they want to go without the phone they want to just because the watch is so
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:34.320]  much better then you don't have this you know if there's just no good way to run with the phone on
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:40.240]  the really and they just want to go and do it and that you know without GPS they feel like they
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.960]  can't because like there's so many of these apps for like bicycling where they they have like they
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.520]  already have like three years of like every single bike ride they've had they have an exact map of
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.200]  where they've gone and they don't want to lose it same way that we were talking before about with
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.640]  the watch where now that you've got the watch on for a week and you've got like this week worth
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.160]  of activity things you want to keep wearing the watch tomorrow because you want to you don't want
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:05.520]  to you don't want to lose that skip the day yes but they've already got they're already used to
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:11.040]  having that GPS data right well i keep my phone in the little fanny pack like they have they make
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.560]  these like really slim profile fanny packs that you can wear uh when you're right don't laugh at
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.080]  me really really i left john grew really cool fanny packs is what you're saying well you can't
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.120]  even it's very low profile you can't even see it under the sports bro
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:36.160]  um but but okay so um like uh cable tweeted uh the other day was it cable
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:45.360]  so or maybe somebody tweeted regardless he had a waiter ask him if i saw his watch and said oh you
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:51.520]  have the new iphone watch and i thought that was kind of fascinating that it's i mean a waiter
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:57.520]  asked me yesterday yesterday oh can i see your i watch can you can you show me what it does i watch
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:03.040]  makes sense whatever that's the that's the go-to um iphone watch made a different kind of sense
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:08.640]  because that means that people are some people are just naturally associated with the hub being
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:15.600]  the computer that it sort of connects to being the iphone i think that's kind of cool um on top
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:23.360]  of which it kind of looks like an iphone 6 it yeah and i think it kind of it does it is an
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:29.120]  interesting way to say it and it does sort of i i wonder whether inside apple how much they
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.840]  were worried about the fact that they're selling it as a thing you have to have with an iphone
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:39.760]  you know that it it is that a bitter pill for people to swallow that this thing really needs
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:46.320]  to be in within 30 feet of your iphone at all times to have functionality i don't think so i
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:51.440]  think i could be wrong but i think people would look at people like myself would look at as an
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:58.960]  advantage right i think it's awesome it's like a tetherless tether um and where we i mean it what
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.920]  it just means to me is that it makes my watch that much powerful gives my imbues my watch with the
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.360]  power of an iphone which has been working for eight years to be as powerful as it is now it
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.720]  really the one thing that really struck me early on was how much the watch wants to be in contact
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:18.960]  with your iphone because as soon as it's out of range of your iphone like if you power your iphone
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:25.280]  off you get like what in my opinion is almost an ugly icon not ugly like that it was poorly drawn
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:30.160]  but because it's like a red you know what i mean it's like up where the notification which what
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:35.120]  are you talking which one so if you turn your phone off the watch gets a little icon up at the
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:40.240]  top a little red it's like a little red phone with a line through it like it's saying i can't
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:45.120]  i can't find my you know the phone that i'm paired with and there's no it's there's no way to get rid
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:51.680]  of that icon until you're back in range of the phone like and it's just uh it it at first i
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:57.120]  thought wow they really made that glaring but then i realized using it that it's because the
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.480]  watch really does want to be within range of the phone at all time like it's it's like lacking in
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:10.960]  oxygen when it's not not doesn't have the phone totally how cool is that pairing process of
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:16.560]  pointing your phone at your watch i think it's so great and i think i you know i'm guilty as
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:22.160]  charged that i haven't sung its praises enough but i feel like it's unheralded how good the
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:29.760]  pairing process is incredible beautiful could have been a qr code thank god it wasn't just like
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:35.360]  magical i i can't i can't think of a i the last time i had an experience with tech that was that
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:41.280]  magical is with the first time i slid the power on the i the first iphone and it showed me a picture
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:47.840]  of the world i was like holy crap this is a magical thing that unboxing experience of point
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:57.360]  your phone at your uh at the weird magic eye type yeah graphic on your on your watch that was just
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:04.800]  some smart smart consumer technology yeah and it's as as it sinks the first time it uh to me
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:10.800]  the animation is just gorgeous it's very simple very you know but it but it's they sweat so many
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:17.920]  details in that process so like the there's a watch on the phone like a picture of a watch on
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:24.640]  the phone as the phone app is syncing with the watch and the animation on the fake watch that's
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:30.960]  shown on the phone it stays in perfect sync with the animation you know the the progress spinner on
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:37.440]  on the watch itself it's so cool it's just signaling to you these two things are connected
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:45.520]  and i and i feel like maybe even a perfect way of summing up or like capping the show
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:50.880]  is like you told me when we were texting back and forth when you had the watch and i
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:55.600]  didn't yet and you told and you said i realized what and it started you wrote this piece about it
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:01.040]  anyway but you said i i realized what the phone is or what the watch is what what did what what
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:06.240]  did you say you know just a really cool digital watch yeah it's a cool as digital watch it's it
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:13.360]  it's it's like the most sophisticated digital watch you've ever seen um uh and and you know
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:22.080]  it does and i i think the the most futuristic thing probably in that old world context of what
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:27.760]  is a watch is like that you can make phone calls with it i think that's pretty awesome um it's not
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:32.720]  something that i would put into practice hardly ever i think it's awesome that my watch rings
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:37.120]  when i get a new call and i can decline it from there but i would never like especially in front
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.200]  of people i would never like take a call on my watch and just start talking to somebody
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:48.800]  it seems like a weird thing to do that um but it is super futuristic and bond like um but to me
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:53.920]  i think if i were to summarize what the watch is i would say it's a really cool second screen
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:08:01.520]  for your iphone yeah yeah i would totally agree um and it's strapped to your body so it's always
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:05.840]  there um i will say this i have to say this before we go because we didn't really talk about the
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:11.760]  touch the touch communication uh yeah but that's hard for you to talk about here's the thing it's
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.160]  hard for you to talk about though because roxanna doesn't have well you have hers and you don't have
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:24.480]  yours yeah so like she's the most intimate person you know connected to me so i have yet to try that
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:31.280]  out um and so like i i mean you you sent me a tap message um that i only just got like when we were
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:35.760]  halfway through the show because i was ignoring it i know that was my way of like i wanted it to be
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:40.960]  like are you ready yeah okay that was that that that's that's nice i just did like i sent you an
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:48.160]  old-fashioned text like a grandpa right um and it's like i so i have yet to prove out that use
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:54.080]  case i think for myself whether it's a heartbeat or whether it's like drawing a sketch to me the
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:58.560]  screen is way too small to draw anything meaningful and for some reason the only thing i can think to
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:04.400]  draw is a dick and i don't want to do that and then the next meaningful thing is a happy face
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.280]  and i don't want to do that either so i just end up not using i send a lot of happy faces
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:16.560]  um no but you know i said this before it's it's and it's so true is that for those features and
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:21.040]  so many people after my initial review came up they're like did you how many did did apple give
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.920]  you did they give you two so you can test the drawing uh and the way that we tested the drawing
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:32.960]  was i could send taps and heartbeats and doodles to people who worked at apple um but that i know
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.120]  and i did it just to see that it worked but it always felt a little weird because it's like
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:44.080]  all of those communications seem way too informal and the heartbeat one to me really does i hate to
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.240]  use the word because it sounds corny but it really is a little intimate it just doesn't seem like
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:52.560]  something you would send to somebody you have a professional relationship with right well do you
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:59.520]  do me a favor as an experiment i've got i've got a tap message queued up for you i'm just gonna try
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.760]  try drawing something all right all right because this is the first time i've done this in real time
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:15.920]  okay did it come no i didn't get it
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.080]  all right some of these things are sometimes a little latent
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.600]  so i don't know here i'll send you a couple taps
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:32.320]  oh yeah i'm getting your tabs that's kind of nice like raindrops
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:35.520]  so wait what am i supposed to i don't even know what i'm supposed to do we'll just draw a picture
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:41.120]  okay but did you add me to the uh yeah you're in my favor all right
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:47.440]  all right i don't think i'm getting it all right all right all right there it is
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.640]  all right so it works it's an action shot
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:03.520]  this is the future uh
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:10.560]  i did that to dalrymple i've kind of guessed when dalrymple was going to get a review unit
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:13.760]  and i was checking and you can tell if somebody has an apple watch because then when you put
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:19.440]  them in your friends and you go to their friends they uh they get the third button down underneath
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.800]  you know and say instead of just phone call and text you can also send them a digital touch so
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.120]  i just kept waiting for dalrymple to get the digital touch and as soon as he did i
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:30.160]  sent him a similar drawing so i could so that i could be up first
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:39.120]  oh that's great that feels good uh well adam lisa gore always a pleasure to have you on the show
