[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  you have a safe in your house? If you do, what do you keep in it? I'm gonna say something that is
[00:06.000 --> 00:13.760]  probably could come back to regret. We do have a safe, and last I checked, it is not locked.
[00:15.200 --> 00:20.320]  That's the problem with having a safe. We have two. One of them is locked, and the other one,
[00:20.320 --> 00:27.040]  but the other one is the one that we've been using for years. That's the problem with having a safe,
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.080]  is when you want to get into it, you don't want to have to go through all the trouble of unlocking
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.280]  it, so you just leave it unlocked. It seems like such a good idea when you become a responsible
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.440]  adult to keep things like passports, because I don't use my... I'm not James Bond. I don't use
[00:41.440 --> 00:48.880]  my passport very often. Keep that in there and other truly, truly inarguably important papers.
[00:50.080 --> 00:55.120]  And then it turns out you do take your passports. You do take your passports in and out, and you
[00:55.120 --> 01:04.080]  need them sometimes. Maybe it's easier to just have a very heavy box. I think I don't know. I'm
[01:04.080 --> 01:12.560]  kind of keen on stashing things in weird places. Yeah. But anyway, the Trump thing is fascinating
[01:12.560 --> 01:18.000]  to me. I don't want to spend a lot of time on it, but it is... in some ways, it is the most
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.760]  bananas Trump story of all time, which is something, right? I mean, because we're talking
[01:23.760 --> 01:29.600]  about a man who's... that's his middle name is... you're not going to believe this. Yeah. But
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.360]  basically, I don't know, what do you think is going... like, why does he have this stuff?
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.200]  Why did he take it with him? He's the kind of... I mean, he is definitely the kind of guy, though,
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.000]  that goes to a hotel and scoops up all the towels as he leaves, right? I think it could be just as
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.800]  simple as that. He scooped up everything that he thought had any kind of value in order to
[01:46.800 --> 01:54.000]  sell it or aggrandize himself. Or hoard it, you know, like... because do you remember...
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.560]  and I think the New York Times included it in their story, one of their, you know,
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.160]  numerous stories this week, but Maggie Haberman, who's been on the Trump beat for the Times since
[02:04.160 --> 02:12.160]  2015, when he first started running, one of the reasons she got the job as the Times' lead Trump
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.640]  reporter on the campaign trail was that she'd been following him... like, I think she was at
[02:16.640 --> 02:21.440]  the New York Post and a couple other New York papers. She went from being a New York reporter
[02:21.440 --> 02:26.640]  who covered Trump to being a national reporter when he became a national figure. And so she knows
[02:26.640 --> 02:30.480]  what she's talking about, but like she said... and you've seen pictures of his Trump Tower, Fifth
[02:30.480 --> 02:37.280]  Avenue office. It's not quite like that TV show Hoarders, but it was cluttered with memorabilia.
[02:37.280 --> 02:42.880]  He kept things. Apparently, one of his prized possessions is a pair of Shaquille O'Neal sneakers,
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.720]  and like she described it in the report as, you know, it was so cluttered with memorabilia
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.320]  that it was kind of difficult to walk around, you know, to sit in front of him. I think that
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.840]  the answer is kind of simple in that he's a lunatic. He's a crazy person,
[02:59.840 --> 03:06.640]  crazy person, and that's what some of us have been saying all along, right? It's not,
[03:06.640 --> 03:13.360]  oh, I have liberal politics and he's going to institute conservative politics and therefore
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.600]  you say things like, oh, he's a lunatic. Like George W. Bush was not a lunatic. Definitely not.
[03:19.600 --> 03:27.280]  Dick Cheney, not a lunatic. I mean, it's wrong, I think. I disagree on certain things. I think
[03:27.280 --> 03:32.800]  in hindsight they were clearly wrong on like the Iraq war, but I think it was in some more or less
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.120]  a good faith effort to do what they thought was the best for the U.S. national interests. You
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.680]  know, they're not lunatics. Wrong, warmongering. Possibly you could just say, you could even say
[03:44.400 --> 03:51.120]  bad people, you know, that their intentions were immoral, but not lunatics. Trump,
[03:51.120 --> 03:58.880]  I think that's the whole problem is the man is a lunatic. And I think that the peoples who like
[03:58.880 --> 04:04.320]  him or who just hate the liberals, you know, that want to own the libs and they just so dislike
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.920]  liberals and they're so into the Fox mindset that the only thing that really matters is owning U.S.
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.440]  liberals, that if the guy is sticking it to the liberals, he's their guy. And that's it. And that
[04:15.440 --> 04:18.960]  they sort of have a mindset when people say, listen, this man, look at what he's doing. He's
[04:18.960 --> 04:27.600]  a lunatic. They think something like this. Nobody likes a lunatic. Nobody would vote
[04:27.600 --> 04:34.400]  for a lunatic to lead a country. We like this guy and we'd like him to lead the country. Therefore,
[04:34.400 --> 04:40.560]  he's not a lunatic. He can't be. He's a very stable genius. And you just can't understand
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.800]  his level of genius. He's playing 12 dimensional chess. I don't know the names. It's the same way
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.200]  that I don't know the names of the rules of grammar. But, you know, like when you take
[04:49.200 --> 04:54.720]  philosophy 101 in college, there's a name for that fallacy, you know, like that five-step. There's
[04:54.720 --> 05:02.720]  some kind of name for it. But there's a big hole in the logic, which might be that your entire
[05:02.720 --> 05:08.160]  premise that no one would support a lunatic for president is wrong, right? And if you look back
[05:08.160 --> 05:17.200]  at a lot of historical figures who are universally deemed as being madmen lunatics, they had popular
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.920]  support, you know? Yeah, yeah. Well, Bo Burt's another one, right? I mean, Bo Burt's another
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.640]  person who is absolutely off the deep end, who, you know, her supporters think, oh, no, she's
[05:26.640 --> 05:32.640]  great. She's, you know, she's getting in there and she's making changes. No, she's just like
[05:32.640 --> 05:40.160]  flailing around like a mad person. Luckily, freshman congresspeople from Colorado don't
[05:40.160 --> 05:48.720]  have access to the nation's holiest of holy top secret nuclear secrets. But somehow I think in his
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.120]  lunatic mind that over the years, there were some of these things that came to his desk,
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.520]  and then he was like, I'd like to take this up to the residents. And they're like, well, sir,
[05:57.520 --> 06:01.600]  you know, actually the stuff in these red folders, we really should just keep here in the old
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.200]  office. And who knows, maybe they don't even show them those in the oval. Maybe those are,
[06:05.200 --> 06:08.800]  you know, they're talking about some of these things that you're only supposed to even have
[06:08.800 --> 06:13.920]  eyes on them in a quote unquote secure facility. I presume the oval office counts as a secure
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.640]  facility, but maybe they only look at those down in that room in the basement of the White House,
[06:18.640 --> 06:24.000]  you know, with the situation room. But as the president and head of the executive branch,
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.320]  you do have the right to declassify classified stuff. And I guess you have the right to take
[06:28.320 --> 06:34.560]  it up to the residents. And I think he just stuffed it in a sock drawer. It is seemingly
[06:34.560 --> 06:39.520]  universally agreed that one of the things he had was the letters, handwritten letters he got from
[06:39.520 --> 06:44.400]  Kim Jong-un. I think he just, I don't think he wants to sell it. I think he wants, he just wants
[06:44.400 --> 06:50.160]  to have it. It's a crazy mind. And he's like, nuclear code. And I know it would be juicy and
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.000]  awful. I hope it's, I actually hope it's not true. I hope it's just crazy and just hoarded
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.800]  the stuff, even though it's illegal. I hope he gets in all sorts of legal trouble for it. I
[06:58.800 --> 07:04.000]  don't want to believe that he was hoping to hand it over to the Saudis or something like that,
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.680]  but I also would not be shocked, right? Would you have to get to the fainting couch?
[07:07.680 --> 07:16.000]  No, no, no, no. I mean, but I don't think terrible thing. It's completely believable.
[07:16.800 --> 07:21.520]  But I also think that to go that path, you're, you have to attribute to him more,
[07:21.520 --> 07:25.520]  more thought than I think goes into it. I think he's just a crazy person and he's like, this is
[07:25.520 --> 07:31.040]  so cool, right? I've got like, I've got like this, the greatest secret documents about our
[07:31.040 --> 07:38.320]  nuclear system, something, something. I, that's mine. That's mine now. And you know, that's it.
[07:38.320 --> 07:44.640]  It's the same. I mean, it's the converse of him taking stuff into the toilet and flushing it down,
[07:44.640 --> 07:49.280]  right? It's like, I don't know what this is, but it looks bad. I'm flushing it down the toilet.
[07:49.280 --> 07:54.800]  Did you see that Maggie Haberman has photos? Yeah. I was like, those are real.
[07:58.800 --> 08:02.800]  Who sent those? Like the cleaning crew? Is that how they got those?
[08:02.800 --> 08:08.480]  I guess, but that, you know, she reported this months ago. And it's, you know, it's, it's a,
[08:09.200 --> 08:14.880]  to get a little serious here, a little bit serious as the Trump thing ended, to get it,
[08:14.880 --> 08:22.000]  put our media critic hats on. There's a repeated criticism, both of reporters, like from the post,
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.800]  the Washington Post and New York Times, who have books coming out about Trump or have had them come
[08:26.800 --> 08:34.000]  out. Woodward's had several. And former Trump administration officials who are on the sane side
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.600]  of the fence, who have books coming out or had books coming out. The argument of why didn't you
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.320]  say these things at the moment, if you're so, if you were so concerned about his damaging the state
[08:46.320 --> 08:51.200]  of the country and the world, as opposed to waiting until you got a book deal and then the
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.720]  stuff comes out two years later. Right. And, you know, I, I, I don't know what to say about that
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.040]  because I can imagine, you know, wanting it. I'm not sure. I'm not, honestly, I'm not that
[09:01.040 --> 09:07.360]  sure how much difference it would have made, particularly towards the end when they controlled
[09:07.360 --> 09:10.480]  both houses. I mean, they weren't going to, they controlled the Senate. I mean,
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.480]  they would have blocked anything that happened. So, you know, the guy already got impeached and
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.440]  nothing happened. So what else would have come down on him?
[09:21.440 --> 09:25.360]  Well, and we saw, right. And you can argue that the Ukraine impeachment, which again,
[09:25.360 --> 09:34.000]  looks a lot worse now than when it happened. But in the way that you couldn't, if you scripted all
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.240]  of this the last seven years as a TV series, you just, it would have to be done like Dr.
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.880]  Strangelove style as a farce and categorized on whichever streaming channel picked it up as
[09:46.880 --> 09:54.320]  comedy. You'd have to because of just everything comes back and it's like, well, this isn't
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.520]  realistic at all that the country of all the countries in the world, the one that, that the
[09:59.520 --> 10:08.160]  lunatic president tried to try to blackmail into digging up dirt on his political opponent before
[10:08.160 --> 10:16.720]  he gave them military aid that everybody agreed we needed to give them would, as soon as the
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.400]  guy was out of office, get invaded by Russia. Yeah. Right. Which was exactly the scenario
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.520]  that had everybody agreeing, you know, we need to supply the Ukraine with some aid because,
[10:27.520 --> 10:32.800]  you know, this other guy, Putin, is also a lunatic and it seems like he might invade.
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.120]  And that's the one country he held hostage for political dirt.
[10:39.120 --> 10:42.240]  Yeah, there was somebody posted something from The Onion. I mean, of course, you know, like,
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.000]  you keep finding things from The Onion that approved, that have come true. But it was
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.560]  something about the hat check person or the coat check person at Mar-a-Lago wondering if
[10:52.560 --> 10:55.760]  anyone's going to come and collect this briefcase full of nuclear goods.
[10:55.760 --> 11:06.480]  So I kind of agree, though, that whatever you want to say about the Ukraine impeachment,
[11:06.480 --> 11:12.640]  it was maybe borderline. I really do think it was an impeachable offense because I really
[11:12.640 --> 11:23.040]  think that trying to get political dirt is truly impeachable. I do. But after the insurrection,
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.480]  the fact that they still didn't impeach him right on the spot. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.240]  that's it. We're going to send those articles over again because we're voting yes now.
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.320]  If they didn't impeach him then, then I agree that somebody like Defense Secretary Mark Esper
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.320]  piping up right on the spot to say, I, you know, I just got fired and I need to tell you this.
[11:44.320 --> 11:50.880]  This man is a lunatic and he's trying to he's really it seems to me like he's trying to start
[11:50.880 --> 11:57.840]  a trumped up war, no pun intended, against Iran in the hopes that it'll make the country
[11:57.840 --> 12:03.920]  distract. Yeah. And I don't think how is that going to have more of an effect? So I kind of
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.160]  feel like, yeah, you probably should have done that, really, like just in case it would have
[12:08.160 --> 12:13.120]  made a difference. But holding it for your book probably isn't that big a deal. But anyway, Maggie
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.440]  Haberman reported months ago because somebody else sort of got the story, too, and she had it. So she
[12:17.440 --> 12:23.520]  put it out. Her book isn't out yet that Trump, everybody knows this by now, that Trump had a
[12:23.520 --> 12:30.320]  habit of ripping up paper and then flushing it down the toilet. But apparently sometimes not
[12:30.320 --> 12:36.640]  flushing. Yeah, really, boy. And then somebody else got more on this story last week. And so
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.400]  Maggie Haberman released another report before her book, but with pictures she had obtained,
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.600]  which again, like you said, immediately, I think, holy crap, somebody has pictures. And then you can
[12:47.600 --> 12:55.440]  zoom in. It certainly looks like his handwriting. That's the Sharpie. The all caps does look like
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.520]  his handwriting. I mean, if I work there, you know, I mean, I don't know what the security
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.760]  is like. I guess you could take, can you take your phone in? I guess. Well, I guess we now know
[13:03.760 --> 13:08.720]  you can't. I don't know. That was a good, that's always been a question to me. What, you know,
[13:08.720 --> 13:12.800]  do you, if you, if you're like a butler, you know, in the White House, do you get to carry
[13:12.800 --> 13:17.920]  your cell phone around? It's, I don't know, I just, I don't know. But somebody had pictures
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.720]  and she, you know, she's obviously staking her reporting reputation, you know, that these are
[13:22.720 --> 13:29.200]  real and that somebody took pictures of ripped up paper. And I will say for anybody out there who
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.800]  isn't aware of this, hasn't Googled it, hasn't seen the pictures, I will assuage any worries
[13:34.800 --> 13:41.280]  in your mind. The pictures do seem to be clear toilet water. Yes. Yeah. It looks like he was
[13:41.280 --> 13:48.640]  just flushing paper down. Yes. Not like he was doing, doing his business. Boy, if you like,
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.480]  if you really wanted to make sure no one was going to get it right. Yeah. You should have
[13:54.480 --> 13:58.320]  mixed it all together. Yeah. A little bit of number one, a little bit of number two,
[13:58.320 --> 14:05.680]  and a little the whole thing, a little bit top secret information, some damaging deal
[14:05.680 --> 14:17.440]  that you just concocted. But it is, what do you think he has? The list that came from the FBI was
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.200]  kind of funny because there's all this serious stuff where, where it's like, this stuff was
[14:21.200 --> 14:26.640]  labeled, you know, whatever the codes are for the holiest of holies, top secret stuff. Some of the
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.440]  stuff was just regular top secret. Some of it was just confidential, but all boxes of stuff,
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.320]  other things seemingly for whatever reason, but you know, it leads your magic, you know,
[14:36.320 --> 14:42.240]  let your imagination run wild. They're just like box 17, a, you know, and they don't even tell you
[14:42.240 --> 14:51.360]  what's in it. And then they're like something about the president of France. Yeah. What's that?
[14:52.240 --> 14:55.760]  Apparently there were hacked emails. I saw somebody post that like, and again,
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.840]  this is something that I read on Twitter, so I don't, I don't, who knows if it's how true it is,
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.440]  but that, that guy, Jack Presobeck, cause I can't, I'm not sure how to pronounce his name,
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.720]  but he somehow got these hacked emails for the, that were macrons and gave them to the Trump
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.800]  people. And, and then like the next day or, you know, shortly thereafter was allowed into the
[15:18.800 --> 15:25.440]  white house press. Oh man. See, yeah. Now I didn't know that now it makes a little bit more sense.
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.440]  And it also makes sense why he would consider that a souvenir. Yeah. Right. I mean, you know,
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.520]  and I, I would think that, you know, like any mob boss, he wants leverage,
[15:38.640 --> 15:43.600]  but it's like his imaginary leverage. Right. And the other thing too, I always come back to is,
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.880]  and I know that he bizarrely, and again, you can't make this up before he got into
[15:48.880 --> 15:56.080]  politics. He was a well-known occasional figure in pro wrestling, which you really can't make up,
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.560]  but I've always thought that professional wrestling really does explain Trump's view of
[16:02.560 --> 16:10.400]  how the world works. It's not quite fake, but it's also just, you just say what you want to happen.
[16:10.400 --> 16:17.120]  And then that happens that if the plot line is that the other guy wins the title because the
[16:17.120 --> 16:23.120]  ref got distracted and looked the other way and you got our hero got hit over the head and lost
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.880]  his championship belt. That's Trump losing his presidency. The hero who lost his belt can just
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.920]  sort of stamp his feet and get the crowd behind him and then steal the belt back. And now he's
[16:33.920 --> 16:39.680]  the champion again. Right. And he thinks everything works that way. You just say what you want to
[16:39.680 --> 16:46.000]  happen and it happens. And it's nothing is really based on actual cause and effect. It's all just,
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.640]  you know, it's like he thinks you can screen write the whole world, which is sort of how pro
[16:50.640 --> 16:54.720]  wrestling works. And that's why people look, you know, like to watch it. Most people understand
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.000]  that that's, you know, fiction. I'm trying to remember that magazine. I used to subscribe to
[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  this years ago, ran through the late eighties into the early nineties, I think. And they went
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.760]  after Trump a lot. It was a funny, funny magazine. Oh, it was Graydon Carter's thing. I can't believe
[17:11.760 --> 17:17.760]  I forgot that either. Yeah. I mean, but anyway, they, they, somebody posted a, a clip from that,
[17:17.760 --> 17:21.920]  from 1989. And it was Trump saying something about, you know, being back then, like he,
[17:21.920 --> 17:27.360]  he thinking that saying that he should be the one to negotiate some sort of nuclear treaty.
[17:27.360 --> 17:34.080]  Yeah. Like the start treaty, the S T A R T. Yeah. Nuclear because, because, because he said,
[17:34.080 --> 17:39.760]  well, you can learn that nuclear stuff in like two hours. And then he said, in fact,
[17:39.760 --> 17:49.280]  I think I probably already know it all. Oh, now I got to find spy magazine, spy magazine. Yeah.
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.520]  Yeah. I was cause I kept thinking secret and I knew that wasn't right. Yeah. But that's right.
[17:53.520 --> 18:01.600]  You're you had it filed under S and probably filed about as accurately as Trump filed all this stuff
[18:01.600 --> 18:09.680]  and these boxes. Oh man. What a, what a, what a banana story. And it's just sitting there.
[18:10.560 --> 18:15.920]  I like, I like it. I like to, when he announced the raid that he, he snuck into his statement,
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.960]  my beautiful home, my beautiful Mar-a-Lago like they've sullied it. Like,
[18:20.960 --> 18:23.520]  like the FBI came in and shit all over the carpets.
[18:23.520 --> 18:30.800]  That's what he wants people to think. You do wonder though, you really wonder what,
[18:32.640 --> 18:38.560]  and again, we've gotten these books on, from defense secretaries and, and off the record
[18:38.560 --> 18:44.160]  comments from the joint chief of staff and, and these perspectives at the highest levels.
[18:44.160 --> 18:49.200]  But I really do think probably the best stories come from the actual working class people,
[18:49.200 --> 18:53.760]  you know, like whoever took those photos of the ripped stuff in the toilets in the white house.
[18:53.760 --> 18:56.720]  Oh my God. Those are the people that should be writing books.
[18:56.720 --> 19:03.440]  Yeah. Just like, like you said, the doorman at Mar-a-Lago, you just know that he's seen some
[19:03.440 --> 19:10.480]  stuff, like some real stuff. He's probably got, he's probably got leverage on that guy too.
[19:10.480 --> 19:15.440]  Oh man. Also, if I, I w I don't even want to tell you, I'd even give the money
[19:15.440 --> 19:22.640]  to the Trumps. I would pay the money to the Trump Media Corporation to get a tape recording
[19:22.640 --> 19:30.880]  and listen to it of Eric Trump calling his father to tell him that 40 FBI agents have
[19:30.880 --> 19:35.360]  showed up at a warrant and are going and getting everything they want out of Mar-a-Lago.
[19:35.360 --> 19:37.120]  Is that how it happened? Is that what happened?
[19:37.120 --> 19:37.920]  Yeah, it was Eric.
[19:37.920 --> 19:39.520]  Because he wasn't there. I knew that.
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.560]  Right. He wasn't there. He was up in Bedminster, I guess, you know,
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.560]  because the weather's miserable in, in August in Palm, Palm.
[19:46.560 --> 19:48.880]  Nobody his age is still in flood.
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.080]  Yeah, but it's, it did come out that they, they strategically planned the raid for when he wasn't
[19:54.080 --> 19:57.840]  there. And I, I think the fact that it was a Monday, you know, cause they knew the place
[19:57.840 --> 20:02.800]  was mostly closed or whatever, but yes, it is, it was reported as fact that it was somehow,
[20:02.800 --> 20:07.280]  I don't think Eric was there per se. I don't know, you know, but he heard first.
[20:07.280 --> 20:11.280]  Right. The first person, you know, somebody there realized, well, we better call the boss.
[20:11.280 --> 20:11.840]  Sure.
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.640]  And the first person they got ahold of was Eric, who I guess was at work somewhere in the,
[20:17.200 --> 20:23.680]  the vast Trump organization. And it was Eric Trump who called his father to let him know.
[20:23.680 --> 20:29.760]  And I, I would just love, oh God, I would pay so much money. I would just make it my ringtone.
[20:32.560 --> 20:35.760]  Every time my phone rings, I would turn the ringer switch up so I could hear it.
[20:35.760 --> 20:41.520]  And then he says, who?
[20:41.520 --> 20:47.120]  Anyway, let me tell you about our first sponsor. Oh man. I am enjoying the sponsor's product
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.960]  literally as, as I talked to you, it's Trade Coffee. So here's the deal with Trade Coffee.
[20:52.960 --> 21:00.880]  They are like a company that deals with local roasters all over the country. They connect
[21:00.880 --> 21:04.720]  customers to the freshest and best tasting coffee that you've ever made by partnering
[21:04.720 --> 21:10.880]  with these craft roasters all over the country. So when you get, I've been getting, I've been
[21:10.880 --> 21:14.800]  getting them all summer long. And when you get them, they come in, there's like a Trade Coffee
[21:15.360 --> 21:20.400]  wrapper envelope, but then inside you, you actually get like a local roasters packaging.
[21:20.400 --> 21:24.720]  So each package, you could see who it comes from, from where, what type of beans.
[21:26.960 --> 21:31.440]  And they've got a thing online. When you first sign up, you go there, they have just a short
[21:31.440 --> 21:35.280]  quiz, just a couple of questions. Like what types of coffee you like? Do you like it really,
[21:35.280 --> 21:40.160]  really dark? Do you like a lighter roast? That sort of thing. You go to drink trade.com slash
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.240]  the talk show. You start there, you take the quiz, you get a couple of questions, but then
[21:45.040 --> 21:48.720]  let's say you get it every two weeks. And then when you get it, they send you like an email
[21:48.720 --> 21:52.160]  after you've had it for a couple of days. And they say, Hey, how'd you like that coffee? Do
[21:52.160 --> 21:58.160]  you give it like a thumbs up? Like a meh or a thumbs down? And then the quiz starts you to
[21:58.160 --> 22:04.400]  coffees you like. And then each time you get one, you can, it's like a recommendation engine. And
[22:04.400 --> 22:10.000]  I'm telling you, it works because I like the coffee that they have. It's really good. And
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.800]  it's like, they're getting it like, Ooh, this is exactly the sort of stuff I like. It works.
[22:14.800 --> 22:21.440]  No gimmicks. And it's really, it's good coffee. I always say this whenever I talk about them.
[22:21.440 --> 22:27.680]  Coffee is like produce. It goes bad. It really is. Even though it's roasted and it doesn't seem
[22:27.680 --> 22:32.560]  like fresh fruit, but the coffee you get in a supermarket is often on the shelf for
[22:32.560 --> 22:38.320]  weeks and weeks. If not, hopefully not, but sometimes months. Whereas the stuff you get from
[22:38.320 --> 22:44.240]  trade coffee, the local roasters somewhere in the country, roast it, vacuum seal it, package it up,
[22:44.240 --> 22:50.160]  and it gets to you within days of having been roasted. That's the way to make and, and get
[22:50.160 --> 22:56.160]  coffee. And it's so great to get it automatically sent to you. So you don't have to remember.
[22:56.160 --> 23:01.840]  You can pick weekly. They, they even have it as fine grain. You can go like every 10 days.
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.560]  If like, you're like, if you're so like a princess and the pea about how often you want your coffee
[23:06.560 --> 23:11.760]  that you're like a week is every week is too often, two weeks, not often enough. You can get
[23:11.760 --> 23:16.160]  it every 10 days. That's how you could just dial it in the way you want. You go on vacation,
[23:16.160 --> 23:21.200]  just quick log on, skip the next shipment or just hit pause or something like that.
[23:21.200 --> 23:27.040]  So easy to manage. It's really great. They have delivered over 5 million bags of fresh coffee,
[23:27.040 --> 23:33.200]  and they have over 750,000 positive reviews. Make it 750,001. I give them a thumbs up. I
[23:33.200 --> 23:37.040]  really like it. I'm drinking it right now. Here. I'll take a sip. I'll prove it. You can't fake it.
[23:37.040 --> 23:44.320]  Listen, that's trade coffee right there. Oh, delicious. Anyway, right now they are offering
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.600]  new subscribers, a total of 30 bucks off your first order plus free shipping.

[24:04.800 --> 24:10.880]  the talk show, and it gets you 30 bucks off. Lots of stuff going on in our real world, right? I
[24:10.880 --> 24:19.520]  guess what we talked about wasn't real world. Well, I it's it doesn't sometimes it doesn't
[24:19.520 --> 24:23.840]  seem like it. Lunatic former president who still has support of his party,
[24:23.840 --> 24:29.840]  who's acting like he's going to run again, has stashed the nation's nuclear secrets
[24:30.560 --> 24:37.600]  in a basement at a resort. Or do you want to talk about system preferences and matter?
[24:38.720 --> 24:42.800]  I'm not sure what the bigger mess is. We probably should talk about system preferences though.
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.600]  So here we are, I guess if there's a theme of the episode, here we are mid August
[24:47.600 --> 24:53.120]  and all this stuff. This is the time when to me, July is sort of la dee da, you know,
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.040]  all that fun stuff from WWDC is still it's all fun and it's okay if it's buggy.
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.240]  And then August is like, hey, crap, this stuff supposed to ship soon. Let's get real about it,
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.400]  right? Because here we are middle of August. I'm guessing just on history ever since Apple moved
[25:10.400 --> 25:17.040]  the iPhone schedule from like June in the very early years to September, most people,
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.680]  a lot of people even who listen to the show may not even remember the days, the first like what,
[25:21.680 --> 25:28.560]  four years when iPhones came out in like June. But ever since they moved it to September,
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.120]  it's been like the first or second week of September, they did this, they kept that
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.840]  schedule during COVID when everything was remote. So I don't think it's very hard to
[25:37.840 --> 25:45.920]  predict that they're probably going to have the iPhone event on Wednesday, September 7, or Tuesday
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.360]  September 13. Now I follow this stuff, because I try to look at the flights, I figure I'm going out
[25:51.360 --> 25:56.960]  there. But the reason I say Wednesday is that if it's the if it's that week, the Monday is Labor
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.200]  Day. And so and traditionally, I don't think Apple's ever held an event. They like to hold
[26:01.200 --> 26:06.640]  them on Tuesdays, generally, for whatever reason, that's their PR scheme. But they won't hold it on
[26:06.640 --> 26:12.480]  a Tuesday. If the day before is like a holiday, like Labor Day, I don't know if that's for their
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.520]  benefit, if it's being gracious to the people that like me in the media, so nobody has to travel on a
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.960]  holiday or combination of everything. A friend of the show, Rene Ritchie, reminded me that probably
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.760]  in the old days before it was at at their own facilities, it was probably a union thing, too.
[26:27.760 --> 26:31.920]  Right? Like if you're holding the event at like a union facility, you can't tell those guys to come
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.440]  in and work on a Monday. The other thing they will do if you look historically, I think they started
[26:37.440 --> 26:47.360]  September's in 2012. Is that when Steve Jobs died? I forget he died. Yeah, well, he died in 2011.
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.640]  Maybe that one but it but in the fall, yeah. And maybe that event was on a weird schedule,
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.840]  because it was the first one to move to the fall. But at least since 2012, it's early September,
[26:57.840 --> 27:03.760]  but they also won't hold it on a Tuesday if the Tuesday is September 11. And I and again,
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.600]  nobody at Apple PR has ever told me why. I think for our lifetimes, no one's going to hold some
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.280]  sort of right. Let's have fun event on September 11. So anyway, it's either going to I feel like
[27:15.280 --> 27:20.080]  it's probably either going to be Wednesday, the seventh or Tuesday, the 13th. That's coming up.
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.240]  That's like, you know, what three, four weeks from now. So iPhones getting real, our friend,
[27:24.240 --> 27:29.920]  everybody's friend. I mean this sincerely that the undisputed king of Apple rumor reporters,
[27:29.920 --> 27:38.880]  Mark Gurman has reported recently that iPad OS, what number are we at 1616 will not debut
[27:38.880 --> 27:45.520]  alongside iOS 16 in September, but they're going to push that back to October when the Mac yearly
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.880]  Mac OS updates typically shipped. I think the reason why for anybody who's been using the betas
[27:50.880 --> 27:56.000]  over the summer is it's pretty clear, a little bit behind. But anyway, that stuff's all getting real.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.200]  And we could talk about all of which one you want to talk about. First, we want to talk about
[27:59.200 --> 28:10.000]  the Mac. I guess that's what we let off with. So probably ought to. So I'll say this, I'll start
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.960]  with this. I think overall, as this year's annual updates have settled in, I kind of feel like it's
[28:16.960 --> 28:25.040]  a relatively thin year. And I don't mean this as a complaint. I think some people really wish that
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.880]  every year Apple could just blow our minds away with major new tent pole features on every
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.960]  platform or some kind of major new feature that's on all the platforms. That's just not how stuff
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.200]  works. You know, like sometimes you need like incremental years, but overall it feels like an
[28:41.200 --> 28:48.000]  incremental year. And I, the only, the only beta that I have installed is, and it is in particular
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.360]  in particular because it looks the most different is iOS. And I think, I mean, I think at least,
[28:55.920 --> 28:59.600]  I mean, it's not just cosmetically, but like the lock screen makes a big difference because
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.240]  obviously that's something that you interact with every time you open your phone. So that one seems
[29:04.240 --> 29:09.920]  to me a little big anyway. Yeah. And then of course the center, nope, center stage is not
[29:09.920 --> 29:16.720]  the right word, stage manager. I will never get this, this dual use of stage. Again, it's just
[29:16.720 --> 29:24.880]  like you with spy and a secret and it's all filed under S stage. I, I, what was Nevin's Nevin had
[29:24.880 --> 29:31.120]  that game stage. Oh, what the heck was it called? I'm doing it. I'm doing it again. But for a while
[29:31.120 --> 29:38.320]  I kept saying the name of that. Yeah. Well, so I, we can knock the Mac out of the way first
[29:38.320 --> 29:45.200]  because the, the two big changes on the Mac that, that spring to mind is system preferences
[29:45.200 --> 29:51.280]  has now system settings and it's more than just a name change, which is good. I think that they
[29:51.280 --> 29:59.680]  held off on renaming preferences to settings when they redid the interface, you know, it, it,
[29:59.680 --> 30:06.480]  it feels fair. It looked shaky right from the initial beta at WWDC and meant enough to me that
[30:06.480 --> 30:13.440]  I actually brought it up on stage with Jaws and Craig Federighi at my live show two days after,
[30:13.440 --> 30:19.520]  you know, it debuted. And I, it was still, it's probably one of my favorite segments of that whole
[30:19.520 --> 30:24.640]  show. Cause I thought it was, I thought Craig Federighi's response was really interesting.
[30:24.640 --> 30:31.600]  I don't think, I still don't think I agree with him, but I thought it was as good, like,
[30:31.600 --> 30:39.280]  what do you, you know, I don't think I quite asked it like this, but one, one way to paraphrase my,
[30:39.280 --> 30:47.760]  my, my question when I first saw it, what are you thinking? And, and anybody who didn't watch that
[30:47.760 --> 30:52.720]  segment of the show, I, I, I'll make a note to myself, I'll put a link and I'll put a link that
[30:52.720 --> 30:59.040]  jumps right to that segment of, of the show. But he had a good explanation, which I, again,
[30:59.040 --> 31:05.680]  I don't want to put words in his mouth, but that it's more than just, Hey, this is what settings
[31:05.680 --> 31:13.920]  looks like on iOS. iOS is the one with a billion users or over a billion users and the Mac should
[31:13.920 --> 31:20.160]  seem more familiar to them. So let's make the Mac settings look as much like iOS as possible.
[31:20.160 --> 31:24.000]  That's a factor. He admitted, you know, familiarity is something in mind,
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.680]  but that basically they thought system settings had grown from 20 years ago when macOS 10 debuted
[31:31.680 --> 31:37.040]  to the point where it was much more simple back then. And now some of the panels in the modern
[31:37.040 --> 31:44.560]  system preferences have views within views and sometimes views within views, right?
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.720]  Yeah. Right. And then some of them, I never know exactly how to get out of.
[31:48.720 --> 31:55.040]  Yeah. You know, and, and a lot of times I think anybody listening who's ever done anything with
[31:55.040 --> 32:00.320]  like the privacy and security panel where it's like you go into privacy and security,
[32:00.320 --> 32:05.840]  and then there's accessibility in there. And that was my initial reaction when seeing that
[32:05.840 --> 32:11.920]  they had basically scrapped the whole thing and pulled over the settings from iOS was that, well,
[32:11.920 --> 32:16.320]  I've always had trouble in there. Like I always had trouble finding things even when I went and
[32:16.320 --> 32:23.600]  when I organize the icons alphabetically, I don't always remember exactly what one thing's called.
[32:23.600 --> 32:28.560]  And then I'm still searching through this long list of things, looking for the particular icon
[32:28.560 --> 32:34.240]  that makes me go, Oh, it's that one or, and then, you know, and then over time they'd change the
[32:34.240 --> 32:39.920]  icons a little bit. And so, you know, that doesn't help that much anyway. And so every time I go in
[32:39.920 --> 32:46.320]  there, I feel like I'm, I spend a solid 15 seconds at least, which doesn't seem that long when you
[32:46.320 --> 32:51.200]  say it like that, but seems like a long time when you're just looking for a freaking icon, trying to
[32:51.200 --> 32:56.480]  find the thing that I'm looking for. And so I was like, well, you know, maybe this would be for the
[32:56.480 --> 33:04.480]  better. And it doesn't seem like maybe that panned out. One of the things I've been slow to learn
[33:04.480 --> 33:13.440]  doing the gig that I do, you know, is I, when you have a good tip, you can't repeat it often enough
[33:13.440 --> 33:19.840]  to the audience. And I think like, Oh, I told people about that a while ago. I shouldn't tell
[33:19.840 --> 33:25.680]  them again. Cause every time I have like one of my favorite tips for iOS or macOS and I'm like,
[33:25.680 --> 33:28.960]  ah, you know what? I'll tell people again, even though I know it brought this up before I get
[33:28.960 --> 33:32.800]  all sorts of emails from people saying, Oh my God, that's the most amazing tip I've ever gotten.
[33:33.440 --> 33:39.840]  So let me tell everybody my favorite tip about system preferences before it goes away.
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.320]  All right. Just in time for it to go away, which is that in system preferences,
[33:44.320 --> 33:49.520]  you open it up, you go up there to the menu bar and go to view. And the second little section
[33:49.520 --> 33:55.680]  there is, or it, it, yours is probably says organized by categories. Yeah. And then you go
[33:55.680 --> 34:01.120]  one item down. It says organize alphabetically. Right. And it just read number. It just reorders
[34:01.120 --> 34:04.400]  all the preferences and it does away with the two, with the three groups.
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.400]  Yep. You know, you tell people this and they're like, what?
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.200]  And it's not like, it's not hidden, you know, really? I mean, it's in the,
[34:15.200 --> 34:17.840]  it's in the views. It's right where you'd expect it to be.
[34:17.840 --> 34:23.280]  Well, I do think I don't want to get off on a sidetrack about it, but I do think that it
[34:23.280 --> 34:32.800]  speaks to the fact that the menu bar has been sort of forgotten. I was going to say devalued
[34:32.800 --> 34:39.920]  de-emphasized is a lack of, is maybe the best way I can put it. It, it, to me defines the
[34:39.920 --> 34:47.040]  Mac interface. It is the one it's one thing that is absolutely unchanged since 1984,
[34:47.040 --> 34:55.280]  which is a long run that the top of your screen on the Mac is a menu bar and it's file,
[34:55.280 --> 35:01.040]  edit, you know, that some of these menus have been the same for close to 40 years.
[35:01.840 --> 35:09.360]  And as an ad and windows copied it mostly, you know, the big difference is that they put the
[35:09.360 --> 35:15.040]  menu bar in the windows instead of at the top of the screen. And it, you know, it fits the
[35:15.040 --> 35:20.160]  metaphor, the windowing metaphor of windows versus Mac, where the app is a window as opposed
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.040]  to just having whatever, but still it's fundamentally the same. It's, it's a great
[35:25.040 --> 35:32.720]  organizing principle for complex software and, or, or even simple software, right? Like text
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.800]  edit, which is a great app, right? It, and it is sort of a canonical example of like,
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.720]  if you wanted to introduce somebody who'd never used the Mac to the basics of the Mac,
[35:42.720 --> 35:49.120]  just have them explore text edit to sort of get a feel for how a Mac app should work and look like,
[35:49.120 --> 35:54.160]  and be organized and do something that everybody can understand. It's just a way to make text
[35:54.160 --> 36:00.720]  documents with simple styles, but for complex apps like, you know, professional apps like Photoshop
[36:00.720 --> 36:08.240]  and BB edit and X code, right? The final cut some of the most complex apps, apps that you
[36:08.240 --> 36:13.760]  actually can pay hundreds of dollars to take courses to learn, because they're so complex and
[36:13.760 --> 36:20.400]  do so much organize everything through the menu bar that, you know, and you can put much used
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.680]  features and toolbars and expose them in other ways, but that everything you can do is somewhere
[36:25.680 --> 36:31.760]  in the menu bar and it's organized, you know, the way like a library's organized in sensible ways,
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.280]  you know, like, Oh, if it has something to do with saving or opening, it's in the file menu,
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.640]  right? And you know, the view like changing which things are on screen, go to the view menu. It's
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.320]  so great. But I feel like overall, the trend has been towards putting things in the window
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.760]  and toolbars and that people just have sort of gotten out of the habit of poking around
[36:53.760 --> 36:59.520]  the menu bars. Right? I guess. Yeah. I don't know. But anyway, I mean, I mean, maybe that
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.960]  isn't an effect of using mobile devices, which don't have menu bars. Right. And I think, yeah.
[37:04.960 --> 37:11.040]  And I think I think that trend started in the early before the iPhone. I think the whole Mac OS
[37:11.040 --> 37:17.120]  10 era sort of shifted towards putting more stuff in toolbars, you know, and the Mac tool,
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.160]  the Mac toolbars of that early cocoa era were great, you know, and they had cool things like,
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.360]  you know, I still do that you can customize them and reorder the way that the things work.
[37:27.360 --> 37:32.320]  But they sort of shifted, you know, and I think it probably is friendlier, you know, and I think
[37:32.320 --> 37:40.160]  it's a better way to expose the most used features to the most typical use cases. But I think it's,
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.600]  you know, I definitely think the mobile era of not having menu bars has accelerated it.
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.120]  Yeah. Yeah. I think Microsoft came up with the ribbon well before the mobile, I mean,
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.520]  the real, you know, well before the iPhone. Yeah, but the ribbon, yeah.
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.440]  And I hate the ribbon. I absolutely hate the ribbon. And every time I bring it up and I
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.280]  think about it, you know, I mean, I consider it sort of a usability nightmare because every time
[38:03.280 --> 38:07.520]  I go in, I never find like all the things on the ribbon are nothing that I want. They're never the
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.320]  thing that I'm looking for. And, but every time I bring it up, people say, oh, no, you just got to,
[38:12.320 --> 38:19.200]  you got to try it more. You get it like you're not using it. So it, the ribbon versus cocoa
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.040]  toolbars is a, is a good direct comparison of the philosophical differences between the companies,
[38:25.040 --> 38:34.720]  right? So, so Apple's cocoa toolbars only had room for at the most, maybe 10 icons, right?
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.440]  I mean, there's options to like view small icons. I guess you could cram more in there,
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.960]  but for the most part and by default, like with default toolbar settings, you know, maybe fewer
[38:44.960 --> 38:52.160]  than 10 buttons up there. Whereas the ribbon was like, how much stuff can we fit in here?
[38:52.160 --> 38:58.320]  Including making some of the controls like L-shaped, you know, like they're like,
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.160]  they're like Tetris pieces so that they can get more stuff in there, which again,
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.440]  it's not to my liking. It's not to my taste, but I get how some, that's why some people
[39:09.440 --> 39:17.040]  love windows and love Microsoft's philosophy of sort of maximalist interface, right? Like
[39:17.040 --> 39:23.280]  put as much in there as possible. Anyway, that's my tip of the day, go to the view,
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.520]  organize alphabetically. And, and as I said, I've, I've tried it that way too,
[39:27.520 --> 39:34.160]  and it doesn't seem to prove it for me for some reason. You still do the search has gotten better,
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.880]  but it's still, and I think, and I think, I think that's what I use mostly on iOS.
[39:38.880 --> 39:44.000]  So I think I'm just going to end up doing that much more on, well, anyway,
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.400]  that it's more than just a stylistic change of whether it looks like a traditional Mac app
[39:50.400 --> 39:56.720]  system preferences or looks a lot more like iOS with this new system settings and macOS 13,
[39:56.720 --> 40:05.200]  Ventura, Ventura, Ventura. We were saying it on the rebound slightly more Ventura,
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.800]  I think, and somebody wrote in to complain. So I think it's supposed to be Ventura.
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.680]  Yeah. I was saying, cause it was Jesse, the body venture, speaking of pro wrestlers who
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.800]  turned into politicians. Can you believe, you know, tell me him becoming the governor of Minnesota
[40:20.800 --> 40:24.320]  27 years ago, wasn't, wasn't a sign of the future.
[40:24.320 --> 40:29.120]  Oh, no, not necessarily a good one, but I mean, and he was not so bad.
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.160]  No, right. I would trade him.
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.680]  Oh my God. An heartbeat.
[40:34.560 --> 40:39.440]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger was, I think, an excellent governor of California. Christ,
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.120]  I would, I was surely the best Republican governor I can think of.
[40:43.120 --> 40:46.720]  Oh, he was great. I mean, I'm not saying I agreed with everything and, you know,
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.120]  well, it's a real shame because I feel like he could have gotten elected instead of Trump.
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.560]  It's just that damn rule about being born in Austria.
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.440]  Yeah. So it's more than just the look of it. It's there's, there's right from the get-go,
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.800]  there's some serious fit and finish problems with system settings on the developer betas of
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.560]  macOS Ventura. And that's what I brought up on my live show. And I mentioned specifically that,
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.600]  that the trackpad, classical trackpad preference panel has some really cool,
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.640]  they're like videos or animated GIFs or something. I don't know if they're actual,
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.560]  but they look like videos that show a human hand making the complex gestures. Like,
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.720]  so then if you're like, what do you mean a three finger pinch? And they're like, oh, do this.
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.680]  And it's like, oh, if you do this, you'll get, you know, expose mode or, or whatever happens.
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.840]  And that all of those niceties were missing. And he said, yeah, that he knew what I was talking
[41:37.840 --> 41:42.240]  about and said, well, that's on our list. That's the thing about these summer betas is it is a
[41:42.240 --> 41:48.400]  legitimate excuse to say these are betas. Right. Right. That's why I assume a lot of these things,
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.800]  well, you know, a lot of these things that are just obvious glitches. Well, some of them are
[41:54.800 --> 42:00.160]  glitches and some of them seem to be more, I mean, I guess I would define them as growing pains as
[42:00.160 --> 42:06.160]  opposed to glitches where you are taking an iOS element and shoving it into macOS and they're,
[42:06.800 --> 42:13.200]  they're not compatible, at least currently anyway. I mean, you know, it works technically,
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.720]  but it does not look pretty at all. And, and it's not a thing. It doesn't seem, it seems like you,
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.520]  you would have to redesign the entire control in order to make it work right on macOS. And that
[42:23.520 --> 42:31.760]  hasn't been done yet. Right. And I think it goes back to 2007 and the original iPhone, or, you
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.680]  know, 2006 when Apple spent the whole year creating what would be the original iPhone and deciding
[42:37.680 --> 42:46.160]  what the interface would look like. And it didn't, it looked Apple-y, but it didn't look Mac-like
[42:46.160 --> 42:55.120]  really at all. I don't know that there was really anything in original iOS 2007 that you'd say that
[42:55.120 --> 43:02.080]  looks exactly like the Mac, you know, the, it used a different font, even it was all in the system
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.040]  font was all Helvetica at the time. And the Mac was Lucida Grande, Grande, they're talking about
[43:07.040 --> 43:12.720]  something I'd never learned how to pronounce, but famously, most famously, I would say I almost like
[43:12.720 --> 43:20.160]  conically instead of check boxes, they had these now famous little pill shaped left, right sliders
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.880]  that would turn green when they're on and off, which if you just think about that control
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.160]  specifically, why did they not use check boxes? And I think, I think there's a couple of reasons.
[43:30.160 --> 43:37.760]  I think one reason is check boxes on the Mac and windows and every GUI system I've ever used tend
[43:37.760 --> 43:43.280]  to be very, very small buttons. It's just the nature of them and making them bigger would be
[43:43.280 --> 43:53.280]  weird. And the fact that they're small works because a mouse or a trackpad is a very precise
[43:53.280 --> 44:01.680]  pointer, right? And again, if tossing out tips that are, have an expiration date on the Mac,
[44:01.680 --> 44:10.480]  on the Mac in any good UI, the label of a check box is a clickable part of the check box. So if,
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.600]  if there's like you're in a preference and there's a check box that says, use Bluetooth,
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.840]  if you click on the words, use Bluetooth next to the check box, that will toggle the check box too.
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.280]  So it's actually a bigger clickable target than you might think. And it's a great little affordance
[44:27.280 --> 44:32.720]  that's been in the Mac interface as long as I can remember. There's no downside to it. So even if
[44:32.720 --> 44:38.080]  people, most people have no idea that you can click the label, it is bigger than it looks, but
[44:39.040 --> 44:45.200]  they, you know, the iOS layout, it didn't, cause it's so up and down, right? And almost everything
[44:45.200 --> 44:52.800]  you do on the iPhone is held vertically. You know, it made sense. And so these little sliders
[44:52.800 --> 45:00.880]  instead of check boxes, much bigger, fatter fingertip size shape that you can just tap to move.
[45:00.880 --> 45:05.520]  But the other thing about them is you don't, you can't, you don't have to tap them. You can
[45:05.520 --> 45:11.200]  just slide the actual little slider, which is cool, right? Like one of the, right?
[45:14.320 --> 45:15.920]  You're going to make it, make it cool.
[45:15.920 --> 45:20.000]  Well, like you think back to the first year with the iPhone and it's like,
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.840]  what did we do with our iPhones? Why did we love them? There was, there was no app store.
[45:24.560 --> 45:31.200]  And it's like, well, I can remember I did, I read, I used Safari a lot and, you know,
[45:31.200 --> 45:34.080]  loading web pages over the edge network.
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.000]  But even back then, yeah, we were doing limited web pages, right? Because,
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.080]  yeah, because bandwidth was so bad.
[45:40.080 --> 45:45.280]  Right. Remember m.twitter.com, which was actually.
[45:45.280 --> 45:48.800]  Yeah. And I forget what the ESPN, when I remember checking baseball scores on
[45:48.800 --> 45:52.320]  like some reduced version of ESPN scoreboard.
[45:52.320 --> 45:56.640]  Yeah. I forget the URL for that one, but I definitely had it bookmarked because it loaded
[45:56.640 --> 46:05.120]  great. m.twitter.com was so minimal that it didn't even include avatars. It would just say,
[46:05.120 --> 46:11.040]  instead of saying molts and having your robot avatar, it just said molts, right? Because
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.120]  the avatars would.
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.920]  That was, yeah, that was an asset that had to be downloaded. And that was,
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.520]  that took too long over edge took way too long, but it was, it was great. But we used the web
[46:21.520 --> 46:26.400]  and then for the most part, we just played with, with the interface. We just slid buttons and,
[46:26.400 --> 46:33.440]  and, and we, we, we scrolled things that were scrolling and, and we sat there for a year
[46:33.440 --> 46:35.920]  saying, this is amazing. You just put your finger on it.
[46:35.920 --> 46:38.400]  And we did pull down to refresh on whatever.
[46:38.400 --> 46:41.360]  Yeah. Yeah. Tweety. I don't know if that was the first year, but it certainly,
[46:41.360 --> 46:42.480]  yeah, no, probably not. Yeah.
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.360]  But whenever Lauren Brikter invented pull to refresh for Tweety, I remember just pulling.
[46:47.360 --> 46:50.320]  I just do that. Oh yeah. You do it over and over and over again.
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.640]  I wasn't interested in seeing more tweets. I was just interested in,
[46:54.640 --> 47:00.320]  in feeling the pull to refresh animation and, and thinking, boy, he really nailed all of the.
[47:00.960 --> 47:06.080]  Yeah. It was like a, it was like one of those, it was a fidget tool, you know? I mean, it was.
[47:06.080 --> 47:07.680]  Yes. I can't remember what it's called.
[47:07.680 --> 47:12.720]  Yeah. Fidget spinner or whatever, you know, but that, but that's, that is, I,
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.240]  but I think fidget tools are, I love to do, I, I like to click my pen. It drives, of course,
[47:18.240 --> 47:28.560]  you know, reason, reason number 47, I work alone and have a door on my office is I like to click,
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.840]  I like to click a pen. I like a clicky keyboard. Fidgeting is, it's a human thing. It's, you know,
[47:35.840 --> 47:39.680]  if you don't like to fidget with anything, God bless you, you know, you don't have to do it, but
[47:39.680 --> 47:42.240]  you know, I need something. You might be a robot.
[47:42.240 --> 47:46.320]  Right. But I remember like just going shopping and I'd be in the line at the supermarket and
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.120]  just playing with the interface and just playing with the sliders. And that was cool. It showed off
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.920]  the interface. But anyway, that's what I'm going is they, they, they redid everything. They didn't
[47:55.920 --> 48:02.880]  use any pop-up menus, no menu bar, no pop-up menus. The everything was like full screen things.
[48:02.880 --> 48:08.960]  They were all every, every user interface element was sort of redesigned from the ground up for
[48:08.960 --> 48:19.200]  touch. And it made sense to do that. And the converse is not quite equivalent. Like desktop
[48:19.200 --> 48:27.520]  style UI controls do not work on a small pocket touch screen phone. They really don't. And I think
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.920]  that's part of the reason windows phone never took off before the iPhone, even though they didn't
[48:31.920 --> 48:38.000]  have a touch screen, they used a stylus because they used these user interface style controls that
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.360]  needed precision, which is why they use the stylus. But I just don't think it worked well
[48:43.360 --> 48:49.840]  mentally. It was too backwards thinking. The converse isn't quite true. You can put iOS style
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.720]  controls on a desktop interface and it's not like, Oh, I can't even use this. Cause it's too
[48:54.720 --> 49:00.320]  tough. It's literally too small for me to accurately poke because you have the precision
[49:00.320 --> 49:09.200]  pointer. You can use a bigger, fatter, sloppier button shape, but it's still, it's not right.
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.200]  That's not right. Right. It doesn't make it right. And it's sort of like,
[49:13.200 --> 49:20.160]  I mean, that was one of my huge complaints about windows eight was that all of the things that they
[49:20.160 --> 49:25.120]  made in order to make it touch ready. And then they slapped it on windows because windows was
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.120]  going to be there, you know, it was going to be both on touch and on the desktop. Everything was
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.320]  too big on the desktop. All the controls were too large when, and then, and, and, you know,
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.880]  and we've talked about this before, but like they would keep, they would have one settings thing
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.120]  that was really for touch. And then in the background, you could still get the control panels.
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.600]  Right. It really did seem at the time, and that's the most interesting version of windows. I can
[49:49.600 --> 49:54.160]  remember in my career writing during fireball. Cause I thought it was fascinating what they're
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.240]  doing and they came up with a different look, but it just seemed so clear to me that they should
[49:58.240 --> 50:04.720]  have bitten the bullet and forked it into its own new OS. Okay. Windows isn't going anywhere.
[50:04.720 --> 50:09.120]  It's, you know, we know it's, you know, it's, it we're as committed to it as ever,
[50:09.120 --> 50:15.200]  but here's our new operating system. That's meant for touchscreen devices and let it be
[50:15.200 --> 50:22.240]  there. What iPad OS is to Mac OS, you know, fundamentally different in certain ways. And yes,
[50:22.240 --> 50:25.440]  people are going to bitch that there should just be one operating system.
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.360]  Shut up. Right. It doesn't work. You know, you can't have it all. You can't have.
[50:31.360 --> 50:38.080]  Yeah. I don't think it does. And I don't, it doesn't seem like it seems like this proves the
[50:38.080 --> 50:44.080]  point. Yeah. But anyway, the, the Twitter thread, there's a fellow named Nikki Tonski and I will
[50:44.080 --> 50:48.000]  put this in the show notes. I'm actually, I'm a hundred percent going to link to it on daring
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.000]  fireball, but haven't yet just, it's a well illustrated it's. I actually think sometimes
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.840]  a thread on Twitter is just a terrific way of posting things like this because
[51:00.560 --> 51:07.920]  Twitter, you know, the thread view is pretty good on just about every client I use and Twitter does
[51:07.920 --> 51:15.280]  make it really easy to paste in screenshots and screen recordings, even if, you know,
[51:15.280 --> 51:20.000]  cause some of the things in his thread or movies, it's so easy. I don't know much easier than
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.640]  writing a blog post and trying to get all that stuff in there. Yeah. Right. My CMS isn't
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.760]  necessarily optimized for making it as easy as possible to paste images and screenshots. I know
[51:29.760 --> 51:35.520]  newer ones like medium probably make it easier, but still there's like the, you have to upload
[51:35.520 --> 51:40.800]  the file somewhere and get the URL and Twitter. You just paste it in. It's just a tweet is so
[51:40.800 --> 51:45.920]  it's so easy to make an illustrated little thing like this where he just sort of went through and
[51:45.920 --> 51:54.400]  found. I mean, it's, it just looks sloppy, right? It's, it's just unfinished. Yeah. Yeah. There's
[51:54.400 --> 52:00.080]  a, and there's a lot of, like I said earlier, like there's a lot of different things going on here
[52:00.080 --> 52:06.240]  and it's hard to, you, you, you couldn't point to any one particular problem and say, well,
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.680]  if they fix this, some of them, some of them look like legitimate, just bugs, but, but also
[52:11.680 --> 52:18.160]  there's so many design problems. Yeah. Just controls that don't look fit and finished and,
[52:18.160 --> 52:24.480]  and buttons that, that are in like going back to Federighi's thing about views within views,
[52:24.480 --> 52:28.160]  that one of the problems with the old system preferences is that the shape of the window
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.800]  doesn't, you can't just grow it to make it longer. And one of the, and I think it was an
[52:32.800 --> 52:38.560]  astute observation by him that because of the phones and iPads and touch, people are used to
[52:38.560 --> 52:45.200]  scrolling and putting things in a long vertical list. If there's a lot of stuff to list it,
[52:45.200 --> 52:51.360]  people intuit that now, and you can make panels now that instead of trying to fit everything
[52:51.360 --> 52:57.280]  on screen in this window that has to fit on a, you know, the smallest Mac screen, you know,
[52:57.280 --> 53:02.880]  like a 13 inch laptop with the size scaled up, right? Cause you, you know, you can scale up
[53:03.760 --> 53:10.720]  a 13 inch laptop to, to not have that many points on screen and there's no scrolling.
[53:10.720 --> 53:18.080]  And so if there's a sub view, like going inside privacy to accessibility and inside accessibility
[53:18.080 --> 53:23.120]  to allowing screen recording, and now here's a list of the apps that you've permitted to
[53:23.120 --> 53:28.720]  do screen recording. And there's only room to show like four at a time. And you have to scroll
[53:28.720 --> 53:35.040]  this little tiny box within a box just to see which app is bitching about not having permission
[53:35.040 --> 53:38.960]  to do screen recording, even though you need it to or something like that. Well, you could just
[53:38.960 --> 53:43.600]  put them all in a big scrolling view and you scroll down and you can make room for these
[53:43.600 --> 53:48.560]  things, which sounds good. And it is a good idea, but now it's like, as illustrated by Nikki
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.680]  Tonski's thread, there are some sub views within views where like the there's like a done button
[53:53.680 --> 54:00.240]  at the bottom and it's half cut off. Yeah. And there's, so I guess you can click it. He doesn't
[54:00.240 --> 54:05.200]  actually say, can you click the top of the button? I would presume from my experience using gooeys
[54:05.200 --> 54:09.760]  that when you experience a bug like that, if a little bit of the buttons available and you click
[54:09.760 --> 54:15.760]  click the little bit of the button, it'll still work. But no, he doesn't, he doesn't one of them
[54:15.760 --> 54:20.800]  there. I think, I think, yeah, it looks like it, but it does not feel to me.
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.800]  And I know how long, you know, I know Apple has great and, you know, lots of engineers,
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.280]  although famously, I think we all know that having lots of engineers doesn't help you shift
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.960]  one project faster, right? There's the mythical man month, you know, which sort of proved that
[54:36.960 --> 54:42.720]  you can't just, you know, it really is in some regards, like trying to throw more women at the
[54:42.720 --> 54:49.920]  problem to, to have a baby born sooner. It's like, no, you know, you can't really speed that up.
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.000]  But they do have talented engineers. I know they care, but it's, it does not look to me
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.560]  at mid August that this looks like it's going to be tip top shape by let's say the end of October.
[55:06.560 --> 55:13.040]  Like, no, it really does. It really does not. And I'm really, why do you, I don't know. Why
[55:13.040 --> 55:19.040]  do you think that is? I mean, they just, they, they didn't have enough time or, but I don't,
[55:19.040 --> 55:26.560]  I don't understand exactly why this would be, I mean, and it happened before, right. But I mean,
[55:26.560 --> 55:34.000]  but it, you know, in a much less critical application because when they did news and
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.200]  some, what was the other thing? I can't remember. They did, they did a few things when they first
[55:37.200 --> 55:44.240]  demonstrated news and stocks are, are like, they're the same app. Really. There's if you
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.160]  there's like Steven trout and Smith has dug in, you know, like you can kind of see how they're
[55:48.160 --> 55:54.720]  the same app. It's just that news is general news and stocks is stock business, specific news and
[55:54.720 --> 56:01.600]  stock tickers, news and stocks. And I forget the other catalyst apps, a home home was one that was
[56:01.600 --> 56:07.120]  sort of a debacle still. It's not really, but home when those, when those first came over,
[56:07.120 --> 56:13.040]  they were, and then they're still not perfect, but they were much clunkier. They were surprisingly
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.080]  clunky. Let's put it that way. But even home, which I don't like, I really don't, I don't,
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.880]  I really don't feel like they've nailed the metaphor, the organizing metaphor for the app,
[56:22.880 --> 56:28.960]  which is better. It's better in the beta, but on, you know, the iOS beta anyway, but it's not,
[56:28.960 --> 56:31.840]  yeah, it's not like a, it's really not a favorite of mine.
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.280]  I don't mean to be dismissive or snarky about it. Cause I think it's very difficult, but you know,
[56:37.280 --> 56:43.360]  that it, and as the user interface designer in me, doesn't have an answer for it. An easy answer.
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.760]  I think it would be a mountain of work and a great achievement to, to do a new version
[56:47.760 --> 56:54.640]  of the home map that has an organizing principle that is visually cohesive and makes sense for all
[56:54.640 --> 57:00.000]  the various things that you, that, that the home app can do. But it's like the home app on Mac,
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.360]  I have problems with it, but it doesn't seem sloppy. It's not like things are only half
[57:05.360 --> 57:13.760]  visible or the controls pop off to the side, you know, or, or that the label for a control
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.560]  is separated by inches from the button that toggles it. Right. Cause that's one of the
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.880]  things that's so weird in settings. Cause the Mac screen is fundamentally wide.
[57:22.880 --> 57:29.360]  Not tall and skinny. And so a lot of these things that make sense, even on the biggest iPhone ever,
[57:29.360 --> 57:35.840]  Apple's ever made the 13 pro max plus, you know, whatever the current monster size iPhone is,
[57:36.640 --> 57:43.120]  when you're holding it vertically, it's not that wide, right? It is actually a very narrow screen
[57:43.120 --> 57:50.400]  from left to right. And so, you know, you can have a left justified label and a right justified
[57:50.400 --> 57:56.560]  switch that toggles that setting. And they're not that far apart. Whereas in Mac settings,
[57:56.560 --> 58:01.840]  in Ventura, a lot of the labels are so far apart that it's almost hard to visually
[58:02.960 --> 58:05.920]  tell they go, you know, which one goes with which. And that's,
[58:06.720 --> 58:10.480]  it's, my eyes have gotten so much better, but that's with my retinal detachments that,
[58:10.480 --> 58:16.800]  that sort of telling which lines go across is still a little, it's always, it's going to be
[58:16.800 --> 58:22.240]  tricky for me for the rest of my life. It just, I kind of need alignment help. If they were just
[58:22.240 --> 58:26.560]  right next to them, like they were check boxes, right. Wasn't an issue.
[58:26.560 --> 58:31.360]  I mean, I worry about, I also worry about like, there seems to be this sort of mishmash of, of
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.760]  control metaphors, right? I mean, there's, he posts a picture of,
[58:35.760 --> 58:39.520]  of what looks like two buttons and apparently one of them is a drop.
[58:39.520 --> 58:47.760]  Well, well, and I'm not sure there is a new control they invented this year,
[58:47.760 --> 58:52.960]  which is really fun because app in app kit for Mac, where there's a combination push button
[58:52.960 --> 58:57.760]  with a dropdown on the right so that you can have a push button with a menu on the side.
[58:57.760 --> 59:01.440]  But I don't think the one in system settings is using that because
[59:01.440 --> 59:05.760]  it's not, I don't think that any of that's written in app kit. I think it's all Swift UI,
[59:05.760 --> 59:10.080]  which is part of the, this is the way, this is the, this is the, you know, this is where
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.960]  the puck is going. I think again, he didn't say this. I don't think anybody, cause it was
[59:14.960 --> 59:20.320]  a Steve jobs quote would, would bring it up. But one way to encapsulate my take on Craig
[59:20.320 --> 59:25.440]  Federighi's defense of this is this is where the puck is going and we want to get ahead of it.
[59:25.440 --> 59:31.040]  And, you know, we know we have lots of work to do, but I just, why do it now? Right. Right. Like,
[59:31.040 --> 59:35.200]  I guess that's what you're asking is why, why isn't this still a secret, secret project in
[59:35.200 --> 59:41.680]  Apple for next year? Exactly. Exactly. Because I think this, this in between is just a mess. I
[59:41.680 --> 59:47.120]  mean, like if you're going to change, you know, simple thing, like check boxes, or now those toggle
[59:47.120 --> 59:53.840]  switches, just do it and do it across the board. They're all, they're all toggle switches. Now
[59:54.720 --> 59:59.200]  don't like have, well, we just changed the settings app and now they're toggle switches
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.680]  in the settings app and everywhere else, there's, they're going to be check boxes.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.360]  Right. So I, I color me skeptical about the whole idea, but I'm willing to admit that I'm,
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.440]  I'm a, I'm a bit of a curmudgeon and a traditionalist on UI design. And I have,
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:23.040]  you know, I'm more of a Mac by far a Mac person than an iOS person. So I'm biased a little against
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.120]  the general idea of, of doing this to system settings, but I try to always have an open mind
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.960]  about it. I really do. And so I'll go with it, but even going with it and accepting it, this isn't,
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.920]  this isn't, it should be the best possible implementation of this idea possible. It should be
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.440]  as. And again, we are complaining about a beta, but, but it's, it's extremely sloppy for where
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.160]  it should be at this point. Right. Presuming that it's going to ship it by the end of October,
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:57.200]  or, you know, even if it was even later, you know, they've said this year, they always seem to ship,
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.200]  you know, with the, the things they announced for the Mac at WWDC in June ship by November.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.920]  Right. It's, it's supposedly going to ship. I, it just feels to me like a project that
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.640]  whatever the point came in, I guess, like early May where they're like saying, what's in,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.600]  what's out this year. This one to me feels like, keep going team. We're behind you on this. This
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:31.440]  is the way, but we're going to punt this to macOS 14 next year, next year at this point, I expect
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.880]  this to be precise, have at it. And then they don't say anything at WWDC. And then next year
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.800]  here, here's the new system settings in macOS, whatever they call it, 14. It goes back to me.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.800]  This again, I don't have any inside information on this. I'm not getting this from any friends
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:56.240]  or little birdies, but just my spidey sense that it's relative. Things are relatively thin this
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.880]  year. And so they needed stuff. And maybe I mean this, I'm not trying to make crack wise,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.480]  but that maybe they've moved this up to have something to show and say is new. And again,
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:15.120]  I'm going to, this is going to irritate some people, but I, I think, and this is informed
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:24.240]  somewhat by friends who work at Apple, that I think two years of lockdown and work from home
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:33.200]  is, this is when it's caught up to them. And it, you know, like I, and I've commented about this
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.240]  in some ways and people have objected on the grounds of how can you, a person who's worked
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.080]  at home for 15 years, complain about people at Apple who want to work at home? And I get that.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.200]  And that's, but that's why I don't work at Apple, right? Like I never pursued a career
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.160]  like that. Cause I know I don't, I don't want to go into an office every day and I never enjoyed
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.760]  that. But I also fundamentally believe that it's true that for a collaborative project,
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.680]  collaborating in person is far more effective than collaborating remotely. I really, and I don't
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.040]  think, I don't know that that's ever going to change in my lifetime. And it's certainly.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.160]  I don't, well, I'm not convinced that, well, I don't, I've never worked in software development,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.680]  particularly. I mean, I've done some, some minor league coding, but I'm not sure that it's the
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.120]  kind of like, so, you know, my wife worked in a newsroom for years. I feel like a newsroom is
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:31.040]  a very good example of where, of where like two things that I don't like are actually beneficial.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.480]  One is an open floor plan, which I absolutely, I absolutely hate. And I think is really,
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.240]  really bad for most kinds of work. I think it's actually really good for, for news organization.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.240]  And then the other thing is working in the office and I would argue, well, I mean,
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.960]  maybe it's slightly different now, even beginning with Slack and stuff like that,
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.960]  but I still think it's slightly better to work in an office if you're working in a news organization,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.600]  but I'm not sure that software development is the same kind of thing when, I mean,
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.360]  do you really need to hear people having a conversation over the wall? Well, I hope.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.080]  All right. So the, and again, I've opened a can of worms and there's a lot to go through. So open
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.680]  floor plans. Definitely. I get it very bad for a lot of people, distraction wise. And for me
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.120]  in particular, it is, especially if you need to concentrate. And I realized that Apple park,
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.280]  you know, there were, you don't hear so much about it, but maybe that's also largely because of COVID
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.520]  but, and people haven't been there, but the fact that the old infinite loop campus was largely
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.640]  organized around everybody having their own office, or maybe in some cases sharing an office,
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.320]  you know, like me and you would share an office or something like that when it got crowded.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.720]  But then, you know, their, their head count has exploded where they've bought up almost everything
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.920]  in Cupertino, anything that looks like an office in Cupertino now is probably an Apple building.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.240]  And most of them are older buildings and, you know, I'm sure that they come in and make them
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.920]  as nice as they can. Apple has, you know, money to spend, but the open floor plan at Apple park,
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.920]  I know is controversial and, and people, you know, there were rules originally about,
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.280]  you have to use, this is the chair that Johnny Ive wants everybody to use. And again, you know,
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.920]  I get it aesthetically. That's great. But in terms of, you know, chairs are really personal,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.160]  you know, they really are. Oh yeah, completely. I mean, and you for, you know, not just you even
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.200]  like minor comfort level. There are very real reasons why, you know, people have different
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.480]  bodies. Yeah. Yeah, very much so. And so I don't belittle, I think people should spend,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.760]  you know, a lot, there's no sponsors this week from mattress companies, but I, you know,
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.240]  but if you sleep eight hours a day, you should get a really, you should get a mattress that really,
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.240]  that you both enjoy. And that makes you feel good. It makes your back feel good every morning.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.680]  You, and if you're going to sit in a chair all day, you really, or, or even half the day,
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.520]  if you'd like to stand half the day or whatever, you really should, you know, it's really important
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.760]  for your health to have a chair that's comfortable for you. I get it all with the open floor plan and
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.520]  that it's distracting. I think I, my, my take on this, and this is informed by talking to people
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.640]  at Apple. I think that, that where they're trying to move to where it's sort of a hybrid, Hey,
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.000]  everybody can work from home a couple of days a week, but you have to come in a couple of days
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.600]  a week is trying to acknowledge that for some things, especially for like engineers
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.280]  and programmers, being able to work from home and not have any distractions and just go heads down
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.000]  on a project with no distractions other than what your dog or whatever else is in your house. But
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.360]  if you can, you know, you know, you can probably be interrupted less at home than at the office.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.400]  And obviously, you know, your commute turns to zero, which is great.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.560]  And I think that's the big thing, honestly, because, and particularly when we've reached
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.880]  the state where, I mean, particularly in California, where you can't afford to live
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.800]  anywhere close to where you work. Because it is it, you know, working from home,
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.360]  it's very easy to get distracted. There's laundry, there's dishes, there's dogs, there's kids.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.000]  There's all kinds of different things. It's not a heck of a lot better than working in the office.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.280]  It's different kinds of distractions, obviously. If you have an office at home,
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.560]  it becomes a lot easier because you can just go in and close the door and lock yourself,
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.720]  lock yourself, which is sometimes what I actually have to do. But the commute is huge,
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.080]  and particularly for a lot of these people. I mean, you know, when I commuted up to Seattle,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:27.120]  it was an hour and a half both ways. So that's why I stopped. That's why I was like, well,
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.560]  I'm quitting. The other thing that's so true about human psychology is once you get used to a thing,
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.880]  it is so much harder to go back than just imagining it in the first place.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.600]  And you see this every year with new iPhones, right? If somebody upgrades from a two-year-old
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.520]  iPhone to a brand-new iPhone, and then they go back to their old iPhone because they haven't
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.680]  wiped it yet, it's like, ah, crap, some of this stuff feels slow, right? It's like, oh, man,
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.640]  I've really gotten used to how much, you know, or the ProMotion display, right? And it's like,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.240]  you use it like, oh, yeah, that does look smoother. But then you go back to the older phone,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:04.480]  and it's like, oh, man, now I'm ruined forever. Well, once you've worked from home for over a
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:11.920]  year in 2020 and 2021, all of a sudden, the exact same commute, or even if your commute is better
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.640]  than it was in 2019 because the roads still aren't anywhere near as full in California, in the Bay
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.240]  Area, it still feels, you feel it in a way that you didn't when it was like, well, this is the
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.600]  way it has to be. I get it. So I'm not trying to simplify this into any sort of argument that
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.560]  Apple should go back to the way things were in 2019, with everybody coming into the office
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.840]  exactly like that. What I'm trying to argue is a very subtle point, which is that I think that
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:47.600]  for 2020, and even 2021, we didn't see the effects of work from home on Apple's software,
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:56.640]  because there was all these ideas were already in place. And it might have even been more effective
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.760]  to just have everybody at home and just work on these things that are already in place.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:08.160]  I think most things that are worth mentioning in a keynote, almost, if not all of them,
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:16.960]  have been in the works for over a year. Any new feature on any of these platforms that's worthy
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.400]  of being mentioned in a WWDC keynote almost certainly has been in the works behind the
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:29.280]  scenes for over a year. And so these years-old ideas, having people at home and having more
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.760]  time to concentrate uninterrupted, maybe even made them more effective. And there was lots of,
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:42.720]  hey, Apple, you know, the consensus largely that I saw was work from home is great for Apple. Look,
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:50.480]  this last few years of iOS and macOS have been just fine. But I think that the part that's
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:58.000]  missing is where did the ideas for the next two, three years come from and not being together as a
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.960]  team and having teams together to spark ideas and do that sort of improv. Somebody comes up
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:11.840]  with an idea and it's not really right, but somebody else can say, oh, but and this,
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.080]  or what if we did, you know, okay, just like that, but what if we did this and those sort of
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.680]  collaborative, oh yeah, we should go with it. Let's propose this, you know, sort of things.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.440]  It's not that they didn't happen at all over WebEx, but I just don't think they happen the
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.800]  same way. And I kind of feel like this is the year it kind of caught up to us. And I'll even
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.520]  draw the analogy to inflation globally in the world that in the early days of the pandemic,
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.800]  when governments in the US, around the world, you know, pumped money into the economy and sent
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:55.680]  people checks, just mailed people money. In Econ 101, you learn that if, you know, the government
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.320]  just sends money out, that would lead to inflation, but it doesn't lead to inflation right away when
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:10.080]  the economy is so massive, right? It comes due, you know, 18 months, two years later,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:17.760]  right? I just feel that this sort of, you know, and again, it's not like they're totally dry
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:25.200]  of ideas, but just And I think it's possible to put too much, you know, it's possible to be
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.480]  tying to, there might not be, this might be correlation, not causation. It could be just
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:37.840]  an age of the operating systems as they exist rather than something due to work from home.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.920]  Yeah. And because there are lots of different, I mean, there are lots of different studies that
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.960]  seem to indicate that working from home is, well, psychologically better for people and also does
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.320]  not seem to damage productivity at all. And there are plenty of organizations, obviously you can't
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:12:02.640]  say the culture of Apple can easily be transferred to work from home model, but there are plenty of
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.200]  companies that are distributed where people are working from different locations and working and
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.480]  collaborating on software projects and creating great stuff. So it's possible to do it.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.720]  Right. And, you know, again, I'm not trying to make a simplistic argument against work from home
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.720]  and companies like WordPress, famously, Matt Mullenweg, you know, it used to just be him,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:31.120]  you know, he like, you know, took on some other project, changed it, named his version
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:37.120]  WordPress. And now it's, you know, this, you know, here we are close to 20 years later and it's a
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.240]  huge, successful company that's, you know, bought all these other previously big companies like
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.480]  Tumblr and I forget what else WordPress owns, successful, thriving, huge chunk of the internet.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:55.280]  I mean, like by some arguments, a majority share of the internet in terms of like what sites people
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.320]  actually use runs on WordPress. And they have been completely distributed without a central
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:07.680]  office from day one. And so I totally acknowledge that. But Apple's culture, I think, involves the
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:13.680]  sort of collaborative, some collaboration. And I think there are, I will also say there are
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:22.240]  probably a lot of talented, talented engineers and other people at Apple who could work remotely full
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.880]  time because maybe where their skill set is and their personality is and what they're best at
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.480]  doesn't contribute to the benefits of in-person collaboration at all. You know, that they could
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.560]  just fully be a full member of the team and be more productive, right? You mentioned productivity,
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:48.160]  measurable productivity, getting more done every week, week in, week out for their career.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.760]  And they live in Iowa because that's where they're, that's just where they grew up and they,
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:14:00.640]  and, you know, bought a massive, beautiful house for the cost of, you know, yeah, for the cost of
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.240]  a parking spot in the Bay Area. Totally get that. I just think, though, that there's some people at
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:13.920]  Apple who thrive on the in-person collaborative nature creatively as a spark. And that, you know,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.840]  you mentioned newsrooms. You go back, you know, look at like, I think they actually shot all the
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.680]  president's men in the Washington Post newsroom somehow. I don't know how they, while the media,
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:32.000]  I don't, I don't either that, or it is famously a precise replication, you know, that it is.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.480]  Yeah. For as someone who has been in, I mean, you know, I spent, I'd been to the local paper
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.400]  right number of times and, and it's, it's almost all that it was, well, you know, now it's a,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.240]  I think they moved since because they had, you know, like, and when she first started
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:54.560]  there in the mid nineties, they had just built this big, beautiful facility, you know, akin to,
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.480]  akin to the, you know, sort of like Apple building, Apple built Apple park, and then
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.960]  everyone decided to go back to analog stuff or, or that metaver, you know, like the metaverse
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.280]  took over or something, you know, like they were immediately obviated. They had a, you know,
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.320]  they had a big Chihuly hanging in the, in the lobby and, you know, a cafeteria and everything.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.800]  And it was just, it was super depressing over the years just to see it shrink like crazy. And then
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.960]  they finally, they finally moved out. But, you know, when they first started there for the number
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.800]  of years, for the first few years, it was crowded. Everybody's desks were a mess. There was, you
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.640]  know, particularly hers, there were stacks of paper everywhere. People were yelling at each
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.720]  other over, over the, you know, the, the walls were really low. You know, it wasn't like they
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.240]  were raised cubicle walls or anything, but, but these are, these were reporters too. And so they
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:51.120]  are by and large, a group of fairly gregarious talkative in your face people. And programmers
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:16:00.160]  are probably not in general. No, I don't want to completely cast everybody in the same light,
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.040]  but still. Right. And so like, if, if your job is being a reporter, who's more or less on breaking
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:09.520]  news, whether it's like the entertainment beat or local politics or national politics and, and
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.480]  breaking news is happening and then being able to shout at your colleagues and somebody says,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:21.520]  you know, Oh my God, they had torn up pictures in the toilet. Yeah. Oh, wait, stop. I gotta stop.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.480]  You know, and then you can, you know, don't even, don't, don't, don't push the story yet.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.120]  Well, yeah. I mean, you're, you're, you're working on it, you're working on a schedule
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.600]  where everything is published daily or, you know, now with internet be published immediately. And
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.080]  if something changes, you want to know right away. Yeah. And then somebody says, I've got a
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.720]  source in the mayor's office. Let me call them. I will get back to you. You keep working on this,
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.960]  but I'll see if I can get somebody on the mayor's office to confirm or deny blah, blah, blah. And,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.520]  you know, and then there's other people like deep investigative reporters who write like,
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:57.600]  sort of, you know, these investigative reports about longstanding problems with the lead pipes
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.120]  in the schools or something like that, who would not benefit from working in that open floor plan
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.480]  and get an office somewhere else and just, you know, go off for six months and do this deep
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.960]  research. I get it. You know, I don't know. I just, it's just a spitball theory. And it just
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.520]  sort of matches of why, why sort of seemingly push system settings this year when it seems like,
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.160]  well, it's going to be rough. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that at least on that, we agree.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.920]  Yeah. And I could be, I could be all wet and seem like it's, but, but I will say too,
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.680]  somebody that they should foist on us. I know this firsthand from people I know at Apple,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:45.680]  and I've read this is a general thing nationwide, even worldwide as, as, as we try to, you know,
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:53.040]  everybody collectively is figuring out where do we find the new normal of work from home versus
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:18:01.120]  work together in the, in an office that managers tend to be way more decisively more. I would like
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.960]  to have more people back in the office and people who aren't managers are more, I would prefer to
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.480]  keep working more at home. And it makes intuitive sense because let's say, it's just assumed it's
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.360]  not bad managers. It's good managers, but how do you become a manager? Who's a good manager and
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.960]  who enjoys being a manager? You, I think by definition, you're a people person. You, you,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:30.480]  you thrive on face-to-face interactions. You feel energized by it. Whereas lots of other people,
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.480]  you know, are somewhere on the introvert scale. And even if they're, they are personable and
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.800]  people say, yeah, I love working with her and I love working with so-and-so, but those people
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.120]  find it exhausting to, to interact face-to-face or tiresome. They don't, you know, they're spending
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:54.080]  energy on face-to-face interaction, not drawing energy from it, which is what I think good
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.200]  managers do. So of course there's a split on that, but the other perspective that managers have
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:10.000]  good managers is, is the team working as on all cylinders, as opposed to the individual,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  I personally, me feel productive working from home. And I can see that I'm producing lots of
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.440]  stuff, but is the team firing on all cylinders, you know, and, and collaborative stuff is all
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.040]  traditionally done in person. I guess everything's traditionally done in person, but, you know,
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:33.680]  there's a reason movies are done in person, you know, I don't know. It's, I could, I could be all
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.240]  wet on this and it could have nothing to do with system settings. It could be that this was going
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.320]  to say, I, the other thing is I feel like we've spent all the, all these years coming up with
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:49.040]  these remote communication tools and we still are facing this, you know, no, you got to come
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:55.600]  to the office thing because, because it is a traditional work mode. And because it also,
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.640]  I mean, well, you know, you talk about managers who are good. There are also lots of managers who
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:07.120]  are not good and insist on having people there so they can, you know, stand over their shoulder and
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.280]  breathe down their neck all the time. And we just, you know, it's like the productivity thing,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.280]  where if you look at those productivity charts and you look at like how computers have improved
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:20.960]  productivity, and yet none of that has transferred into improved wages for the people who are
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:26.720]  actually doing the work. Or, or, or more recreational time, or more recreational time.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.760]  Yeah. And, and so from that perspective, I find it extremely frustrating because it just seems
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.360]  like we've made all this progress and yet things don't, you know, we still have these people who
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.760]  are insisting that they have to be done the same way. And then the other thing I think is,
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.120]  is similarly the commute, I think is completely just destructive to people.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:49.200]  Yeah. And, and yeah, and in the Bay Area, particularly, and the real estate situation
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:55.120]  in the whole area too. I, again, I don't mean to simplify a truly complex thing that, you know,
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.320]  and I also think though, to tie it off, I do think it'll work itself out because fundamentally,
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.240]  and I know it, it, it's dissatisfying in the moment. If somebody out there is listening
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.320]  and works at Apple and is now having to go in three days a week and only, you know, and
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.480]  they're like, maybe you're getting mad at me. Cause you're like even doing two days a week or
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.360]  whatever it is, the office is still annoying to me. And those are my least productive two days
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:27.680]  of the week. I get it. If that's your situation right now in August of 2022, but it will work
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:32.400]  itself out in the long run. I still believe this. Our mutual friend Guy English said this, I think,
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:37.280]  I think it was 2013 on his blog, but that the single biggest problem Apple faces is talent
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:44.400]  retention. And that was true then. And that was sort of in the, in the wake of Steve Jobs dying
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.280]  and sort of, you know, for lots of reasons, everything seemed to be in flux. The iPhone
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.440]  was still explosively growing. What's the future of the company. The biggest problem they face is
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:59.120]  talent, talent retention, because the fundamental premise of Apple as a company is that they make
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:06.800]  the best computing devices and, and anything, anywhere where they fall short of that is a
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.480]  problem for them. Cause it's, it's, that's where the whole brand comes from. That's where the
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:16.080]  customer loyalty comes from. And how do you keep making the best products and devices, software
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.840]  and hardware going forward? It's obvious, but you have to have the best people working well together.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:30.080]  I mean, it's, it's not complicated, but if the best people really want to insist that they don't
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.520]  want to work in the office, they're going to go elsewhere. You know, competition, the market will
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.600]  sort that out because the talented people are the ones most likely to be able to find gainful,
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.600]  enjoyable employment elsewhere. Well, as long as, as long as Apple sticks to that
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.840]  credo, right? I mean, you know, organizations don't necessarily listen to the market. They like to
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.160]  pretend that they do, but I mean, Apple could just say, well, we're still not going to, you know,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.320]  we're still not going to change and we're just going to let the quality of the software decline.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.600]  Right. And you know, and that's sort of what happens to companies eventually. I mean,
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.160]  I don't mean to laugh because I hope it doesn't happen to Apple, but yeah. Well,
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.240]  that's just the way it is. Right. I mean, the band kept playing on the deck of the Titanic.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:24.080]  I don't know. They told us to play till nine. We can't go off. Glub, glub.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.440]  Let me tell you about our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Ship Station. I got to be careful
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.280]  pronouncing their word, their name. Sometimes you can get by doing the hard things without
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.960]  doing things the hard way. And you don't even realize it. They ever get a package and you don't
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.280]  have like a box cutter nearby and you just start digging in with your fingers. And it's like,
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.320]  why did I do this? This would have been so much easier to just go to another room and find a box
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:52.800]  cutter. Ship Station is like that for shipping products. It gives e-commerce sellers an easier
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:59.360]  way to manage shipping and doing it, doing your shipping through Ship Station is like opening a
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:05.600]  package with a box cutter as opposed to just using your knuckles. They integrate with all of your
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.520]  storefronts, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and more. And they let you automate processes like fulfillment
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:17.120]  and tracking so you can save time managing orders while keeping customers happy. Because you know
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.200]  what? Customers buy stuff from you. If you're in a business where you ship stuff to people,
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.840]  as soon as you buy something, you know what they want to do? They want to track it. They
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.200]  want to know where it is. Ship Station automates all this stuff. And here's the thing. You get
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.560]  deeply discounted shipping rates that are normally reserved for Fortune 500 companies
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:41.360]  because Ship Station aggregates all of this shipping from so many small, independent,
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:50.240]  even individual people selling stuff and collectively gets the group rate. So you get
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.040]  discounted shipping rates that you would not get doing it on your own. So in addition to being
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:01.040]  easier and having great features and integration, you save a lot of money. You can easily compare
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:07.280]  carriers, rates, and delivery times. So it's easy to choose the best option for every shipping
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:15.200]  scenario. Here's the stat. This is it. Ninety-eight percent of companies that use Ship Station for a
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.360]  year keep using it for as long as they're in business. Ninety-eight percent. That's what I
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.560]  call customer satisfaction. That's great. So what do you do to find out more? It isn't magic,

[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:07.520]  slogan, make ship happen. I didn't make that up. Oh, they leaned into it. Oh, they leaned into it.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.240]  Nice. I heard a Vince Scully story. I forget what he told it, but it more or less something,
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.640]  something he was talking about early in his career. What was the most embarrassing thing
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.760]  he ever did? And something like ship, I forget what he said, like a law, some kind of thing.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.280]  I don't know exact words, but it was clear that he still wouldn't say it while relaying the story,
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.320]  but he accidentally said shit instead of something while somebody hit like a screaming line drive
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.640]  over the third base. Thought he was going to get fired. You know, he's like, you know, it was like
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.280]  one of his first years announcing the Dodgers. Nobody said anything. And he was like, maybe
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.680]  nobody heard it. And then he went out to eat a week later and a guy at the restaurant was like,
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.760]  I don't know if we should serve you. And he's like, why? And he said, because you put profanity
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.280]  on the airways and then they slapped him on the back and everybody laughed, you know, but he was
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.280]  like, Oh, everybody did here. So what else do we got? So we did the, the Ventura system settings
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:05.600]  stage manager is the other thing. Now you say you haven't used the Mac or iPad or the iPad one. Yeah.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.160]  Cause I heard the iPad was still rough. So I, I wasn't ready for, it's definitely wasn't ready
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.480]  for Ventura. I haven't installed on spare machines, but I haven't spent a lot of time with it, but
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:21.840]  it's clearly. Rough and again, rough enough that I really wonder how, how good a shape it'll be in
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.120]  by October, like some really weird bugs. And I I've recognized that these, these, you know,
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.200]  have to be fixed, but you know how like you can hit again, if anybody doesn't know this, my God,
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.720]  what a great tip, but you hit the command back tick on the Mac and it cycles through the windows
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.480]  in the current application. Yeah. So if you've got three windows open and text at it and you
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.240]  hit command back back tick or the Tilda key, it'll cycle through those three windows. Well,
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.080]  on my Ventura installation, the command back tick doesn't do anything. It just doesn't even
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.920]  whether I have. I, that, that's a recently, and I think that's in the most recent release,
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.240]  but wasn't in there earlier. Is that right? I believe so. Right. Yeah. And I got to assume
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:12.160]  that's just a, that's a bug. They're not getting rid of command. You don't get to switch windows
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.520]  anymore. You're going to, yeah. Right. Sorry. I do think though, the thing that I forget who
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.280]  popped this idea into my head, but it is when you step back and think about it, the fundamentally
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.000]  thing that's most interesting about stage manager, I almost called it center stage again.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.280]  Center stage seems more right. I don't know, but it's really interesting that it is I've
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.320]  poked around with it enough. And if you watch the keynote, you know, it was clear enough that
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.600]  it really kind of is the same idea on Mac and iPad, right? For all the various ways that the
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:53.040]  Mac OS interface is different than iPad OS. When you're using center stage, it's pretty similar.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:58.720]  It is, you know, as, as much as it can be between the two platforms with different concepts of what
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.200]  a quote unquote window is. But I think it's fundamentally interesting that on iPad,
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.880]  it's sort of a power user mode, right? Like, okay, you're a more advanced iPad user. You'd
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.280]  like to sort of have multiple apps on screen at once. And you've got a lot, you know,
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.280]  a couple of windows or apps worth of stuff going on at a time. Here's an interface to manage this
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:26.480]  visually that you, you know, it's not on by default and it it's more complex, significantly
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:34.320]  more complex than the basic iPad idea of one thing on screen at a time. On the Mac, it's sort of like
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.440]  a simplified mode, right? Like, okay, you've got a jumble of windows open on your desktop and you
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:47.360]  feel it's cluttered and it's distracting. Here's a way to sort of reduce the clutter and the
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:53.840]  advantage of it versus spaces for like having multiple desktops is that you can make a new
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.720]  space and then the new space is obviously it's fresh. There's nothing in it, but you can quickly
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.560]  clutter that space up too. Stage manager is a way that it sort of enforces a lack of clutter
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.480]  because there's only so many things that you can take out of the strip on the side. I think that's
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.560]  what they're calling it, the strip. You can only take so many windows out of the strip at a time
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.080]  and otherwise things go back into the strip to keep it organized. That's kind of interesting to
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.280]  me that it's, you know, that Apple sees this as the same interface works on both platforms,
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:31.760]  but on one it's the simplified decluttering mode and on the other one it's the power user do more
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:40.560]  things at once mode. Yeah. It's also interesting to me that, you know, it might be, it feels like
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:48.240]  the sort of shift that might be permanent, you know, that iPadOS on an annual basis might be
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:57.760]  more on the macOS October schedule than the iOS September schedule as iPad sort of does grow more
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:05.040]  Mac-like than being a big iPhone-like. Yeah. It'll be interesting to see, like, I mean,
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:12.160]  they've struggled with how to define multitasking on the iPad for a long time and I feel like they
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:19.760]  keep trying stuff that doesn't always work perfectly. It doesn't make it as seamless as it,
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:26.320]  well, seamless, as easy to understand, I guess, as it is on the Mac. And I feel like it's getting
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:34.800]  better slowly though. But it is the one platform where they still don't seem to have had their
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:42.480]  that's it moment. Right. What was the slide over still a thing? Cause I don't see slide over anymore
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.960]  and every time I've ever seen slide over, it's always by accident. That's when, when the thing.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.320]  Well, right. That's always been my problem is like, for years I was just like, I'm not
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:57.520]  going to use multitasking on the iPad. I don't care about it. Like I, you know, even when I'm
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:03.280]  writing, I'm fine command tabbing back and forth between, you know, whatever text editor I'm using
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:10.880]  and Safari or whatever I'm, you know, using to, to reference. And every time I implemented it,
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.320]  it was always by mistake. Well, I've told this story before, but it's worth retelling,
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.000]  but my, my dear mother loves her iPad and I'm not throwing my mom under the bus as opposed to my dad,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.200]  you know, under the trope that it's the grandmother who's, who's always got a
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.360]  trouble. So my mom is far more of an advanced computer user than my dad, which is why she's
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.560]  the one who ran into it. My dad is super simplistic in his, his computing. Whereas my mom
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.120]  is more immersed in it and does more, but the, the problem she ran into multiple times would be
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:49.040]  somehow Safari got into slide over mode and then she'd be in an email and the email, you know,
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.680]  like she, she likes subscribing to things like CNN emails and they tell her what's news. And then
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.040]  there's a URL. And then instead of what she expected to happen is she taps on the URL and
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:05.040]  then she switches to Safari in full screen. And that webpage opens instead, it would pop up in
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.400]  this slide over that comes over her email. And she couldn't even cheat. Not only did she not
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.320]  want it there, she didn't know how to make it go away because it didn't have a close button,
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:19.120]  right? It was like, you had to kind of like flick it away. But if you didn't flick quite the right
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.720]  way, it would just jump over to the other side of the screen. And I remember a couple of years ago,
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.040]  there was actually an option somewhere in settings. Again, I'll never remember where it's
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.680]  just to go back to the idea that you kind of just have to search in settings to find something. But
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:40.480]  there used to be an option to just say, don't ever use multitasking. And then, which was, I think,
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:46.720]  at least again, it was a sign that the interface wasn't good, that there was an option to turn it
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.000]  off, but at least they acknowledged it and put the option in. But then they got rid of that option,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.480]  I guess, a couple of versions ago where they thought, okay, I don't think this is a problem
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.400]  anymore. We don't have to give people an option to turn it off. But still, sometimes something
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.160]  happens. You know, I don't get as many calls from my mom about getting into split screen.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:11.840]  JS I think it's easier to dismiss now somehow. I think maybe the flicking got a little bit more,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.520]  let's take a flick that's more generally, that's just sort of in the right direction as opposed to
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.560]  has to be this particular kind of flick. JS Well, and I guess the other thing is in real, not slide
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:28.320]  over, but split screen, you can just drag the divider between the two halves. And if you just
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:33.760]  drag it all the way over to the side, it, you just end up with an app in full screen. And that's,
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.360]  that's so obvious that even if like, I think I had to tell my mom to do it the first time,
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:46.400]  but it's so obvious that she never, she couldn't forget it because it's, here's the thing. I just
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.680]  touch it and move it over to the side. And now Safari is full screen. Yeah, yeah. You know,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:57.280]  but that's the thing is that how does split screen fit in the center stage world? Like why,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.320]  you know, if they had come up with the center stage, center stage, stage manager, God damn it.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:10.000]  This is why I'm a writer. And I didn't even notice stage manager. Damn it. Stage manager. If they'd
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.720]  come up with it years ago, would they have ever done split screen? It's just weird because in
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.640]  centers, stage manager, I'm not doing it on purpose. They do look like windows, right?
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.520]  They're these things you can resize them. They're stacked. Whereas split screen,
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.240]  they don't look like windows. It's still like one full screen panel with two halves.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.760]  Yeah. I know. I'm not sure they would have done it originally because of just because of the
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.760]  green real estate, because you know, the screens have gotten a lot larger since we got certainly,
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.080]  since we got the iPad pro, but also now that you can plug in an external monitor and run it and it
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.760]  seems like it's particularly designed for that. Right. Yeah. And there's some, am I right? There's
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.400]  some, I can't remember now which way it goes. There are some devices where it might only work
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:04.640]  on that or did, was that just like, because it, because, you know, I think that's, we were,
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:10.720]  that was the, did you suggest that at some point? Because they, they cut off a number of,
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.680]  yeah, a number of devices that wouldn't be able to use it. And people were kind of upset that they
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.960]  just, you know, that they didn't buy their iPad pro that long ago, but it wouldn't run well. They,
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:27.280]  they still have an adjusted manager. Right. So you have to have the M one and presumably the M
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.840]  two iPads are coming later this year, probably in October when they might finish the iPad OS.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:42.320]  Right. And yeah, people sort of, you know, my idea to maybe make people happy who really want
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.640]  stage manager elsewhere would be to just say, don't support external displays and just have
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.640]  it on screen. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the other way, but it doesn't seem like they're going that way.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.880]  It seems like Apple is sticking to no M one or later. And it also seems like the displeasure
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:02.480]  over that has died down, but maybe it'll come back up when iPad OS actually ships. Right. Because
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:08.240]  right now we're, we're only hearing from the, you know, self-defined enthusiast crowd who's
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.720]  installing either developer betas or even public betas. But when I don't think, well,
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.240]  I think maybe we talked about this last time I was on the show, but I feel like it's fine for them to
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.760]  make these decisions. Honestly, I don't think, you know, they, they make, they largely make these
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.960]  decisions based on what they think works well. And I just, because you want to run something
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.360]  crappily on your place, does that mean that you should necessarily be able to do that?
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.160]  I know that's sort of what I wrote and it's people pointed. I can't remember the examples
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:44.320]  I pointed to, but basically if they don't do Apple, doesn't do many spite features,
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:54.640]  you know, and they do do some marketing spite things that are cosmetic. So like the one that
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:01.200]  it doesn't seem like a lots of people comment on it. And I think because so many people use one of
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:09.440]  their personal photos as their iPhone wallpaper, lock screen pictures, you know, that they don't
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:16.880]  use the default wallpapers, but whenever you buy a new iPhone, the new, the iPhone comes with
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:27.920]  a device specific wallpapers and it like, if you buy the iPhone 13 pro, you don't get the iPhone 13
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.240]  non-pro wallpapers, right? That there's like these custom wallpapers just for the device that I guess
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:42.320]  Apple thinks are keyed to the actual physical nature, you know, like gold, shiny gold steel
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:48.560]  on the iPhone pro. Well, there's like a gold colored laser looking wallpaper that's supposed
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:55.120]  to match. But in terms of actual features, not just cosmetic things, they don't tend to do that.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.320]  Like, Oh, we're going to hold that cool thing just to get you to buy a new device. No, because
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.840]  their overall mindset is they just, they really don't just want you to buy one more Apple device,
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.040]  get your money and never come back. They want loyal customers, right? It's the same thing.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:19.520]  I go back to with like the seemingly faded conspiracy theory that new versions of iOS
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:27.920]  deliberately tank your battery life, right? And there were some versions of iOS over the years
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.360]  that didn't run great on older iPhones, but I don't think deliberately, I think it was just
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:38.800]  engineering and just shortcomings just didn't quite do it, but they, the last thing they want
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:46.640]  is for somebody with an iPhone to think is Apple really screwed up the OS and tank my scrolling
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.920]  performance and battery life. I'm going to go buy a new product from them, right? That doesn't work
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.440]  that way. Like the last thing they want you to think is maybe I should look at a Samsung phone,
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.640]  right? And what would be the best way to get an iPhone user to at least look at a Samsung phone
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.360]  is ship a software update that ruins their phone.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.920]  This does something and seems deliberate, right? Yeah. Right. Yeah.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:17.200]  I think they purposefully tanked my iPhone is not a way to get someone to buy another iPhone. It
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:22.000]  really isn't it. If the idea that it, that it was, I don't think it comes true. And I really
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.520]  don't think that they're withholding centered or stage. I'm going to stop talking about this
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:33.200]  feature. I am I'd screw it. This is the last time the new feature, the new windowing feature
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:39.280]  is definitely not trying to get you to buy a new thousand dollar iPad pro. I really think that it
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.640]  just doesn't run well on the older hardware. Yeah, I think, I think so too. I mean, I think
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:53.920]  of like the fact that when you tilt larger phones, you can get different UI effects. You know, you
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:41:01.360]  get, you get more of an iPad type of layout, so that the icons go in the bottom type of thing.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.320]  Whereas, you know, with my mini, if I tilt it, nothing happens.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.000]  So that, that does bring us to iOS 16. So you're, that's when you're running. Now,
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.400]  are you running it on your main phone or on an old phone?
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.640]  I am. Yeah. And that is your iPhone 13 mini or 12 mini?
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.400]  It's a 12 mini. So my upgrade this year will be to a 13 mini. That's the machine,
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.720]  then that's the device that I'm buying. So here's, here's, and this is why I put this
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:31.120]  in the notes. I think you probably saw it, but I've installed it on a spare machine and,
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.880]  and I should have probably sent it back by now, but sometimes I, I've still got my iPhone 13
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:43.600]  mini review unit from last year. So I, it's like part of my August to-dos is to ship those phones
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:49.520]  back to Apple before I get new ones. But that's where I've got the beta running. And son of a
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.480]  bitch, I fell in love with the mini again. It's because it's the best phone.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.920]  It's two, a couple of things. Number one, I found, I have found iOS 16 to be extremely
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.040]  stable for a developer beta all summer long. I have not had a problem with it, honestly.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:11.680]  And I installed the first public release. It has been in very good shape. And I actually
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.720]  like some of the new features. I mentioned MG Siegler opened my eyes to it. I had no idea,
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.920]  but they've added this feature for haptic feedback on the keyboard.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:28.960]  I turned that on immediately. I can't go back. It is like, and on the mini,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.240]  like to me, the very worst thing about the iPhone mini is that my fingers got used to the more
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.640]  generous, larger keyboards and having the little bit of haptic feedback. It makes me feel like
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:47.840]  I'm typing more accurately on the mini. And it just, I love the size. I love, I've, I've,
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.200]  I've said this many times. I, I really hope one of the, my big hopes for this year's iPhones,
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.200]  which is the sort of thing that for all the things that leak, some things don't like, you know,
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:05.840]  we know so much about the sizes and stuff like that, but like, will the pros still use stainless
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:12.240]  steel instead of aluminum or switching to titanium or something else? I find the steel to be so
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.200]  heavy. I don't, why would I want my phone to be heavier? And I know it's shiny and I guess people
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.760]  like that it's shiny and that it looks, you know, yeah. But the fact that the mini is aluminum,
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:32.080]  cause I bought the iPhone 12 non-mini two years ago and I just love the weight and I was so close
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.280]  to, I should have bought the mini. I really should have. I don't, and I was right that it's like,
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.480]  I'm locked in, I'm going to be locked in all year. I don't need the extra camera anyway.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.880]  I didn't need the battery life either. I never left the house. But the weight didn't
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:51.680]  difference. Even not the size, just the weight difference between aluminum and stainless steel
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.160]  is so nice. The mini it's both smaller and it's aluminum. And, and, and of course I'm falling in
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.680]  love with it. The year that it's been widely reported for over a year that they're not going
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.680]  to have a new mini. Right. And I know that you're a mini. I have long been a mini fanatic. I mean,
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.560]  I had the, so I got the original iPhone SE. I guess I had gone as far, I kind of forgot this,
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.520]  but I had gone as far as the seven. And then when the SE, the original SE came out, I ditched the
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.880]  seven for the SE and have not looked back particularly. I kept that phone for, I had
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:31.840]  that phone for four years until, until the, like the next, the second SE came out. And then I got
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.200]  that for six months and then the 12 mini came out. Right. And then it's like the longer you go,
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.920]  the more of a brick it feels like in your pocket because they keep getting bigger and they're using
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:50.880]  materials like steel and yeah, it, it really is. Oh, I, I guess people are, I don't, it doesn't
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.560]  seem like I see a lot of people using an iPhone mini out in the world. I still see, I still run
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:02.960]  into a few. And then every time I, I, I pull it out, people, I get a lot of comments. People are
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:10.480]  like, oh, I should have gotten that one. I wish you had, because then it might have made another
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:17.520]  one. I had the spitball theory back in when these rumors first started that, hey, maybe they're only
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.320]  going to do the mini for one more year. And then the next year they're not because it's not selling
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.360]  well. And you know, some of those supply chain things that they're like, oh, Apple cut orders
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:34.000]  for the mini 12 and, and, but up, up to their orders for the max pro or something like that. And
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  people who liked the idea that Apple has a mini size option were like, like me, even, and especially
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.800]  like you. And I know Marco Arment, you know, is, is always on the fence. Oh man, the mini,
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:54.400]  I had the spitball hopeful idea that maybe like coinciding with COVID when stores were closed.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.240]  And even when they opened a lot of people reasonably just were like, I'm not going to go
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.600]  to the store, you know, I'll just order online. And you really kind of had to see it and find
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:11.440]  it and feel it to get, Oh, this is so much nicer and cuter and adorable. You know, but I also think
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:18.560]  that one of the things I, I know Apple's timeline on these, especially iPhones is so much longer
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.600]  than people think the lead time. These, the decision not to make, assuming it's true that
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:29.520]  all the rumors are true and there will not be a new iPhone 14 mini this year. That decision was
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.360]  made like two years ago. And I don't know that they had sales data from the 12 mini and yes,
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:42.240]  it's by all accounts, it has sold disappointingly even by Apple's estimates. Apparently we don't
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.040]  know. Apple doesn't never, of course, officially says anything like that, but it seems like that's
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.680]  probably true that maybe it's not, it didn't sell as well. But even if it had sold better,
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:58.400]  I don't know that I think this decision was made two years ago for some reason. I don't know.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:03.120]  I'm still, I'm still hopeful that they'll, you know, that this is just a device that they're
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.760]  planning on doing occasionally. Well, I, this is my hopeful idea. And again, my hopeful idea that
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:16.240]  maybe once stores got reopened, there'd be, there'd be like this shocking wave of people
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.840]  buying the mini size phones apparently didn't happen. So maybe this one's wishful thinking too,
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:29.360]  but my wishful thought is that maybe the current SE is the last, okay, we're going to give you
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:35.680]  the home button interface, the touch ID button that you, that you familiar with and love,
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.120]  but eventually we're going to move everybody to the iPhone 10 style. There is no more touch ID
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.320]  home button. Everything is a, is a modern round cornered full screen. So the next SE will be in
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:53.360]  the same form factor as this current mini. I that's my hope. Yeah. That's my,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.400]  that's my hope as well. First of all, I mean, I would love to pay less for it.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.760]  Right. That was one of the, that was the great thing that I loved about the SE really is that,
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.080]  you know, that was the, one of the phones that I would just buy outright and pay,
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.480]  pay for it all upfront and never have to worry about it again. Whereas everything else I'm like,
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.880]  you know, 700 bucks, that's kind of a lot. I think, I think I'll just, I think it's that
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.560]  much. Right. Yeah. I mean, which is another interesting thing, because since they are
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.160]  discontinuing the mini and they are rumored to be increasing the price, I think it was another
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:29.760]  German thing, increasing the prices on the, the max and the pro. Yeah. By like 50 bucks.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:36.160]  Right. That their ASP is going to go up dramatically. Right. Yeah. That the, that
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:42.000]  supposedly if it's true, the, the non-pro models and that the big, the other, you know, for
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.600]  anybody who's not staying up on the rumors, the idea is that there will still be four models,
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:53.520]  but instead of the non-pro having mini and regular size and the pro having regular and max size,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:03.280]  they'll just all have regular and max and pro and not pro. So four phones, two regular size,
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:09.680]  two max size, and no mini, but that the pros are going to go up 50 bucks and then
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.240]  non-pros will stay the same price, but that they're already sort of have that $30
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.880]  carrier fee weird charge that I still don't. I still don't know what to tell people that
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.280]  the prices of those funds, like which one is the real price. The one that Apple is saying,
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:32.160]  that's like 800 bucks or the 831 that you get if you don't buy it through a carrier,
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:38.880]  it's weird, but well, we'll see. Anyway, my, my fear about my spitball idea that maybe the next
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:46.000]  SE will move past the home button. I have two fears on that. One is that because the mini is
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:53.600]  unpopular or not as popular as Apple had hoped that they still want the SE to sell in big numbers
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.720]  and that they fear that if the new SE is only the mini, then people won't want it because they'll
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:06.000]  think it's too small. And the other thing is that maybe I'm underestimating. Well, I mean,
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.480]  the screen size is larger though. Right. It is, but I don't know what people, I don't know what
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:14.800]  it is that, I don't know why more people aren't buying the mini. So they, I, you know. Well,
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:19.520]  I think it, I think it's, I mean, I think the SE is popular because of price for the most part.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.200]  So it's the cheapest one that they make and it's still a good value. And I think the other thing
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:31.920]  that might be a factor is you get with some older customers, they still want the touch ID.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:39.040]  Well, but Chris Evans wants touch ID. He's not older. Did you see that story?
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.360]  So did you see him at the end of Endgame? He looked pretty old.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.120]  Chris Evans apparently was using an iPhone 6 or a 6s and it finally bit the bullet.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.160]  He went with like the 12 pro or something like that, or 13. I can't remember which one he went
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:00.000]  with. Everybody was like, why did you get the SE? It's the same phone.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.120]  I think he, I think he got bad advice. I think so too. I think somebody led him astray.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.080]  But I truly wonder, cause I, you know, clearly even like, I don't know who the least technical
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.840]  listener of this podcast is, but God bless you. And I'm glad you enjoy the show,
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:25.040]  but whoever you are least, least technically minded person who enjoys listening to the talk
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:31.760]  show with John Gruber and you're not the sort of person, even you, the least technical listener
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:37.680]  of this show, you're not the sort of person who's confused by change to the iPhone, right?
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:43.600]  You might prefer touch ID, but you, you're not confused by having no more touch ID and
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:49.520]  swiping up from the bottom. I worry it's so hard for me to be in touch with how many hundreds of
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:54.480]  millions or million, tens of millions of people there are. My mom definitely, my mom has right
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:52:01.360]  now, the iPhone SE, the, this, this current one, you know, when did it come out at six months ago
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:07.440]  or 18 months ago, whenever I I'm confused on that a year ago. Yeah. I don't know where a little bit
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:11.680]  more than a bit more than a year. She was due for a new phone. I knew it was coming and she just
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.400]  really come out in the spring. She really just said, she just said, I just want one that works
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:20.560]  like my old one. And I was like, this is easier for me and she's fine with it. So that's what
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:25.680]  she got. And she's very happy with it. I presume eventually they won't offer touch screen iPhones
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.320]  anymore, but I don't know how many years away that is. That might be, you know, that might be
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:36.480]  this like part of the new Apple dealing with a billion person user base for this product that
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:43.440]  they've kind of got to stick with legacy fundamental home button. Yes. The current
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.520]  SE came out in March of this year. All right. Well, no, then maybe my mom has the previous one
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:50.960]  now that I think about it. Cause she didn't get it this year. So yeah, she's got the old, the
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:55.520]  previous SE, but if she was in the market for a phone now she'd want the SE like if she dropped
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:00.720]  her cracked her phone right now, she, she would get a SE. I'm not sure. I think my mom has to,
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:04.160]  has the current one. Actually, I don't know what you cause she sent me her old devices.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:09.360]  She said, I got a box full of old devices. Cause I, I can't say no to anything. And one of her
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:15.120]  previous device was a success. And then the one before that was the three GS and, and it's in,
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.040]  it's in beautiful condition because she, every time she used it, she would turn it off and put
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:26.080]  it back in the box. I think it's very hard for anybody outside of JAWS, we acts small
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:34.720]  leadership team to really know how, how much of the SEs purpose, I mean, clearly the lowest price
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.320]  is a, is a number one, right? That's, that's the job of the, that's the job. The iPhone SE serves
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:47.360]  in the product line, but how much of it right now is serving the desire for people to just replace
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:53.840]  their old iPhone with one that it works exactly the same way. And it's familiar and they even,
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:59.600]  you know, feel more comfortable with a fingerprint sensor than a face sensor, right? Like we've all,
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:04.400]  I've moved past the face. I mean, the face sensor thing is old news, but you know, I,
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.240]  people don't like change, you know, I, yeah, I had a conversation somewhere. I think it was in
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:11.600]  a Slack, some, some, I don't remember who it was with, but someone was like, oh man,
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:15.920]  I don't want to get that face ID thing. Get my face on the internet. That's not,
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.120]  that's not how it works. Right. But you know, where do you start? Yeah.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:27.520]  Start listening 353 episodes ago and John Gruber's the talk show 890 hours later,
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.000]  you'll be caught up. I guess that was in person. Cause I think Albert was with me and we were like,
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  no, no, it doesn't put your face on the internet. Well, anyway, I fell in love with
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.120]  the mini again and I don't know what to do. I guess I just, I should just stop.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.400]  No, I should do it for four years. Like I did. No, I got to send it back to Apple. It's a review.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.000]  You know, I should have sent it back. This is why it's not worth keeping these damn review units.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:54.240]  Yeah, that's right. Cause you do, you just get tempted by other form factors.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:57.920]  The other thing I've noticed and even on the mini, I kind of like it. It does seem like one
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:03.120]  of the under remarked upon changes in iOS 16 is they're moving more stuff lower on the screen,
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.720]  like, you know, search boxes and stuff like that. And you know, I think clearly it's about,
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.760]  you know, on the mini, it's not so big a deal, but on all of these phones, it's just,
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.480]  it's still better though. Yeah. That's the thing. Even on the mini, I, once you get used to it,
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:24.800]  it is better. Yeah. And it's a, it's a, it's a really interesting change that gets back to the
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:33.200]  way that on the iPhone in particular, the physical ergonomics of it matter more than on any other
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:40.480]  device. And like, why is the menu bar on the Mac at the top and not the bottom? It, you know,
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:44.720]  like in theory, you could have the menu bar at the bottom and then the menus would pop up, you know,
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.400]  like the windows start menu is at the bottom and pops up. You could do that. But I kind of feel
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.800]  that the menu bars role organizing all the features of whatever app you're using right now
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:04.160]  makes more sense to, to most people's minds as a top to bottom organizing principle. And, you know,
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:09.920]  most frequent, you know, the edit menu has the cut, copy and paste and undo at the top because
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:15.120]  they're the most common things in the edit menu. And then the stuff at the bottom is usually the
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.800]  lead, you know, look at the bottom of most of your menus. It's the stuff that you
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:28.720]  tend not to use. And I feel like on the iPhone, top bottom was sort of like 15 years ago more
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:34.160]  common just because of that thinking. Whereas as we've evolved and Apple's gotten more,
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.240]  you know, we've all habitualized to it, they're really sort of thinking like, no,
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.280]  the actual physical ergonomics of putting stuff towards the bottom is more, people will get used
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:49.040]  to it and it's more important. Thumb reachability is more important than the sort of conceptual
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:54.160]  thinking of putting important things at the top. All right, let me thank our third and final
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.880]  sponsor of the day. It's our good friends at Squarespace. Hey, Squarespace is where you go

[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:35.280]  this really, this is your area of expertise, the superheroes. Yeah. Yeah. I want to know what you
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.840]  think about that girl getting, I don't even know what I don't even, what, what happened to the
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:45.680]  bat girl movie? I was canceled, but is that the right time after, after filming it? I mean, it
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:51.200]  wasn't, it was not done, you know, I mean, they, they had done primary shooting on it as my
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:55.040]  understanding. And, you know, I don't think they had done any of the sort of after effects or
[01:59:55.040 --> 02:00:00.080]  anything like that. So, but they had, they had enough that they had done audience testing.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:03.920]  Yeah. So they had shown it to people because that was one of the things like, you know,
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.480]  they're saying, Oh, it only got like 60% or whatever, however, they, I forgot how they do
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:15.920]  the numbers like six out of 10, which would be like a D, but it's not uncommon. It's particularly
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:24.640]  not uncommon for DC movies to be released with scores that are lower than that. But, but they,
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.760]  when they show them initially, they often get that and then they tweak them and they make them
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:36.480]  better. And so, you know, a movie that is initially, you know, at that stage reviewed as a,
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.600]  as a 60 comes out and it's, you know, it's an 80 or something like that. An article I'd read
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.000]  had provided several examples and I don't remember which ones they were, but, but some, some of the
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.760]  ones, some of the DC universe ones that were not so bad, many of them are quite bad. I, in my opinion,
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.720]  I don't think they've done such a great job to date. So it could have been, you know,
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:01.680]  one of the decent ones, but they decided that they were going to take a tax write-off instead.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:08.080]  And they are, and I don't, they're retooling their view of how they want to do movies and stuff. And
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.760]  I think that's okay. Like they've decided they don't want to do sort of lower budget. And until
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.000]  it was a lower budget movie, it was like half the budget of the Batman and it was just going
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:26.560]  to be released on their streaming platform, HBO max, HBO max. And I think it's fine to redo
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:34.240]  your strategy, but it seems a little weird to redo it right in the middle of a movie
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.880]  and not just say, okay, well, you know, this is the last one. And then we're redoing our strategy.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:42.480]  And because you, you have gotten your fans sort of hyped up about here's,
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.840]  here's a movie about a character that really hasn't been done much or well before. And
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:56.240]  certainly hasn't had her own movie. And it is one of the few that is going to be led by,
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:02.480]  you know, a female and a woman who is of color. And that's the one that we're going to,
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.680]  pull the rug out from under this. It's like, it's a bad look and you know,
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.000]  we're doing it for tax reasons. Doesn't help.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.880]  And it's in the, for those who aren't following along with the drama, it's in the context of
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:23.840]  a major corporate reshuffling where discovery has acquired Time Warner, which is the, the studio in
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:30.480]  charge of all the DC franchise and the HBO and HBO max, the streaming service,
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:38.000]  and CNN, you know, Time Warner and famously, you know, David Zaslav is the CEO of discovery and is,
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:44.880]  you know, which features a lot of reality TV content, which is, yeah, right. So it
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:51.840]  raises concerns amongst fans, people who want either, you know, feature length, quality movies,
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:03:00.320]  feature length, quality movies to our blockbuster movies that are good movies or high quality
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:06.080]  streaming content on HBO max. And why is the company that makes the real housewives
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.600]  reality? I don't even know if a real housewives is on discovery, but shows that are sort of like
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.320]  shows and big shows. I don't watch reality programming, which is very successful,
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.680]  but is that the right leadership to come in? Yeah. I mean, when you think of HBO in particular,
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.560]  and we think of what you want the DC universe to be, even if it hasn't quite reached its
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:34.080]  best self yet, you don't think of reality TV stuff. I mean, HBO is kind of famous for making
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.760]  some, a, some incredibly good and thoughtful content, but also, you know, some that's just
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.040]  great spectacle. Right. Yeah, true. And it's just, that's what the brand stands for. They,
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:51.920]  HBO is to content, what Apple is to computers, the whole, the whole concept hinges on, we make
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:57.680]  the best stuff. And it's not that nobody else makes good stuff, but that our stuff is good
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.800]  stuff. And that's, it's quality first. And then success comes because of the quality and not the
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:09.680]  other way around. And you know, but like famously, very ignominiously, CNN had been spending a year
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:18.560]  making a CNN plus news streaming service before the acquisition. And then it launched, I seemingly
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:24.240]  rushed, I think, because they might've suspected, well, if we launch, they can't kill us. Right.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.840]  And it'll, I just know lots of people are going to sign up and then they launched and then the
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.680]  acquisition went through and like three weeks after it launched, the acquisition was final and
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:42.800]  David Zaslav is like, yeah, that's over. And there were apparently very few subscribers.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:50.640]  I mean, and it does seem, you know, sometimes you have to try an idea and see, but it seems to me
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:57.120]  that, you know, lots of people are talking about the wallet fatigue of paying forever more streaming
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.920]  services. Right. Well, yeah. I mean, Disney just announced that they're raising their rate as well.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:06.960]  And Netflix possibly raised their rates a bit too high last year that, you know, a lot of people
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:12.080]  think that, you know, the last time Netflix is, hey, we're Netflix, we're the number one streaming
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:17.600]  service. And every 18 months, we can just turn the burner up on the monthly rates, maybe caught
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.080]  up to them. And then it went too high because the price, you know, eventually you reach the point
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.560]  where people don't want to pay more and the competition is getting better and more varied
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:32.640]  and there's more services. But it seems like what people like to spend their money on is
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:38.960]  entertainment. You know, Netflix is best known for, they have documentaries and news-ish type
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.200]  things, but for the most part, it's entertainment content. Disney famously, the whole company's
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:51.440]  brand for a hundred years has been about creating family entertainment. It turns out people maybe
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:59.200]  don't want to spend extra money every month for news. And also, you know, I don't know.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.680]  Well, that's been a problem obviously, right? Yeah.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:07.120]  Right. It has been a problem for news organizations, but also too, just to sort of
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:13.040]  circle back to the opening of this show, I don't know, you know, the last maybe handful of years
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:16.480]  of news haven't. Right.
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:18.960]  Who wants to pay more for that? Sure. Right.
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:19.360]  Yeah.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:28.160]  What did you like to hear more about the lunatic in charge of both the nuclear man with the nuclear
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:32.240]  codes that keeps flushing things down the toilet? Right. Well, at least, you know, one point I
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:37.440]  wanted to make at the beginning of the show is at least as a lunatic, who's always been obsessed
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:45.760]  with quote unquote, direct quote, the nuclear, right? That's what he calls the whole area,
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:54.000]  the nuclear. At least if the worst he did was take some of the paperwork about it with him
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.960]  in an unsecure way, it sure is better than doing something inappropriate with the button.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.560]  Right. It makes you wonder how many times the general's had to just sort of slap his
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:12.080]  hand away from them. Yeah. Like, or just, you know, you know, the story that famously,
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:17.600]  apparently he had a red button installed on the desk that he could hit and then a butler would
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:23.200]  come in with a diet coke. And you know how he liked his diet coke. Apparently everywhere he
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:31.200]  goes, he gets his diet coke served the same way, which is unopened. And it comes, I don't know if
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.040]  he likes the bottle or the can, but whatever it is, it's all. I think it's the can. I think I've
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:41.520]  seen him. Okay. Yeah, I think so. And it comes, including at his own steakhouse in Washington,
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:47.840]  but every time he gets served the diet coke, it comes sealed and then gets opened in front of him
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:54.480]  so that he knows. Hasn't been tampered with. Well, and I do think, again, he's not a taster too.
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:08:01.840]  He's a lunatic, but he's not stupid, right? He's ill-informed and crazy and in curious,
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:07.600]  but he's is, but you know, and that, cause that's the thing some of his supporters have always said
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:16.480]  is if he's, if he's not smart, how did he get to be president? And it's true. He's smart in cunning
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:22.800]  in certain ways. That's how he's, that's how he's became president and how he's still is not in
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:30.000]  jail. We'll see how long, but he's also, I believe savvy enough to know that he's very likely to have
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:39.600]  his soda spit in. I think he knows. I think most likely it's spit. Cause, and I think, you know,
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:44.800]  like that scene in Martin Scorsese's casino where the cops are ordering sandwiches from the mobsters
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:49.680]  sandwich spot and they're like, ah, yeah, officer. Yeah. On the house, no money from you. And then
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:53.280]  the, you know, the mobsters and making the sandwiches are spitting in them and then they
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:58.480]  wrap them up. And Trump watched that movie and he's like, yep. Yeah. He's like, see, see,
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  that's how they get you. They do that. But anyway, they put a button on the oval office desk and he
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:06.880]  could just hit the button and a guy would come in with a ice cold can of diet Coke and open it in
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.800]  front of him. I bet that they put that button there, not because he wanted the Cokes, but to
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:18.320]  get the button out for launching the nukes. The man wants a button. That seems like a really
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:24.560]  imprecise way to launch nuclear weapons. Well, just a big button. I mean, why, why,
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:30.640]  where are they going? I'm not making this up. Don't you think that when he got in like January
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:36.960]  21st, 2017, that he was like, where's the button? Well, yeah, probably. I bet he was. And they're
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.920]  like, when can I hit it? Well, yeah. And where's, well, I just want to know where it is in case I
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:44.560]  need it. And they're like, what are you talking about? And he's like, you know, like that,
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:49.200]  the button on press your luck, like the big, the big red button that I hit to launch the nukes,
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:54.160]  the nuclear, how do I launch the nuclear? And they're like, girl, there really is no button
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:58.640]  that's sort of a figure of speech. And he's like, I want a button. And they're like, see,
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:04.080]  and what if we got you a button that got you a Diet Coke? Well, and what if it was like this?
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.080]  They're like, all right, we'll put the button on your desk. We'll hook it up to the nuclear
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:13.680]  eventually. But for now, that's going to take a while. If you win a second term.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.000]  That's going to take a while. And I think you'll understand, sir, that, you know,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.200]  that's a little complicated. And I think he would nod his head and say, okay,
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:26.720]  but for now you can you can try the button and it'll it'll get you an ice cold Diet Coke.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.720]  And I think that that might have been so distracting that he never really followed
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.800]  up on the hooking it up to the nuclear. He was so happy getting Diet Cokes.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:39.680]  Yeah. Anyway, things after that got worse. There was a pandemic,
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:45.360]  you know, so the news has not been something people really wanted to pay for. I give this
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.560]  Zaslav credit. That's sort of a hell of a way to take ownership of an acquisition.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:55.040]  Yeah. I mean, I know, I know that. Yeah. Nobody questions him getting rid of CNN Plus.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:58.400]  There was nowhere near as much of an outcry as opposed to canceling.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.800]  No one was looking forward to that. Whereas everybody was looking forward to Batgirl.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.320]  Well, not everybody, but lots of people, lots of people were legitimately looking forward to
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:10.480]  Batgirl. I think, have you watched, have you watched Prey on Hulu? Yeah.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:17.600]  We did. We watched it last week, which was, is the prequel. I guess it is a prequel. Yeah.
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:20.000]  Chronologically to Predator.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.240]  Yep. And I thought it was fantastic. Certainly, I think the best Predator movie. I haven't seen all
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:31.520]  of them, but the best one since the original, I think. I liked it. I didn't like it as much
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:41.600]  as I was hoping, but I genuinely appreciated the way that it went straight through in the universe
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:47.440]  where the Predator situation is real. It was plausible, right? It never, it never got to
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.520]  cockamamie, which is where all of these, all of these franchises tend to go, right? Because
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:58.080]  that was sort of the appeal of the original Predator. Speaking, you know, of the former
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.360]  governors, Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura, right? Yeah. Good way to launch a career in
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.240]  politics to be in a Predator movie. But it was, you know, it was, it was low, you know,
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:16.320]  the plot largely hinged on mud, right? Yeah. There's always a lot of mud in a
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:22.720]  Predator movie. But, you know, that cool mud. These high-tech aliens are flummoxed by mud.
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:28.160]  Yeah, but it messed with their infrared eyesight and, you know, and kind of cool,
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:33.120]  right? I liked Predator 2, which was the one. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, I think it's
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:37.680]  weaker than one for sure, but it's a movie you can watch and enjoy.
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:41.600]  Yeah. But Prey, so here's a question. I actually don't know. We did watch,
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:47.040]  the family watched it. I enjoyed it. I'm glad it exists. It's a neat lower-key way of bringing the
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.840]  Predator series back to Earth. I recommend it. Yeah. And I had heard about this movie coming
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:57.040]  out and was very excited for it. And then when, but I didn't, I guess I didn't follow it that
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.680]  closely because it's not a franchise that I'm super invested in. But when it came out, I was
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:08.880]  like, oh, it's on Hulu. Like, what? It just went to Hulu? But I thought that this is an example of,
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.320]  you know, here's a, here's a movie. And I don't think the budget was outrageous. First of all,
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:19.840]  they weren't spending a lot of money on, you know, big name actors because most of these people are
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:28.960]  not, you know, currently big name actors, although I think Amber Midthunder has a break. And it is,
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:34.720]  you know, the, the lead is woman who was a minority and, you know, and, and also like you
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.040]  can, you can watch it in Comanche. There's a Comanche, I don't know if it's a dub, I can't
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.280]  remember, but I think they, I thought they said they filmed both. Anyway, you can turn on Comanche,
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:46.320]  which might be the better way to watch it. We didn't, I was watching it with Hank, so we watched
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:53.120]  it in English. But, and I got to believe that it did super well because the word of mouth about it
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.960]  was, was terrific. And I would imagine that the Hulu is pretty pleased with the results.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.800]  Yeah. So my question is not in theaters, right? It's only on Hulu. But that seems, it almost seems
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:11.200]  criminal because it's really, it's so much better. I want to backtrack on my, my lukewarm praise.
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.200]  It's just, I was hoping maybe it was like an all-time classic. It's, it's very, very good.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:20.000]  I'm so glad that it exists and it is, but, and again, I should maybe just give the,
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.960]  the elevator pitch. It's some of the predators actually have been visiting Earth for hundreds
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.520]  of years. And here's one who went to, I, what year does it take place around?
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.080]  1710 or 19 or something like that. 1719, I think.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:40.800]  Yeah. So 1719 in Comanche Indian territory in North America. And, and one of the great things,
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:44.560]  I mean, again, I don't think that, I don't know, I hope it didn't even get pitched,
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.800]  but like if this movie, that premise had been made when you and I were teenagers,
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:55.120]  predators, prequel Comanche Indian, 1710, and then somebody would have said, okay,
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.520]  when does the white guy come in? What do we have him come in on?
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.680]  And save the, and save the natives?
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:06.800]  Right. And, you know, and who can we get? Can we get Harrison Ford? How about Harrison Ford
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:14.080]  is like a pilgrim and he's on a boat and then he comes in and kills them. No, it's just Comanche
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:20.240]  Indian, 1710 North America. And, and you know, terrific cast. It's, it's really interesting
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.840]  movie. I, I, I, I, you're talking me into having fonder thoughts about it than, than I,
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:27.520]  I want it. It's really interesting.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.000]  Yeah. I just think they did such a good, I mean, I, you know, particularly because I,
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.040]  like I said, I think it's a franchise that after the first one, you know, the second one's okay.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.320]  And then it, you know, it gets really silly and gets, you know, goes downhill severely.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:49.440]  I've heard moderately good things about predators, but I'd never, I have not seen it yet from 2010.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.560]  I know I've saw it and it's so bad that I don't remember it.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:57.200]  Yeah. Like some people say, oh no, it's not, it's not so bad. And other people say it's terrible.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:00.640]  So I know, I mean, I'm going to, I'm probably going to try and watch it just so I can sort
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.280]  of complete, you know, but I, but the alien versus predators ones that I've heard are absolutely
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:11.440]  terrible. Yeah, they are. They really are. It's, it's just, it, it doesn't, doesn't seem like
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.040]  there's a story. It's, you know, it seems like, how can you go wrong with that? Right. I mean,
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:20.640]  you're taking two, two cool things and mashing them together. Like, you know, like when you're
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:23.920]  a kid, what do you do? You know, you play, you get the action figures that are the same size and
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.720]  you're like, Hey, these guys can fight now. And they don't, you know, they never meet up in TV.
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:33.280]  I think it comes back to what you hear from everybody who's ever been involved with the
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.560]  Pixar movie over and over again, doesn't matter which movie, which people from Pixar you talk to,
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:44.560]  they always say story, story, story, story, story, and that they're famous for inventing 3d
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.360]  animation and turning the whole world of children's animation from hand illustrated to computer
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.680]  animated. And the computers is what was novel about Toy Story. And they're like, you know what,
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:57.920]  that's just, that's, that's great. And we love that stuff. And we think it makes for a better
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.800]  movie, but if we didn't have good story, this would be terrible. And the alien and predators
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.160]  thing really seems like, wouldn't it be cool if aliens and predators fought and they're like,
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.800]  yeah. And that was all they did. Yeah. And I think there's VFX people who did terrific work
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.520]  and there's, you could look at scenes, you could find scenes in those movies that are top-notch
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:21.520]  action scenes and tense, tense, Oh my God, I don't even know who to root for here. You know, it's
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.600]  blah, blah, blah. But another problem with those movies though, is the same problem was they still,
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:29.200]  they injected humans into it. It's like, all right, how do we get some people in here?
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:33.840]  Wouldn't it be cool if the movie was just aliens and predators and there's no people,
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:39.120]  which was like the WALL-E story, the first half of WALL-E, where there were no characters other
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:45.200]  than a cockroach and a robot. Right. That's, that's really hard cinematically, you know.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:49.680]  And no dialogue for you. Right. No dialogue. Right. And it's like,
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.520]  but anyway, to go back to Batgirl, it still is an open question of, you know, that I guess the
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:05.520]  problem I, I, I presume the movie is actually just terrible that it's so bad that they, they,
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:11.520]  that they looked at it and they're like, this is so bad. We should not even put it on just on HBO
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.600]  max, which I think was the plan all along that it wasn't going to have a theatrical release.
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:20.640]  It was not going to have a theatrical release that was, but they already have spent $90 million
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:28.240]  on it. And the idea is that they can take a tax write off on that. And, and the people who want
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:36.080]  Batgirl to be good, whether it's because it has a female lead, because they just love DC superheroes,
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:41.280]  they, they just want good, more good superhero movies. And you know, why not? If you're a fan,
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.400]  of course you want every movie to be good, right? No, who roots for a movie to, to stink. Sure. So
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:52.400]  you want it to be a good movie and you, you know, and you, people kind of latched onto this tax
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.920]  write off and it's like these rotten corporate bastards are taking a tax write off instead of
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:02.960]  releasing a good movie on HBO max. I don't think it makes sense. Cause it's like, I don't think
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:07.920]  people understand the tax write offs. They don't get you all your money back. Like there is an
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:12.640]  advantage to it. Yeah. And, but there is an argument to me like, you know, it wasn't done.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:17.360]  And so they would have had to spend a bunch more money on special effects and whatnot, but it's
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:25.680]  not, but it's not the bulk of it. And the other, I mean, like I said, that 60% for an early cut
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:32.720]  is not that bad. I, you know, I don't, I don't know that it's going to be a trying to think of
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:38.480]  like the best superhero movie, but I mean, you know, iron man one, you know, I don't think it's
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:43.200]  going to be something where you're necessarily where universally everybody is going to think,
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:49.280]  man, that was a great movie, but it's, but it could very easily be like, that was a solid
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:55.360]  superhero movie. That was, that was enjoyable. And I didn't feel like I wasted my time and we
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:00.400]  got to see a character that we hardly ever get to see. Right. You know, is it as good as the Han
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:05.600]  Solo movie, you know, which I thought, I think is the worst piece of star Wars material ever to come
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:11.040]  out. I mean, I seriously, I don't think it's, I mean, compared to the prequels. Oh, I lied.
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.280]  I don't think it's that. I don't think Dan, Dan famously loves that movie, but I don't,
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:19.280]  I don't think it's that great. I think it's, I think it's watchable, but I don't think it's
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:23.040]  that great. And it's certainly nowhere near, you know, I mean, but I, but I would put it,
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:27.360]  I would definitely watch that movie over any of the three prequels. I don't know. I just feel
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:33.200]  that the Batgirl must be bad and maybe not, maybe the other thing is I just don't think Zaslav is
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:38.240]  the kind of guy that I would trust to make that determination. I don't know, but I, it, it is a
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:46.480]  weird thing. And, and the way it played out was on day one, they, they said very nice things about
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:51.760]  the directors who, who unfortunately, I don't know their names off the top of my head, but they,
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:57.280]  they're Moroccan there too. They're yeah, a deal L-R-B, Belgian Moroccan, I believe. Yeah. And
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:04.400]  Bilali Fala. And one of them was getting married and the other one was, was at the wedding in
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.680]  somewhere over it, you know, in Asia, that's where they got the news that the movie they spent like
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.800]  right after the wedding, they got a call saying, Oh yeah, we're not doing your movie. We're not
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:17.040]  even putting it on streaming and you don't get to finish it. They worked on Ms. Marvel,
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.760]  which I think was a really, you know, it was a good show for, for Disney plus. Yeah. And I
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:25.840]  haven't seen that yet. You know, I mean, that's the only thing that I've seen that they've done
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:31.840]  that I know of and did a good job from what I saw. So. And there was stuff, other stuff that
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:35.680]  people were looking forward to in the Batgirl movie. Like there, you know, it's the same,
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:43.200]  the same way that like real science came out at the same time as what was the other one that it's
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:48.720]  like the same plot, which is the one with Val Kilmer. But you know, there's, it's like somebody
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:52.800]  comes out with a movie about an invisible man and then some other studio comes out with a movie
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:58.640]  about an invisible woman, you know, and that these ideas come up and it's like Marvel's gone in this
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:04.000]  multiverse thing and DC's going in a multiverse thing. And there's a multiverse in DC where
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:10.480]  Michael Keaton is still Batman. And so he's Bruce Wayne or who knows, I don't know the plot if he's
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:15.280]  still actively Batman at age 68 or whatever. Yeah. I think he's just say, yeah, I mean,
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:20.320]  maybe they pull him out of retirement. Right. But it's, you know, wouldn't that be fun? That's
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.320]  one of the things, you know, wouldn't it be fun to see Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne again,
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:27.920]  that would be a lot of fun. And all of these ideas are in there and it's, you know,
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:33.680]  now it's just not coming out at all. And it does seem, it just seems weird that you don't just
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:37.360]  let them finish it and put it on HBO Max and move on, learn the lesson, you know.
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:42.400]  Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, but what seemed to be happening, I mentioned this on Dithering
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:46.400]  last week, but it's really curious to me that on day one, when they announced it publicly,
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:52.640]  they said very nice things about the directors and the cast. And Leslie Grace is the name of
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:57.520]  the actress who was playing Barbara Gordon slash Batgirl, that they look forward to working with
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:01.360]  her again. It wasn't about the quality, it's this financial situation and that they've incurred
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:06.320]  $55 billion in debt with this acquisition, which is, I don't know if you know, that's a lot of
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:09.920]  money and that, you know, they're taking a tax write-up, but they look forward to working with
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:14.480]  everybody again. And they said all these nice things. Whereas in Hollywood, it's typically a
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:19.040]  cutthroat business. It's known as being a cruel business and you're hot until you're not. And
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:23.200]  then you're dropped and, you know, whoever's in charge, this is just a mean, you know,
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:27.360]  mean things happen to people all the time. They did this. But I think what happened,
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:33.040]  I think very clearly what happened Hollywood-wide is the unprecedented nature of a movie that's
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:39.600]  already been shot. $90 million have been spent. It's nearly finished. And like you've said,
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:46.240]  the test screenings aren't catastrophic tip for it just to be like, well, it's gone. We're just,
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:51.600]  you know, not even really when DC has released some super crappy movies to the theaters.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:02.640]  Like, and they gave, they gave the, the justice league movie to cracks. Yeah, right. Exactly.
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:06.400]  Yeah. We gave you, we give you a crappy one and now here's a longer crappy one.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:12.160]  And, and then they gave it a black and white version. I mean, they gave, they gave that
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:18.480]  movie, which was, in my opinion, spectacularly bad. It's really incoherent. I completely agree.
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:20.800]  I mean, that really felt like a trip to the dentist. I mean,
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.960]  Oh, well, the trip to the dentist is shorter at least. But I watched that one over like three
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:31.120]  nights and I was like, this has got to be almost over. And I'm like, I'm going to bed for tonight.
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.560]  Yeah. I mean, I, I watched the original and then, you know, and then it kept hearing,
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.840]  Oh no, you got to watch the Snyder cut. And it was like, I watched the Snyder kind of like,
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:41.680]  well, that was longer. I mean, I watched the Snyder cut and that was one I had to
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:45.280]  watch by myself because my wife would not have anything to do with it, but I watch and I'm like,
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.720]  I'm getting tired. How much is left? Maybe I should just stay up. And I look and there's
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.960]  still two hours left. I was like, Oh my God. So yeah, if they released that and gave a couple
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:59.840]  versions, why not do this? But then what happened the next day is Discovery had their earnings call
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:06.880]  and Zaslav on the earnings call was a lot less kind, not, not personally to the directors or
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.440]  the actors involved, but more or less said on the earnings call, this movie was really,
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.560]  it was beneath our state. I'm putting words in his mouth, but shifted from this was all
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:22.080]  about the taxes and the debt to this movie was beneath the standards of what we're trying to
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.320]  set for the DC franchise, which is a very different story. Cause I think what happened
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.320]  is all across Hollywood. People are like, is this going to happen to me? If I do a project
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:36.560]  with Time Warner, because one thing I think is super true in a creative endeavor like this,
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:40.720]  and yes, movies are about making money at some degree in the same way that selling computers
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.360]  and writing software about money, but the people who devote their lives to this recently really
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:51.360]  care about their work and their craft. And it, you know, I think in some sense that the Discovery
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:55.360]  thought, you know, everybody got paid. Nobody's the directors got their money and the actors got
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.680]  paid what they were supposed to get. And I guess because it was going to be streaming anyway,
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:03.760]  nobody was supposed to get a share of the box office. You're right. Everybody got paid. So
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:08.160]  it's all good. Right. But whereas I don't think they anticipated how the creative professionals,
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:13.680]  actors, writers, VFX people, lighting people, it becomes, yeah, it becomes like, here's a thing
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:18.960]  that we did and now it's not right. And it's like, Hey, there are people in Hollywood whose
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:28.480]  career is miking the set to get the dialogue recorded and that they take great care in doing
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:35.040]  it exactly right, you know, and having the lighting be exactly right. And yeah, this thing
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.000]  you spent a year on, yeah, never even, nobody's even going to see it. And people are like, what?
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.240]  And so I kind of felt like that's why Zazzle of the next day went to, yeah, this one was really
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:50.080]  bad. So don't, don't worry if you work with us. We're not, we're not going to. Yeah. I got to
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:56.880]  make sure that we can still get people to work for us. I mean, I don't think, I don't think we'll
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.200]  ever know for sure. Right. I mean, cause it, I don't, it doesn't seem like it's the kind of
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:06.480]  thing. I mean, maybe some of it might leak out, but it doesn't seem like it will be, cause I don't
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.200]  think they, you know, the people who made it want it to be released in its current form because it's
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.920]  probably not great yet. Right. Right. It's probably not it's the, the special effects aren't done.
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.480]  And you know, and they often, when they, after they do like first screenings, they're like,
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.920]  okay, we tweak this. We'll get them back in for reshoots. We'll do a couple other things and
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:27.920]  we'll make a slit, you know, at least a slightly better movie, if not a substantially better movie.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:32.480]  They don't want people to see it in its current form. So it's not going to get released.
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:37.840]  Right. Seems unlikely that it's going to get released and even leaked. So we'll never,
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:44.240]  we'll never be sure. But on the other hand, it certainly did raise my curiosity about what it
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:49.360]  actually looks like, you know, like, yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I agree with you though, that
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.800]  because it's not like, Oh my God, it was totally finished and you could just hit play or, or it's,
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:28:01.520]  you know, like supposedly Kubrick's eyes wide shut. He died like 10 weeks before it came out
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.760]  and famously liked to edit his movies right up to the very end tweaking. And so, you know,
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:10.640]  I think most people, they say it was officially finished, but if he hadn't had a heart attack,
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:14.960]  he probably would have made just little nips and tucks here and there before it came out.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:19.360]  It's not like that. Right. Like where it was when he had his heart attack was totally playable
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:25.280]  and a Kubrick movie, you know, Batgirl is clearly not in that state. And I don't know what,
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:30.880]  but it's damn, the curiosity is so high about it. Right. Cause I would just like to see,
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:36.240]  can you show us like 10 minutes of it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, maybe if they, maybe if they get
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:42.560]  sold again. What was the worst Batman movie? Remember Joel Schumacher took over the franchise?
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:45.920]  Well, it was one of the, it was the, I think it was the last one of those, right? It was the
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:51.280]  one with the, where they had nipples on them. Oh, that was that, that was Batman and Robin where
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.600]  George Clooney took over the role. Right. Yeah. And no fault of George Clooney's in particular.
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:01.440]  He's perfectly fine. But yeah. And actually seems like a pretty good idea for Bruce Wayne.
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.200]  Sure. Yeah. I think, yeah, I think he, yeah. I mean, honestly, like I think Ben Affleck is
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.760]  pretty good. I don't, I don't blame Ben Affleck at all. I think the story, you know, getting back to
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:15.120]  story, the story was just terrible and, and, you know, and I think he's, there's a lot of those
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.800]  pictures of Ben Affleck just being like sort of exhausted. I mean, he fits into that, that meme,
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.240]  right? Like he's this guy who's just like, and it works for old Batman. Yeah. Yeah. Slump shouldered.
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.800]  Yeah. He's got, he's got to fricking work with Aquaman now. Oh my God. Geez.
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:38.400]  Oh, we're, we're still like Starbucks. Where was I when Christopher Nolan was making these things?
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:42.400]  Anyway, that was a great discussion. Thank you, John. I hope you have a good rest of your summer.
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:46.320]  All right. You too. People can listen to you. You mentioned the rebound. That's,
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:49.520]  that's your podcast where you talk about the nerdy type stuff, right?
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:54.080]  Yeah. Yeah. And Dan is on paternity leave. So it's just, it's me and Lex for a while.
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:58.800]  Yeah. So same thing over at Biff where it's me and Guy while Dan is off.
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:04.640]  Who was also mentioned a guy that's Guy English friend of the show, but I'll bet Dan has time to
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:09.920]  listen to podcasts. So congrats to Dan because he had a big summer, right? He had his next.
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.840]  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Released a book and had a baby.
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:18.480]  Released a book and had a baby. So yeah. Yeah. You need some time off. I will also thank
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:21.840]  our sponsors. Oh, where do you people, where do people get those podcasts though?
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:26.400]  I mean, they could just type rebound into their podcast player or Biff into their podcast player,
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:33.360]  but they're what's Biff is at the incomparable and you can go to reboundcast.com reboundcast.com.
