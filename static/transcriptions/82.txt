[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Well, I enjoyed the first new show on the new network.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Did you notice any difference?
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  No, not at all.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  The RSS worked and sounded good.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  A couple of people.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  It was funny.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.000]  It was put a little extra effort into it.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  It seems like it weren't pretty well
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  in terms of all the stuff that was supposed to forward getting forward.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  The RSS feed redirects.
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  It's just crazy, though, because there's like four different redirects.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  There's feeds.muleradio.net,
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  slash the talk show is really a C-name.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Is that feed burner?
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  No, feed press.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  Feed press is like the new indie, totally indie version of feed burner.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  I should probably get on that.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  I'm still using feed burner.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  I still don't know, though.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  I'm torn, because they do seem to have some good analytics.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  But on the other hand, I always like just controlling my feed.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  Totally.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  And feed press seems like the best option for something like this by far.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  There's like an API that you can always do a manual rebuild.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  Say, hey, look, I made an edit to my last entry.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  Rebuild the feed so that you have the current version of everything.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  I don't know, I might.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  Seems like they do a decent job estimating subscribers, which is the big thing.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Right.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  And I think you're on SoundCloud as well.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Yeah.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  That's why I signed up there, because they're the only ones who even try to tell you how many times it's been played.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Yes.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  I don't know how they are determining what counts as a play.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  This was like the old YouTube question of 2006.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  Right.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  How much of the video do they actually watch?
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  And I actually owe the listeners a correction on that.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  I said SoundCloud was free.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  And they do have a free tier, but for like unlimited downloads, it's not free.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  It's $30 a month, I think, which is what I have now for this show.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  But compared to what I would pay to host the audio on S3, which I think would probably be around two or three grand a month, it is free.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  Right.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  When you're comparing two or three grand for hosting on S3 versus $30 a month for SoundCloud, all right, that's free.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  You know, with an asterisk.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Yeah.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  It's crazy that S3 gets expensive.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  It doesn't really scale that well in terms of pricing for media.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  No, not yet.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  Like video, I mean, I can't even imagine what a popular video download would cost.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  Yeah, because I would think video would have to be at least an order of magnitude bigger than audio.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Right.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  All of which just makes YouTube's infrastructure more impressive when you think about it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  Yeah, because my show, this show is usually around 70 megabytes.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  You know, 60, 70, 80 megabytes, depending on how far past the hour mark we blow.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  Yeah.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  The one hour.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  You mean the two hours?
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  Yeah, two hours, you know, you're still, you're still under, I think it's like 50 megabytes for about an hour.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  And then at the, you know, with the audio compression settings we use.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  And so, you know, somewhere between 50 and 100 for an hour plus show.
[03:38.000 --> 03:49.000]  My first big story at Forbes when I was there was trying, and this was early 2006, trying to guess how much
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  YouTube's bandwidth bill was based on their, and this is YouTube, you know, pre-Google acquisition.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  Right.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  There are venture funded company, and back then there were very few options for hosting video.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  So they were using these content delivery networks.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  And I think one, I think the one they were using was limelight.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  And the big one is Akamai, which is actually they're both public companies now.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  Right.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  And they refused to talk to me.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  They wouldn't tell me.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  And so I just use kind of publicly available data of, you know, how many hours of video they streamed
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  today, the kind of rate, you know, going rate for video streaming or video.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  They actually don't, don't, did not stream.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  It was, it was a progressive download, which was cheaper than streaming because
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  back then to stream you had to have some Adobe license.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  And, and then yeah, and then I made a guess.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  And I guess that it was a million dollars a month.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  You know, an educated guess based on interviews with all these experts and that kind of stuff.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  And we published this article and people went crazy.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  It was just a huge, it got a lot of attention because I think the dig headline was something,
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  this was when dig was massive.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  It was like you two burning up cash, spending a million dollars a month on, of their VC money on bandwidth.
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  And the first thing I heard of back, you know, kind of through like a second degree
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  great vine was that I was kind of off by 10X, which is kind of, you know, not ideal.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  You know, it's always, it was very clear that it was an estimate and you never want to be off by, by that much.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  So, you know, a million dollars a month would have been a lot back then, especially,
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  you know, this was before the era of the $50 million VC round.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  So, which way were you off though?
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  You were off high?
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  I was high, yeah.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  So, they were running YouTube pre, pre Google, they were running it for $100,000, roughly a month.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Maybe something like that.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  But then I also.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  Well, it was much smaller then.
[06:01.000 --> 06:10.000]  But then I think I saw an interview more recently with one of the founders where they said that it cost almost a million dollars a month in the early days.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  So, I don't know.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  I don't really know.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  I mean, you know, someone has the bill somewhere, so we know.
[06:16.000 --> 06:25.000]  But then if you looked at limelights, financials, there was no way that YouTube was, you know, that bigger there because they were not a huge company at that point.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  There was no way that YouTube was generating like a third of their revenue or whatever it was.
[06:29.000 --> 06:39.000]  So, anyway, it was really, it was like the, one of the first business tech stories I did where we kind of played the wire, you know, the follow the money game.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  And it was a lot of fun.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  It was a really fun story.
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  I got a lot of attention.
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  I, you know, I hope it was more accurate than it was and I actually don't even know how accurate it was.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  But because people from YouTube just would never comment or give suggestion either way.
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  But it was fun.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  Yeah, it's a fun like a modern equivalent of how many jelly beans are in the jar type of question.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Totally, yeah.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  And back then, you know, now video delivery is a lot cheaper, I think.
[07:07.000 --> 07:19.000]  And video is bigger too because it's HD, but it's, you know, and I'm sure there are quite a lot of companies with a billion dollar AWS bills.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  Oh, it's gotta be.
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.000]  Yeah.
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.000]  Well, Google, I wonder what you, I wonder, you know, a good question now is what is Google paying for bandwidth for YouTube a month?
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  I wonder because I think that a lot, and this is where now I'm making stuff up because I don't actually know.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  I think a lot of their bandwidth is an appearing basis.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  So they don't have to pay actual cash.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  They just kind of plug in to the other ISP and they, I don't know, great question.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  Probably, I'm not sure.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  It must be.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  And yeah, you might be right that Google isn't such a unique situation that they don't pay for bandwidth like normal companies do.
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  Yeah, and there were always all these murmurs that like Google was buying up all kinds of dark fiber.
[08:03.000 --> 08:15.000]  And I would not be surprised if they have the most advanced network infrastructure of any, you know, company that's not like a straight up telecom company.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  So I don't know.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  No, I'm just making stuff up.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  Which is, you know, that's commentary, right?
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  Yeah, we're allowed to make stuff up.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's just a podcast.
[08:28.000 --> 08:38.000]  I wonder to, like, for user submitted videos to YouTube, they still have the 10-minute limit, right?
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  I don't know.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  I've never, I haven't uploaded a video to YouTube in a long time.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  I know that, you know, that first stuff that did is like, where there's like a commercial partnership.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  I mean, when, you know, some people can host their whole movie on YouTube.
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.000]  Right.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  But that's not just like, guy signs up for YouTube account and uploads an hour video.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Like, the 10-minute thing is still a real limit.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  But I'm not quite sure when.
[09:01.000 --> 09:10.000]  I think so because you still see videos chopped into multiple parts when they're clearly not partner videos.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  Like, you know, some rip of an Apple keynote or something like that.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  A lot of them are still chunked up.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  I don't know, though.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  Good question.
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  I haven't, you know, uploading, making web videos is one of those things that every, like, two or three weeks.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I'm like, oh, man, I wish I was making cool videos.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  And then that's the end of the, but someday, maybe, I don't know.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  The podcast audio thing, you know, again, we talked about it last week, but it's, it's, it's weird.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  I don't know.
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  But SoundCloud's cool and you're right that they do just to circle back five minutes that they seem to do more work trying to figure out how many downloads you have than anybody else.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  And it isn't just, okay, you started a download.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  Right.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  Well, we think, right.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  You don't.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  But it's, it's important because a podcast is delivered many different ways.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  You know, I'm sure some people are actually listening to it via the actual SoundCloud player,
[10:13.000 --> 10:25.000]  but a lot of people, probably most people are just pulling the file through either iTunes or the iOS podcast app or any other pod catching type things.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  Well, and that's the two is it gets to be like RSS too, because, you know, podcast is RSS.
[10:31.000 --> 10:42.000]  But it's the same way with RSS feeders that the numbers don't equate to people because let's say you signed up in Apple's podcast app and you have a subscription to the show.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  And now you're using Castro or something else that's new.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  People don't unsubscribe from the other one.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  So you might be copying it twice.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  You might be downloading it once in iTunes on your Mac where you don't even listen to it.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  And then once in Castro on your iPhone, you're just one person.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  You're only going to listen once, but you might have two or even three copies of it.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Yeah.
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  And I often listen to, you know, this show on three or four different devices throughout the course of the show.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  Right. So who knows what?
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  Well, it's better for everyone if all of those count as a place.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  Right.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  I mean, it's, I'm not complaining about it.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  I'm just not only pointing out that it's a very hard thing to put a number on.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  And it always has been.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  I mean, even the Nielsen numbers for TV, they were nonsense, you know.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  Oh, I mean, have you ever been part of the arbitron radio survey where you actually have like a paper book and you're supposed to fill in what you're listening to on the radio?
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  No, I think I heard that when I was like 12.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  I heard that five bucks in the mail.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  Right.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  It's like, yeah, fine.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  For five bucks, I'll write down the radio.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  Right.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  Shows how I'm not listening to.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Right.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  That is actually how radio ratings.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  I don't know if they're still computed that way, but they might be.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  I think it's a little more digital now, but it's still, they're still, I believe.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  I was talking to someone about this somewhat recently.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  I don't remember if it was radio or TV though, but it's still based on,
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  I think it's, I think we were talking about TV Nielsen.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  I think it's still based on like, you know, Nielsen households that have some sort of equipment or.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  Yeah, now it's at some point in the 80s or 90s.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  They switched to equipment, but I know when I was a kid in like the 70s,
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  I remember reading that it was like Nielsen.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  It was a log book that the family would do it and that it.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  Not that there was it back in those days.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  Not that there was a lot of inappropriate stuff on,
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  but that people would, because you had to self report it, people would write,
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  wouldn't write the trashy stuff that they watched that they were embarrassed.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  And they'd say, oh, I watched the, you know, the McNeil report on PBS.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  Right.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Yeah.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  When in fact.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  I watched Rick Steves all night.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  Right.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  I was watching.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  And in fact, they were watching, you know, Brady Bunchry runs or something.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  Yeah.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  Let's take a break.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  I'm going to thank the first sponsor.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  This is great.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  This is a new sponsor, Karma, K-A-R-M-A.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  What's Karma?
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Karma at a high level.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  You kind of think of them.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  You know, like a mofi juice pack.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  What that is, you know, not the ones that, that case,
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  but, you know, the little square rectangle ones.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  And you just have battery power.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  You could use it for anything.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  You could use it for your iPhone.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  You could use it for your iPad.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  Anything with a USB connection.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  Karma is like that, except instead of battery power,
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  it's for Wi-Fi.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  So Karma is a little cute.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  Very small.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  You take a look at the hardware.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's really, really small.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Easily fits in any kind of pocket.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  Very thin 4G hotspot.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  And you turn it on.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  It gets a 4G connection.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  It creates a little, takes the 4G and creates a little local Wi-Fi
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  network.
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  And you can connect anything to it.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  You connect your iPhone to it, your Mac.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  You connect your iPad.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  Super cool.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Have a device like that.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  Or a hotspot for your Mac because Mac still don't come with
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  any kind of 4G, you know, cellular networking.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  And it's, they've got a crazy, cool business model.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  No monthly fees.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  You just buy the data.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  And you can take as long as you want to use it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  So if you buy a hundred megabytes or something like that,
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  you only use 15 this month.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  Next month, it doesn't reset.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  You still have 85 left.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  You just use it until it's up.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  Not a monthly fee.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Data is really affordable.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  It costs as little as $9.99 per gig.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  10 bucks for a gigabyte.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  Pretty good for cellular.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  And it's made for sharing.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  So you create an account.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  And you create a little hotspot.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  And you let other people on, if you have friends,
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  you can let them on your hotspot.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  And every time somebody else joins using your hotspot,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  you each get an extra hundred megabytes free.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  You get another hundred megabytes added to your account.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  You can use it whenever you want.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  They get a hundred megabytes to start with,
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  just for signing up for free.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  So if you just keep letting people use your thing,
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  you might never even pay for data.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  They have an iOS app that lets you check.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  They have an Android one, too, if you happen to have an Android device.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Use the app.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  You can check your balance.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  See who's connected to your device right now.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  So what do you do?
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  You buy the device.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  It's 99 bucks to buy the little hotspot device.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  When you sign up, you get 100 megabytes free.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  But don't just go there and buy it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  Do it this way.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  There URL is yourkarma.com.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  YO-U-R-K-A-R-M-A.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  Yourkarma.com slash the talk show.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  Go to that code, yourkarma.com, the talk show.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And you'll save 15% off right off the top.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  So it'll only be 85 bucks for you.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Like I said, it's like a little mofi juice pack,
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  but instead of battery power,
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  it just gives Wi-Fi to all your devices.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Really cool deal.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Great prices.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  And with the sharing thing, you might not even have to pay for it.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  So go check them out.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Great sponsor.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  I've used one of these things and works a charm.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  I used it last month out in San Francisco
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  when I was out there for the build conference.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  If you can do it, if you're listening right now,
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  you're going to WWDC.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  You should, a quick order one right now,
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  so you can get it before you get out there.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  Can't believe that's a week away.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  I cannot either.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  A week from, we're recording on Memorial Day.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  This is Monday, the 26th of the name.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  So literally one week from today,
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  it'll be, keynote will be over, right?
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  It'll be one o'clock Pacific as we speak.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  So we will be cracking open the health book app and
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  Yeah.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  Pricking our fingertips and measuring our,
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  doing a blood test on the, no, I don't know.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  I use an app called Ida.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Ida. Ida. I don't know how to pronounce it.
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  ITA.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  iOS app and it lets you make little checklists
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  and you can sit, you know,
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  it probably doesn't have apps that make checklists,
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  but you, I have one for like packing for a conference
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  and then when I'm done and then I just uncheck them all
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  and then the next conference I can do it again.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  Last year, like a dumbass,
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  I did not bring an old iPhone.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  Did you see, did you see?
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  And so I had to sit there and think,
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  well, I did, there's no way you have to be
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  a crazy person to install the first beta of iOS
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  on your daily use iPhone,
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  especially when you're like away from home,
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  away from, you know, you're on your phone all day.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  It's insane.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  And especially when it's iOS 7.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  Exactly.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  Well, exactly.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  When it's a major release like that.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  And there were others, I don't know why,
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  but so I've added a checklist in my,
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  you know, all year long,
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  every time I go to anywhere else,
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  any kind of business trip,
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  I get the spare iPhone for iOS beta check thing
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  and I just check it off because I know I don't want it,
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  but then when I pack for next week,
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  I'll bring my iPhone 5, I guess.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  I ran out and bought a iPod touch for that.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  And then there were so many people last year
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  who went to the one that,
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  I guess it's closed now,
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  the Apple store on Market Street in San Francisco.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  Yeah, I think they're remaking it, right?
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  Right.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  They're moving up to where Levi's used to be.
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  Okay.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  Union Square.
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  I'm not sure if they're done with that yet,
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  though.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  I don't know.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  But anyway,
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  the one that's right up there on Market Street,
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  a couple blocks from Moscone,
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  I don't know if they sold out or they came close to,
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  there was like a,
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  just, you know, 40, 50, 60 people from WWDC going in
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  to buy the super cheap old,
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  well, 199 iPod touch.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  That's awesome.
[18:30.000 --> 18:31.000]  The one that doesn't even have a camera.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  It doesn't even have a camera.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  Yep.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  That's the one I got.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  All right.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  Took it back like a week later when I realized that
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  there was no need to have an iPod touch,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  but you took it back running the iOS beta.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  Well, I wiped it.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  I don't know.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  I don't know what it wipes to it.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  It wipes back to iOS beta.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Oh, well.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  I'm sure they,
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  yeah.
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  I wonder what they do with that.
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  They can figure it out.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  I'm sure Apple can figure it out.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  Yeah.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Yeah.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  I can't help but think we're going to see,
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  we're going to get betas of all that stuff next week.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Yeah.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  So I'm wondering the big question I have,
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  and I'm thinking about writing about this tonight or tomorrow,
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  is how drastically different the new OS X is going to seem,
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  like just thinking about how, you know,
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  when iOS 7 came out, people freaked out.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  And, you know, obviously not the Mac nerd types,
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  but a lot of other people did.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  And I wonder if changing someone's Mac that drastically
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  would also cause people to freak out.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  And so I wonder how different it'll be.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  Theoretically, they would change a lot of the Mac OS stuff
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  to more closely resemble iOS 7 or whatever iOS 8 is going to
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  look and feel like.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  But I don't know.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Yeah.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  I do not know what to expect.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  And my spidey sense is failing me.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  I mean, clearly it's going to change some degree cosmetically,
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  but just how radically I don't know.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.000]  Yeah.
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  And also the idea of running this now,
[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  almost four-year-old MacBook Air with a new software,
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  running it, also seems strange,
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.000]  because OS X has really not changed that much visually since then.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  They've added a lot of stuff that I don't use,
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  like the launcher and all that kind of stuff.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  But I don't remember like a different feeling Mac OS.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Right.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  Yeah.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  I think that when they,
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  I forget which version number it was,
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  it might have been 10.6.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  Maybe it was 10.5.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  But one of them, when they got rid of the separate metal windows
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  and just said, all the windows just have one appearance
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  and it's this gray,
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  you know what I mean?
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  There's not going to be two types of windows anymore.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  Simple.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  Simple.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  Yeah.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  It was probably 10.5.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  And then 10.6 was snow leopard.
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.000]  Yeah.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  So 10.5 was the one where they made it look.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  And it certainly looked different than what came before it,
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  because I got rid of a lot of the candy colored stuff.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  But it was like a gentle flattening.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  It wasn't a radical flattening.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  Right.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  And I think that's what a lot of people were expecting
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  with iOS 7 was that kind of flattening.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  And a perfect example of that,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  if anybody wants to look it up,
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  just look up the screenshots from last year's
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  W-W-D-C app.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Ah, yes.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  I remember this.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  And everyone was like, oh, this is what iOS 7 is going to look like.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  Yeah.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  And I even saw on Twitter,
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  Mark Gurman from 9 to 5 Mac the other day was writing,
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  because he had written about it, you know, that,
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  hey, this is what iOS 7 is going to look like.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  And he still thinks it did,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  that it was a clue as to what iOS 7 looked like.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  And I would say no.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  It was a step in that direction,
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  but like a half step as opposed to the actual iOS 7,
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  which was like, holy shit.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Yeah, holy shit.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  That was my, you know,
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  and a lot of people's reaction when that video came out,
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  just showing all the new graphics and all that kind of stuff.
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  Right.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  And I've said this before the last,
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  over the last couple of weeks on this show,
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  like the flat is overused
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  and talking about these interfaces,
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  but, you know,
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  there's no other word to say it.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  And a lot of the ways in iOS 7 on the iPhone and iPad,
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  it is flatter.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  There's a lot less 3D treatments between elements, you know,
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  that when something scrolls underneath a navigation bar,
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.000]  there's no shadow there.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  It's just a one pixel line.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  I just don't see how the Mac can get away with that much flatness
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  when you have, by definition, these overlapping windows.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  Yes.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Yeah.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  By the way, I love, this is like, you know,
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  as someone who learned web design in the mid 90s
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  and didn't really learn much since then,
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  no 3D or gradient modeling or any of that kind of stuff,
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  I love flat design because it's all I've ever known.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  So I'm actually a competent designer again,
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  but, and I'm already nervous about
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  when it's going to start getting more technical again.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  And texture.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  Yeah.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  Yeah.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  We still have an iPad, original iPad running,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  wow, I guess it's iOS 5 now,
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  and, you know, I use it every few weeks,
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  and it's super weird.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  Yeah.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  I think it's weird.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  In many ways great, but in also many ways,
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  I'm very used to iOS 7 now, and I really like it.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Like, there are some annoyances,
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  but that's probably never, not going to be the case,
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  but I really like the way it feels.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  Yeah.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  I think that it, for all the,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  I'm going to botch this,
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  what's the German term, Stermandron?
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  I'll do that.
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.000]  Yes, something like that.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Well, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  Well, for all of the consternation that iOS 7 caused,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  and as, as vocal as some of its critics
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  are about the planeness of its visual style,
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  in hindsight, when I go back and fire up one of those devices,
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  I, you know, from my stackable iPhones
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  and look at iOS 6,
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  or look at an old original iPad
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  that has to be running iOS 5
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  or whatever the last version that, that it supports is.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  It looks so much older.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  It just looks way more than,
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  I can't, it's hard to believe that,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  that, until like eight months ago,
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  that was what everybody was using.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  It really feels like it,
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  it's just the distant past visual style was.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Yeah.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I don't see that changing.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  I mean, there might perhaps make some tweaks.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  Like there are some of the iOS 7 icons
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  that just don't really make sense.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  Like, I think game center,
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  and then maybe also the new stand one,
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  which is hiding all the apps in there.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  I don't know what's going to happen with new stand.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  I might just vaporize, but.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Yeah, maybe with new stand,
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  it's actually appropriate because I feel like they don't know
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  what they do with new stand.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  And so an icon that sort of doesn't really know what it is,
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  either kind of it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  Yeah.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  Not fitting.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  Not to be a jerk,
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  but it kind of fits.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Whereas game center, yeah, I don't know.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  I kind of feel like they punted on it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's attractive to me,
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  but it doesn't say game center.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  No, it says balls.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Yeah, it just says like, I don't know.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  It just looks like something, you know,
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  we don't have an icon yet,
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  but we want to start giving beta builder.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  So it could be any app.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  It could be any app at all.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  It could be a photo app,
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  a notes app could be a game.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  We'll just put this placeholder icon here.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Yeah.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  I'm excited about it, though.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  I do think, you know, in the big part.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  I think it's really cool.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Here we are one week out from WWDC.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  We have no idea what this Mac OS 10 thing is going to look like.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  And as a long time Mac guy, you know,
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  as someone who really got drawn into the hole,
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  following Apple closely,
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  specifically and only because of the Mac.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  I think it's pretty awesome that here we are in 2014
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  and the most exciting thing we have coming up next week
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  is a Mac interface overall.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  Oh, yeah.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  Yeah, I'm pumped.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  I remember when I switched from six to seven on the Mac,
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  and that was crazy.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Like that was because that was the first one
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  where the folders were colored in.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Yeah.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  Six was system six was, you know,
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  which traced outlines and then seven had the beginning of that
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  kind of 3D folder look.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  And that was just, yeah, six supported color on certain models,
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  but it was, you know, it was funny.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  It was a very flat color because remember like the,
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  when they, yeah, it was very, very flat.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  I think it still had a black and white Apple logo,
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  though.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  I think the color Apple logo didn't come in,
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  you know, for the menu bar until system seven.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  But everything was flat.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  Even though you had color,
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  the windows were still drawn just blue,
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  not grayscale, black and white.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  It was just black pickles, pixels and white pixels
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  for the windows and open and saved dialogues and everything.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  And then seven had like the scroll bar had a gradient to it.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  I mean, the folders, the window title bar had a gradient.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Yeah.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  Sort of thing.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  And it was, you know, it was clearly an evolution
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  of the system six look.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  They just kind of colored in certain parts,
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  but they didn't color in much.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  I think it was sort of, I wouldn't call that
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  an exciting overhaul though.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  To me going from six to seven, it was a huge change,
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  but the interface wasn't really that hugely changed.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  I also think that it slowed down our old Mac so much.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Yeah, that was, that was the thing I remember.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  Is that system seven really slowed down your computer.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  Yeah.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  I think that was, I think we had an LC running six
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  or maybe a plus or something.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  I don't know.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  Yeah.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  Because people used to, people used to complain
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  about the old original open and saved dialog boxes.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  A lot.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  Because they were modal and they were kind of ugly.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  And it was system seven actually originally didn't fix that.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  I forget when the nav services open and saved dialog boxes
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  came about, which were a little bit more modernized Ui-wise.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  But the thing about the old open and saved dialog boxes
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  was that if you knew the keyboard commands,
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  the command up arrow and down arrow.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  And you knew that you could type ahead to match items in a list.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  Right?
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  Like to match, if it's a list of people's last names,
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  I could just type FR and get it from her.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  You could really fly through those dialog boxes
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  because when you hit command up to go up a level
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  in the hierarchy and down, down, down, command, down, command, down,
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  it would update instantly.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  It was like you could, if you knew the incantation
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  and knew your way around that and you weren't using the mouse,
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  you were using the keyboard.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  You could kind of zip around your hard disk
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  at the similar pace as to somebody who was an expert
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  on like a command line system.
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  And then when system seven came out,
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  just see like everything got slowed down
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  and you hit command up and you'd get the watch cursor
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  for a little bit.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  Just a little, all sorts of little things really slowed down.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  And that was the thing that I hated about visiting
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  friend's houses with PCs was that even though Windows
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  was pretty awful, it felt so fast versus system seven.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  And I wonder if maybe that's the kind of thing that
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  the new Mac OS by will it be a 10 or is it,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  are we at a, we're not at 11?
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  No, it'll be 10.10.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  I wonder if that's the kind of thing
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  that a flatter, simpler UI could actually achieve.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Like, hey, PS, we made your computer faster.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  I don't know, maybe not, man.
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  I think I feel like we've gotten to the point
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  where even the cheapest Mac can render pretty quickly.
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Yeah.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  And especially if they're going to go in a less exuberant style,
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  like there's certain things in the transparency in iOS
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  that maybe they're pushing the limits on,
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  not even maybe they kind of are pushing the limits
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  on some of the iOS devices that support it.
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  True.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  And the power lacks and stuff like that.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  They didn't have good frame rate on some of those effects.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  And it's gotten better with 7.1, but they were pushing.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  But any Mac, even the cheapest Mac mini,
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  which hasn't even been updated in 600 days or something like that,
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  can just chew that stuff up.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  I mean, the days when a Mac can't render windows dropping down
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  and stuff like that, menus dropping down quickly,
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  it's, I think we'll pass that.
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  Yeah.
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  I think so too.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Well, with SSDs and all that.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  Yeah.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  And that's definitely a big change.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  And I think it's kind of cool, though,
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  that hopefully that's the reason that it's kind of cool
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  that we haven't seen any major leaks yet
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  about what's going on.
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  It could just mean that there's nothing.
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.000]  There's nothing worth knowing.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  I don't know if that's an attitude,
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  but I think it's kind of cool.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  And it'll be curious, the leaks often come closer to the event.
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.000]  Right.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  Yeah, especially when they're software leaks.
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  The hardware leaks kind of have been coming too early
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  because of the supply chain stuff.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  But when it's stuff that never left Cupertino
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  to begin with, that typically is like the night before.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  Like, wasn't last year, didn't someone nine to five
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  or someone else have all the icons,
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  either the night before or the morning of?
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  Yeah, but I think that they had it as recreations.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  Right.
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  Someone had like dictated to them,
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  and then they drew them.
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  And they did really good.
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  Yeah.
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.000]  I think I've even joked about it with Margaret.
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  It was like a police sketch where the...
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  Yeah.
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  And it's like a dead ringer.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  It's like, holy hell, that's the guy.
[32:06.000 --> 32:07.000]  Yeah.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  You know, they like police sketched the icons
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  and they did a really good job.
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  And it was, and they nailed it.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  And there was so many people, of course,
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  because the icons are probably...
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  They're the first thing you see.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  And B, they are work kind of radically simplified.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  And there were so many people who were like,
[32:28.000 --> 32:31.000]  no way is Apple gonna do icons that were like that.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  Right.
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  That was awesome.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  Yeah, and then you got to wonder, you know,
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  for the apps that have the same app in OS X and iOS,
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  do they have the same icons now?
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  Like, just Safari, get this.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  This new icon, the same as iOS,
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  or is that it still Mac has their own icon set.
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  Right.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  And are they going to do a thing like give Mac icons
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  an official shape?
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.000]  Like a circle?
[32:58.000 --> 32:59.000]  Oh, yeah.
[32:59.000 --> 33:00.000]  You know, interesting.
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.000]  You know, they've done a lot of circles.
[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  You know, like the iBooks is new and has a circle
[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  and apps have been a circle.
[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  Though the iWork numbers and that kind of stuff are still
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  free form shapes and kind of arbitrary shapes.
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  So I don't know.
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  Yeah.
[33:16.000 --> 33:17.000]  I don't know.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  I feel like...
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.000]  Well, I don't know.
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.000]  I wouldn't be surprised,
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  but I feel like there's so much...
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  I mean, there's just got to be 30 years of history
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  of Mac icons taking whatever shape they want.
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  Whereas iOS always had, you know,
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  you're going to make it a little round-cornered square.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  Right.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  That's true.
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  Yeah.
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  I used to make Mac icons.
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  That was a weird hobby in like high school,
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  I think, with ResEdit,
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  just kind of goofing around.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  Because I forgot which maybe it was eight or eight,
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  five had kind of these 3D folders.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  And I would draw the icons of apps.
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  Back then, you know, I wouldn't keep my apps in apps folder.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  I would just keep them in their own folders.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  Right.
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  In Macintosh HD.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  So there was like the Quark Express folder.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  And so I made like a special Quark icon for that folder.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  Actually, I think Quark had a good icon.
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  Some of them had awful icons.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  Yeah.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  I remember customizing icons, though.
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  Same thing.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  All right.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  You do either go in...
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  You do either go in and actually be an idiot
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  and go in and edit the actual resource in the application.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  Or you would make your own icon and then copy and paste it
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  in the finders, get info.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.000]  Yeah.
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  And then you could just delete it,
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  and it would go back to the regular icon for the app.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  Right.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  And then some of them I even made aliases.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  And I think an alias could even maybe have its own icon.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  Yeah.
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  I think it could.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  Yeah.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  I think I'm almost sure you could.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  Which was crazy.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  It's confusing.
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  Right.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Well, yeah.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  No one...
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  Anyone who would sit down in my computer
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  wouldn't have no idea how to use it.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  Did you remember when I don't remember which Mac OS?
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  Maybe it was 8.
[35:01.000 --> 35:01.000]  8.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  5.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  Or 8.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  Which had...
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  It shipped with maybe one or two themes.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  And then there was the idea that they would be more themes
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  coming within they just never came.
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  Yeah.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  That was...
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  I think it was...
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  I think it was system.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Or Mac OS 8.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  I didn't think it was when they stopped calling it system 8.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  Right.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  The first version of Mac OS 8.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  And...
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Syracuse is listening to this show right now.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  And his head is exploding because he can't just jump in
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  and correct us and tell us exactly what I think it was 8.0.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  And it was called the appearance manager.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  Yes.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  And the appearance manager was a control panel.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  And it had a list of themes.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  And there was platinum, which was the default look.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  Gizmo, which was the one that was like a kid's theme.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Looked like something from my Nickelodeon.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  And I think it was called Techno, which was sort of the...
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  I don't know, looked like something from...
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  That would have been art directed for like a Terminator movie
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  or something like that.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  Like a sci-fi movie where they have a custom theme
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  for the GUI that the characters are using.
[36:17.000 --> 36:25.000]  Now, did you know about the leaked unofficial fourth theme now?
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  No.
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  That was the drawing board.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  Oh, of course.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Yes.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  That was awesome.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  Yeah.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  I love that.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  I wish I could run that now.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  If I get...
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  If OS 10.10 was drawing board, I would take that.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  Right.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  Drawing board made it look like an architectural sketch.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  Like the windows were made out of paper and that the buttons
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  and everything were sketched in by an architect.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  And it even shipped with an architect handwriting font.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  I forget the name of the font.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Yeah.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  I don't remember.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  It set the system font to that.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  So like your menus and your window titles were in that architect handwriting font.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  But that never shipped to customers.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  It shipped as like developer betas.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  So like, you know, people who are in the developer program
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  got those themes so that you could make sure your Apple
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  and Gizmo and Techno and you're right that the architectural one was
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  the one that actually was like, maybe I would use that.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  I mean, it was totally...
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  It felt like playing one of those old SimCity games
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  where it was like back in the...
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  Maybe one of those Sim Games
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  where it was like the expansion set.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  Yeah.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  And, you know, just was never as fun as the main SimCity.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  But it was cool.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  I think I ran it for a couple of months.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  I'm not looking this up.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  I'm going from memory here.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  I'm trusting my memory, which is dangerous.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  But my understanding, my recollection though,
[37:43.000 --> 37:49.000]  is that this Mac OS 8 didn't come out until after the next acquisition.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  And the next team had come in and Steve Jobs was the interim CEO
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  and Avi Tovanian was the CTO or whatever his title was.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  And while most of their efforts were focused on getting this next step,
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  Mac OS, carbon, next generation OS that they kind of had to, you know,
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  start in 96 and build it.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  And they were hoping to ship it in a year.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  And they wound up not even shipping it in 2000 until 2001 or whatever.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  You know, they were four or five years out from it.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  But in the meantime, they had to keep the company running.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  And so that team took over,
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  or at least overseeing the last few years of Mac OS evolutions.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  Mac OS 81859, I guess was the last one.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  And, you know, like six, too.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Right. And they were like ready to ship it with these themes.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  And Steve Jobs was like, what is this bullshit? Get it out. Get it all out.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  It ships with platinum. That's what it looks like.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  And so it shipped with an appearance manager.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  And it would say theme. And there was one choice.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  It like, so they ripped the themes out.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  The alternate themes were ripped out at the last minute.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  But they didn't, couldn't rewrite all the software.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  So it was this interface that looked like it was meant to have a list of themes.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  And it did. But there was only one to choose from.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  Yeah. It was, it was hilarious. And I, was that when you could,
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  when you could change the colors to match the different iMac colors as well.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  Like, tangerine and, and lime and that kind of stuff.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Or was that later? I don't remember. That was later.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  Because they didn't come out until 98 was the original iMac.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  And then 99 was when the colored ones came out.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  But then they did, yeah, they had like, I forget if the software
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  could tell what color your iMac was though and default to it.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  But yeah, you could pick like highlight colors that matched your,
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  your candy colored iMac.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  And I can't do any of that stuff.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's, that's probably okay. Yeah.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  Well, I don't know. Is there anything like, I've gotten old and
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  crochety. So I don't know. I don't look either.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  Maybe there is. I wonder whether there's still something like that.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  Because there used to be something in the early days of Mac OS 10,
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  where you could switch the theme.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  It was from sanity. Yeah.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Oh, yeah. Hey, look at that appearance.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  You can go, oh, guess these are, these are many different options here.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  You can pick blue or graphite.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  And then you can change the highlight color.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  But yeah, blue or gray are your choices now.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  That's all right.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Maybe, yeah, and you know, this is obviously now just,
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  just fan fiction almost, but I wonder if the Mac hardware
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  will ever kind of more closely reflect the iOS hardware,
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  like, you know, the five C type plastic, like the return of the
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  iBook or something like that.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  It just, I was testing out that new Microsoft Surface this week.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  Yeah. And it reminded me just how old the Mac Book Air
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  design is. I mean, it's now six years old.
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  Almost the current Mac Book Air.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  Yeah, and it's funny because Microsoft's like, hey, look,
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  this thing is lighter than a Mac Book Air.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  But I'm like, yeah, that Mac Book Air is six years old, man.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  Yeah, and it looks, to me,
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  the part that really kind of looks a little dated is the,
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  the bezel around the screen.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  Right. Right.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  So that's over. Yeah.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  You've got like this inch thick frame around the screen,
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  and that the only part that is black glass or plastic, I guess,
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  it's not glass, but, you know, shiny black screen is the screen.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  Whereas on the Mac Book Pros,
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  they've got this, to me, much more modern look,
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  which looks like it matches the phone, it matches the iPad,
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  it matches the iMac, which goes edge to edge now,
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  matches the current displays,
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  where the whole front surface is black glass,
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  or black shiny screen material,
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  and then not all of it is actually screen pixels,
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  but it's just surrounded by, you know, black screen.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  It strikes me as a kind of thing that they've learned so much
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  since then with the iPhone and with the other Macs,
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  that there's a lot of improvements they could make if they were,
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  you know, redesigning the laptop from scratch today.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  Yeah, my, my guess, though, is that they're waiting for retina errors to update that,
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  because they just came out last month with new Macbook errors.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  Yeah, I don't think they're going to.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  And they're, you know, they're, they're, you know,
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  latest CPU kit from Intel and et cetera, et cetera,
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  but it's, you know, what we call in the business a speed bump update,
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  not a major update,
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  but given that it just came out last month,
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  I can't imagine they're going to go retin a soon.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  And I can't, therefore, I think that when they do go retin,
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  they'll get the modern look where the whole front when you open it up is black.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  Yeah, unless they introduce that as a new line,
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  which they kind of did with the retina pro,
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  because they kept the older pro around, who knows,
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  now this is silly.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  Well, I, that's the sort of thing.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  That's quite, I mean, if they did it with the pros, they could do it.
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  They could do whatever they want, right?
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  But I kind of think they wouldn't,
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.000]  because it seems to me that that sort of bifurcation of the product line,
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  you can do it with a device that's pro,
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  and you kind of can't with the air,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  because the air is just sort of the default.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  The air is, you walk in the Apple store,
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  and they say, how can I help you?
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  And you say, I want to get a laptop.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  They're going to, you know, the odds are pretty good.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  They're coming out with a 13 inch MacBook Air.
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  Yeah.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  Because it's just the default.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  It's the one that's the, it's cheaper, you know,
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  and I know that the pros have gotten it.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's crazy if you remember how much power books used to cost back in the day.
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  Oh, yeah.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It's crazy that you can get a 13 inch MacBook Pro
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  with a retina display for $12.99, I think,
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  the starting prices, which is crazy.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  But $9.99 is a lot less than $12.99.
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  You know, you're talking 25% less.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Yeah. More than 25%, right?
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.000]  Yeah.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  And when you add 100 bucks or tax or whatever, it's, you know, you know,
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  and it's that there's, you know, there's, it's just one of those,
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  all those, every time you go up a digit,
[44:17.000 --> 44:18.000]  it's a magic price.
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.000]  Like $9.99 is a lot less than $1,000 in people's minds.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  Yeah.
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  In real life.
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  Which is lovely.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  In real life, it's a dollar.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  A penny if it, if you charge the 99 cents,
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  but it just feels, it just feels like it's cheaper.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  So are you shipping a new Vesper by WWDC this year?
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  How do it, it could be any day.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  Okay.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  Cause I remember that's when you launched last year, right?
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  Yeah.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  I, if, if we were approved, I would tell you right now,
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  but we're not, but it should be knock on wood.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  If everything goes through, it should be before WWDC.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  It should be well before WWDC last year was, it was pretty tight.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  And this, but this is not the sync update,
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  or maybe you shouldn't tell me what it is.
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  Uh, I'll tell you, don't tell anybody else though.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  All right.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  It is the sync update.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  Oh, wow.
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  Okay.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  Well, we were.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  Uh, let me take another break before we keep going.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  Um, and tell you about our second sponsor.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  And it's our good friend.
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  Good friends at Linda.com.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  Linda.com helps you learn and keep up to date with your software.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  Pick up brand new skills.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  Explore new hobbies with their easy to follow video tutorials.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  So whether you want to learn to develop apps,
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  I want to learn to program websites, pick up a programming language
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  like Objective C, or something more creative.
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  You want to learn how to, you've got like a really good digital camera,
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  but all you do is just turn it on and press the button and you never do
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  anything with it.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  You want to learn how, how, how can you learn to be a good amateur photographer?
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  They've got videos for that.
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  They have over 2,400 courses taught by industry experts.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  More are added weekly.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  Uh, and one low monthly price.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  25 bucks a month.
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  It gets you unlimited access to the entire Linda.com library.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  To me, that's key to the whole thing because you don't have to think,
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  uh, it's two bucks for this video or three bucks for this video.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  I don't know if it's going to be worth it.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  Because I have to spend the three bucks to do it.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  You just sign up for a Linda.com account.
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  It's unlimited.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  Start watching the video.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  If it is what you want, you've got it.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  If it's not, stop it and go back.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  Keep looking until you find the one you do want.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  Uh, all of their courses are produced at the highest quality,
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  really high production level.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  Really good talented teachers.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  So it's not at all like it's like the polar opposite of the homemade
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  videos you find on YouTube.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  Uh, where anybody, it's a crap shoot, whether it's going to help you,
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  whether the person actually knows what they're talking about,
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  whether the video is actually technically even any good.
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  Uh, courses are broken down into bite size pieces.
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.000]  So whether you have 15 minutes or 15 hours, you can learn at your own pace on your own terms.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  Uh, great deal.
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  Really great videos.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  I guess at 2400 of them, it's just unbelievable.
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  Uh, and, and everything from technical stuff to creative stuff.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  Great. They've been all around for a long time.
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  Here's the best part.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  I've got to deal with them for the sponsorship of this show,
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.000]  where you have access to their entire library free for seven days.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  So sign up for seven days,
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  watches many of these videos as you want.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  And they're, that's how sure they are that you'll sign up afterwards.
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  How do you do that?
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  Go to linda.com.
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  L-Y-N-D-A dot com slash the talk show.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  You'll get seven days free, the whole library unlocked.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  And if yours anything like that, you're curious about one to learn,
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  It's great, great stuff.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  My thanks to linda.com.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  So will you mention your surface pro review or first look?
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  This is not, yeah, not a review.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  Well, let's take a step back though.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  So, so since last year on the talk show,
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  you've picked up a new gig.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  You're now, I don't know, forget your title,
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  but you're like the new technology columnist at Quartz.
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  Yes, this started a week ago.
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  I'm the tech editor at Quartz, which means I'll be writing
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  several posts a week, probably one a day,
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  maybe a little more than that, maybe less depending on the news flow.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  And then also building out a team of journalists around the world,
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  actually.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  That's one of the really cool things about Quartz,
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  which I guess I should explain what Quartz is.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  It's a relatively new business news site
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  owned by the Atlantic that started in 2012.
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.000]  And their whole thing is that it is what, you know,
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  they sat down and they said,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  if you were starting a business news site in 2012,
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  what would it be?
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  Well, it would be designed first for phones and tablets
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  and less for a desktop computer,
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  because it doesn't talk show during Fireball.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  Well, I'm sorry, keep going down.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  Because that's where people will be reading it.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  It'll be global because people fly around a lot
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  and real business leaders are thinking about what's going on
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  and Asia just as much as what's going on at home.
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.000]  And it'll have new forms of advertising
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  and I've never really, I've never seen in the history
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  of the site any standard banner ads on the site.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  They do these special custom kind of big ads
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  that work for a mobile site and for a desktop site.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  So it's really cool.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  The staff is pretty small.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  It's really smart people there.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  The editor-in-chief is this guy, Kevin Delaney,
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  who was at the Wall Street Journal for a long time
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  and was one of their leading tech journalists there.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  So I was not looking for a job.
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  I've been working on my startup city notes for a long time now
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  and we're going to be shipping a brand new app
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  in the next few months that could be a big thing someday.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  But when the existing tech editor from Quartz left
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  recently for the Wall Street Journal,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  I emailed Kevin and said,
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  hey man, let's get together and talk
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  because I've long been a huge fan of the site.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  I think they do really cool stuff.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  One of the really interesting things there
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  is that they have a team of engineers
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  that sit in the newsroom and work with journalists
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  and our journalists themselves
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  and make little apps and interactive stories
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  and tools for the newsroom to either do reporting
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  or to tell stories.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  Like we have a chart building tool
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  that was made by one of the Quartz engineers
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  for the Quartz newsroom.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  So it's really cool.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  If you were taking all the elements of a news organization
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  and creating them from scratch in this era,
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.000]  it's a really good representation of that.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  So I'm really excited to join the team.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  I have not been writing much lately,
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  so I'm quite rusty,
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  but I post it a few things last week,
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  and I hope you'll all follow me there.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  It's a very simple URL designed for the mobile era.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  It's qz.com.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  The element Quartz, I believe.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Is that there?
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  It's been a while since the periodic table.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  But it's really cool.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  I'm really happy to be there.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  I'll be covering the same stuff that I did
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  on my old site's flat F, which is Apple, Microsoft Google,
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  kind of big tech mobile.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  And I'll hopefully get to do some travel as well,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  looking up cool stories around the world
[52:07.000 --> 52:12.000]  that most desk-bound tech sites aren't really touching.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  They do.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  They Quartz has been interesting to me ever since it debuted,
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  and it's cooler for me that somebody who I know
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  like you is going to be writing there.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  But they've always had good stuff.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  They've always had an interesting design
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  where it doesn't really look like anybody else's stuff.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  They were really early to me on that infinite scroll,
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  where when you get to the end of an article
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  and instead of a bottom of the page,
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  they just sort of algorithmically predict,
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  well, this might be something else you're interested in.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  You can close the window if you want,
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  but if you want to keep scrolling down,
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  here's another article.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Yeah, and that's, you know, for better or worse,
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  I think it works really great on mobile when, you know,
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  hey, if you're still connected to the network,
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  here's something else to read.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  Sometimes at the computer, it's a little frustrating
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  because you want to share the previous story
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  that you'd read, and then all of a sudden you're at the next one.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  But they've written, you know, again,
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  they have engineers in the newsroom,
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  so they're making changes in real time
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  as they decide whether something's working or not.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Well, that reminds me of Adrian Holovati.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  You know, Adrian Holovati?
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  Here's another name.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  I don't know.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  A co-creator of the Django Python framework
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  and a bunch of other stuff from Chicago,
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  but he's been on, I mean, longer than anybody.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  It may be even close to a decade,
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  but at least from my 2006, 2007,
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.000]  on programming as journalism, you know,
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  that it's now that the output device
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  for so much journalism is a computer,
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  that it's not a piece of paper with ink on it,
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  and it's not a TV screen getting something broadcast
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  to millions of people,
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  identically, that it's this device that can compute,
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  that it's almost criminal not to take advantage of it.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  You can't just hire, you're not can't,
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  but the way to take advantage of it
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  is not just to hire programmers to build you a CMS
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  and then they go away and you just sit there
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  and type text into it and paste pictures into it,
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  but that they're a full-time part of the team.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  In the same way that a TV studio,
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  a TV news, is always going to have cameramen.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  That website should always have programmers.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  Yeah.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  And that you wouldn't, the same way
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  that you wouldn't get rid of cameramen at a TV station,
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  you know, you wouldn't just have them come in at the beginning
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  and set the cameras up in the studio
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  and say, here's the angles they should be at.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  Now you're on your own, just hit this button
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  when you want the camera to record.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  You know, you wouldn't want it,
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  you don't want to dismiss the programmers
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  after they've built the system.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  No, and I think like having worked in a few newsrooms now,
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  there are, in many organizations,
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  there tends to be a combative relationship between product
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  and the journalist because, you know,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  sure, every CMS has flaws.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  So if you're just sitting around and ragging on this crappy CMS,
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  you know, you're probably not thinking
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  the nicest thoughts about the people who made it for you.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  And often are, you know, trashing them.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Whereas if they're sitting next to you
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  and you are working on stuff together,
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  it's a really cool opportunity.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  It's also made me personally realize
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  that I need to learn to code too.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  You know, I've been programming websites since the mid 90s,
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  so I know in HTML and later CSS,
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  since, you know, since it was a thing,
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  but I never took the dive into kind of more advanced stuff.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  And now I realize, especially the last six months,
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  working with my friend Mark Dorison on city notes,
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  kind of feeling like a helpless loser,
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  not being able to help out with building our iOS stuff.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  So I know it's going to take a lot of time,
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  and it's kind of corny, but in this era,
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  it feels like coding skills are almost like freedom.
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  So that's one of the things I'm going to spend some of my spare time on now.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  I've already started actually.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  I don't want to abuse the metaphor,
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  but I'll compare it to camera work again,
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  where, you know, there was a time when it was so comp,
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  you know, in the film days,
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  when you had so much going on,
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  just to take pictures where, you know,
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  not many people learned to take photographs,
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  but now everybody has cameras with them all the time.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  And not that everybody is going to be a pro photographer,
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  and not that you are going to become a top notch developer,
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  but it's like you should have, you know,
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  everybody should have a basic fluency in it, you know,
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  to be able to write a little code,
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  and everybody should learn a little bit,
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  so you can take a decent picture.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  Like maybe...
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  Oh, yeah.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  Well, you know, you're out, you're a journalist,
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  you see something, you should be able to get as good a photograph
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  as your, you know, your iPhone is capable of taking.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  I think also the mobile era, you know,
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  has a lot to do with it, at least for me,
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  because back in the day, like I would buy,
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  oh boy, I bought, like,
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  a student edition of, was a code warrior,
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  where was the old, you know,
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  and I tried learning that.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  I bought books like Learn C on the Macintosh,
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  and it just works.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Yeah, right.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  And it never took.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Like I never got past Hello World,
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  in part because, you know,
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  it's sit there in my desk and think,
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  well, if I could make a Mac app,
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  what would I make?
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  I'm not going to make like an email client
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  or something like that.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  So, and then the web came out,
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  so I just kind of started goofing around on the web,
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  but now in the iPhone era, like,
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  I have an unlimited list of cool apps
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  that I would want to make.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  And, and so one of the things that,
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  that has kind of stuck with me over the last week
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  is I've been starting to learn JavaScript,
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  just kind of getting my feet wet,
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  is it's strange and unfortunate
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  that there is no kind of iPad native programming environment.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  And maybe I'm totally missing it,
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  but I've never heard of one that's,
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  has any traction or has any acclaim.
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.000]  And, you know, I,
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  so I'm like, you know,
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  starting with these programming lessons
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  and I have to sit at my computer at a desk.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Yeah, I mean, it feels weird in this.
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  Okay.
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.000]  See, I don't know about that.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  CODEA.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  Definitely worth checking out.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  Okay.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  Cool.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  I forget the one.
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  This wouldn't be good for you.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  It's more for kids.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  There's a great one for kids
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  that Jonas has on his iPad.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Cool. It's less code and a little bit more visual.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  CODEA is probably one worth checking out.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  People who are out there, send us Twitter,
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  send it, hit us up on Twitter.
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  Yeah, from Dom on Twitter is my Twitter handle.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  Let me know what I should be doing.
[58:48.000 --> 58:49.000]  All right.
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  And it's a good question.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  Any new tips.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  But, you know,
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  and this is one of the things I cover
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  during the day is the post-PC shift.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  Like I did an article this week at Quartz
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  about tablet sales
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  are actually on pace to match PC sales this year
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  or at least come very close.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  And by next year, far surpassed them.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  But you still can't make a tablet app on a tablet.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  Yeah.
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  Well, and that's the problem that CODEA ran into.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  It's out.
[59:22.000 --> 59:23.000]  You get it.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  But they've run into a lot of hassle
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  with the App Store in terms of
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  like you can do the interpreting code
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  or something.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  Well, I think that they're using JavaScript.
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  There's a rule that you're not supposed
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  to include a third party interpreter.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  But if you want to have interpreted code,
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  you could use WebKit's JavaScript
[59:42.000 --> 59:43.000]  and have at it.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  But you can't.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  They wanted to have it where you could maybe
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  like save your sample project.
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  And then I could download your sample project
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.000]  and run it in CODEA.
[59:52.000 --> 59:53.000]  But then all of a sudden,
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  that runs a file of the, hey,
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  are you distributing apps?
[59:57.000 --> 59:58.000]  Yeah.
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.000]  You make a game in CODEA.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  And then you send me the game thing
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  and now I can open it in my CODEA
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  and I have a new game running
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  and I didn't get it through the App Store.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  And so that was like,
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  so I forget all the crazy hoops
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  they have to jump through.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  But it makes it all,
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  it's all worse for the overall experience
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  for the benefit of Apple's control
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  overall app distribution.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  And there are constraints,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  like typing in stuff on an iPad
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  is kind of annoying still and I get it.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  But it would be cool if either Apple
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  or a third party were to come out
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  with a fairly sophisticated,
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  yet iPad-designed coding environment.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Yeah.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Remember when we were doing it, right?
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Remember when we were kids
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  and we would get magazines with programs in them.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  Right?
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  It would be like, you know,
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  here's a program that, you know,
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  here's a simple one.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  But you could write this in ten lines or, you know,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  three lines of basic, you know.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  But, you know, enter your weight on Earth.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Here's what you weigh on the Moon
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  and here's what you would weigh on Jupiter.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  And then you would type it into your, you know,
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  your Apple II or your TI-9948 and basic.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  And then you'd save it
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  and then you'd type run the name of the program
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  and it would run.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  But to duplicate these programs,
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  they were printed in magazines
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  and you'd sit the magazine next to the computer
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  and type them in.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  And that's how I learned of a lot of HTML, actually,
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  from the Net Magazine teaching me like tables
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  and that kind of stuff.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  You know, and it's crazy that when,
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  when now that we've invented things like the internet
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  and copy and paste and downloading and stuff like that,
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  that that's sort of how you have to use CODIA
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  because they don't want you to distribute things
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  that you just tap and open and run.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And so you're stuck retyping all this stuff.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  It's, you know, but anyway, it's worth checking out.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Yep.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Yeah, and I remember actually, I think Google
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  made some sort of very simple Android,
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  you know, like almost drag and drop programming tool,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  but I don't think it took off.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And they probably shut it down.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  You know what?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  That's an interesting point
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  because Android doesn't have the iron-fisted control
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  over executing code that by design,
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  not like it's, you know,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  it's a weakness.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  This is a difference of opinion.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  You know, so you could buy a Nexus
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  and, you know, stock app, you know,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  this is the stock Google Android device.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Next is whatever the latest phone is.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  And you can go into settings and say allow, you know,
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  applications from third parties.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And then it'll say, you sure this is, you know,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  could open you up to security problems.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  You say, don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  And then you can install apps from anywhere.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And you, you know, with no developer signing
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and stuff like that, you can just install apps on your device.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  So there's an opportunity there
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  where they could have something like a sort of next generation
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  hypercard, right?
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  I mean, that's what everybody always comes back to.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  They come back to hypercard because hypercard,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  and the reason people keep coming back to hypercard
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  is that hypercard when people, you know,
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  if, if, if, I don't know what the percentage
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  of people who can program is, let's just ballpark
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  and say 5% of people if they want to
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  can program like an objective C apps, probably lower than that.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  I would say less than one.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  Yeah, let's say, all right.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Let's be more realistic.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  That's, let's say 1% of people have that, that aptitude.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And it's a combination of ability and desire
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  because it's so hard and complicated.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  You just can't make yourself do it unless you're driven to do it.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  And absolutely.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  You know, hypercard was a thing where way more,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  maybe 5% of people who looked at hypercard
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  and had ideas for a little thing they could program
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  or, you know, if you click a button, this happens
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  and you could click this button and then you'd have a list
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  of things that you could drag and drop to rearrange.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  That there was way more people who could just look at it,
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  get it, and, and not in terms of intelligence,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  I think entirely, although part of it is clearly intelligence,
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  but it's also that, that level of obsession
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  where if it was so much easier to do it
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  and you didn't have to commit so much
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  and learn at such a low level,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  you'd be willing to do it.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  You'd be willing to try.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  You know, a little less abstract.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  It's not, you know, a text editor with gibberish in it.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  There's a lot more visual aspects.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  It just removed a lot of friction.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And it just, and the lack of friction would encourage
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  more people to try it.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  In the same way that digital photography,
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  you know, ultimately, the best pictures we take,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  are they any better than the best pictures
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  that were taken 50, 60 years ago?
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  No.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  But way more pictures are being taken period
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  because there's so much less friction.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You just turn on these simple devices
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  and exposure is computed automatically.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  You know, the, the, the aperture is computed automatically
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  and its friction is removed.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  And so people do it.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  And that's what hypercard was.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  Hypercard was like a point and shoot camera for programming.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And there's nothing.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Well, let's get that for iOS.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  So if Phil Schiller, if you're listening,
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  I'll help you out with this.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  We'll, we'll do it.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Yeah, I think, and I think people, you know,
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  people have tried stuff like that.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  And I think sometimes people maybe get caught up
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  because they want to boil the ocean all at once
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and they think, well, let's not just do iOS.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Let's do iOS and Android.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  And let's have it run in web browser too
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  so that anybody you could open it.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  I say start simple and maybe, you know, do that,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  but get, do it and have it just run on the iPad, right?
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And then worry about, worry about other things next.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Get it running on the iPad and then expand to the iPhone
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  and then think about Android and then, you know,
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  but get it running one place at first.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Anyway, I think Google has an opportunity
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  that to do something Apple couldn't
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  because Google could build a thing like that
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  and not worry about the distribution of these, you know,
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  the in hypercard parlance, the stacks, right?
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  Hypercard was the app and it ran stacks.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Whatever you want to call them, but, you know,
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  that you, they could allow people to distribute these things
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  to other Android users and not, they don't care
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  if you're not going through the Play Store anymore.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Totally.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Yeah, and I think they started to try it,
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  but then they, I don't know what happened with that.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  The weird thing that they made, maybe it was just too simple.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  I mean, I think it was a typical Google thing
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  where somebody, you know, some three people built the thing
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  and there was never really anything behind it
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  and they were like, well, ship it, you know, who cares?
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  And then nobody ever even remembers it anymore.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Yeah, and the Mac kind of has that with Automator,
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  but that's, you know, well, not really.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  That's not even close to Hypercard.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  But I remember in the early automator days,
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  actually my friend ran a site called Automator World,
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  which was, you know, a community of Automator recipes
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  or whatever they were called.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  And that was pretty cool.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Automator's cool and AppleScript still remains, you know,
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  it's alive and well, but it's not thriving.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Right.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  No, not at all.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  You know, but, you know, there's little signs of health for it
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  like, for example, I mean, the biggest sign of health
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  for AppleScript to me is that when the new versions
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  of iWork apps came out, the new pages numbers and keynote
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  with this unified file format across iOS and the web
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  and the Mac apps and they took out all these, you know,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  all these features that were in the Mac were gone
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  because they'd solidified the whole platform
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  on this common denominator of features.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  AppleScript was gone.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  But in the months since they've brought it back.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  I don't think that they've brought entirely back,
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  but it's mostly back, you know, that most of the things
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  you could do in AppleScript and those apps
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  before you can do again.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  You know, it wasn't enough of a priority to be there
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  in their initial release, but it's enough of a priority
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  that they got to it before the end of the year.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Yeah, that's good.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Do you buy into the concept of multi-view, you know,
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  two apps, two up apps on iOS?
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Because I've been playing with that surface.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Let's hold that.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Let me do the third sponsor.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Okay.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Let's combine that with that for iOS combined with the surface.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Okay.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Third sponsor.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Final sponsor of the show.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Great, great company.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Harries.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  What is Harries provide?
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  They provide men's shaving goods.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  So the team behind Harvies is there.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  I think one of the founders is one of the guys from Warby Parker.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  The eyeglass people.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Also a sponsor of the show.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  Same basic idea though.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Warby Parker's thing was, why in the world are prescription eyeglasses
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  so crazy expensive?
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  The team with Harvies is like, why is it cost so much to buy
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  razor blades to shave?
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Why is this stuff so crazy expensive?
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Well, it doesn't have to be.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  So what they've done is they've gone right to the source.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  They're making, they even make their own razor blades.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  They purchased a 93 year old German factory that makes precision
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  engineered German engineered razor blades.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  So they're making their own blades.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  They're not just like white labeling something that they're buying,
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  you know, from some abandoned factory or something.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  They're making brand new blades.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Brand new razors to hold them.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Really cool, stylish stuff.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Really good equipment.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And it gets shipped right to your door.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  They focus on providing men with a great shaving experience
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  for a fraction of the price of the big name competitors.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  At least half the price of other brand name razor blades.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Better product design.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  Less, but better.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  None of these fancy, you know, no fake chrome and stuff like that.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  Plastic stuff.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  You just go take a look at their stuff and you'll see what I mean.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  It's classic design, not like the fake good design like you see
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  from the Gillette or the other companies like that.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Easy convenience.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  You don't have to go to a drug store where all the shaving stuff
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  is blocked behind a cabinet because people shop lifted or something like that.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  You just order online and it shows up at your door.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  So you don't have to go out.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  I don't want to go out buying stuff like that.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Really good.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  They've sent me a kit when they first signed on as a sponsor.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And I've used it great stuff.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  It's, you know, it's good shaving cream.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Good, good razor blades.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Great stuff.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  So what do you do?
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  How do you take advantage of this?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Well, they have a promo code, talk show, T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  That's the promo code.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And here's the offer.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Use that promo code and you save five bucks off your first purchase.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Now the prices are already low.

[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  They have a $15 kit that gives you a handle.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Three sets of blades and shave cream.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  That's a great deal.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  It's everything you need to get started.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  15 bucks.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  And they even have a custom engraving option if you want to get your initials
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  under razor or if you want to give it as a gift.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Father's Day is coming up.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  God, it seems like a no-brainer.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  So my thanks to Harries, go to Harries.com
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  and remember the promo code, talk show.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Know the, just talk show.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  So my thanks to them.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  The other Harries guy, the non-warby Parker guy,
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  is an old friend of mine.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Oh, really?
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Yeah, his wife married me.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  She not married me.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  She officiated our wedding.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  There is a big difference.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  There is a big difference.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Yeah, he was there too.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  It was cool.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Well, that's actually, you know, that's not like a,
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  hey, I met him the one time.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  That's actually like the guy was there for an important,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  you know, he's a good guy.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  That's a really neat company that is smartly vertically
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  integrated.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Much like Warby Parker.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And a massive industry full of a bunch of clowns.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  So I hope they do really well.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Yeah, I love all these stories of people who are getting into
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  hardware of anything.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And, and, and I feel like there's so many opportunities.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  You know, our whole generation,
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  we were all digital for so long,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  and the web was such an eye opener.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  And we all built website and spent, you know,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  first decade, two decades of our professional careers,
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  shipping ones and zeros.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  And it was awesome.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And I still, you know,
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  everything I do is still mostly ones and zeros, right?
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Vespers digital.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Daring fireballs digital,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  even the show is digital,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  although not entirely.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  And I'll get back to that.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  But I just love these people who are taking the same sort of,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  let's just stay lean and mean and vertically integrated,
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  and not have the waste of like a proctor and gamble,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  gazillion head count conglomerate,
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  totally behind it.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Let's, let's take this thing and let's just do it right.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Let's, you know,
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  let's start without all the baggage and do it right.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And ultimately it ends up being cheaper for the consumer
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  and it's in many cases better.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  I feel like, you know, it's like,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  it's like something that nobody really imagined,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  but like, to me,
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  going down the consumer aisles and like a drug store
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  or like a target if you're in that, you know,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  like shopping for deodorant or toothpaste
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  or shaving cream or something like that.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Like 40 or 50 years ago,
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  it would look like something out of science fiction,
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  like the way that when you go to buy crest,
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  you have to choose between literally like 12 or 15 kinds
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  of crest, you know,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  it used to be switched between crest and cold game.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And they were the rivals and then like they've,
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  they've gotten into this race to take up shelf space
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  and the only way they'll get the shelf space
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  is if they have a bunch of varieties.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  So they have like 20 each other own isle at this point.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  Yeah, 20 different kinds of crest to choose from
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  or edge shaving gel.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  There's 17 kinds of it.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And like, I don't, I mean, I don't know which one to get.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  I mean, I'm not an expert on it.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Like I like these startups that are, you know,
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  it's like, here look, here's good shave cream.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Here it is.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Harries.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Yeah, there's one flavor.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Yeah, here it is.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  And it's good.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Here it is.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And that's it.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I do.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I love it.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Anyway, I mean it.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  I know they're a sponsor.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I am literally getting paid to tell you to go check them out.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  But I mean it.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  It's what I love about the show
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  and doing this and getting these sponsors like this
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  is that to me they're doing fascinating and great work.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  But that's actually and not to, you know,
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  plug your show, but that's part of,
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  of doing that right is actually being in the right place
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  to promote your company.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  I mean, I mean,
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Proctor and Gamble to my knowledge is not sponsoring tech podcast.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  But if I wanted to reach the types of people that, you know,
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  load up Amazon and drop 100 bucks on nonsense,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  that that would be a good place to start.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Tablets.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  So you were at the surface announcement?
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  It was very strange.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  I was, it was like one of the first emails I got to my new
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  courts address was, hey, do you want to come to this surface
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  thing next week?
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  And I said, yeah, sure.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  And I didn't even know what it was.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  I thought I had no idea.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Like I didn't realize it was the unveiling
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  of a new surface.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Like I didn't realize that.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Because you're not as tuned into that world as you are the
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Apple world where.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  No.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Right.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  And they're not on that regular schedule that Apple has.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Right.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  And it's a New York and it's a Tuesday.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  I don't know.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  So I just wasn't expecting that.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  And then I showed up and they're like,
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  here's the new surface.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  And here's one to take with you.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  And it was, it was interesting.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  So maybe you want to take with you.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Yeah.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  I got, I have one.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  It's in my desk at the office.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I don't have a here in front of me.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  But it was, and you know,
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Sacha Nadella, the new CEO,
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  Microsoft was there.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  He kicked off the event.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  And what he said sounded good actually,
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  which was, you know,
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  I had seen Balmer and Gates speak a few times
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  at various things.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  And it always seemed like a lot of puffed up.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Kind of corporate speak.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  And, and Sacha actually sounded more human.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  And, you know, what he said was smart.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  That they're making these devices.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  That every single product has to fit into their cloud strategy
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  and all this stuff.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And then the guy who came on and kind of demoed the hardware
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  was kind of a bozo.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  And they were making all these really stupid jokes
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  about Joanna Stern, the new Wall Street Journal reviewer.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  I don't know if you watched the video.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  It was just really awkward and not, not funny at all.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  I didn't watch the video,
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  but I was following along on Twitter.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  And I got the gist that they were making,
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  they were referencing Joanna a lot.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Yeah. And it was kind of funny the first time,
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  but then they did it like four more times.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Can you imagine like, you know, Phil Schiller
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  stopping an Apple keynote,
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  four times to rib Walt Mossberg about something?
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Right.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  Or me, right?
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  What if he did it to me, right?
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Hey, John, remember that post you wrote?
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  Right.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  And maybe once is kind of funny.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  And I guess it's because Joanna,
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.600]  who she was just on the show a couple of months ago,
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:48.400]  but talking about these issues with tablets and laptops
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:50.600]  and metabolites, it was right after she had done,
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:53.320]  I'm sure this is why they referenced her is that she's done.
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:57.000]  She's been on this beat for a couple of years now of,
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.680]  you know, what's the ideal form factor for like a one and a half,
[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:03.000]  one to two pound portable computer
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.800]  that you're going to do real work on?
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:05.600]  Is it a tablet?
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:07.000]  If so, how do you put it in your lap?
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:07.800]  How do you get a keyboard?
[1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:08.800]  How do you type fast?
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:10.800]  If it's not, if it's a laptop, you know,
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:11.800]  does it have a touch screen?
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.320]  What, what, where is this going?
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:14.600]  She's written a lot about it.
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:15.600]  And she's done.
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:19.880]  It's fantastic work reviewing a wide variety of stuff.
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:21.600]  So I'm sure that's why.
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:24.000]  Yeah, I think she came from reviewing laptops.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.240]  So she has probably, you know, if not the best,
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:31.120]  one of the best kind of histories in her brain
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:33.280]  of the evolution of these devices.
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:34.120]  Right.
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.880]  So it makes sense that they would reference her during a keynote,
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:38.960]  I suppose once.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:42.880]  But then, I don't know, it was, it was very weird.
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:44.960]  I think I tweeted something like Microsoft,
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:47.200]  you're still so Microsoft or something like that.
[1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:48.200]  Right. And she was there.
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:49.920]  She, that's, is there in the front row?
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:53.000]  And she had, she was curious why she was in the front row.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:54.160]  And then she found out why.
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:57.400]  It's because she was part of the, part of the play.
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:18:59.200]  She like went to take like a regular sheet in the middle.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:01.360]  And they're like, no, no, no, yeah, right.
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:02.560]  Down in front, Joanna.
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:05.440]  Yeah. So some of the stuff they did was actually kind of funny.
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:09.040]  Like, you know, they made, they kind of self-deprecating comment
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.360]  about how everybody in the audience was typing on a MacBook Air.
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:18.440]  But then, I don't know, then I kind of dragged along
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:21.760]  and then I grabbed my surface and got out of there.
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:24.360]  Yeah, that's funny.
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:27.880]  That's like an interesting, I saw, and they definitely,
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:30.160]  I definitely noticed that they made a joke about the fact
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:34.640]  that the MacBook Air is like stock issue
[1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:37.840]  for mid, I don't know what we call this decade.
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:42.840]  The 10s, you know, in the 10s, tech journalists have MacBook Airs.
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:45.440]  It's just, it's just ridiculous.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:47.240]  What percentage?
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:50.040]  And that, you know, most of my press events are Apple events,
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:53.240]  but even that like build when I was a build that, you know,
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.040]  in the press room, not everybody.
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:58.480]  And clearly there's a lot of Windows devices in the build press room.
[1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:01.360]  But there was a crazy amount of MacBook Airs too.
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:02.040]  Crazy, yeah.
[1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:05.040]  And at this thing, it was pretty much all max.
[1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:11.720]  I rarely see Windows PCs in my life, which is kind of funny.
[1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:13.960]  But, good life, I guess.
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:17.560]  The thing to remember is that journalists, most of them,
[1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:19.360]  are on a tight deadline.
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:22.560]  You know, they've got to file, if they're there today
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:24.800]  to cover the Microsoft Surface event,
[1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:29.120]  they've got to have something ready to go pretty soon after the end.
[1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:30.800]  And a lot of people now,
[1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:33.560]  most sites now, they're taking photos and they're putting photos in.
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:37.720]  And there's, it's more than just typing in a text area field and hitting a button.
[1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:40.640]  There's, you know, a CMS production system.
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:47.880]  And, you know, you kind of need your, you know, I don't test that many devices,
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:48.960]  but a lot of people do.
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:51.560]  But in terms of actually doing the work of covering the event,
[1:20:51.560 --> 1:20:54.000]  you want your go-to trusty.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.240]  This is my thing.
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.760]  And it's got all the apps I need to, you know,
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:03.240]  get into the CMS to, you know, format this the way I want to format it,
[1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.200]  to get the photos into where the photos go in the CMS,
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.040]  so I can put them in the article and all this.
[1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:12.840]  And for most of the people working today, it's a MacBook Air.
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:16.320]  Totally, and, you know, especially if you're carrying it around,
[1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:20.840]  the Air is an amazing portable computer.
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:28.720]  So then, you know, the Microsoft's argument seems to be that a tablet,
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:33.520]  with a keyboard, is better than a laptop.
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:35.840]  Because, and then they have different on, you know,
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:39.480]  one was that it's lighter than a MacBook Air, which I don't,
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:42.880]  I don't, when you put that big keyboard thing on there,
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:44.400]  it's, I don't think it's lighter.
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:45.400]  I don't know.
[1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:48.000]  Well, their comparison, and this is, to me, it's,
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.360]  everybody called this out, is that their weight comparison
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:56.960]  was the uncovered surface compared to the MacBook Air,
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.440]  which has an attached cover.
[1:21:58.440 --> 1:22:03.480]  And if the 13-inch, six-year-old MacBook Air
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:08.360]  versus the, you know, brand new, uncovered, 12-inch.
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:12.320]  Well, the fact that the design is six years old, doesn't,
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:14.680]  that's fair game.
[1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.360]  Oh, yeah, I mean, it's still shipping, right.
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:18.840]  And it's, they just came out with new ones last month, you know.
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:23.800]  Right. That's fair game, but I, it just doesn't seem
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.680]  like a fair comparison to say, here's this device
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:30.280]  where a big part of it is that we've built this great cover
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:32.680]  with a keyboard and a great, a much improved
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:34.360]  over last year's trackpad.
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:36.840]  And then when we compare it to this device that has a built-in
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:39.560]  keyboard and trackpad, we're not going to put the cover on
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:41.240]  when we talk about the weight.
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:43.960]  Right. Yeah. So that's, I mean, and that's also the kind
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:46.760]  of thing like, okay, but in your backpack with a few other
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:50.200]  things, there's really, in use, I will say there's,
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:54.280]  there's no noticeable difference in, you know, how light
[1:22:54.280 --> 1:22:56.920]  one of those things feels next to the other one.
[1:22:56.920 --> 1:22:58.360]  And that's not even really the point.
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:02.440]  Like, weight is not really the deciding factor in this.
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:07.640]  It's, is this better for, and I guess they're straight up just
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:09.880]  going after people who are using this for work.
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:13.640]  Like, you know, if you're the kind of person who is doing work
[1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:16.520]  on a laptop, which is really the only thing I use my laptop
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:20.920]  now for is straight up work, is a tablet with a keyboard
[1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:25.240]  better, and it's still, to me, it just felt off.
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:28.760]  And I haven't used it much, and I, I really should use it more, but the idea
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:34.200]  of balancing this heavy screen, and with this lighter keyboard,
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:38.280]  that it's kind of attached to it, but not very rigid,
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:44.120]  just seems very awkward. I just, I would always rather have a laptop,
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:48.840]  and then, you know, for the stuff that I use a touch tablet for,
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:54.040]  have a separate tablet that is, you know, really designed for that,
[1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:59.160]  and, you know, hardware and software, and size, and all that sort of stuff.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:05.720]  Yeah. For weight to really matter, it has to be, like, a next level.
[1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:09.000]  I mean, it's, it's all a little arbitrary, but it's got to be like,
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  hey, this is actually like a game changer.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:16.280]  And an example I'll bring up is the MacBook Air, totally,
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:20.360]  where a year ago, when it was the iPad 3 and in the 4,
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:24.360]  and these were the, when the retina iPads still had the full bezel around the
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:27.800]  whole size. It doesn't matter. They were the same weight the 3 and the 4.
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:33.240]  Versus the first generation iPad Mini,
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:37.880]  it was like, wow, this one has, it's a lot faster, and it has a beautiful retina
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:41.240]  screen, but man, it's so much heavier than the Mini,
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:44.200]  which doesn't have a retina screen, and it's using your old,
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:48.680]  you know, it's system on a chip, but man, is it light?
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:52.040]  And it just seemed like a real easy,
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:55.720]  easier decision. You want to go lightweight and easier to carry around,
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:59.400]  or do you want to go beautiful screen, a little bit heavier?
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:02.680]  Whereas this year, with the air, it was so much lighter.
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:06.760]  Like, everybody who was at the original press event, you know,
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:09.960]  the last October for the iPad, everybody was like,
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:12.360]  geez, I don't know how to decide which one that he's to get now,
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:15.320]  because the air is so much lighter. It's,
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.720]  the whole reason I wanted a Mini in the first place was it was
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:20.840]  easy to hold in one hand, but this is easy to hold in one hand,
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:23.080]  because it was so much lighter than what it came before.
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:27.480]  The surface pro is not like that. The surface pro is over a pound, so it's,
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:32.040]  it's, you know, it's not heavy. It's not, right.
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:35.160]  It's not, and that's fine. I mean, it's, you know,
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:39.320]  I guess it's thinner than a laptop, and maybe a little lighter than one,
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:44.360]  but it's not the difference. To me, the best example is still actually
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:48.120]  the MacBook Air versus my old plastic MacBook,
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:51.560]  which was so heavy that I dreaded carrying it around,
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:55.320]  whereas the minute I got the 13 inch MacBook Air,
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:59.000]  it was the first computer I'd ever owned that I am happy just to take anywhere.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.120]  It never is annoying to carry it around.
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:05.880]  And there were other benefits too, like the battery life and that kind of stuff.
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:09.320]  But this, so this surface is not like that.
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:14.120]  And I don't know, again, I should use it more,
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:18.440]  and I'm not a Windows guy, so the OS is kind of foreign to me still.
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:25.080]  Although I did pop open Twitter and Internet Explorer side-by-side,
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:27.240]  and that was actually pretty cool. Like I would totally...
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.680]  So how does, how, what is the interface for, for putting two apps side-by-side,
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:35.000]  instead of taking over the full screen?
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:38.840]  I'm sure there is a way to do it, that is the actual way to do it,
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:42.600]  but in my case, it was poke around until it happened by accident.
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:48.280]  It's some secret gesture, like swiping in from one of the sides or something like that,
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:51.720]  which, again, I'm sure there's an actual right way to do it.
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:53.480]  I just haven't figured that out yet.
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:57.000]  See, that's my new aspect, and I wrote about this this week,
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.240]  because I'm not opposed to it.
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:02.920]  And there was, I got some pushback, but like I wrote something,
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.880]  I was like to put it in, you know, Randy in terms, Michael, to steal Michael Lop's Twitter stick.
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:13.960]  You say, I want to run two apps side-by-side on my iPad,
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:18.680]  and I hear, I want the iPad to become more complicated.
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:19.880]  Right.
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:22.440]  And that doesn't mean that I think that they shouldn't do it,
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:27.800]  or that they're not going to do it, but all I want to shine a light on is that if they do it,
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  no matter how clever it is, it will therefore make the iPad more complicated than it was before.
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.920]  Maybe justly so, maybe it's a good decision.
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:42.200]  You know, when the iPhone couldn't copy and paste, when you couldn't select text and copy and paste,
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:47.480]  adding that made the iPhone more complicated.
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:53.720]  And I think everybody would agree it was a complication for the better.
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:57.560]  Yes, it's more complicated, but it's better now, because it's just so essential.
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:02.200]  Maybe Apple will come up with something for side-by-side apps that we'll look at the same way,
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:06.680]  and it'll work for everybody, but to me, I think about it as a UI designer,
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:14.920]  and I can't think of anything that really is approachable that most people would use it.
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:19.640]  To me, the only things I can think of are something where you double-tap the home button
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:26.440]  to go into the multitasking thing, and then drag those little window versions
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.440]  that you see in the multitasking, somehow drag two of them together.
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.600]  And I just thought of that, too, independently, so maybe we're onto something there.
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.320]  Yeah, but I'm going to go out in a limb and say, it's only going to work for apps
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:41.640]  to explicitly support it, because it's a new experience.
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:43.800]  Half the screen is going to be a new experience.
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:48.440]  And what if it's an app that you ran a long time ago, the other one that you want on there?
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.200]  Right, and it's not updated.
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:54.680]  Right, how are they going to tell you, how are they going to suggest to you that this app is,
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:56.440]  you can select it?
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:57.880]  Ah, yeah, I don't know.
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:00.120]  Turn the other one's black and white, I don't know.
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:00.920]  Have them bounce?
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:05.640]  It's a complicated, complex question UI designer.
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:10.040]  I mean, it's kind of like how you join phone calls that are in session.
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:10.680]  Yeah.
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:15.320]  You can either put one on hold, start another one, and then join the two of those,
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:19.560]  or you can put one on hold and create a new one and then join them.
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:23.720]  But it's not that simple, because that's just kind of running audio,
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.560]  running in the background, whereas this is.
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:29.160]  If it takes three or four taps to get two of them together,
[1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:33.160]  you don't want to have it completely undone by just hitting the home button once
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:35.400]  to do something else, right?
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:39.640]  If you set this up and it's taken three or four taps and you've got your Twitter client running
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:40.840]  next to Safari.
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:46.760]  And oh, I got to check my ideal living room setup.
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:51.240]  Right, but I quick want to check my email, because there's a thing I want to copy and paste
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:54.440]  from the email to put into Safari and then you hit the home button,
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:57.080]  you don't want to have to rebuild that Twitter thing.
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:29:59.240]  You want to be able to somehow go back to it.
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:02.680]  And I don't know what that is, because the only thing you can go back to in iOS
[1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:04.120]  is we know it is an app.
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:09.960]  Right, and now in the surface, if I recall correctly, the way that that works is that it
[1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:15.640]  basically starts a third window and you can then decide where that third window goes
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:16.200]  if anywhere.
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:19.480]  I don't have it in front of me, so maybe that's a false memory,
[1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:21.320]  but that's what it seemed like.
[1:30:21.320 --> 1:30:26.360]  So, I know Mark Gurman said they're working on it, although he did not say that they're
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.400]  doing it for sure.
[1:30:27.400 --> 1:30:32.040]  It seems to me like he doesn't even have that much stuff this year in terms of what's for sure,
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:33.640]  other than the health book thing.
[1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:36.040]  So I wouldn't be surprised.
[1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:37.400]  I wouldn't like to bet on that.
[1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:39.960]  I wouldn't bet on seeing that next week.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:40.600]  Right.
[1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:50.840]  Yeah, I mean, I would like it if it were elegant, the Twitter on the iPad is the same with column
[1:30:51.640 --> 1:30:55.160]  that it should be on a phone and then it's taking up the rest of the screen.
[1:30:55.160 --> 1:31:01.160]  So it'd be really cool to have Twitter as like a side bar while I'm, you know,
[1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:04.840]  whatever, using Safari or email or anything like that.
[1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:09.800]  But, as you say, they'll have to do it in a way that it's elegant and makes sense,
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:13.160]  otherwise they're messing with their AWS.
[1:31:13.160 --> 1:31:17.960]  The other thing that they would be messing with, and Gurman acknowledges this in his report
[1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:22.680]  reason, I don't know, and there's no word on whether it would be for the full size iPad
[1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:27.240]  Air only or for the iPad Mini 2, but the thing is, just in terms of the physical,
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:31.960]  just physical size, half of the iPad Mini screen is not a lot of screen.
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:36.600]  Yeah, but in terms of pixels, it's the same as an Air, isn't it?
[1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:38.600]  No, I don't know.
[1:31:38.600 --> 1:31:41.880]  Yeah, yeah, in terms of pixels is the same, but now you're talking about a lot,
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:43.720]  you know, a very small physical space.
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:50.280]  And yet to date, the OS is exactly the same, pixel for pixel is exactly the same between the two.
[1:31:50.280 --> 1:31:53.800]  There's nothing you can do on the one on the air that you can't do on the other just because
[1:31:53.800 --> 1:31:54.360]  it's bigger.
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:57.960]  Everything is the pixel for pixel at the same, but I can't help but think that if you're going
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:02.440]  to split it in half, it may not work out as well.
[1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:05.480]  Yeah, that would be an interesting thing to do some mock-ups of.
[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:10.360]  I mean, and that was the most compelling thing to me about that surface is, wow, this is what
[1:32:10.360 --> 1:32:13.400]  a 12 inch touchscreen feels like this is kind of cool.
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:19.560]  Like I could see a big iPod, and that was kind of the angle of my piece about this was,
[1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.880]  hey, I could actually see a big iPad being useful.
[1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:27.800]  Like my kind of dream setup now would be a big iPad that I don't really take
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:34.120]  places, and then a big iPhone that kind of replaces my small iPad, but I don't, you know, now I'm
[1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:41.960]  just fantasy designing Apple hardware, which is not something that I'm probably supposed to be
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:43.960]  doing, but I'm excited for it though.
[1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:48.760]  I mean, just in terms of if it does come out, I can't help but think that the only
[1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:53.160]  if it is going to come out that they've got something really thoughtfully designed, because I don't
[1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:59.160]  think they're under any market pressure to do it, right? So Microsoft has been banging the drum
[1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:07.080]  for this sort of not technical multitasking, not computer science to two processes running
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:12.120]  on the same operating system at the same time, but visual multitasking, two things on screen
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:19.960]  at the same time, Twitter and a YouTube video or, you know, your email and a web browser on
[1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:25.400]  screen at the same time, you know, for my work, a web browser and Excel or something like that,
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:29.480]  so I could get data and spreadsheets at the same time.
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:34.760]  And it certainly hasn't Microsoft having gotten to it first two years ago, I guess, or a year and
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:39.560]  a half ago, hasn't really helped them make a dent put a dent in the tablet market, so it's not
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:46.440]  like Apple's under market pressure to do so. In the same way that they seem to be under
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:52.280]  market pressure to come out with a bigger iPhone. Right. And yeah, that's, you know, that there are
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.960]  people who are buying other brand phones because they want a bigger phone, you know, how big of that
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:04.520]  market, you know, how many people there are, you could argue about, but you inarguable that it's a
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:10.680]  number worth caring about. Totally. Whereas I don't see that for this multitasking on tablets,
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:15.640]  to me, they're not going to do it unless they have something clever. So I'm excited because if they
[1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:21.880]  show it, I feel like we're going to see something pretty interesting. Yeah, I hope so. And one of the
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:27.960]  things I was thinking about then is, and as you mentioned, they just Microsoft has not caught any
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:37.400]  traction with tablets and iPhones. I wonder if they should make a laptop or is that too competitive
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:43.880]  with all their partners? I don't know. To me, they've already broken the seal. I think they kind of
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:48.440]  have anything. But see, here's the thing I think though. And this is what I took away from the
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:54.680]  coverage last week. And your piece in particular is that to me, it seems like what they were
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:35:00.360]  saying it last week's event is that they think this is the future of the laptop. Right. A tablet
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:08.760]  that, you know, the screen part is a tablet and the keyboard part to detaches. Yeah. And it's a
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:15.800]  cover. And to me, that's why they kept bringing up the MacBook Air or not Mac, yeah, MacBook Air,
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:19.560]  not the iPad that they weren't talking about iPads really. They were talking about the MacBook Air
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:24.680]  that they're saying, if you want to do work, this is the form factor, you know, and like the way
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:30.680]  I put it is that they're saying, this tablet form factor isn't just for iOS type devices, media,
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:35.720]  simplified. Well, and not just media stuff, but simplified. One thing at a time,
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:42.360]  a simple system that anybody can kind of get the gist of, you know, you tap an app, you're in the app,
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:48.280]  you tap home, you go back to your apps. And that's it. They're saying this form factor is useful
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:54.360]  for more complicated systems like Windows or, you know, in theory. Now Microsoft isn't saying it,
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:36:00.760]  but in theory that their, their, their, by implication, they're saying that Apple is wrong
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:06.840]  not to be doing a Mac OS device in this form factor. Yeah. And that this is your next laptop.
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:14.280]  It's this tablet. Right. That Apple, Apple's stance is that the form factors are tied to the
[1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:21.320]  complexities of the systems. That the simple tablet form factor is meant for the simple iOS
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:28.760]  interface and that the more complicated MacBook form factor with the attached keyboard and a track
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:34.600]  pad and this layer of abstraction between the track pad and the pointer on screen is inherently
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:41.080]  suited to the more complex OS Mac OS. Yeah. And Microsoft is saying that I, you know, that to me
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:45.400]  is what I took away from it is they're saying, no, this form factor is the future of portable computing
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:51.640]  for any level of complexity. Yeah. And then, well, the, the trouble I had with that was that the
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:57.880]  minute they got into anything rather complicated, immediately the stylus came out and the keyboard.
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:05.320]  So, uh, is that better, you know, than a, a, just a keyboard that's and not a touch screen,
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:11.160]  I suppose for some applications, it is like, you know, you link to the people drawing on it and that
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:18.520]  kind of stuff. Yeah. Um, I don't, you know, I don't know if that's better than a, than a purpose
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:23.800]  designed drawing tablet, like one of the Wacom, Wacom, whatever they're called. Yeah,
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:28.680]  long term though, but I, I've always thought about with that and that, yeah, Wacom and I forget who else
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:33.720]  and, you know, apparently the, the surface is really good for this. I think he's gabed the penny
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:37.960]  arcade guy who's the artist who's been using one for a while and he has, you know, had the,
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:44.280]  got the surface pro three right away and says it's really good. Um, for precision drawing in a way
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:50.680]  that the iPad screens are not precise like that. Um, but there's nothing that stops Apple from
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:56.040]  eventually making an iPad that has a screen that that's, that is that precise and right,
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:01.000]  I don't think they'll ever ship with a stylus, but they could make one that you could get a third
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:07.400]  party stylus that would have professional level precision. Yeah, I actually bought a Kickstarter
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:16.280]  stylus that was the most precise like iPad stylus I've seen so far. Uh, very small tip and it's,
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:21.000]  it's all right, but I just don't really have any use for it. So I don't, I never use it, but, um,
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:27.160]  syntax syntax is that the other one? It's like a, uh, I think the Pixar people remember. Oh,
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:35.400]  cool. Yeah. So that's what I don't know. I, I'm not sold on, on that. I'm not sold and I'm sure
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:44.280]  there, my guess is that this will be the most successful tablet PC ever made because that's
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:50.200]  basically saying that more than 20 people will buy it, but I, you know, when I think about
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:59.960]  writing a lot or, you know, building a document in a spreadsheet program or doing graphic
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:07.560]  manipulation, I'm still much happier with a keyboard and a real trackpad, uh, than,
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:12.680]  than what they're shipping. Um, that's not to say that they can't keep improving it,
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:19.240]  but it's just like that, that keyboard still feels like a cheapo add on keyboard. Yeah. Relative
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:25.960]  to the real rigid kind of bottom half of a, of a good laptop. Let me, let me just type right here
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:30.120]  and cut off all the people who are probably already halfway through emailing me,
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:42.760]  cintick, c-i-n-t-i-q is, it's a line of, uh, touchscreen tablets from Wacom. Oh, cool. So that's, that's,
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.240]  that's, that's what I was thinking of, but that's why you thought Wacom, it's Wacom's line of
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:54.440]  touchscreen tablets. Do you think they would do, that Apple would do a touchscreen Mac OS device,
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:40:01.720]  whether it's a MacBook thing with touch? Yeah. I really think no. I think we're, I think we're
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:09.160]  more likely to see a laptop iOS device than, uh, touchscreen Mac. Huh. Interesting. I just,
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:14.280]  you know what though? Well, I don't think that they'll announce the hardware, uh, next week,
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:20.120]  but that's something to keep an eye on when they show us Mac OS 10.10 is look at what,
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:25.240]  uh, the chips. Well, no, look at how big the screen, the elements are on screen,
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:30.520]  or they spaced in such a way that they look like they're amenable to big fat fingers.
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:36.840]  Ah, interesting. Yeah. Mac OS, as we know it, is totally, totally horrible for fingers,
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:43.000]  like just the simplest thing, like the red yellow green buttons in the windows for,
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:47.080]  yeah, closing, not going to happen. Well, they're so close to each other, you'd
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:50.680]  know nothing on iOS is ever that close to each other, because you're, they're all right.
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:55.720]  Next time I'm looking at the Safari window right now and the close button, the minimize button
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:41:01.240]  and the back button are all, you know, within all of those three buttons are all within the target
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:07.720]  area of one button that's the size of my fingertip. Right. Yeah. And the menu, uh, the little icons
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:13.320]  in the menu bar, uh, you know, with the sound and the Wi-Fi and that kind of stuff. None of that
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:18.360]  would really be right. And show combine it. Yeah, combine it with the file menu, like the top
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:24.280]  window in Safari on my Mac right now, the, the close button is right under the file menu.
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:30.360]  So there's actually three touch targets, four touch targets that are all within, you know, the,
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:35.480]  with drastically different consequences. Right. Right. Open and do, oh, I didn't mean to close that
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:41.000]  whole app. Yeah. Right. It's, it would be a recipe and frustration if they just turned on touch.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.720]  They'd have to resize everything and, you know, it, it just, it would just be, you know, I'm not
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:49.960]  saying it's impossible, but it's, you know, you'll be able to tell just by looking at iOS 8 if
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:55.480]  it's designed with future touch and in mind. Yeah, that's interesting. And if they were to ever
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:02.680]  converge them into one, you know, whether it's fully, you know, the same operating system or at
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:09.400]  least the same look and feel, that's where we would start to see the cues there. Um, I thought
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:16.440]  you were going to say, look and see if it'll run on, um, not Intel arm. Well, we wouldn't be able
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.920]  to know they're not going to, yeah, they're not going to mention that. So I will eat my hat if they
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:26.040]  don't have a version of Mac OS 10 running on arm chips in the same, probably in the same freaking lab
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:32.760]  where that's how, that's how Tim Cook's MacBook Air lasts all the way to, uh, to tie one or whatever.
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:38.360]  Right. They'd be nuts not to have it compiled, especially now, I bet, and maybe they couldn't do it.
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:44.600]  In fact, I was thinking about it. Maybe they couldn't do it until the arm went 64 bit with the,
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:50.760]  the last year's devices because Mac OS 10 had already gone 64 bit and there was no way they
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:57.560]  could keep 64 bit Mac OS 10 running on 32 bit arm chips. But now that they have 64 bit arm chips,
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:01.960]  if they don't already have it running their, their full steam ahead making it running. It's on.
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:09.400]  But we won't know that because in the same way that we never knew that iOS 7 was going to be 64
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.840]  bit until they shipped those devices until they announced the iPhone 5S because the versions,
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.360]  the betas they shipped starting at WWDC last year and all summer long, they just shipped 32 bit
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:24.600]  betas and they never, you know, in order we know that there would be an Intel version of
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:29.960]  Mac OS. Right. Versus the old, uh, Harpy C chips. Right. Because they just never distributed
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:35.480]  outside their internal land. Hey, so speaking, I mentioned before about the fact that everything's
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:41.080]  mostly ones and zeros, but I do have a physical thing to announce, which is oh live version of
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:46.120]  the talk show. I said this in the last episode. Whoa, I would have ticket information. I've done
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:54.040]  this. Okay. I thought the show was live and then we had an audience. I would never do that.
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:44:00.680]  Oh, cool. You launched a new podcasting suite. Nice, man. No, it's a live event next week in San
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:09.720]  Francisco, uh, Tuesday, six to nine PM at Mezzanine, which is right there on, uh, what's it mint
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:14.360]  square or whatever the hell it's called. I don't know. Wow, the address will be on the website.
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:20.200]  Here is where you go. This is the announcement for ticket information. Um, selling tickets on a new
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.560]  system from my friend, uh, Paul Campbell, the guy behind the will conference, Tito. So you go to
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:34.760]  ti dot tio. Super short domain name ti dot tio slash daring fireball. And, uh, right now as soon
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:41.080]  as if you're listening to this, you can go and you'll see a link to the talk show live from WWDC.
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:47.720]  Um, and you can buy tickets. Give me a limited space. We sold out pretty quickly last year. Same, same
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:55.880]  facility. Uh, I think we'll have at least 350 tickets, maybe, maybe more, but probably 350 to start.
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:00.920]  Uh, so if you're hearing us now, uh, you should go and check it out if you want to come.
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:04.760]  And anybody can go. You don't have to be a WWDC attendee. I think most people this year aren't,
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:15.160]  aren't don't have badges. Yeah. Do you? Uh, it's complicated. Okay. I don't ask. I have been told
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:20.920]  that I will have a press badge for the keynote. And I don't have a paid, uh, the attendee badge though.
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:25.960]  Okay. Got it. Um, but we'll, I'm going to scalp some tickets to this thing now because it's
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:28.920]  going to sell out by the time anyone. Are you going? You got, you're going to be a San Francisco.
[1:45:28.920 --> 1:45:33.560]  I'm not, no, I'm actually going to be in Seattle that day, uh, because courts is having a conference
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:40.200]  there. Um, so Monday and Tuesday, uh, Monday. And then I'm actually spending Tuesday and Seattle
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:45.400]  and then coming back. I should have gone to San Francisco. Well, you're going to miss from Seattle.
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:50.680]  But I've been to the one, uh, that you did two years ago and it was super fun. It was really great.
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.240]  Last year's was better access to right? Yeah. Two years ago was cable sassier and last year at
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.040]  Guy English, uh, better facility. We're at the same place we were last year, mezzanine, uh,
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:07.080]  more seats, uh, better acoustics. Really, it's a really great place. Uh, it's going to be an open bar.
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:13.560]  Everybody, you know, you can enjoy any adult beverage of your choice. Uh, top shelf liquor. Uh,
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:19.240]  we're going to have great sponsors. Uh, although I think the bar sponsorship is still open. So
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:23.160]  anybody who wants to sponsor it, uh, I'll be promoting this on Darren Fireball this week,
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:29.560]  uh, should get in touch with me through the usual channels on the website. Uh, so we're still
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:36.840]  looking for a sponsor for the bar. Uh, and special guests, special guests this year at this live
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:42.040]  show. This is amazing. I don't know how it's going to work, but, uh, going to have the whole ATP crew.
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:54.440]  Wow. Marco Arment, John Syracuse, uh, and, uh, it was the other one. It was, it's, uh, I don't know.
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:59.080]  Casey list. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Casey list. All three of them will be joining me on stage at the
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:03.720]  beginning of the show for the nerd, the nerd part. We're going to talk about the day before
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:08.840]  his news at WWDC. And then, uh, and then my pal Scott Simpson's going to come on and,
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:15.880]  and, uh, lighten it up a little bit. And musical guest, Dr. Dre, musical guest, Dr. Dre. Everybody
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:22.040]  will get a free pair of, uh, beat headphones. Yeah. Cool. Well, that sounds fun. I'm bummed on
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:32.280]  missing it, but T to T I dot T O slash daring fireball. And if you're in Seattle, come to the
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:39.480]  courts conference, 69 Tuesday in San Francisco. So that'll be that that'll be the show party come out
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:43.160]  tomorrow. So you'll have one week in advance to make your, make your, uh, get your tickets.
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:51.000]  Anything else? No, that's good. It feels like a happy memorial day. Yeah. Happy memorial day to you,
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:56.280]  uh, happy. Congratulations on the new gig. Always good to see you writing more. I'm excited. I,
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:01.800]  I've kind of have had a lot of thoughts in my head over the last six months that have been to
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:08.040]  kind of busy slash lazy to express. So now I have to do it. And I, can I just say a big picture,
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:14.040]  I've been doing this for a while during fireball and even the talk. I am more excited about
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.120]  what's going on in all this stuff that we talk about this year that I've been in a long time,
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:22.360]  because I feel like, I don't know, I feel like there's a lot, a lot of turning points.
[1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:28.840]  I agree. I had last the last, uh, I would say the second half of last year, I was super bored.
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:35.400]  Like I just did not really, I was almost offended by kind of how little progress was going on.
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:41.400]  But I don't know what maybe, maybe it's just, uh, the, the spring after an awful winter,
[1:48:41.400 --> 1:48:46.600]  but I'm really, I'm excited. I think there's a lot of, you know, and I hope I'm not disappointed
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:52.200]  by what ends up coming out of it. But I think that Apple in particular and other companies,
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:58.520]  Google and Microsoft and Amazon and even Facebook and Twitter are in a position to really do some
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:04.920]  cool stuff now. So I hope they, I hope they don't disappoint. I compared to 2007 when the iPad
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:09.240]  or iPhone first came out and nobody knew it was awesome. It's a little different because there's
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:16.200]  not one device that to me is centered, centered our attention. But it was like, I just, we just didn't
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:20.360]  know where it was going to go. It was clearly going somewhere new, but we couldn't tell where.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:28.360]  And I knew there was a phone coming, but we didn't know how drastically, yeah, I feel that way
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:33.320]  with the interface stuff for macOS 10. I feel that way with the health monitoring stuff that
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:38.680]  everybody says is coming to iOS. And so it's coming and it feels like it's cool ideas,
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:42.840]  but I can't tell where it's going. And so I feel like it's, it's a very exciting time to be
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:48.120]  writing about and talking about this stuff. Me too. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you, Dan.
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:54.280]  Yeah. Thank you. QZ dot com. QZ and at from Dom on Twitter where you can sound off and tell me
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:59.080]  I'm a moron. Right. What do we ask people? We want them to send us their, oh, programming on,
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:05.480]  if you have any ideas for new tips for early, yeah, like hypercard type stuff like
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:09.320]  kodia and stuff like that, like ways that you can teach yourself programming on iOS.
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:39.160]  Awesome. Thank you, everyone. Yeah. And thanks, Joe. I'm hitting stop.
