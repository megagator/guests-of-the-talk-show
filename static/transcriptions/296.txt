[00:00.000 --> 00:03.320]  Michael Simmons, welcome to the talk show.
[00:03.320 --> 00:04.160]  Thanks for having me.
[00:04.160 --> 00:08.560]  This is dangerous, because you operate at a much higher energy
[00:08.560 --> 00:10.800]  level than I do.
[00:10.800 --> 00:14.000]  I'm going to try to stay calm, think first, and be positive.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.600]  How about that?
[00:15.600 --> 00:19.840]  Now, you used to do a show with our mutual dear friend
[00:19.840 --> 00:22.280]  Brent Simmons, and you're of no relation.
[00:22.280 --> 00:25.280]  But wasn't that the topic of the what was the title of the show?
[00:25.280 --> 00:27.200]  It was identical cousins.
[00:27.200 --> 00:27.880]  Identical cousins.
[00:27.880 --> 00:28.800]  Your cousin Brent.
[00:28.800 --> 00:29.880]  But you weren't cousins.
[00:29.880 --> 00:31.440]  It's actually no relation.
[00:31.440 --> 00:32.560]  Maybe we were.
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.400]  Maybe we are.
[00:34.400 --> 00:37.720]  The whole point is we're identical cousins.
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.480]  If there's a loose theme to today's show,
[00:40.480 --> 00:43.800]  it'll be indie Apple platform development.
[00:43.800 --> 00:46.600]  I was going to say Mac development, right?
[00:46.600 --> 00:51.280]  Because we're of an age where that's still what we think of.
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.760]  Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:52.760 --> 00:54.840]  I've been, as I'm getting older, and you and I have talked
[00:54.840 --> 00:57.560]  about this, as we're getting older, we're old Mac guys,
[00:57.560 --> 00:58.040]  right?
[00:58.040 --> 01:00.480]  We're old Apple, old Mac guys, and yeah, it's
[01:00.480 --> 01:03.880]  kind of hard to describe it now because it's so different.
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.360]  But for those who don't know, do you have a title at Flexibits?
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.400]  Are you just Michael?
[01:09.400 --> 01:10.920]  I mean, I usually just say co-founder,
[01:10.920 --> 01:13.320]  but I'm kind of everything.
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.720]  In some sense, you are the director.
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.760]  That was my role at Vesper, that you direct the movie.
[01:19.760 --> 01:22.320]  Maybe producer's a better word, but you
[01:22.320 --> 01:24.720]  help organize and run Flexibits, who are best
[01:24.720 --> 01:30.080]  known for Fantastical, and now everybody who's listening
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.200]  is like, oh, OK, Fantastical.
[01:33.200 --> 01:34.320]  Yeah, sounds about right.
[01:34.320 --> 01:36.320]  Believe it or not, I think I told you this as well.
[01:36.320 --> 01:38.900]  I was a film major in college, so the producer-director thing
[01:38.900 --> 01:40.360]  definitely resonates with me.
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.840]  I always view app development as a craft of almost as
[01:43.840 --> 01:46.640]  if I were making a movie, of it being parts of the movie,
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.440]  and how does someone walk away.
[01:48.440 --> 01:49.760]  How do they feel about the app when they're done?
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.880]  So I really like the producer-director thing.
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.840]  Yeah, well, that was my title at Q Branch for Vesper,
[01:55.840 --> 01:56.960]  and it works.
[01:56.960 --> 01:59.560]  And I'm surprised that it hasn't caught on more.
[01:59.560 --> 02:03.280]  And some people think it's cutesy, but it does work.
[02:03.280 --> 02:05.680]  Because movie-making, it's an interesting thing,
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.880]  where what does the director do?
[02:07.880 --> 02:10.560]  There's a screenwriter who writes a screenplay.
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.120]  And hopefully, that's the starting point
[02:14.120 --> 02:18.120]  of any good movie, is a finished screenplay.
[02:18.120 --> 02:21.200]  And an app has sort of a plan, and it
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.480]  doesn't have to be in the same way
[02:24.480 --> 02:27.800]  that the same finished, excellent, award-winning
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.320]  screenplay in the hands of an entirely different director
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.460]  with a different cast could be not just a different movie,
[02:35.460 --> 02:39.080]  but the difference between a good movie and a bad movie.
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.800]  Same thing with the plan for an app.
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.960]  Somebody makes the design for the app,
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.920]  and then there's programmers who make it real,
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.120]  and designers who pixel-perfect design icons,
[02:53.120 --> 02:55.280]  and pick colors, and shades of blue,
[02:55.280 --> 03:00.320]  and everything that needs to be designed to make a great app.
[03:00.320 --> 03:03.960]  But somebody has to be there steering the ship, right?
[03:03.960 --> 03:06.000]  You've got all these talented people on the bus,
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  but somebody's driving the bus and deciding where to go.
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.840]  That's sort of you?
[03:10.840 --> 03:11.440]  Yeah, sure.
[03:11.440 --> 03:14.040]  One of the things that always stuck with me from college
[03:14.040 --> 03:16.120]  when I was taking my film classes was,
[03:16.120 --> 03:18.680]  if you don't have the proper ingredients,
[03:18.680 --> 03:21.000]  and then the proper execution of those ingredients,
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.960]  then of the film, you won't have a great film.
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.680]  And I really think all app developers, no matter
[03:27.680 --> 03:29.920]  what app you're making, even if it's just a client
[03:29.920 --> 03:32.440]  or even if it's a new thing, you need
[03:32.440 --> 03:35.640]  to think through the roadmap of the app.
[03:35.640 --> 03:37.520]  Are you just solving a problem, and then you're
[03:37.520 --> 03:38.620]  implementing it, and that's all?
[03:38.620 --> 03:39.880]  That's the only thought you've put into it?
[03:39.880 --> 03:42.280]  Or is it the actual journey of the app of where it's going
[03:42.280 --> 03:44.440]  to go, and how it's going to make the user feel?
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.200]  Solving a problem, or making them more productive,
[03:47.200 --> 03:49.560]  or making notes quicker, whatever it is, right?
[03:49.560 --> 03:51.360]  But you have to have this vision and then
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.920]  the execution of the vision to really have
[03:53.920 --> 03:55.840]  a, I think, successful product.
[03:59.080 --> 03:59.960]  So fantastical.
[03:59.960 --> 04:00.460]  Let's start.
[04:00.460 --> 04:03.640]  We can start with fantastical.
[04:03.640 --> 04:06.720]  You guys have an update this week to support.
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.240]  I'd rather start with flying robot cameras.
[04:10.240 --> 04:10.920]  Did you see that?
[04:10.920 --> 04:12.320]  What everyone's talking about this week?
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.120]  Did you see that?
[04:13.120 --> 04:15.280]  So yeah, we could start with flying robot cameras.
[04:15.280 --> 04:17.800]  So Amazon at their...
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.880]  Much more exciting than fantastical, I think.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.920]  Amazon at their fall hardware announcement.
[04:23.920 --> 04:25.920]  And they have, you know, one thing that struck me
[04:25.920 --> 04:28.160]  yesterday, trying to catch up on this, and you and I,
[04:28.160 --> 04:29.920]  we're friends, we chat.
[04:29.920 --> 04:32.200]  You know this, that I am struggling lately
[04:32.200 --> 04:34.080]  to keep up with the news.
[04:34.080 --> 04:37.440]  It is, it's difficult, right?
[04:37.440 --> 04:39.800]  It is a blizzard of insanity.
[04:39.800 --> 04:41.560]  I think part of it, here's part of it,
[04:41.560 --> 04:45.680]  is I have a big interest in, in general,
[04:45.680 --> 04:48.200]  in normal times, in national politics,
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.720]  and national, for lack of a better term,
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.320]  I love the phrase, the national affairs, right?
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.080]  That was like Hunter S. Thompson's desk
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.560]  at Rolling Stone, the national affairs desk.
[04:58.560 --> 05:02.200]  I have a great interest in them, but in normal times,
[05:02.200 --> 05:03.800]  I can mostly tune out.
[05:03.800 --> 05:08.520]  And you know, I always like, were you a newspaper guy?
[05:08.520 --> 05:11.640]  Do you used to like to get the physical newspaper?
[05:11.640 --> 05:13.640]  Yeah, and it was the whole experience of,
[05:13.640 --> 05:16.120]  you were focused on the newspaper, and that's it, right?
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.600]  It was the one mode of the paper, the paper, right?
[05:18.600 --> 05:20.600]  So there you go, so you know I'm into it, the paper.
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.640]  The single greatest thing in newspaper history,
[05:24.640 --> 05:29.640]  in my mind, as an artistic, journalistic accomplishment,
[05:30.200 --> 05:33.760]  was this New York Times weekend review section,
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.280]  where you could be heads down, you know,
[05:37.280 --> 05:39.520]  like maybe you're working for NASA,
[05:39.520 --> 05:41.800]  you know, making the space shuttle,
[05:41.800 --> 05:45.920]  or go back to the 60s, and you're trying to land men
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.800]  on the moon, and you're working 120 hours a week,
[05:49.800 --> 05:51.640]  but you got a break Sunday afternoon,
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.840]  you're gonna take a break.
[05:52.840 --> 05:54.760]  You wanna catch up, what's going on in the world?
[05:54.760 --> 05:57.720]  All you have to do is read the Sunday New York Times
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.880]  weekend review section, you know what I mean?
[05:59.880 --> 06:01.840]  And you could catch up, and you'd realize,
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.120]  all right, you don't know everything, but.
[06:03.120 --> 06:04.080]  Summary of the week.
[06:04.080 --> 06:05.600]  Yeah, you know what's going on.
[06:05.600 --> 06:08.600]  The weekend review for National Affairs right now
[06:08.600 --> 06:12.360]  would be like, it would be 700 pages long.
[06:12.360 --> 06:15.920]  Like there's no way, there's too much going on.
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.200]  And I'm trying, like I try to keep my toes
[06:19.200 --> 06:21.680]  on National Affairs at that weekend review level,
[06:21.680 --> 06:25.520]  so that I can spend my day obsessing over all the stuff
[06:25.520 --> 06:27.680]  that's typical during a fireball fair, right?
[06:27.680 --> 06:31.280]  And trying to do that while simultaneously staying
[06:31.280 --> 06:34.160]  in touch with what's going on in the world at large
[06:34.160 --> 06:37.360]  with, it's hard.
[06:37.360 --> 06:39.880]  No, no, but friend or not, you've been doing a great job.
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.520]  I have to say, I know you're pivoting a little bit
[06:41.520 --> 06:43.600]  in terms of covering all the crazy, wacky,
[06:43.600 --> 06:45.760]  very important things that are going on.
[06:45.760 --> 06:49.480]  And to me, like, you're doing it, at least for me,
[06:49.480 --> 06:51.360]  I can only speak for myself, but you're doing it in a way
[06:51.360 --> 06:53.600]  where I actually get news from you,
[06:53.600 --> 06:55.260]  and then I get your take on the news.
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.840]  Some things resonate, some things don't.
[06:56.840 --> 06:58.040]  We'll discuss it, you know that.
[06:58.040 --> 07:01.240]  But I think it's really good how you're almost giving
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.440]  a summary of the important stories mixed in with tech
[07:04.440 --> 07:07.080]  so people don't ignore what's actually happening
[07:07.080 --> 07:07.920]  in the world, right?
[07:07.920 --> 07:10.000]  That is what I'm trying to do, and I appreciate you.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.320]  Well, I see that, and I appreciate you.
[07:12.320 --> 07:15.160]  But just alone, yesterday, it's like, just like,
[07:15.160 --> 07:17.680]  well, oh my God, look at all this stuff Amazon announced.
[07:17.680 --> 07:20.440]  It's so much, and I found a good Verge summary
[07:20.440 --> 07:22.880]  of like, here's the 13 biggest things they announced.
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.280]  And it's like, well, 13's a lot, but it was a good summary.
[07:25.280 --> 07:27.880]  I felt like I was reading a CES roundup or something.
[07:27.880 --> 07:28.720]  Like, I was reading The Verge.
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.980]  The Verge did an amazing roundup, as they do.
[07:30.980 --> 07:33.280]  But I'm reading that thing, and I'm just like,
[07:33.280 --> 07:34.120]  it's ridiculous.
[07:34.120 --> 07:36.960]  Well, I don't know that it's ridiculous, but it is a lot.
[07:36.960 --> 07:41.960]  But it goes to show that Amazon has to be taken seriously
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.560]  as a hardware company at this point,
[07:43.560 --> 07:48.560]  and that their acquisitions of Eero and Ring, among others,
[07:52.480 --> 07:57.480]  we can argue about Google's acquisition of Nest,
[07:57.480 --> 08:01.200]  and did that, did they sort of squander that?
[08:01.200 --> 08:03.600]  I think they sort of did, in hindsight.
[08:03.600 --> 08:04.960]  I do too, I do too.
[08:04.960 --> 08:08.360]  And you know, I've got, we have Nest thermostats here
[08:08.360 --> 08:11.300]  at the Daring Fireball World Headquarters,
[08:11.300 --> 08:13.440]  and I like them very much.
[08:13.440 --> 08:17.800]  In fact, we were delayed, we were delayed recording.
[08:17.800 --> 08:20.000]  The whole reason we were delayed to start this show
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.800]  from when we were scheduled was,
[08:22.800 --> 08:27.800]  I'm carrying around a, still a testing device on iOS 14,
[08:28.200 --> 08:32.120]  and it turns out I never actually signed into the Nest app
[08:32.120 --> 08:36.480]  on that device, and I wanted to turn the air conditioner,
[08:37.320 --> 08:39.080]  the temperature up so that it won't kick in
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.320]  and make noise in the background.
[08:40.320 --> 08:42.560]  This is it, I'm sweating my family.
[08:42.560 --> 08:45.600]  This is what I do for my audience, the talk show audience.
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.520]  I sweat my family out, turn the house into a hot box,
[08:49.520 --> 08:50.560]  so that we don't get,
[08:50.560 --> 08:52.840]  you have high quality audio, so I mean, it's worth it.
[08:52.840 --> 08:55.440]  But it turned out I couldn't sign into the Nest app
[08:55.440 --> 08:57.780]  on this new phone, and I was very confused,
[08:57.780 --> 09:01.360]  and it's because me and our Nest app
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.060]  is not using a quote, unquote, Google account.
[09:04.060 --> 09:06.600]  I have a Nest account, and they've,
[09:07.600 --> 09:10.840]  because this was a different device, I had to sign in again,
[09:10.840 --> 09:12.860]  and they have since made the,
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.040]  the sign into your Nest interface,
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.920]  it looks totally normal if you use a Google sign in,
[09:21.920 --> 09:24.420]  and I was trying to sign in with this email account
[09:24.420 --> 09:27.240]  that's not really a Google account in this interface.
[09:27.240 --> 09:30.320]  There is a little thing at the bottom that says,
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.720]  do you not migrated still using a Nest account?
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.380]  I would say it is printed in like the pixels,
[09:38.380 --> 09:40.520]  like the non-retina pixels.
[09:40.520 --> 09:41.360]  Point one font.
[09:41.360 --> 09:45.400]  Yeah, like a one point font at the bottom of this screen.
[09:45.400 --> 09:50.040]  That it's a miracle that anybody could even read it
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.040]  or notice it, it looks like a hair on the screen
[09:52.040 --> 09:54.120]  that says like, oh, tap right here
[09:54.120 --> 09:56.520]  if that's what you wanna do, and it took me five minutes.
[09:56.520 --> 09:59.780]  But anyway, we've got the Nest thing, and we like it,
[09:59.780 --> 10:02.100]  but I don't, I can't say anything that they've done
[10:02.100 --> 10:05.480]  with that that wasn't there before they acquired it, right?
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.440]  It doesn't seem like Google is,
[10:08.440 --> 10:12.160]  under Google's ownership, Nest is proceeding
[10:12.160 --> 10:14.360]  at the pace they were when they were independent.
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.360]  Whereas Eero and Ring, doorbells and security things,
[10:20.760 --> 10:23.200]  if anything, seem to be accelerating faster
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.840]  under Amazon's acquisition than they were before.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.040]  I completely agree.
[10:29.040 --> 10:32.120]  I was always on the fence between the Nest and the Ring,
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.920]  and then eventually I got a ring around the time,
[10:33.920 --> 10:35.800]  actually it was right before Amazon acquired it,
[10:35.800 --> 10:38.840]  and anyway, the development has been incredible.
[10:38.840 --> 10:41.640]  Like, it accelerated since Amazon acquired it.
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.200]  Now, I already know there's a lot of naysayers and cynics
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.720]  that'll say, well, that's because they're putting
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.720]  all their stuff in to try to spy and everything.
[10:47.720 --> 10:50.980]  Anyway, I'm just saying, I definitely think Amazon
[10:50.980 --> 10:53.880]  has nailed it, and to be quite blunt,
[10:53.880 --> 10:56.120]  especially with that robot camera thing,
[10:56.120 --> 10:57.800]  I think Amazon, or at least Nest,
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.380]  it seems like the CEO who started the company,
[11:00.380 --> 11:02.960]  sorry, Ring, CEO who started Ring,
[11:02.960 --> 11:04.940]  they seem to really care about privacy,
[11:04.940 --> 11:08.400]  or certainly they're certainly making me feel
[11:08.400 --> 11:10.120]  they care about privacy, because the amount
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.960]  of privacy settings and control I have over privacy,
[11:12.960 --> 11:15.040]  I actually feel comfortable with my ring.
[11:15.040 --> 11:19.400]  It's interesting, I don't have any Ring products yet,
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.680]  and we don't really have smart doorbells,
[11:21.680 --> 11:23.320]  we've got really dumb doorbells,
[11:24.260 --> 11:28.760]  but it's on the list, but the basic privacy concerns
[11:28.760 --> 11:31.080]  are there, and I know, I don't wanna devolve
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.200]  this conversation into it, but I know
[11:33.200 --> 11:35.440]  part of the controversy with the Ring stuff
[11:35.440 --> 11:38.000]  is their partnership with police,
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.920]  and that they've got things where they're willing
[11:40.920 --> 11:43.840]  to contribute footage from your Ring camera
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.880]  to police, and what are the rules for that?
[11:47.880 --> 11:49.180]  There's a lot to think about.
[11:49.180 --> 11:50.240]  It's sticky, it's sticky.
[11:50.240 --> 11:51.680]  It's very complicated.
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.160]  I'm erring on the side of, we have voice assistants,
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.520]  we have HomePods, and an older, now it looks ancient,
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.480]  Amazon Alexa listening device,
[12:06.480 --> 12:08.920]  if you wanna put it in cynical terms.
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.920]  So we have those, and again, I have good friends
[12:14.020 --> 12:16.060]  who are like, no way am I letting any of those in my house,
[12:16.060 --> 12:17.620]  and I get it, you know?
[12:17.620 --> 12:19.780]  I'm one of those, I have to raise my hand.
[12:19.780 --> 12:21.920]  I mean, I almost think it's crazy,
[12:21.920 --> 12:23.180]  go back to the 80s when everyone's like,
[12:23.180 --> 12:24.180]  oh, there's gonna be all these bugs
[12:24.180 --> 12:25.420]  that the government's putting in your house,
[12:25.420 --> 12:26.780]  now people are going paying money
[12:26.780 --> 12:28.740]  to put speakers that are connected to the internet
[12:28.740 --> 12:31.420]  that they specifically say they're gathering information,
[12:31.420 --> 12:32.900]  yeah, okay, anonymous, and blah, blah, blah,
[12:32.900 --> 12:35.460]  but I find the whole thing incredible
[12:35.460 --> 12:37.820]  that people are paying money to put this in their house.
[12:37.820 --> 12:41.180]  I get it, but I do think it's, you know.
[12:41.180 --> 12:42.020]  It's me.
[12:42.020 --> 12:46.040]  But it's also, you know, it's like a lot of progress.
[12:47.180 --> 12:49.900]  I remember when it was really controversial
[12:51.100 --> 12:55.020]  when apps would phone home at all.
[12:56.460 --> 12:59.540]  Even if an app just, you know,
[12:59.540 --> 13:02.060]  you downloaded an indie Mac app,
[13:02.060 --> 13:06.540]  and every time it launches, it would call to a server
[13:06.540 --> 13:08.620]  to see if a new version was available,
[13:08.620 --> 13:10.820]  and then if so, would let you know with the,
[13:10.820 --> 13:12.420]  you know, is it before Sparkle,
[13:12.420 --> 13:14.540]  and before you could even click a button
[13:14.540 --> 13:16.900]  to upgrade in place, it would just say,
[13:16.900 --> 13:19.860]  hey, there's a new version of my app available,
[13:20.740 --> 13:23.060]  you know, here's a button that would go to the website
[13:23.060 --> 13:24.620]  where you would download the update
[13:24.620 --> 13:27.340]  and manually replace the actual app file,
[13:27.340 --> 13:29.700]  but people were, you know, there was outrage about it.
[13:29.700 --> 13:31.660]  And again, I'm not even saying I disagree,
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.780]  I'm just saying I remember when it was controversial
[13:33.780 --> 13:36.220]  that it happened at all, you know, and people.
[13:36.220 --> 13:40.100]  You know, and people would run tools to detect,
[13:40.100 --> 13:42.660]  you know, Little Snitch on Mac OS X,
[13:42.660 --> 13:44.180]  still around and still a great tool.
[13:44.180 --> 13:47.100]  I don't run it, but I'm glad it's there.
[13:47.100 --> 13:48.260]  I'm sure a lot of people listen.
[13:48.260 --> 13:49.980]  I've seen a lot of reports where it's detected
[13:49.980 --> 13:51.500]  some sketchy stuff, so I gotta say,
[13:51.500 --> 13:53.620]  it really is a very valuable tool for the,
[13:53.620 --> 13:55.340]  you know, bad players.
[13:55.340 --> 13:57.740]  But it's, you know, like the amount of that type of stuff
[13:57.740 --> 14:01.420]  that's going on now is a waterfall
[14:01.420 --> 14:04.940]  compared to the trickle that it originally was,
[14:04.940 --> 14:07.020]  and I, you know, I think we're going that way
[14:07.020 --> 14:10.420]  with devices that have cameras and microphones.
[14:10.420 --> 14:12.860]  I mean, it's the amount, you know,
[14:12.860 --> 14:14.020]  and it's good to be concerned.
[14:14.020 --> 14:16.500]  I think the way to do it as people
[14:16.500 --> 14:18.740]  and as technically adept users
[14:18.740 --> 14:21.380]  who our friends and family come to for advice
[14:21.380 --> 14:24.700]  is for us to be skeptical and cautious.
[14:24.700 --> 14:26.620]  But, you know, my eyes are wide open.
[14:26.620 --> 14:28.860]  I think, you know, 20, 25 years from now,
[14:28.860 --> 14:33.420]  we'll look back at 2020's number
[14:33.420 --> 14:38.060]  of camera-equipped, microphone-equipped devices
[14:38.060 --> 14:41.180]  in our lives and laugh at how few there are
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.820]  compared to how many there will be.
[14:42.820 --> 14:44.860]  It's that skepticism along the way
[14:44.860 --> 14:46.820]  that will hopefully steer it in a good direction.
[14:46.820 --> 14:50.980]  But I would say that Amazon's new Ring camera
[14:52.900 --> 14:56.660]  is, seems, if it works, and again,
[14:56.660 --> 14:59.500]  it's not like they said, hey, you can order it.
[14:59.500 --> 15:00.700]  It's so friggin' cool.
[15:00.700 --> 15:02.340]  They're not saying you can order it,
[15:02.340 --> 15:04.580]  so there's a vaporware-ish aspect
[15:04.580 --> 15:06.820]  to it's coming, quote, unquote, next year.
[15:06.820 --> 15:09.260]  Who knows how, when next year that is?
[15:09.260 --> 15:12.700]  But, you know, they,
[15:12.700 --> 15:14.940]  Amazon's credibility is pretty good, you know?
[15:14.940 --> 15:16.980]  I mean, if they say it's gonna happen,
[15:16.980 --> 15:18.700]  I tend to believe it.
[15:18.700 --> 15:21.700]  It's not like Magic Leap, for example, right?
[15:21.700 --> 15:23.500]  The VR company down in Florida
[15:23.500 --> 15:27.540]  who's been soaking up billions of dollars in investment
[15:27.540 --> 15:31.060]  and, you know, the whole thing is sort of a fraud,
[15:31.060 --> 15:32.500]  in my opinion.
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.460]  Amazon's, you know.
[15:33.460 --> 15:36.500]  I agree, and I will remain nameless as well,
[15:36.500 --> 15:37.340]  but I agree with you.
[15:37.340 --> 15:38.900]  Amazon is putting their name behind this,
[15:38.900 --> 15:40.380]  so it seems like it's gonna be real,
[15:40.380 --> 15:45.020]  and the idea is it is a in-home flying drone
[15:45.020 --> 15:48.100]  that you can make fly around your house
[15:48.100 --> 15:50.740]  and there, and it has a camera,
[15:50.740 --> 15:53.140]  and the idea is kinda genius,
[15:53.140 --> 15:55.860]  so that, let's say you go on vacation
[15:55.860 --> 15:57.300]  or you're just away from the house.
[15:57.300 --> 15:58.980]  Remember, like, when you could leave the house,
[15:58.980 --> 16:02.260]  you know, if we go back to being able to leave the house,
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.140]  you, instead of putting cameras
[16:05.140 --> 16:06.900]  every single where in your house, right?
[16:06.900 --> 16:09.500]  Like, how do you cover your whole house with cameras?
[16:09.500 --> 16:12.900]  It seems oppressive and expensive and complicated
[16:12.900 --> 16:15.020]  and ugly, right?
[16:15.020 --> 16:16.460]  Because what, you're gonna,
[16:16.460 --> 16:18.780]  it's gonna look like the inside of a store
[16:18.780 --> 16:21.460]  with security cameras all over your house?
[16:21.460 --> 16:23.580]  This idea that you could have this drone
[16:23.580 --> 16:25.180]  that moves all over the house
[16:26.460 --> 16:28.820]  and has a camera, and then you could just say,
[16:28.820 --> 16:31.620]  hey, go look in my, go look down by the garage,
[16:31.620 --> 16:34.260]  and the drone would fly down there,
[16:34.260 --> 16:36.300]  show you what's going on with the garage.
[16:36.300 --> 16:38.340]  You could see that your garage door's closed,
[16:38.340 --> 16:42.780]  and then, you know, go back to your base.
[16:42.780 --> 16:44.180]  It sounds fantastic.
[16:44.180 --> 16:45.940]  It sounds like, you know, it's sort of like
[16:45.940 --> 16:48.340]  the iPhone did, where it feels
[16:48.340 --> 16:50.500]  not like we didn't think we'd ever have it,
[16:50.500 --> 16:53.700]  but it feels maybe it's pulled five years from the future.
[16:55.420 --> 16:57.140]  It does, and when you actually see the video,
[16:57.140 --> 16:59.300]  you feel like it's one of those proof of concept videos
[16:59.300 --> 17:00.820]  where it's like a Kickstarter project,
[17:00.820 --> 17:02.460]  and it'll never ship.
[17:02.460 --> 17:04.940]  I don't, but it is Amazon, and they say it will.
[17:04.940 --> 17:07.900]  Oh, it's gonna, the way I've been reading
[17:07.900 --> 17:09.180]  all the stuff I've dug into it,
[17:09.180 --> 17:10.300]  I'm pretty sure it's coming.
[17:10.300 --> 17:11.940]  I think it's legit.
[17:11.940 --> 17:14.380]  I do too, and will you get one?
[17:14.380 --> 17:16.700]  And the privacy angle is fascinating,
[17:16.700 --> 17:20.540]  because it's actually, the camera is,
[17:20.540 --> 17:22.500]  it's like, if you imagine this device
[17:22.500 --> 17:25.900]  as sort of like a tack,
[17:25.900 --> 17:28.180]  the camera's at the sharp part of the tack,
[17:28.180 --> 17:30.900]  and when it goes into its charging base station,
[17:30.900 --> 17:32.820]  the tack goes into a hole,
[17:32.820 --> 17:35.220]  and the camera is therefore completely,
[17:35.220 --> 17:36.820]  not just like a little bit covered,
[17:36.820 --> 17:37.900]  it's all the way at the bottom
[17:37.900 --> 17:41.260]  of this cubicle charging base station,
[17:41.260 --> 17:42.940]  so that when it's on the base station,
[17:42.940 --> 17:44.940]  you know the camera can't see anything.
[17:45.980 --> 17:47.540]  Yeah, it's really well done how they did it,
[17:47.540 --> 17:49.820]  and I love that they integrated it into the design
[17:49.820 --> 17:51.820]  and into the whole kind of premise
[17:51.820 --> 17:54.180]  that it's capturing when it's flying,
[17:54.180 --> 17:55.300]  and when it's in its base,
[17:55.300 --> 17:56.500]  you don't have to worry.
[17:56.500 --> 17:58.660]  I also did wanna say,
[17:58.660 --> 18:00.780]  while I told you I don't bring a speaker in my house,
[18:00.780 --> 18:02.020]  I don't cover my cameras
[18:02.020 --> 18:03.300]  or cover my microphones or anything.
[18:03.300 --> 18:04.940]  It's not like I'm overly like,
[18:04.940 --> 18:06.300]  I'm not having anything in my house,
[18:06.300 --> 18:07.860]  but I just feel like,
[18:07.860 --> 18:10.060]  I don't think I would ever talk to an Alexa speaker
[18:10.060 --> 18:12.180]  or a Google Home speaker, whatever they're called.
[18:12.180 --> 18:13.540]  I just, isn't that it, Google Home?
[18:13.540 --> 18:14.700]  I don't remember what they're called now.
[18:14.700 --> 18:15.540]  Yeah, whatever.
[18:16.460 --> 18:19.220]  But I just, to me, having a speaker in my house
[18:19.220 --> 18:21.140]  that's always listening,
[18:21.140 --> 18:22.700]  I don't know, I just wanted to make it clear,
[18:22.700 --> 18:24.820]  I'm probably gonna get one of these flying robot cameras.
[18:24.820 --> 18:25.940]  It's one of those things that first I look at it,
[18:25.940 --> 18:28.340]  I'm like, hell no, but I have to have one, I think.
[18:28.340 --> 18:30.620]  The listening thing is unsettling in certain ways,
[18:30.620 --> 18:33.940]  but it is, I don't think people are nuts.
[18:33.940 --> 18:35.340]  Joanna Stern has been on my show,
[18:35.340 --> 18:36.940]  and I know Joanna's written extensively
[18:36.940 --> 18:40.900]  about whether you should or should not cover your camera
[18:40.900 --> 18:42.860]  with tape or with the third-party thing
[18:42.860 --> 18:45.060]  that you can stick over your MacBook camera.
[18:46.340 --> 18:50.220]  And it goes beyond the technology angle,
[18:50.220 --> 18:52.060]  which I tend to side on.
[18:52.060 --> 18:54.340]  I don't cover my cameras on any of my devices,
[18:54.340 --> 18:56.660]  and I really do tend to trust
[18:56.660 --> 18:58.260]  all the software I have on them.
[18:59.300 --> 19:02.500]  But I also don't think people who do
[19:02.500 --> 19:06.580]  are nuts or wrong to do so, and I.
[19:06.580 --> 19:07.420]  Oh, not at all.
[19:07.420 --> 19:08.660]  That's their personal comfort level,
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.020]  and they're entitled to that.
[19:10.020 --> 19:14.500]  Right, and I totally get you can't beat
[19:14.500 --> 19:19.020]  the peace of mind of the physical security
[19:19.020 --> 19:22.340]  of a piece of tape over the thing,
[19:22.340 --> 19:25.140]  or a slider, right?
[19:29.820 --> 19:32.060]  It just interests me, the new Peloton
[19:32.060 --> 19:35.900]  has a bigger screen in front of it, the bicycle thing,
[19:35.900 --> 19:38.900]  and there's a webcam so that you can be seen
[19:38.900 --> 19:40.340]  and participate in these classes,
[19:40.340 --> 19:43.620]  and the camera has a built-in slider.
[19:45.380 --> 19:47.380]  And that's fascinating to me,
[19:47.380 --> 19:49.140]  and I can see why they do it, right?
[19:49.140 --> 19:52.620]  And it's not like, you could say both A,
[19:52.620 --> 19:54.700]  you could trust us without the slider,
[19:54.700 --> 19:56.940]  but we're adding the slider too,
[19:56.940 --> 19:59.740]  because then you can trust it completely, right?
[19:59.740 --> 20:01.580]  And when there's a slider in front of the camera,
[20:01.580 --> 20:03.460]  when the lens cap is on a real camera,
[20:03.460 --> 20:06.140]  you know it's not taking a picture, right?
[20:06.140 --> 20:09.180]  You don't have to trust the technology at all.
[20:09.180 --> 20:12.140]  And you can say, oh, there's this path
[20:12.140 --> 20:14.660]  through the T whatever security chip,
[20:14.660 --> 20:17.460]  and the green light literally has to go on,
[20:17.460 --> 20:20.740]  and even if you had malware, the malware,
[20:20.740 --> 20:23.500]  there's no way for it to get into the security chip,
[20:23.500 --> 20:25.300]  and the green light is always gonna be on
[20:25.300 --> 20:26.540]  if the camera's on.
[20:26.540 --> 20:28.300]  And you can read security papers
[20:28.300 --> 20:30.740]  and totally believe it, right?
[20:30.740 --> 20:33.700]  But you could even be the person who wrote it.
[20:33.700 --> 20:36.300]  It could be like me and you or the team at Apple
[20:36.300 --> 20:39.340]  who wrote it in this alternate universe
[20:39.340 --> 20:43.660]  where PhDs in mathematics,
[20:43.660 --> 20:46.020]  and we're completely convinced
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.660]  that we've got a mathematical proof
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.740]  that there's a secure electronic chain
[20:50.740 --> 20:53.420]  between the green light and the camera,
[20:53.420 --> 20:54.780]  and when the camera has power,
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.980]  this green light must go on.
[20:56.980 --> 21:00.100]  I still feel like even the people who made that
[21:00.100 --> 21:02.620]  and know it as mathematically secure
[21:02.620 --> 21:03.780]  still would feel better
[21:03.780 --> 21:06.180]  if they put their thumb over the camera, right?
[21:06.180 --> 21:07.020]  It's just intuitive.
[21:07.020 --> 21:08.180]  Yeah, well, every system's hackable.
[21:08.180 --> 21:10.620]  I think every engineer always knows
[21:10.620 --> 21:13.140]  every system is hackable, right?
[21:13.140 --> 21:14.220]  Because someone could get into your house,
[21:14.220 --> 21:16.220]  get into your laptop, and bypass that system
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.860]  with something that they installed in your laptop.
[21:17.860 --> 21:20.060]  But if there's a cover that's a solid object,
[21:20.060 --> 21:21.460]  you can't really hack physics.
[21:23.380 --> 21:25.860]  So I, yeah, I'm tempted.
[21:25.860 --> 21:28.460]  And there's a lot of unanswered questions
[21:28.460 --> 21:31.020]  about this flying ring drone,
[21:31.020 --> 21:32.780]  and the Verge had a good rundown of them.
[21:32.780 --> 21:34.500]  It's like there's a lot of things
[21:34.500 --> 21:35.580]  Amazon hasn't talked about,
[21:35.580 --> 21:37.500]  like can it go up and down stairs?
[21:37.500 --> 21:39.700]  Presumably, you'd hope it could, right?
[21:39.700 --> 21:42.500]  It's like we don't all live in ranch houses.
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.340]  And-
[21:43.340 --> 21:44.180]  Well, how wouldn't it?
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.020]  It's a drone, right?
[21:45.020 --> 21:45.860]  So I mean, it could fly.
[21:45.860 --> 21:47.780]  It would have to have some kind of flight control,
[21:47.780 --> 21:49.220]  but it looked like it had that from the video, right?
[21:49.220 --> 21:51.140]  I guess, I don't know.
[21:51.140 --> 21:53.500]  There's so many ways that this could go wrong, right?
[21:53.500 --> 21:56.660]  Like, you know, like imagine if you get it,
[21:56.660 --> 21:58.540]  it comes out and you get one right away,
[21:58.540 --> 22:01.460]  and it's just like banging around like a drunk robot,
[22:01.460 --> 22:04.580]  you know, like banging into walls, hitting things.
[22:04.580 --> 22:05.940]  Well, I'm thinking about unintended things,
[22:05.940 --> 22:07.860]  like what if you have a dog or a cat, right?
[22:07.860 --> 22:11.540]  Like, I don't know, the drone rotors somehow,
[22:11.540 --> 22:12.580]  I don't know, who knows?
[22:12.580 --> 22:13.420]  But you know what I mean?
[22:13.420 --> 22:16.180]  Like it's like there's lots that can go wrong in the home.
[22:16.180 --> 22:19.220]  I would imagine dogs are not gonna be a fan of this thing,
[22:19.220 --> 22:21.220]  just based on my experience
[22:21.220 --> 22:24.660]  with what dogs are fans of and not-
[22:24.660 --> 22:26.500]  Oh, they're gonna go crazy over it.
[22:26.500 --> 22:28.940]  You're gonna start seeing like videos, you know,
[22:28.940 --> 22:32.740]  ring robot flying camera videos of my dog attacking it.
[22:32.740 --> 22:35.700]  I think drones are significantly quieter
[22:35.700 --> 22:37.340]  than vacuum cleaners, you know?
[22:37.340 --> 22:41.660]  Like the loudest drone is probably still quieter
[22:41.660 --> 22:43.380]  than, you know, a home drone.
[22:43.380 --> 22:45.420]  I'm not talking about like industrial strength stuff,
[22:45.420 --> 22:50.420]  but you know, the loudest drone you might conceivably fly
[22:50.660 --> 22:55.660]  inside your house is gonna be quieter than a vacuum cleaner.
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.860]  But it's on the spectrum of a vacuum, you know,
[23:00.860 --> 23:03.420]  what is it that dogs don't like about vacuum cleaners?
[23:03.420 --> 23:04.940]  And now to have one flying around,
[23:04.940 --> 23:08.020]  I feel like your dog is gonna be like, no way.
[23:08.020 --> 23:10.260]  That's just my answer, but I don't know.
[23:10.260 --> 23:11.100]  I gotta see it.
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.260]  It is fascinating.
[23:12.260 --> 23:13.100]  It really is.
[23:13.100 --> 23:15.820]  And the privacy angle I think is just amazing.
[23:15.820 --> 23:16.780]  And I think it's good.
[23:16.780 --> 23:17.660]  I don't think, you know,
[23:17.660 --> 23:19.260]  I think that's an interesting balance
[23:19.260 --> 23:21.540]  where it's like, you don't even have to,
[23:21.540 --> 23:24.300]  we don't have to, we'll talk to you about the technology
[23:24.300 --> 23:27.660]  of our privacy and how we're protecting your footage
[23:27.660 --> 23:29.740]  and blah, blah, blah, but you can know this.
[23:29.740 --> 23:31.180]  This is where the camera is.
[23:31.180 --> 23:33.220]  And therefore, when it's in the base station,
[23:33.220 --> 23:35.260]  the camera obviously can't see anything.
[23:36.340 --> 23:38.100]  Yeah, that's why I was saying with my ring products,
[23:38.100 --> 23:39.660]  which I've had for a while,
[23:39.660 --> 23:42.560]  I've always really felt like I'm as a developer
[23:42.560 --> 23:43.580]  and as a product guy,
[23:43.580 --> 23:45.540]  I always like kind of know how a company cares
[23:45.540 --> 23:47.300]  about security and they really,
[23:47.300 --> 23:49.740]  they always seem to make me being in control
[23:49.740 --> 23:51.180]  of what's shared or privacy.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.500]  And you know, yeah, they had some hiccups
[23:52.500 --> 23:54.040]  and they had to add two factor authentication
[23:54.040 --> 23:54.880]  and things like that.
[23:54.880 --> 23:57.140]  But I just feel like they've been really transparent
[23:57.140 --> 23:59.100]  about stuff, maybe not the police stuff.
[23:59.100 --> 23:59.940]  That's another topic,
[23:59.940 --> 24:04.460]  but to put one of the key industrial design features
[24:04.460 --> 24:06.540]  is that when it docks the cameras hidden
[24:06.540 --> 24:09.900]  and that communicates security and privacy so clearly,
[24:09.900 --> 24:10.860]  that's a big thumbs up.
[24:10.860 --> 24:11.960]  They did a great job.
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.140]  Here, let me take a break before we continue on with the show
[24:14.140 --> 24:18.260]  and I will do our first sponsored break.
[24:18.260 --> 24:20.260]  Hey, let me tell you guys about our good friends
[24:20.260 --> 24:21.700]  at Squarespace.
[24:21.700 --> 24:25.060]  Oh, do I love Squarespace and it is not just because
[24:25.060 --> 24:26.940]  they are a long time sponsor of the show.
[24:26.940 --> 24:31.340]  I love Squarespace because they have a fantastic service
[24:31.340 --> 24:32.740]  and product.
[24:32.740 --> 24:35.540]  Squarespace is your all-in-one website
[24:36.940 --> 24:40.860]  service and tool and design app.
[24:40.860 --> 24:44.020]  Everything you need from registering a domain name
[24:44.020 --> 24:46.820]  to picking the design of the site
[24:46.820 --> 24:51.540]  to all the features of the site and making it just right.
[24:51.540 --> 24:53.460]  Ah, all of it is at Squarespace.
[24:53.460 --> 24:54.980]  All of it is excellent.
[24:54.980 --> 24:57.740]  And all of it is amazingly affordable.
[24:57.740 --> 24:59.300]  Everything is right there.
[24:59.300 --> 25:01.060]  Sites look professionally designed regardless
[25:01.060 --> 25:01.900]  of your skill level.
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.500]  No coding required.
[25:03.500 --> 25:07.260]  But if you do have coding skills, you can get in there
[25:07.260 --> 25:09.500]  and do stuff at that level.
[25:09.500 --> 25:11.740]  It really does scale all the way from the,
[25:11.740 --> 25:14.860]  I don't even know the difference between HTML and CSS
[25:14.860 --> 25:17.460]  to somebody who knows how to write JavaScript.
[25:17.460 --> 25:20.100]  Anybody in that spectrum,
[25:20.100 --> 25:22.780]  Squarespace can be a great service for you.
[25:22.780 --> 25:26.620]  They have a great free trial you can check out.

[25:36.220 --> 25:39.220]  and you steer them to Squarespace, decides to sign up,
[25:39.220 --> 25:42.340]  just be sure to head to squarespace.com slash talk show

[25:50.340 --> 25:53.700]  My thanks to Squarespace for their continued support
[25:53.700 --> 25:54.980]  of the talk show.
[25:56.100 --> 26:00.180]  Let's just talk a little bit about Fantastic L and widgets
[26:00.180 --> 26:04.580]  and iOS 14 and just sort of-
[26:04.580 --> 26:05.620]  Oh, all right, if we have to.
[26:05.620 --> 26:06.620]  Basically the news.
[26:06.620 --> 26:07.620]  All right, come on.
[26:12.060 --> 26:13.820]  But I would say this.
[26:13.820 --> 26:20.380]  I would say, let me preface this discussion this way.
[26:20.380 --> 26:23.300]  In recent years, I'm not quite sure when it started,
[26:23.300 --> 26:27.700]  but Apple has, you know, with the public betas
[26:27.700 --> 26:31.380]  for summer releases, Apple's annual schedule
[26:31.380 --> 26:33.300]  has been locked in for quite a while
[26:33.300 --> 26:37.260]  where WWDC's June, they announce all their OS
[26:37.260 --> 26:39.020]  is for the year.
[26:39.020 --> 26:41.460]  They slate them for fall.
[26:41.460 --> 26:45.700]  September is the iOS month, and then Mac has some slack.
[26:45.700 --> 26:47.980]  We still don't know when Big Sur's gonna ship.
[26:49.860 --> 26:50.900]  But then all summer long,
[26:50.900 --> 26:52.660]  developers certainly use the betas
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.980]  because they're looking to update their apps
[26:54.980 --> 26:58.340]  to both support whatever new features
[26:58.340 --> 26:59.940]  they think they can support for launch
[26:59.940 --> 27:04.540]  and make sure everything doesn't break
[27:04.540 --> 27:08.860]  or look funny, you know, when the new OS hits,
[27:08.860 --> 27:12.620]  you know, fix any issues with old stuff
[27:12.620 --> 27:14.980]  and then add new stuff to support new features.
[27:16.180 --> 27:18.420]  Now they have public betas, so there's more people
[27:18.420 --> 27:20.980]  than ever maybe using these things.
[27:20.980 --> 27:25.980]  But when the actual OS is actually dropped to the public,
[27:27.420 --> 27:30.420]  I think it's always interesting to see what the reaction is.
[27:30.420 --> 27:34.420]  And I think it's often surprising.
[27:34.420 --> 27:37.220]  So I feel like this year, the big surprise
[27:37.220 --> 27:42.220]  is how enthusiastic the public is about widgets
[27:42.420 --> 27:46.300]  and shortcut customization for app icons.
[27:47.340 --> 27:48.820]  You know what I think the big surprise is?
[27:48.820 --> 27:49.820]  What do you think?
[27:50.780 --> 27:53.660]  iOS 14 launching the day after announcement.
[27:53.660 --> 27:55.580]  Well, we should talk about that.
[27:55.580 --> 27:57.180]  That's one of those things that sort of slipped
[27:57.180 --> 27:59.300]  through the cracks on Daring Fireball.
[27:59.300 --> 28:02.100]  But I know, I mean, that just does not,
[28:02.100 --> 28:04.380]  that's never happened before.
[28:04.380 --> 28:06.580]  Never, ever, ever happened before.
[28:06.580 --> 28:08.020]  All right, so let's talk about that.
[28:08.020 --> 28:12.380]  You know, what, how surprised were you at the end?
[28:12.380 --> 28:15.060]  Wasn't it at the very end of the event, too?
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.700]  It was like an hour-long event.
[28:16.700 --> 28:20.060]  They do the new products, and it's like, okay, back to Tim.
[28:20.060 --> 28:22.860]  And it's like Tim Cook in this hallway
[28:22.860 --> 28:26.300]  at the inner circle of the spaceship in Apple Park.
[28:26.300 --> 28:28.260]  And he's like, you know, I'm not gonna do
[28:28.260 --> 28:31.780]  a Tim Cook impression here, but what a great day.
[28:31.780 --> 28:34.100]  We've also got great OS launches.
[28:34.100 --> 28:36.860]  They're shipping tomorrow.
[28:37.780 --> 28:38.700]  See you next time.
[28:38.700 --> 28:41.980]  And every developer friend I know is like, what?
[28:43.660 --> 28:44.820]  Remember you started the podcast
[28:44.820 --> 28:46.220]  by saying I was high energy?
[28:47.100 --> 28:49.100]  You did not wanna be around me that day.
[28:50.420 --> 28:51.500]  And it was crazy,
[28:51.500 --> 28:53.140]  because speaking of the whole producer-director thing,
[28:53.140 --> 28:55.620]  we had everything dialed in.
[28:55.620 --> 28:57.660]  We were counting on that week.
[28:57.660 --> 28:58.860]  We had betas.
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.140]  Everything was ready to roll, right?
[29:00.140 --> 29:02.340]  Because if you see, we shipped our widgets a week later.
[29:02.340 --> 29:04.620]  We were ready.
[29:04.620 --> 29:06.740]  I know a lot of other developers' friends
[29:06.740 --> 29:08.740]  shipped on the day when, you know, next day.
[29:08.740 --> 29:09.580]  I get that.
[29:09.580 --> 29:11.020]  They wanted to get it out, be part of it.
[29:11.020 --> 29:11.860]  I get all that.
[29:11.860 --> 29:15.380]  But we just had to have it right.
[29:15.380 --> 29:17.380]  We couldn't ship with bugs and then just deal with it.
[29:17.380 --> 29:19.260]  You know, we suffer, maybe, maybe not.
[29:19.260 --> 29:23.740]  But it was really, really, really, really, really crazy, John.
[29:23.740 --> 29:28.740]  So I get it that this is an unusual year for Apple, right?
[29:29.060 --> 29:32.260]  Because of the reason it's unusual for all of us.
[29:32.260 --> 29:35.060]  And so there are, you know, because of COVID
[29:35.060 --> 29:37.140]  and whether it's a combination,
[29:37.140 --> 29:40.460]  probably some combination of Apple's own internal systems
[29:40.460 --> 29:45.460]  being slowed down in some ways by remote work,
[29:47.420 --> 29:49.300]  combined with everything
[29:49.300 --> 29:52.300]  affecting the supply chain in China.
[29:52.300 --> 29:55.820]  You know, if we get new iPhones in October,
[29:55.820 --> 29:56.940]  even by the end of October,
[29:56.940 --> 29:59.920]  it's almost a small miracle that they're only that late
[29:59.920 --> 30:03.100]  compared to the usual schedule of a, you know,
[30:03.100 --> 30:07.260]  September 10th, 12th-ish announcement, you know,
[30:07.260 --> 30:09.900]  and shipping by the end of September.
[30:09.900 --> 30:12.820]  And that's sort of the anchor on the calendar
[30:12.820 --> 30:15.060]  that ties the OS release to.
[30:15.060 --> 30:19.060]  And the normal schedule is these betas are coming out
[30:19.060 --> 30:21.860]  through August and you kind of get a sense.
[30:21.860 --> 30:24.260]  And last year was weird too, you know,
[30:24.260 --> 30:27.820]  where they kind of locked in iOS 13 early
[30:27.820 --> 30:30.380]  because it was buggy, really buggy,
[30:30.380 --> 30:33.640]  but they had to have an iOS 13 for the new devices.
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.300]  And it's just, it's all very complicated, right?
[30:37.300 --> 30:40.420]  It's like, I don't even know where to unwind it all here,
[30:40.420 --> 30:42.860]  telling it, you know, like where the new phones
[30:42.860 --> 30:46.420]  always are locked to the latest version, right?
[30:46.420 --> 30:49.300]  There is no, there's hardware that doesn't have drivers.
[30:49.300 --> 30:51.260]  Like they can't ship the new phones
[30:51.260 --> 30:53.300]  with the old version of the OS.
[30:54.420 --> 30:57.580]  So whatever new products like are coming out,
[30:57.580 --> 31:00.900]  have to have iOS 14, therefore iOS 14 has to ship
[31:00.900 --> 31:02.380]  come hell or high water.
[31:02.380 --> 31:05.040]  And like last year, that was a big problem.
[31:05.040 --> 31:07.460]  But they do, the general schedule is
[31:08.700 --> 31:12.020]  they announce what they call a GM,
[31:12.020 --> 31:14.300]  which is like a, you know, a golden master,
[31:14.300 --> 31:16.940]  which is a term of art from back
[31:16.940 --> 31:19.060]  when we were printing CDs.
[31:19.060 --> 31:22.180]  And I guess it goes back to the floppy era too, right?
[31:22.180 --> 31:24.100]  There'd be a golden master.
[31:24.100 --> 31:28.180]  But I think the actual gold master was a CD thing.
[31:28.180 --> 31:30.820]  They'd print the CD on gold because it was what,
[31:30.820 --> 31:32.740]  more durable, and then that's what they'd press
[31:32.740 --> 31:35.340]  all the gazillion CDs from.
[31:37.060 --> 31:39.280]  But they, you know, they have the GM release,
[31:39.280 --> 31:41.840]  but they would announce that at the event, right?
[31:41.840 --> 31:44.240]  That the normal schedule is roughly,
[31:44.240 --> 31:46.260]  okay, there's a Tuesday in September,
[31:46.260 --> 31:49.780]  and they say the GM, you know, release is coming out
[31:49.780 --> 31:51.500]  later today or tomorrow.
[31:51.500 --> 31:53.680]  Developers can start to finalize.
[31:53.680 --> 31:55.500]  This is what's going to ship.
[31:55.500 --> 31:59.260]  And then the actual OS release comes out like 10 days later,
[31:59.260 --> 32:02.260]  like on a Thursday, the day before the actual new iPhone
[32:02.260 --> 32:05.460]  start hitting customer hands, 11 days after the event.
[32:07.180 --> 32:09.860]  So as a, you know, and there's no rule, you know,
[32:09.860 --> 32:11.220]  and again, with all the, you know,
[32:11.220 --> 32:13.780]  you can draw comparisons to our national affairs
[32:13.780 --> 32:16.360]  and all of the things that aren't written in law,
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.780]  but we've just sort of assumed that's the way,
[32:18.780 --> 32:20.540]  that's the way it's always been.
[32:20.540 --> 32:22.860]  You know, the President of the United States
[32:22.860 --> 32:26.060]  doesn't call into question the integrity of our elections
[32:26.060 --> 32:28.020]  with no evidence.
[32:28.020 --> 32:28.860]  Exactly.
[32:28.860 --> 32:29.700]  Just the way it's always been, right?
[32:29.700 --> 32:30.660]  Right, it's just the way it's been.
[32:30.660 --> 32:34.220]  But, you know, technically there's no law against it, right?
[32:34.220 --> 32:38.180]  So Apple has always given developers, you know,
[32:38.180 --> 32:42.180]  a week plus of time with the GM release
[32:42.180 --> 32:45.780]  of an iOS update to prepare so that.
[32:45.780 --> 32:46.780]  Always.
[32:46.780 --> 32:47.600]  At least a week.
[32:47.600 --> 32:51.420]  So, you know, you can get your ones and zeros in order,
[32:51.420 --> 32:56.020]  and if you're trying to get into the App Store for day one,
[32:58.020 --> 33:00.220]  you know, you have a week or so to prepare,
[33:00.220 --> 33:03.860]  and this year, you did not.
[33:05.140 --> 33:07.840]  Exactly, you know, I've been, as you have been,
[33:07.840 --> 33:09.260]  working with Apple for a really long time,
[33:09.260 --> 33:10.500]  and the thing is this.
[33:10.500 --> 33:12.700]  I have my critiques and all my problems,
[33:12.700 --> 33:15.980]  but I think something happened, they had to do this.
[33:15.980 --> 33:19.300]  I have spoken to enough people that, you know,
[33:19.300 --> 33:20.940]  it's not like, oh, we don't care about developers,
[33:20.940 --> 33:23.220]  we're gonna get this out, we're gonna make them scramble,
[33:23.220 --> 33:24.220]  to heck with them, whatever.
[33:24.220 --> 33:25.740]  Like, I do think something happened.
[33:25.740 --> 33:26.740]  What, I don't know.
[33:26.740 --> 33:28.300]  What, it really is frustrating.
[33:28.300 --> 33:29.820]  What, this definitely impacted us,
[33:29.820 --> 33:31.940]  especially for a week having customers
[33:31.940 --> 33:33.260]  being so upset with us.
[33:33.260 --> 33:34.380]  Like, where's the widget, you know,
[33:34.380 --> 33:36.420]  thinking we're not releasing it, or we're never,
[33:36.420 --> 33:37.260]  I don't know, whatever.
[33:37.260 --> 33:39.420]  But like, to me, it's just,
[33:39.420 --> 33:41.040]  I hope this never happens again,
[33:41.040 --> 33:42.400]  and I hope that this happened.
[33:42.400 --> 33:45.140]  Apple can improve their procedures and policies
[33:45.140 --> 33:47.260]  and schedules, that it won't happen again,
[33:47.260 --> 33:49.860]  because it was a bad experience for everyone.
[33:49.860 --> 33:51.200]  If you look at all the other apps,
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.660]  look how many updates they had to scramble to get out
[33:53.660 --> 33:56.780]  after their, you know, 1.0, 2.0, whatever, for the widget,
[33:56.780 --> 33:58.640]  because there were all these bugs, right?
[33:58.640 --> 34:00.380]  So, yeah, they had it out on launch day,
[34:00.380 --> 34:01.220]  but what did it matter?
[34:01.220 --> 34:03.100]  Now they're scrambling over the next week,
[34:03.100 --> 34:04.900]  which we waited a week to release,
[34:04.900 --> 34:07.380]  to just get to where they were a week later anyway.
[34:07.380 --> 34:10.020]  Yeah, and it's like, why do developers
[34:10.020 --> 34:11.740]  want to be there on day one?
[34:11.740 --> 34:16.540]  And part of it is, I think, pride, you know,
[34:16.540 --> 34:18.260]  part of it is promotion, right?
[34:18.260 --> 34:20.860]  If you have new features, right?
[34:20.860 --> 34:23.820]  So, like, the new feature angle, let's say widgets, right,
[34:23.820 --> 34:26.380]  which are an altogether new feature.
[34:26.380 --> 34:28.640]  If you have spent a lot of time on widgets,
[34:28.640 --> 34:30.860]  you want to be there, and when people,
[34:30.860 --> 34:34.260]  users are upgrading and want to check out widgets,
[34:34.260 --> 34:36.700]  you'd like, and you've spent this whole summer
[34:36.700 --> 34:38.980]  working on them, you'd like them to be there right away.
[34:38.980 --> 34:42.460]  And then there's also that bug fix angle.
[34:42.460 --> 34:46.900]  Like, if your app has a layout bug
[34:46.900 --> 34:50.780]  in iOS 14 that's not there in iOS 13,
[34:50.780 --> 34:52.700]  and who cares, you know, let's not even say
[34:52.700 --> 34:55.140]  whether it's the OS's bug or your app's bug
[34:55.140 --> 34:56.780]  or just, you know, something changed,
[34:56.780 --> 34:58.420]  but it doesn't look right.
[34:58.420 --> 35:00.500]  There are certain bugs you can't fix
[35:00.500 --> 35:03.500]  until the new OS comes out, right?
[35:03.500 --> 35:05.100]  You can't fix it in advance
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.620]  because you might have to actually have the new SDK,
[35:08.620 --> 35:11.620]  and you can't submit builds to the App Store
[35:11.620 --> 35:14.260]  with the latest SDK until the OS is out.
[35:14.260 --> 35:17.900]  Right, and you can't even submit a build for iOS 14
[35:17.900 --> 35:20.660]  until the GM of Xcode is out to submit anyway.
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.740]  So it wasn't even like you could submit
[35:22.740 --> 35:25.380]  until Apple released that Xcode GM build.
[35:25.380 --> 35:27.540]  Right, right, so from a, yeah, that's a good,
[35:27.540 --> 35:28.380]  that's a great point.
[35:28.380 --> 35:32.540]  So the developers need the latest version of Xcode
[35:32.540 --> 35:34.980]  to build the thing to submit it.
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.900]  You can't do it, and there was confusion.
[35:36.900 --> 35:41.540]  This was so Helter Skelter, slapdash,
[35:41.540 --> 35:42.740]  I don't know what to call it,
[35:42.740 --> 35:45.780]  where there was actually some confusion after the event
[35:45.780 --> 35:49.020]  where there were two builds of Xcode
[35:49.020 --> 35:52.220]  off with these real long, crazy version numbers,
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.940]  but off by one, and if you,
[35:53.940 --> 35:58.940]  and it was maybe even like a CDN thing,
[35:59.540 --> 36:00.980]  a content delivery network thing
[36:00.980 --> 36:03.700]  where some people would click to download the latest Xcode
[36:03.700 --> 36:05.100]  but get the wrong version,
[36:05.100 --> 36:06.180]  and they clicked the same thing
[36:06.180 --> 36:08.300]  that somebody in California clicked
[36:08.300 --> 36:10.140]  and got a newer version,
[36:10.140 --> 36:11.580]  and two people who thought they had
[36:11.580 --> 36:13.580]  the same new version of Xcode,
[36:13.580 --> 36:17.540]  only one of them could build and ship an executable
[36:17.540 --> 36:20.300]  that could be submitted to the app store.
[36:20.300 --> 36:21.140]  That's correct, and as you know,
[36:21.140 --> 36:22.660]  it takes a long time to build an app
[36:22.660 --> 36:24.100]  and distribute it, right?
[36:24.100 --> 36:27.860]  So you're spending all this time to download Xcode,
[36:27.860 --> 36:30.140]  you're not realizing it's that off by one number,
[36:30.140 --> 36:31.540]  you're building it, you're spending all this time,
[36:31.540 --> 36:33.540]  you're submitting it, it's like, nope, not with the GM,
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.380]  and you're like, what?
[36:34.380 --> 36:36.660]  And then thankfully, Twitter and all of our friends
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.740]  in the developer community figured out what it was.
[36:38.740 --> 36:41.900]  Right, it's sort of, some aspect of this,
[36:41.900 --> 36:44.420]  even if you have a really good build system in place,
[36:44.420 --> 36:48.380]  it still is like baking a cake or a casserole or something,
[36:48.380 --> 36:50.460]  and it's like, you gotta do the whole thing first,
[36:50.460 --> 36:52.660]  and only when it comes out of the oven do you find out
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.660]  that you had the wrong version of the cake mix,
[36:54.660 --> 36:57.780]  you gotta throw this one out and start all over.
[36:57.780 --> 36:59.300]  And when you're trying to do this thing
[36:59.300 --> 37:01.820]  and hit a deadline that's under 24 hours away
[37:01.820 --> 37:03.780]  when you thought you'd have a week,
[37:03.780 --> 37:06.860]  losing an hour or two hours to this is a lot of time.
[37:06.860 --> 37:09.940]  And I think it was more than an hour or two,
[37:09.940 --> 37:12.540]  I mean, based on some of the tweets I was, yeah,
[37:12.540 --> 37:14.420]  the point still stands, absolutely.
[37:14.420 --> 37:18.220]  The whole thing was very haphazard and not good.
[37:18.220 --> 37:20.380]  So I want, so why, you know, here's the big question.
[37:20.380 --> 37:25.380]  So with the hardware stuff, the actual products,
[37:26.020 --> 37:30.820]  the new Series 6 watch, the new iPad, and the,
[37:32.300 --> 37:34.900]  every time I say the word, something is wrong with me,
[37:34.900 --> 37:38.580]  I say Series, like the name of the watch,
[37:38.580 --> 37:41.420]  and every device in my house kicks in with,
[37:41.420 --> 37:45.220]  you know, who's voice assistant, sorry.
[37:46.220 --> 37:48.340]  I'm really, anyway.
[37:48.340 --> 37:50.900]  I kinda like it, actually, it kinda like is a wake-up call.
[37:50.900 --> 37:55.900]  Your S6 Apple Watch, the new iPad, the new iPad Air.
[37:55.980 --> 37:58.140]  All right, even though the, you know,
[37:58.140 --> 38:01.260]  I get it that Apple is always gonna wanna keep hardware
[38:01.260 --> 38:04.860]  under wraps, even if there are leaks that are accurate
[38:04.860 --> 38:07.180]  there, that's just how Apple is, I don't blame them.
[38:07.180 --> 38:10.460]  And part of that is that the actual,
[38:12.020 --> 38:15.580]  but the release of the OS isn't part of that secrecy, right?
[38:15.580 --> 38:19.540]  Like what would have stopped Apple from a week before
[38:19.540 --> 38:22.420]  not holding an event, not something that's like,
[38:22.420 --> 38:25.540]  hey, whole world, look at us, but just put it
[38:25.540 --> 38:28.260]  on developer.apple.com and tell developers
[38:28.260 --> 38:30.780]  in the same way that like when they go from Beta 7
[38:30.780 --> 38:34.500]  to Beta 8, just say, okay, this is the GM release
[38:34.500 --> 38:38.740]  of iOS 14, you know, be prepared for this to ship
[38:38.740 --> 38:42.100]  in the next two weeks or next week, you know.
[38:42.980 --> 38:44.500]  There was either something hidden in it
[38:44.500 --> 38:46.460]  that no one's found yet, like just something,
[38:46.460 --> 38:48.220]  I don't know, right, like it might not be obvious now
[38:48.220 --> 38:50.220]  because it's out, right, so I don't know.
[38:50.220 --> 38:53.580]  Or, and, or, I don't just think it's Apple's style.
[38:53.580 --> 38:56.140]  In other words, what if something happened at the event?
[38:56.140 --> 38:57.580]  What if, I don't know, right, like,
[38:57.580 --> 38:59.540]  but I don't see Apple doing that,
[38:59.540 --> 39:01.060]  and I don't blame them for not doing that.
[39:01.060 --> 39:03.020]  I believe it or not, even with the week notice,
[39:03.020 --> 39:04.060]  because I'd be like, well, why didn't they release
[39:04.060 --> 39:04.900]  it a week earlier?
[39:04.900 --> 39:06.660]  I can understand why they didn't.
[39:06.660 --> 39:08.940]  What I don't get is why couldn't they have still
[39:08.940 --> 39:11.140]  delayed it a week, and even with the new hardware
[39:11.140 --> 39:13.820]  that was coming out, okay, yes, I know you need it
[39:13.820 --> 39:16.220]  on the servers for stuff and this and that,
[39:16.220 --> 39:19.100]  but I don't know, there just could have been
[39:19.100 --> 39:21.220]  a little bit better mitigation of like,
[39:22.060 --> 39:24.260]  iOS 14 will be available in a week if you're buying
[39:24.260 --> 39:25.940]  one of the new devices, you know,
[39:25.940 --> 39:27.020]  there might be some hiccups.
[39:27.020 --> 39:28.620]  I know you can't really put that into a message
[39:28.620 --> 39:31.580]  that's pretty, but I feel like there could have been
[39:31.580 --> 39:34.580]  a little bit of a way to delay that release still a week.
[39:34.580 --> 39:36.780]  I feel like there really could have been.
[39:36.780 --> 39:39.580]  I do wonder, and this is a total spitball.
[39:39.580 --> 39:41.100]  I don't have anybody who's told me
[39:41.100 --> 39:42.380]  there's any validity to this.
[39:42.380 --> 39:46.380]  Maybe I'm just crazy, but one thing people observed
[39:46.380 --> 39:50.820]  in the video was that all of the scenes of Apple Park,
[39:50.820 --> 39:52.220]  and there's a lot of them, you know,
[39:52.220 --> 39:54.100]  because they shoot there and sort of emphasize
[39:54.100 --> 39:59.100]  the sunny California climate, that event came
[40:00.540 --> 40:04.540]  at the tail end of some truly horrific smoke
[40:05.780 --> 40:09.940]  in the air scenes all throughout that area of California.
[40:09.940 --> 40:12.140]  People are like, how did they get all this sun?
[40:12.140 --> 40:15.580]  Did they, you know, I guess the idea, you know, speculation,
[40:15.580 --> 40:18.860]  which isn't crazy, is that they filmed those scenes
[40:18.860 --> 40:21.700]  weeks prior, right, that these things aren't,
[40:21.700 --> 40:22.860]  of course they're not live.
[40:22.860 --> 40:24.100]  You can tell by watching that these
[40:24.100 --> 40:26.780]  aren't live productions, but they probably have
[40:26.780 --> 40:31.780]  a bit more of a headroom than a casual observer might think.
[40:33.700 --> 40:35.940]  I actually think they should shoot it weeks before, right?
[40:35.940 --> 40:37.100]  Well, there's no reason not to, right?
[40:37.100 --> 40:39.420]  Well, but I wonder, so here's where I'm wondering,
[40:39.420 --> 40:44.420]  is I'm wondering if Apple was vaguely worried
[40:44.860 --> 40:49.380]  that they might need to delay the whole announcement
[40:49.380 --> 40:53.020]  and the event because of the fires, right?
[40:53.020 --> 40:56.740]  And or did they maybe originally think
[40:56.740 --> 40:58.540]  they would have it the week before
[40:58.540 --> 40:59.500]  and thought we should push,
[40:59.500 --> 41:04.500]  maybe they did push it back a week, and I don't know.
[41:05.060 --> 41:06.620]  That's reason, no, no, that fits, that fits,
[41:06.620 --> 41:08.540]  because to have that also during the fire
[41:08.540 --> 41:10.300]  where people are worried and maybe even people
[41:10.300 --> 41:12.220]  were out of their homes and it was very scary
[41:12.220 --> 41:13.780]  and then it looks bad, the optics are bad
[41:13.780 --> 41:15.500]  in terms of like doing the announcement that week
[41:15.500 --> 41:18.100]  and people aren't around and maybe they had to push it out
[41:18.100 --> 41:20.140]  and that was the week we would have gotten.
[41:20.140 --> 41:23.340]  Maybe, and that part of this week,
[41:23.340 --> 41:26.660]  and that is, I know one reason, among many,
[41:26.660 --> 41:29.420]  but one reason Apple doesn't announce any of these events
[41:29.420 --> 41:32.140]  until much later than other companies.
[41:32.140 --> 41:35.740]  I mean, even WWDC, even in normal years,
[41:35.740 --> 41:39.100]  they announce the date for their developer conference
[41:39.100 --> 41:42.180]  that attracts thousands of developers from around the world
[41:42.180 --> 41:44.100]  and the around the world aspect
[41:44.100 --> 41:47.020]  is greater than ever historically,
[41:47.020 --> 41:51.180]  which involves tremendous amounts of travel commitments,
[41:51.180 --> 41:55.180]  right, if you're traveling from Asia or Australia
[41:55.180 --> 41:59.380]  or even Europe, the cost and complexity
[41:59.380 --> 42:03.060]  of booking a week of travel to California is significant
[42:03.060 --> 42:06.300]  and the earlier you could do it, the better it would be
[42:06.300 --> 42:08.100]  and probably the cheaper too,
[42:09.100 --> 42:12.540]  but they kind of hold their powder until the last minute
[42:12.540 --> 42:15.060]  and I think part of it is because they're Apple,
[42:15.060 --> 42:16.940]  it's just their nature and part of it is because,
[42:16.940 --> 42:18.580]  well, you never know, right?
[42:18.580 --> 42:23.300]  And so this year, they never delayed WWDC.
[42:23.300 --> 42:25.100]  We think of it as being delayed
[42:25.100 --> 42:28.980]  because it came several weeks later than it usually is,
[42:28.980 --> 42:32.620]  but they never had to cancel the in-person WWDC,
[42:32.620 --> 42:34.460]  they never had to change the dates
[42:34.460 --> 42:36.940]  because they never actually announced them, right?
[42:36.940 --> 42:40.900]  I mean, we know that they had the, whatever the name is,
[42:40.900 --> 42:43.180]  the San Jose Convention Center booked,
[42:43.180 --> 42:46.020]  we know that if it hadn't been for COVID,
[42:46.020 --> 42:47.860]  it almost certainly would have been
[42:47.860 --> 42:50.260]  like the second Monday of June
[42:50.260 --> 42:53.940]  would have been the beginning of WWDC in San Jose,
[42:53.940 --> 42:56.140]  but because they didn't ever announce it,
[42:56.140 --> 42:58.100]  they never had to postpone it
[42:58.100 --> 43:00.420]  and so they don't announce these press events
[43:00.420 --> 43:03.220]  until like a week before and I think part of it maybe
[43:03.220 --> 43:05.980]  was trying to wait out the fire
[43:05.980 --> 43:08.140]  because it would just be so inappropriate
[43:08.140 --> 43:13.060]  to have this, here we are in Cupertino in sunny California,
[43:13.060 --> 43:18.060]  while this actual skies are a hellscape orange, right?
[43:18.340 --> 43:19.460]  It just, you know.
[43:19.460 --> 43:22.540]  It certainly is poor optics, I agree with you.
[43:22.540 --> 43:25.220]  And you know, and then my thinking along these lines
[43:25.220 --> 43:29.940]  is somebody would raise their hand in this discussion
[43:29.940 --> 43:32.020]  and say, well, wait, what about developers?
[43:32.020 --> 43:33.420]  You know, they're gonna wanna know
[43:33.420 --> 43:35.620]  and that the basic decision was,
[43:35.620 --> 43:38.700]  well, we'll just ship the day after the event,
[43:38.700 --> 43:43.220]  whenever it is in tough noogies, you know, and that's it.
[43:43.220 --> 43:45.420]  And that's sort of what happened.
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.260]  Yeah, it could be.
[43:46.260 --> 43:48.220]  Either way, it was definitely out of character for them
[43:48.220 --> 43:51.100]  and definitely, definitely very bad for developers.
[43:51.100 --> 43:53.580]  And I wouldn't even say bad for users
[43:53.580 --> 43:54.580]  at the end of the day, right?
[43:54.580 --> 43:57.380]  Because there was so much like there were bugs,
[43:57.380 --> 43:59.300]  there was confusion, there were things being late,
[43:59.300 --> 44:02.220]  there were developers like us that didn't ship on time.
[44:02.220 --> 44:06.020]  Just saying, it was definitely a very difficult release.
[44:06.020 --> 44:07.660]  Chaotic maybe, right?
[44:07.660 --> 44:08.500]  Absolutely.
[44:08.500 --> 44:09.500]  And I would say overall,
[44:09.500 --> 44:12.820]  iOS 14 is definitely better than iOS 13.0.
[44:12.820 --> 44:13.660]  I mean, remember last year,
[44:13.660 --> 44:17.380]  iOS 13 was only out for like five days before iOS 13.1.
[44:17.380 --> 44:18.980]  I mean, it was like five days.
[44:18.980 --> 44:21.260]  I mean, it was very confusing.
[44:21.260 --> 44:25.700]  And even iOS 13.1 was by the general standards
[44:25.700 --> 44:30.380]  of first releases of major new OSes, pretty buggy.
[44:31.820 --> 44:33.660]  Yeah, iOS 14's, believe it or not,
[44:33.660 --> 44:35.580]  been quite stable and quite good.
[44:35.580 --> 44:37.180]  Yeah, there's bugs, especially with widgets.
[44:37.180 --> 44:40.780]  And they're fixing them and we're fixing them and other.
[44:40.780 --> 44:42.140]  Just, it's very solid.
[44:42.140 --> 44:42.980]  I agree with you.
[44:42.980 --> 44:43.820]  I've run into some things.
[44:43.820 --> 44:47.420]  I use sharing sheets a lot, a lot.
[44:47.420 --> 44:49.500]  Yes, me too, they're broken.
[44:49.500 --> 44:52.700]  Yeah, I've run into some things all summer long
[44:52.700 --> 44:54.820]  and it seems like they've fixed some of them,
[44:54.820 --> 44:56.740]  but I still run into it sometimes.
[44:56.740 --> 44:58.740]  But an app can get locked.
[44:58.740 --> 45:03.740]  It almost feels like a throwback to a long time ago,
[45:03.860 --> 45:05.380]  maybe even before the iPhone.
[45:05.380 --> 45:07.860]  But like an app can, with a share sheet open,
[45:07.860 --> 45:11.820]  if you, I still can't get it reproducible,
[45:11.820 --> 45:13.860]  but I'd be trying to use a sharing extension
[45:13.860 --> 45:16.460]  and then all of a sudden the share sheet is there.
[45:16.460 --> 45:18.900]  Nothing on screen is tappable, right?
[45:18.900 --> 45:20.180]  It's just like a screenshot.
[45:20.180 --> 45:21.140]  A blank share sheet.
[45:21.140 --> 45:22.300]  Well, it's not blank.
[45:22.300 --> 45:24.820]  I can see stuff, but it doesn't do anything.
[45:24.820 --> 45:25.860]  It's like a.
[45:25.860 --> 45:26.700]  I've seen it where it's blank.
[45:26.700 --> 45:29.180]  It's as though the whole app is a screenshot, right?
[45:29.180 --> 45:32.740]  It just, nothing, I can't make it go away.
[45:32.740 --> 45:34.300]  There's no way to dismiss it.
[45:34.300 --> 45:36.820]  I can switch to other apps and if I switch back,
[45:36.820 --> 45:38.380]  it's still there in this state
[45:38.380 --> 45:40.980]  and the only way to get out is to force quit the app.
[45:40.980 --> 45:42.340]  Oh yeah, I've had this with Slack.
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.620]  So if I try to share like, let's say,
[45:43.620 --> 45:45.660]  a crash log with one of my teammates,
[45:45.660 --> 45:48.100]  after the share happens, the whole screen freezes
[45:48.100 --> 45:49.620]  and you literally can't tap anything
[45:49.620 --> 45:51.100]  and then you have to force quit the app like you said.
[45:51.100 --> 45:51.940]  Right, exactly.
[45:51.940 --> 45:52.780]  I've had that too.
[45:52.780 --> 45:54.100]  I've seen it in a couple apps.
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.060]  And it's just.
[45:56.060 --> 45:57.940]  I think it might be the app not being ready for,
[45:57.940 --> 45:59.620]  like I think there's probably something that updated,
[45:59.620 --> 46:01.140]  got updated with share sheets
[46:01.140 --> 46:04.020]  and the app like Slack isn't aware of how to like say,
[46:04.020 --> 46:07.660]  okay, I got it and close the, you know, close the value.
[46:07.660 --> 46:10.420]  I think it's probably that
[46:10.420 --> 46:12.260]  because some apps it works fine, right?
[46:12.260 --> 46:15.580]  Yeah, and I do think it's gotten better throughout August.
[46:15.580 --> 46:18.100]  It was a real problem for me like early August.
[46:19.260 --> 46:21.860]  More so on iPad, but you know,
[46:21.860 --> 46:22.740]  it seems like it's gotten better,
[46:22.740 --> 46:25.380]  but I still run into it even with the shipping version
[46:25.380 --> 46:30.380]  of iOS 14 on iPhone and iPad, but overall it's better.
[46:30.380 --> 46:33.700]  But it really, what a weird, what a weird release.
[46:34.900 --> 46:35.740]  But anyway.
[46:35.740 --> 46:36.580]  New release indeed.
[46:36.580 --> 46:39.580]  Widgets, people are nuts for widgets and the other thing.
[46:39.580 --> 46:40.420]  Nuts for widgets.
[46:40.420 --> 46:43.500]  And it's related because it's about customizing
[46:43.500 --> 46:46.380]  the same area of the app, the home screen.
[46:46.380 --> 46:49.580]  People are nuts for this new ability in shortcuts
[46:49.580 --> 46:53.620]  where you can make a shortcut that just launches an app.
[46:53.620 --> 46:58.180]  And then the shortcut, you can assign any icon you want.
[46:58.180 --> 47:02.460]  So what you could do is take let's say Fantastical
[47:02.460 --> 47:06.340]  and you could put Fantastical in your app library
[47:06.340 --> 47:09.700]  and then make a shortcut that launches Fantastical.
[47:09.700 --> 47:12.100]  Name the shortcut Fantastical
[47:12.100 --> 47:16.940]  and put a picture of Michael Simmons on the thing.
[47:16.940 --> 47:17.980]  And now all of a sudden.
[47:17.980 --> 47:19.060]  I was thinking John Gruber.
[47:19.060 --> 47:19.900]  Right.
[47:19.900 --> 47:20.740]  All right, either way.
[47:20.740 --> 47:23.420]  You know, put a picture of you or me.
[47:23.420 --> 47:25.420]  And now all of a sudden the way, you know,
[47:25.420 --> 47:26.580]  it looks like, you know,
[47:26.580 --> 47:28.260]  and you have an icon on your home screen
[47:28.260 --> 47:29.460]  that says Fantastical.
[47:29.460 --> 47:33.460]  It's a picture of me or it's a picture of you or whatever.
[47:33.460 --> 47:36.060]  And you tap it and it launches Fantastical.
[47:36.060 --> 47:39.860]  And it's as though you've customized the icon
[47:39.860 --> 47:42.700]  of Fantastical to whatever icon you want.
[47:42.700 --> 47:44.540]  Some people are going nuts for this
[47:44.540 --> 47:49.300]  and having tons of fun and doing, you know, entire themes.
[47:49.300 --> 47:51.340]  You know, I saw somebody posted a screenshot
[47:51.340 --> 47:54.220]  where they replaced the icon
[47:54.220 --> 47:57.500]  for all of their first screen apps
[47:57.500 --> 48:00.900]  with a photo of the CEO of the company behind the app.
[48:00.900 --> 48:03.980]  So like their Apple apps all had a picture of Tim Cook.
[48:03.980 --> 48:06.300]  The Amazon ones had a picture of Bezos.
[48:06.300 --> 48:09.860]  The Google apps they use had Sundar Pichai, et cetera.
[48:09.860 --> 48:13.780]  You know, Facebook and Instagram had pictures of Zuckerberg.
[48:13.780 --> 48:14.980]  People are going nuts for this.
[48:14.980 --> 48:19.220]  And then combine it with, of course, home screen widgets,
[48:19.220 --> 48:21.220]  which is another way to, you know,
[48:21.220 --> 48:23.740]  decorate and customize your own thing.
[48:23.740 --> 48:25.820]  People are going nuts for it.
[48:25.820 --> 48:27.860]  And I'm not surprised.
[48:27.860 --> 48:29.660]  And I think the reason I'm not surprised
[48:29.660 --> 48:32.580]  is I remember the 90s on the Mac.
[48:33.500 --> 48:36.740]  And that people loved doing stuff like that.
[48:36.740 --> 48:39.020]  And I feel like we've been in an era
[48:39.020 --> 48:41.020]  where that sort of customization
[48:41.020 --> 48:43.300]  just isn't even technically possible,
[48:43.300 --> 48:45.380]  let alone support it, right?
[48:45.380 --> 48:48.460]  It just wasn't even possible that people,
[48:48.460 --> 48:50.140]  and maybe it's younger people
[48:50.140 --> 48:51.460]  and maybe people who weren't around
[48:51.460 --> 48:53.940]  for the classic Mac era, or maybe, I don't know,
[48:53.940 --> 48:56.100]  maybe there was, I guess there was similar stuff
[48:56.100 --> 48:59.300]  for Windows back in the day, you know,
[48:59.300 --> 49:01.140]  like the way that you could customize Winamp
[49:01.140 --> 49:02.780]  and all the various MP3 players.
[49:02.780 --> 49:04.380]  No, totally.
[49:04.380 --> 49:05.220]  People forget about it.
[49:05.220 --> 49:06.860]  You just reminded me of,
[49:06.860 --> 49:09.260]  you just totally gave me a flashback to college
[49:09.260 --> 49:10.420]  where a friend of mine, believe it or not,
[49:10.420 --> 49:11.700]  I wasn't into Mac my whole life.
[49:11.700 --> 49:14.420]  I was an Amiga guy, you know, like a Commodore 64 Amiga guy.
[49:14.420 --> 49:16.620]  And when I got into college, a friend of mine had a Mac.
[49:16.620 --> 49:19.220]  And on his Mac, he had his hard drive customized
[49:19.220 --> 49:21.260]  with a BMW icon.
[49:21.260 --> 49:22.300]  And I remember when I saw that,
[49:22.300 --> 49:23.380]  I was just like, that's so cool.
[49:23.380 --> 49:25.460]  No, really, it's still in my brain
[49:25.460 --> 49:26.940]  where I just remember at that moment being like,
[49:26.940 --> 49:28.740]  how did you do that, right?
[49:28.740 --> 49:30.740]  And that's what I think is going on here, right?
[49:30.740 --> 49:32.740]  It's the personalization, customization
[49:32.740 --> 49:35.420]  of your device to whatever you're into.
[49:35.420 --> 49:37.900]  Right, and I've seen, and again,
[49:37.900 --> 49:38.740]  this is one of those things
[49:38.740 --> 49:40.380]  I haven't really written about on Daring Fireball.
[49:40.380 --> 49:43.820]  My opinion is go everybody, go.
[49:43.820 --> 49:46.660]  Do what you wanna do, have fun with it.
[49:46.660 --> 49:48.980]  I know some people are thinking,
[49:48.980 --> 49:50.500]  oh my God, I've seen all these screenshots.
[49:50.500 --> 49:52.740]  They're so ugly, this shouldn't be allowed.
[49:52.740 --> 49:54.100]  This is terrible.
[49:54.100 --> 49:55.380]  These people have no taste.
[49:55.380 --> 49:56.660]  This is awful.
[49:59.100 --> 50:00.940]  It's their phone, it's their device, right?
[50:00.940 --> 50:01.780]  So it can look like whatever they want.
[50:01.780 --> 50:04.140]  I've seen people thinking that brand managers
[50:04.140 --> 50:05.700]  that these companies are gonna be upset
[50:05.700 --> 50:07.100]  and they're gonna complain like,
[50:07.100 --> 50:11.860]  hey, we spent all this time on our fancy black square
[50:11.860 --> 50:15.340]  with a white U Uber logo for our Uber icon
[50:15.340 --> 50:17.100]  and now people are replacing it.
[50:18.900 --> 50:20.300]  I think they're overreacting.
[50:20.300 --> 50:24.340]  I think that, again, they're not changing your phone.
[50:24.340 --> 50:25.260]  They're changing their own.
[50:25.260 --> 50:28.140]  It's like getting upset that people put stickers
[50:28.140 --> 50:32.060]  over the brand logo on the back of their laptop screens.
[50:35.100 --> 50:35.940]  If anything.
[50:35.940 --> 50:36.780]  Yeah, I think you've changed my mind.
[50:36.780 --> 50:37.620]  I think you've changed my mind
[50:37.620 --> 50:39.340]  because seriously, I was looking at a lot
[50:39.340 --> 50:41.500]  of these screenshots going, oh, these are kind of terrible.
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.700]  But no, I really, I think you changed my mind.
[50:43.700 --> 50:45.420]  I think it's like, it's their device.
[50:45.420 --> 50:46.380]  If that's what makes them happy,
[50:46.380 --> 50:49.180]  like putting a BMW logo on their hard drive, right,
[50:49.180 --> 50:50.780]  then let them be happy, right?
[50:50.780 --> 50:51.620]  It makes them happy.
[50:51.620 --> 50:52.740]  It makes them unique.
[50:54.260 --> 50:55.140]  I totally think so.
[50:55.140 --> 50:58.220]  And I just remember back in the day that,
[50:58.220 --> 51:01.100]  my God, customizing your hard drive icon
[51:01.100 --> 51:02.220]  was the least of it.
[51:02.220 --> 51:05.020]  I mean, we, on the Mac, we had extensions
[51:05.020 --> 51:06.340]  that did crazy stuff.
[51:08.420 --> 51:09.380]  I remember the trash can.
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.100]  I know we had talked about this a while back.
[51:11.100 --> 51:11.940]  Oscar the Grouch.
[51:11.940 --> 51:14.060]  That was my favorite, man.
[51:14.060 --> 51:14.900]  I love that.
[51:14.900 --> 51:15.740]  Oh, Oscar.
[51:15.740 --> 51:17.140]  But we had extensions.
[51:17.140 --> 51:18.500]  There was one called,
[51:18.500 --> 51:19.540]  I'm gonna forget this.
[51:19.540 --> 51:20.780]  I actually should have done the work.
[51:20.780 --> 51:25.380]  But you remember the way that the BOS looked?
[51:25.380 --> 51:28.700]  This was the John Oegasi's B company.
[51:28.700 --> 51:31.740]  And they had a, it was a very Mac-like interface.
[51:32.700 --> 51:35.020]  But their window style were,
[51:35.020 --> 51:38.980]  the big difference was that their top of their windows,
[51:38.980 --> 51:42.020]  the title bars, which we've kind of gotten away from overall
[51:42.020 --> 51:44.140]  but back when title bars were title bars,
[51:44.140 --> 51:46.580]  theirs were tab-shaped as opposed to going
[51:46.580 --> 51:48.740]  the full width of the window.
[51:48.740 --> 51:49.580]  And so.
[51:49.580 --> 51:50.780]  That's right.
[51:50.780 --> 51:52.820]  You know, and if you, they're just like,
[51:52.820 --> 51:54.260]  they'd look like folder tabs.
[51:54.260 --> 51:57.100]  And they would grow to the length of the name of the thing.
[51:57.100 --> 52:00.980]  So if you had a document named Michael
[52:00.980 --> 52:04.660]  and I had a document and my copy was,
[52:04.660 --> 52:07.780]  Michael is a big fat idiot,
[52:07.780 --> 52:11.180]  my tab would be longer because my file name is longer
[52:11.180 --> 52:12.300]  and yours would be shorter
[52:12.300 --> 52:14.900]  because it would just shrink to fit the name Michael.
[52:14.900 --> 52:17.980]  But anyway, there were extensions for the Mac
[52:17.980 --> 52:19.900]  that would you just, I forget what it was called,
[52:19.900 --> 52:22.340]  but it was, it would just turn all your windows,
[52:22.340 --> 52:24.700]  it would just, you'd put this extension in your folder,
[52:24.700 --> 52:26.780]  restart, and then all of a sudden,
[52:26.780 --> 52:28.660]  when you restarted, all of your Mac windows
[52:28.660 --> 52:30.020]  looked like B windows.
[52:31.540 --> 52:32.620]  I remember that one too.
[52:32.620 --> 52:33.740]  And then of course you remember,
[52:33.740 --> 52:35.380]  I can't forget Conflicatcher,
[52:35.380 --> 52:37.660]  which then managed all the extensions, right?
[52:37.660 --> 52:39.700]  His name was Greg Landweber, I remember.
[52:39.700 --> 52:41.620]  I don't remember the name of the first version of.
[52:41.620 --> 52:43.300]  God, that name totally rings a bell.
[52:43.300 --> 52:44.340]  Right, Greg Landweber.
[52:44.340 --> 52:46.180]  And then he collaborated with someone
[52:46.180 --> 52:49.740]  and they turned it into something called ARIN, I believe.
[52:49.740 --> 52:50.580]  That's my memory of it.
[52:50.580 --> 52:52.260]  Oh, ARIN, ARIN, that's right.
[52:52.260 --> 52:53.380]  Yeah, because of Copeland, right?
[52:53.380 --> 52:54.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[52:54.820 --> 52:57.820]  ARIN was an extension that took what they did,
[52:57.820 --> 53:00.500]  the first version made it look like one way
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.540]  and one way only, exactly like B,
[53:02.540 --> 53:05.300]  and ARIN made it so that you could style your windows
[53:05.300 --> 53:07.660]  to look however you wanted them to look.
[53:07.660 --> 53:08.500]  And you're being.
[53:08.500 --> 53:10.700]  Right, and then Kaleidoscope, right, Arlo Rose?
[53:10.700 --> 53:13.060]  I'm starting to remember the whole path of all this, right?
[53:13.060 --> 53:14.620]  Well, Kaleidoscope, though, was different, though,
[53:14.620 --> 53:16.460]  because it wasn't about changing all of your windows.
[53:16.460 --> 53:19.140]  It was, Kaleidoscope were like widgets, you know.
[53:19.140 --> 53:21.780]  They called them gadgets, I think, remember?
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.380]  Okay, but it didn't change window themes and stuff?
[53:24.380 --> 53:27.140]  I forget, it might have been a different Kaleidoscope.
[53:27.140 --> 53:28.980]  Back to ARIN, though, because ARIN was cool now,
[53:28.980 --> 53:29.820]  I'm remembering.
[53:29.820 --> 53:30.660]  Yeah, but Arlo Rose had definitely
[53:30.660 --> 53:31.860]  had something to do with this.
[53:31.860 --> 53:34.420]  He might have been his collaborator on ARIN,
[53:34.420 --> 53:35.580]  now that I think about it.
[53:35.580 --> 53:39.100]  But anyway, the basic idea was you could get an extension
[53:39.100 --> 53:40.980]  and then it would customize everything,
[53:40.980 --> 53:42.820]  make the buttons look different, the menus,
[53:42.820 --> 53:47.100]  the colors, and none of this was supported by Apple.
[53:47.100 --> 53:51.620]  You know, it was all sort of hacking the OS.
[53:51.620 --> 53:55.380]  And then Apple sort of saw the enthusiasm
[53:55.380 --> 53:59.660]  people had for this and built into classic Mac OS
[53:59.660 --> 54:02.140]  something called the Appearance Manager,
[54:02.140 --> 54:05.180]  where they could have Appearance Manager extensions
[54:05.180 --> 54:08.420]  and officially supported, they announced like five of them,
[54:08.420 --> 54:11.180]  and they were, wasn't just like different colors
[54:11.180 --> 54:13.740]  of the same look, they were radically different.
[54:13.740 --> 54:15.940]  And there was one called Gizmo that looked like,
[54:15.940 --> 54:16.980]  you remember this?
[54:16.980 --> 54:19.780]  I will definitely put this in the show notes, but.
[54:19.780 --> 54:20.620]  I do.
[54:20.620 --> 54:22.860]  Gizmo looked, I mean, how would you describe Gizmo?
[54:22.860 --> 54:24.420]  I don't even know how to describe it.
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.420]  People wouldn't believe it if I said it.
[54:27.260 --> 54:29.300]  So it was sort of like,
[54:31.140 --> 54:32.020]  so hard to describe.
[54:32.020 --> 54:36.540]  It was, it would take the user interface,
[54:36.540 --> 54:37.980]  and well, there were two Gizmos actually,
[54:37.980 --> 54:39.900]  because wasn't there one that was a messaging app too?
[54:39.900 --> 54:40.940]  But that's not the theme.
[54:40.940 --> 54:43.820]  The theme was like, it was like Sesame Street style.
[54:43.820 --> 54:47.820]  Like, you know, you know those toys at the pediatrician,
[54:47.820 --> 54:49.740]  when you, at least when I was a kid,
[54:49.740 --> 54:52.900]  there'd be like these wooden toys with like spirals
[54:52.900 --> 54:55.660]  and slides and you would just sort of move like an.
[54:55.660 --> 54:57.060]  Oh, okay, I know what you're thinking,
[54:57.060 --> 54:59.620]  like the candy stripe stuff would have all like the,
[54:59.620 --> 55:02.180]  like blue and red and everything was like very glossy
[55:02.180 --> 55:03.020]  and candy colored.
[55:03.020 --> 55:05.140]  It was crazy, it made your Mac look like a circus,
[55:05.140 --> 55:06.620]  you know, every window.
[55:06.620 --> 55:08.740]  And there was one called High Tech that was big.
[55:08.740 --> 55:10.420]  Platinum, platinum was another one.
[55:10.420 --> 55:11.940]  Well, platinum was the one that wound up.
[55:11.940 --> 55:12.780]  Platinum was the default.
[55:12.780 --> 55:14.020]  Platinum was the default.
[55:15.180 --> 55:19.180]  But the idea was that it would be one of several choices.
[55:19.180 --> 55:22.220]  The high tech one was like what we would now
[55:22.220 --> 55:23.100]  call dark mode.
[55:23.100 --> 55:26.700]  It was a very dark, almost black interface,
[55:26.700 --> 55:29.340]  but the chrome was much thicker.
[55:29.340 --> 55:31.940]  It looked sort of like what you would think
[55:31.940 --> 55:36.020]  the computers would look like in the Judge Dredd movie.
[55:36.020 --> 55:36.860]  Right?
[55:36.860 --> 55:37.700]  And it's.
[55:37.700 --> 55:39.820]  There was one that was like a blueprint or a drawing board.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.660]  Remember that?
[55:40.660 --> 55:42.100]  What was it called?
[55:42.100 --> 55:43.700]  I want to say it was called drawing board.
[55:43.700 --> 55:44.540]  Yeah, maybe.
[55:44.540 --> 55:45.780]  Or blueprint or something like that.
[55:45.780 --> 55:46.620]  Remember that?
[55:46.620 --> 55:47.460]  And everything was like sketches.
[55:47.460 --> 55:48.740]  Right, everything looked.
[55:48.740 --> 55:51.500]  Actually, they came back to that same look and feel
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.020]  with the icons for like Xcode nowadays, right?
[55:55.020 --> 55:57.700]  Where everything looks like an architect's blue paper
[55:57.700 --> 55:59.940]  with white pencil sketch.
[55:59.940 --> 56:01.420]  But your whole interface looked like that,
[56:01.420 --> 56:03.460]  including your menu bar.
[56:03.460 --> 56:04.340]  That's right.
[56:04.340 --> 56:07.100]  And those things, they literally, they were from Apple.
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.420]  They were going to be first party supported.
[56:09.420 --> 56:12.220]  And there was an API where third parties would be able
[56:12.220 --> 56:13.820]  to write their own extensions for it.
[56:13.820 --> 56:18.340]  They effectively Sherlocked the third party hack
[56:18.340 --> 56:19.540]  to customize the interface.
[56:19.540 --> 56:21.880]  And then this was all getting ready to ship
[56:21.880 --> 56:25.460]  right when Steve Jobs came and next reunified with Apple
[56:25.460 --> 56:28.300]  and they looked, I think, I would love.
[56:28.300 --> 56:31.620]  This is one of those like on my top 10 list of meetings
[56:31.620 --> 56:34.980]  I wish that I could have been a fly on the wall for.
[56:34.980 --> 56:36.940]  Would have been the meeting where Steve Jobs
[56:36.940 --> 56:40.540]  was presented with these appearance manager themes.
[56:41.660 --> 56:42.500]  Right?
[56:42.500 --> 56:46.940]  Like they've got this OS that they didn't even make
[56:46.940 --> 56:49.860]  that they, you know, the next people
[56:49.860 --> 56:51.180]  who now are running Apple.
[56:51.180 --> 56:53.920]  But they knew they needed the company to depend upon
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.300]  for years to come before Mac OS X would be ready to ship.
[56:58.300 --> 57:00.640]  And it had all of these themes
[57:00.640 --> 57:02.420]  and they just deleted them all.
[57:02.420 --> 57:04.800]  They just shipped it at the last moment
[57:04.800 --> 57:07.340]  with nothing but the platinum theme.
[57:07.340 --> 57:10.980]  And no, they like took out the mechanism
[57:10.980 --> 57:13.060]  to load the other themes.
[57:13.060 --> 57:16.540]  But yet there still was an appearance manager subsystem.
[57:16.540 --> 57:19.460]  So they had this whole complicated set of,
[57:19.460 --> 57:22.980]  they made making interfaces so much more complicated
[57:22.980 --> 57:25.980]  because the right way to do an interface as a developer
[57:25.980 --> 57:28.340]  was to support the appearance manager.
[57:28.340 --> 57:31.180]  Which meant not being able to make any assumptions
[57:31.180 --> 57:33.780]  about like what the windows or the buttons
[57:33.780 --> 57:36.100]  or the menus would look like, right?
[57:36.100 --> 57:38.500]  And then they shipped one theme and one theme only.
[57:38.500 --> 57:40.700]  So you had to support.
[57:40.700 --> 57:41.700]  Throw it all away.
[57:41.700 --> 57:44.180]  You had to support an infinite number of thieves
[57:44.180 --> 57:46.380]  for a system that wound up shipping
[57:46.380 --> 57:48.140]  with one theme and one theme only.
[57:48.140 --> 57:49.900]  But anyway, this sort of thinking.
[57:49.900 --> 57:51.180]  Speaking of a fly on the wall.
[57:51.180 --> 57:54.140]  Mac users customizing their icons, oh my God.
[57:54.140 --> 57:56.320]  That's all we used to spend half of our days
[57:56.320 --> 57:58.020]  just customizing our icons.
[57:59.420 --> 58:01.320]  That BMW icon, I'll never forget.
[58:01.320 --> 58:03.720]  Like when I saw that, that's actually what got me to go,
[58:03.720 --> 58:05.580]  oh my gosh, this Mac thing is cool.
[58:05.580 --> 58:08.020]  Like simple hard drive icon.
[58:08.020 --> 58:08.860]  You know what we used to do?
[58:08.860 --> 58:11.980]  We used to have, there was an app called folder icon maker.
[58:11.980 --> 58:13.820]  And I don't remember.
[58:13.820 --> 58:16.940]  Oh man, so what folder icon maker would do
[58:16.940 --> 58:20.980]  is let's say I have a folder
[58:20.980 --> 58:24.780]  where I know I'm only gonna put BB edit files.
[58:24.780 --> 58:27.660]  I could drop BB edits application
[58:27.660 --> 58:30.860]  onto folder icon maker, drag and drop.
[58:30.860 --> 58:35.140]  And folder icon maker would spit out an icon
[58:35.140 --> 58:37.980]  that was a standard system folder
[58:37.980 --> 58:41.860]  with a BB edit badge on the folder.
[58:41.860 --> 58:44.820]  And then I could take that icon and paste it onto,
[58:44.820 --> 58:46.100]  or I guess if you wanted to,
[58:46.100 --> 58:48.140]  I think it would even just spit out a folder
[58:48.140 --> 58:50.100]  that already had that icon on it.
[58:50.100 --> 58:50.940]  And then you could.
[58:50.940 --> 58:51.820]  It badged it.
[58:51.820 --> 58:54.220]  Right, so you could make folders
[58:54.220 --> 58:57.320]  that had badges with whatever you wanted on them.
[58:57.320 --> 58:59.940]  So a common one would be to badge it
[58:59.940 --> 59:04.940]  with the application that would be inside.
[59:05.220 --> 59:07.940]  And in fact, it became so popular
[59:07.940 --> 59:09.140]  and such a standard thing
[59:09.140 --> 59:13.740]  that apps would ship with inside a folder
[59:15.900 --> 59:18.660]  with a badge already on it.
[59:18.660 --> 59:21.620]  Folder icon maker became so standard that that,
[59:21.620 --> 59:23.300]  because that was the way back then,
[59:23.300 --> 59:25.460]  we didn't just ship naked apps
[59:25.460 --> 59:27.020]  that you put in an application folder.
[59:27.020 --> 59:29.560]  Typically an app would come in a folder
[59:29.560 --> 59:32.380]  and in the folder would be certain support files, right?
[59:32.380 --> 59:33.280]  So if Photoshop.
[59:33.280 --> 59:34.120]  Readmes and things like that.
[59:34.120 --> 59:35.580]  Well, or extensions, right?
[59:35.580 --> 59:38.960]  Where did the extensions for Photoshop go?
[59:38.960 --> 59:41.740]  They went in a folder named extensions
[59:41.740 --> 59:45.780]  at the same level as the Photoshop application.
[59:45.780 --> 59:48.940]  So the typical way for a well-organized Mac user
[59:48.940 --> 59:50.820]  to organize their applications would be that
[59:50.820 --> 59:54.220]  if you had a applications folder,
[59:54.220 --> 59:56.780]  inside that folder would typically be folders.
[59:56.780 --> 59:58.300]  There'd be a BB edit folder,
[59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.980]  and in the BB edit folder was the BB edit app
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.080]  and the BB edit extensions and scripts
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.520]  and the readme, et cetera.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.120]  Right, all of these auxiliary files
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.180]  that were organized in their own folders.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.340]  Right, but instead of having plain folders
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.300]  for all those things, we would badge them all.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.180]  It was fantastic fun.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.020]  Oh, we loved it.
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.840]  Absolutely.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.580]  Oh yeah, and that's somewhat similar to this, right?
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.360]  You're putting an icon on something for an app
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.060]  that's recognizable to you, or that's personal to you.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.860]  So I think it's great fun.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.340]  I think it's completely harmless.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.220]  I think anybody who's rolling their eyes
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.020]  because they think what people are making is ugly,
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.720]  I made tons of ugly stuff.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.760]  I think it's great.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.980]  I think it's so great because to me,
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.680]  it gets people involved in their own user interface design
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.940]  at a recreational level, and it has them thinking about it,
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.540]  and I just think just thinking about it, period.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.480]  Like, if you just think it would be fun
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.500]  if I could change the icon of Instagram,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.300]  what would I change it to?
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.700]  And the answer is anything you want, really.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.380]  Just pick any image you want and make a shortcut
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:07.700]  and use that image as the icon and set the shortcut
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.420]  to just launch Instagram.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.420]  Boom, you've got a custom icon for it.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.120]  It just makes people think like an interface designer,
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.160]  and whether that's actually something
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.380]  you have any aptitude for at all,
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.020]  it doesn't matter if you think it's fun.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.140]  And I still think it makes you a better user
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.420]  just to even broaden your mind to think about it at all.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.740]  Even if like three weeks from now you're like,
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.740]  oh my God, what did I do to my iPhone?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]  These icons are horrible.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.800]  I'm gonna get rid of these shortcuts
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.220]  and put the real apps back.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.460]  But at least you suddenly have an appreciation
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.280]  for how hard it is to pick a good icon, right?
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.780]  Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of these.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.540]  Some are good and some of those are showing
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.100]  that that's why not everyone can be
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.660]  a user interface designer, though.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.740]  Right, but there's some that you're sort of like,
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.180]  man, but to that person, they like it,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.180]  so what's the harm, it's fine.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:02.220]  Right, and I think it's, so again,
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.180]  I go back to decorating your hardware with stickers
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.340]  and people, honestly, if you went somewhere,
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.020]  back remembering you could go and meet people,
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.900]  but if you just surveyed a thousand people
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.340]  like at a theme park or a baseball game
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.620]  and just took a thousand random people
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.260]  coming through the turnstile and asked them,
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.140]  hey, can I see your phone?
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.280]  And you just wanna see the back of their phone
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.060]  and you document what case they have.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.540]  Out of a thousand people, you easily,
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.460]  I honest to God think you might get
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.180]  at least 900 different cases, right?
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.820]  The number of people who, you know,
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.120]  there's that much expression of personal taste
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.020]  in the back, you know, what people choose
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.340]  to put on their phones.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.220]  The way people put stickers on their laptops.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.920]  I have owned a lot of laptops over the years.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.580]  To my recollection, I've never once put a sticker on one,
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.760]  but I don't, I just don't want a sticker on mine,
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.940]  but I don't hold it against people who do
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.120]  and I totally get why people do,
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.120]  and I've also never gone to school with a laptop
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.380]  and had to worry about like, hey, you know,
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.720]  three of my classmates all have MacBook Airs
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.260]  and it's very convenient when they're closed
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.500]  and sitting together to know that the one
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.500]  with the whatever sticker, you know,
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.500]  the James Bond sticker is mine, you know?
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.860]  I get it, but the software stuff is even better
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.340]  because at least you don't have to worry,
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.720]  like if you decide you don't like your custom icon
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.080]  for Instagram, you don't have like glue to peel off, right?
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I think a lot of it
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.760]  is interactivity, right?
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.780]  People have seen their phones as these apps that they run
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.540]  and now in a way, not that they're beginning
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.420]  an app developer, but they're sort of getting into,
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.380]  oh, I can change something on the screen
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.040]  that I never used to be able to change, right?
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.120]  It's almost like an inquisitive thing, I think, also,
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.580]  and I think that's very interesting.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.560]  Yeah, I totally, you know, and it's, you know,
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.140]  widgets are along the same line.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.780]  Let's hold the thought, though, on widgets
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:06.580]  and let me talk about our next great sponsor
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.380]  of this episode, it's our good friends at Feals, F-E-A-L-S.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.860]  Short name, would be a very short tab and a B-O-S window.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.860]  Feals sells premium CBD
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.180]  and they deliver it directly to your doorstep.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.340]  Do you experience stress?
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.040]  Do you have anxiety, chronic pain,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.480]  maybe trouble sleeping more than once a week?
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.740]  You are not alone, many people do.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.820]  CBD naturally helps reduce stress, anxiety,
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:38.820]  pain, sleeplessness, just take a few drops of Feals,

[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.260]  the difference within minutes.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.300]  Are you new to CBD?
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.580]  Most people are, it's a new thing.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.840]  Feals is right there with you to help you out,
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.860]  make you feel, you know, you're new to it,
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.460]  you don't really know the details.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.580]  They have a free hotline, you can call them
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.740]  on the phone or text message, and I always say
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.580]  that's what I would do.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.060]  I mean, if I, anytime I need customer support,
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.980]  chat before talking, but they've got both,
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.100]  whatever you're happier with, they're happy to talk to you.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.040]  You tell them what you're looking for,
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.160]  they will tell you what they recommend,
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.960]  help guide your personal experience.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.240]  There's no high, no hangover, no addiction,
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.860]  this isn't that sort of thing.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.240]  It is the same fundamental, you know, chemicals,
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.780]  but this is prepared in a way that doesn't get you goofy.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.020]  And they have a membership program.

[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.780]  great company, great product.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.320]  All right, widgets, that's the new, that's the other thing.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.920]  Man oh man, I, people have been asking for this,
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.040]  this is one of those things where it's like,
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.640]  okay, I get it, people are happy to have all these widgets,
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.060]  people are customizing widgets,
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.560]  people are having fun with it.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.960]  People have been talking, the Android people's heads
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.600]  have to be exploiting, right?
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.240]  Because the Androids had widgets on their home screens,
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.920]  I think since they started, and if not.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.760]  I saw some ridiculous tweet that was like,
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.400]  this iPhone looks like my Android from 2016 or something.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.760]  Or probably longer, like 2011 or something, I don't know.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.920]  Is it longer, yeah.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.920]  But I don't know why Apple took so long to do this,
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.000]  but they did, they've had things called widgets,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.880]  and this is where it starts to get a little confusing.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.000]  And I'm glad they didn't change the name,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.620]  I think widget is a good name for this thing.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.800]  I think the fact that it's catching on,
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.100]  this is one of those things too, where my son,
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.020]  you know, we have an interesting relationship on technology,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.560]  where he thinks, you know, because my primary interest
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.800]  isn't games, that I'm out of touch.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.120]  And I've been writing more about games recently,
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.540]  so I've had a lot more to pick his brain about,
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.120]  but even he gave me, and this is seriously like
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.920]  within 24 hours of iOS 14 getting released,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.300]  he's like, hey, have you heard about this thing
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.320]  with the widgets?
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320]  And I'm like, yeah, I have.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.520]  Let's, you know, you know this is actually what I do.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.720]  And he's like, well, I don't know.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.640]  And he said it like in a way, like I don't know,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.520]  you don't seem to ever know about the cool stuff,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.360]  so I just figured maybe you didn't know about the widgets.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.120]  It's awesome.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.640]  I, you know, I don't know what they were thinking.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.440]  I don't know, you know.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.000]  There's obviously a lot of, you could speak to this,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.320]  but I think Apple's put a lot of care
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.360]  into making these things customizable,
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.880]  but yet low energy, you know,
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.480]  and that they're not going to suck your battery dry.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.720]  Yeah, the canvas is great.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.180]  I mean, it's definitely great for a designer like me
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.280]  and an app guy like me as a what are we gonna make
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.700]  for the app to do, and then it's even better for the user
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.920]  because they get to have the best of their app
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.760]  on their home screen.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.400]  And, you know, and Fantastical to me is pretty,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.000]  what do you guys have, nine widgets?
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.320]  12, actually, and we're adding some more
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.720]  that didn't make the cut for launch,
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  so we have 12 currently and there's more coming.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.960]  So you told me that, I know you previewed,
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.780]  you sent me the video, you know, and it's like,
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:54.280]  my first thought is that seems like too many,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.100]  just as a number, right?
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.400]  Right, yeah, sure. But you go through,
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.400]  number one, I think Apple has a pretty good interface
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.880]  for discovering this, right?
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.200]  Like getting into jiggle mode and then there's
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.320]  a big plus button at the top and that's where it says
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.700]  what widgets and there's, you can scroll
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.120]  and look through available widgets
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.080]  and then there's a nice obvious,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.560]  you don't have to pull down to see it
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.480]  once you're in this mode, there's a search field,
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.720]  you could just start typing F-A-N
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.760]  and it'll show you the Fantastical widgets
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.760]  that are available.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.920]  I know I wrote this, I know you and I have talked about it,
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.420]  this comparison to Legos is to me very apt
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.720]  because it's like, okay, you can say 12 widgets
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.320]  for Fantastical, all related to calendaring
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.320]  and reminders is too many, but like once you see them,
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.700]  they all sort of make sense.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.480]  It's like, oh yeah, this one would just, yeah,
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.560]  there's, of course there's three different sizes
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.920]  and so you need three different ones
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.480]  where if you just wanna see a list
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.760]  of what's coming next on your calendar,
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.260]  here's three sizes and that's three of them right there,
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.440]  right?
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.280]  That's right.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.480]  You know, maybe you want to see a whole month,
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.720]  you want to see that five-week grid calendar month view,
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.280]  well now you have, you need a couple sizes for that.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.960]  It's like looking at Legos, you can say,
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.280]  well my God, there's 18 different pieces,
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.760]  but once you look at them spread out on your table
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.600]  as you're putting it together, you know,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.600]  you're like, well, of course there's different sizes
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.440]  because you need a long one, you need a short one,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.960]  you need a, you know, the big square one
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.000]  and you need the long skinny one, et cetera.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.240]  That's right.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.000]  Yeah, we were designing it, we were, you know,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.640]  we had a small one that we were like,
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.440]  here's the funniest part, one of the features we get,
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.340]  our biggest feature request for iPhone,
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.520]  literally the biggest is,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.680]  can you put the date on the app icon?
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.340]  In other words, Apple's calendar app
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.480]  can show the date dynamically, right?
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.720]  Changes once a day.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.420]  We can't do that, third-party developers
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.400]  don't have the ability to change the icon dynamically.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.700]  As you know, third-party developers had the ability
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.360]  to put in custom icons that you could change manually,
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.640]  but that's it, right?
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.420]  So when the widgets, iOS 14 widgets came about,
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.100]  one of the first ones we did was,
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.180]  well, we're gonna put a date, right?
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.020]  A small date.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:04.500]  Yeah, it takes up four spaces versus one icon,
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.120]  but now it's a date on your home screen
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.660]  that can launch fantastical, right?
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.320]  We knew that that was like one that people would love.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.720]  But as we started to go,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.080]  okay, what other small ones can we do?
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.960]  Okay, we can do an up next, we could do a calendar,
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.720]  we can do this, then we made the medium.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.920]  Okay, which parts of that can go on the medium?
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.120]  We mixed and matched.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.560]  The large, and as the design was happening,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.820]  I in my head said, wait a minute,
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.000]  we're putting together all these
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.440]  that we think are logical,
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.720]  but these widgets are great
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.720]  because you can pick as many as you want.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.640]  I don't know if you know also,
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.680]  you can stack our own widgets,
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.120]  or one apps, or multiple apps.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.800]  You can take multiple fantastical widgets
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.000]  and put them in a stack,
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.560]  and then swipe between the widgets in a single stack.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.400]  And you can actually almost create
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.640]  a scrolling month that way
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.120]  because you can just put multiple lists
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.060]  and then have the list show different calendar sets
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.440]  or different attributes.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.440]  Anyway, the point is, as we were doing all this,
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.020]  light bulb went off in my head that it's like,
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.420]  well, okay, we're putting together all these
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.840]  and saying these are the best 10, or 12, or 15 scenarios,
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.740]  configurations, well, okay, let's start making the ones
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.560]  that then users might wanna put together.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.160]  So you could take a small and a medium
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.640]  and put them together and get your best view,
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.120]  or two mediums to equal a large and get your best view,
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.020]  or two larges, and so on and so forth.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.600]  And that was kind of like,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.620]  then the guiding light of widgets for us was,
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.340]  let's make all the tools that users will want,
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.960]  and then they can pick their favorite widgets
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.840]  in the layout that they want.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.640]  Yeah, and I think it really shows,
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.800]  and to me, however complex that might sound,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.180]  hearing it, when you see it, it's very, very clear.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.740]  Well, and especially if you already know
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.320]  what you wanna see, right?
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.000]  That's right.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.200]  And it's like, oh yeah, I would pick this piece
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.040]  and that piece and snap them together,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.160]  and now I've got what I want, which is this
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  two icon high by three wide thing at the top
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.200]  that will show me all of my agenda right there.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.200]  And I don't even think we talked about it.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.280]  I just think it's so obvious from the get-go
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.500]  that Fantastical in particular was a candidate
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.960]  to go really deep into widgets right from the get-go
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.320]  because of the nature of the app, right?
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.400]  It is.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.240]  That's right.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.280]  Some of the analogies between digital world
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.680]  electronic calendaring and real world calendaring
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.640]  are very different, but a lot of them are sort of the same,
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.800]  and that basic idea of what's going on for me today?
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.400]  What do I, I need a glanceable thing,
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.480]  and it is sort of foundational to all of it, right?
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.940]  It's the same as, it's very much the same
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.080]  as the needs of somebody 100 years ago
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.240]  who's doing it all with a pen and paper.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.960]  Yeah, when we started making Fantastical back in 2010
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.720]  is when we started, that was the skeuomorphic period,
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.040]  if you will, and one of the things,
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.720]  it was actually good that we started around then
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.140]  because I think very hard, very hard about
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.060]  what's the real calendar in the real world
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.360]  versus a digital calendar on the device,
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.920]  and I think it's really important to make sure
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.800]  that they're different, but that they serve
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.500]  the same purpose, which is what, keeping you on time, right?
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.000]  Keeping you apprised of your meetings and your tasks,
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.300]  and I think the digital space allows us so much more,
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.000]  so many more tools to actually give the user
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.600]  to let them be more organized,
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.840]  things that we can take over the heavy lifting from
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.400]  as developers and have the user just go,
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.320]  okay, well, there's a date and a calendar and a list,
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.560]  that's familiar to me, but what they don't realize
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.400]  is all the other stuff, how they're all intertwined
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.520]  with the app, with the calendar sets,
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.360]  with the notifications, with the accounts, right?
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.560]  There's all this stuff that it's standing
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.320]  on the shoulders of, but at the end of the day,
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.680]  it's a really familiar display that keeps them organized,
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.560]  and that's what I think widgets do quite well.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.240]  Right, and then the combination effect
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.320]  with all of the other widgets you might have,
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.800]  and again, we're only like a week into this, right?
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.540]  Who knows where we'll be in a couple months,
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:08.540]  but the basic idea is it lets the user
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.440]  design their own home screen, and...
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.040]  That's right, and again, people are going to make decisions
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.040]  that I would find distasteful or confused.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.760]  Why would you want that?
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.260]  But that's not for me to decide,
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:29.000]  and I know that I do things that,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.880]  like if you look through my Field Notes notebook here,
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.040]  you might think, well, these are the notes
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.560]  of a crazy person, right?
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.280]  This is somebody who needs to be locked up
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.840]  because they're not really meant to be understood
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.620]  by anybody else, like why would anybody
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.880]  write these things down?
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.720]  You know, that's the way you've set up your home screen.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.980]  But it really gets people thinking
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.480]  like an interface designer, what do you want?
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.840]  Do you want a big clock?
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.380]  Do you really need to know the time?
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.360]  Do you not wear a watch?
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.880]  Do you want a big clock on your iPhone home screen
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.720]  all the time?
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.440]  But it really does sort of...
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.580]  I find it so exciting that people,
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.000]  not that I'm using widgets so much yet,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.220]  but I find the enthusiasm that so many people
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.180]  clearly have for this feature,
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.440]  this explosion of enthusiasm for it,
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.600]  to be so exciting, because I just think
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.600]  that it's the best of the Mac mentality,
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.040]  going back to 1984, that computer for the rest of us,
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.260]  that you can design your own computer stuff,
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.280]  you know, that you're not just locked into this design
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.900]  that the people who made it do.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.560]  You can snap your own pieces together like Legos
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.080]  and make a weird Lego spaceship
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.920]  that Lego would never sell as a kit,
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.560]  but it's your spaceship, and there's a reason for it.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.080]  No, absolutely.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.160]  Absolutely, and it's almost like,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.520]  you know, what is it, this is my rifle,
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.080]  there's others like it, but this one's mine.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.320]  Like, I think people actually end up saying
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.600]  that it's like, this is my iPhone, right?
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.820]  It is mine, there's many like it, but this one's mine.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.000]  And then they get into that whole idea that,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.080]  okay, this is my iPhone now,
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.940]  I don't have to have this thing
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.040]  that looks like everyone else's.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.480]  I can make it work and look and feel
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.040]  exactly the way I want it to.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.120]  Right, and it's, you know, like your home screen
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.880]  can sort of start to take the weird shape
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.800]  of your weird mind, you know, and ultimately,
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.480]  at some level, all of us, the inside of our heads,
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.640]  it's weird, you know?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.400]  And you can start designing a little thing that reflects it,
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.800]  and I think it's very cool.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.240]  I do think, at a technical level, part of,
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.200]  hey, why not till now?
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.160]  I think that the fact that these are all with Swift UI,
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.160]  and it has to be Swift UI, is part of that story, right?
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:49.520]  That this is, you know, this is the fruition
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.080]  of Apple's Swift UI, many years long strategy
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.000]  that we're only in the middle of,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.460]  starting to come to fruition, you know?
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.640]  But what about, the last thing I'll talk about
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.600]  on this point is that the confusion
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.640]  between the old style widgets and the new widgets.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.440]  So, they call them both widgets.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.080]  I touched on this a few minutes ago.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.600]  The new ones are the ones that everybody is loving
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.160]  and having fun with, and has exuberance for,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.120]  and you can put them on any home screen you want
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.400]  and drag them around.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.920]  The old ones are the ones that could only be
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.920]  when you swipe over to like screen zero, right?
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.440]  When you go, if you call it the today,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.840]  they call it the today view, actually.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.660]  Right, but I always think of it as if your main screen
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.560]  is screen one, this was the one that's to the left.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.160]  It's like screen zero, and there's no apps.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.840]  You can't put apps on screen zero.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.920]  Today view, whatever you want to call it, you know.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.560]  Those widgets still exist, and it's like,
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.000]  I guess because they can't, you know,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.480]  people who are relying on them in other apps,
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.040]  they can't, you know, but they're a totally,
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.440]  they're a totally different thing.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.960]  It's not like, oh, this is a new version of that thing.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.920]  The only similarity is that they are called widgets,
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.880]  and they basically are the same idea
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.720]  of a widget of information, but technically.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.600]  So two reasons, sorry, two reasons why they still exist
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.440]  is just that I think they're still called classic widgets.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.680]  I think that's what the name,
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.900]  that's what we call them is classic widget,
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.800]  but I think they exist because of things
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.520]  like home automation, right?
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:24.340]  If you have a light that's being controlled by this button
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.280]  and you want it on or off quick,
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.960]  the new widgets can't do that.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.520]  Hmm.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.520]  Ah, because the new widgets can't really be interactive.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.360]  Correct.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  But the old widgets could.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.160]  Yes, or like the Tesla app for the Tesla car, right?
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.880]  You could tap it and it does stuff with the car
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.640]  or whatever it is, anything connected,
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.680]  and the new ones cannot do that.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.420]  Yes, there could be a Tesla app or a light app
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.840]  or a home automation app that is a new widget,
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.680]  but you tap it, it then opens the app,
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.240]  and then the app still has to do something.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.080]  It's not an instantaneous interaction.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:55.920]  Hmm.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.400]  So, I think those are still around
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.240]  because without those, you lose some really, really,
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.360]  really big functionality from the iPhone.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.760]  And, oh, that's interesting, I didn't think about that.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.880]  I didn't think about the fact
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]  that the old ones had the interactivity.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.240]  I've been thinking about the fact that the new ones don't,
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.160]  but the old ones did, and I think, and why is that?
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.040]  I think they just haven't gotten there yet, right?
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.120]  I hope they do because even our old widget,
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.020]  I still keep our old widget, our classic widget around
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.900]  because we actually have a calendar view
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.280]  that you can tap around the days,
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.240]  and then the list changes.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.040]  It's just like the fantastic LIN app view.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.000]  And we have, if you tap and hold, it adds to that date,
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  and it's very, very interactive,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.040]  and we would love to do that with the new widget,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.840]  so I really do hope that's coming.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.000]  All right, let us break here
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.200]  and thank our third and final sponsor of this episode,
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.760]  our good friends at Linode.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.880]  I say Linode, I used to say Linode
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.460]  because it looks like Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E,
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:56.040]  but it's Linode because it's a node-based hosting for Linux.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:01.040]  But I used to also say Linux years ago, I swear to God,
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.060]  and I swear to God you could take it to the bank
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.900]  that for years, when it was a new thing,
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.560]  and it was like the up-and-coming,
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.620]  hey, some crazy guy in Finland
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:14.120]  is making his own Unix offshoot.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.280]  I thought it was called Linux for years,
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.880]  and it turns out it's Linux.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.220]  And anyway, the company is Linode.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:25.220]  I believe, and it is my favorite cloud hosting company.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.620]  It is where I host Daring Fireball.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.480]  It is fantastic.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.560]  Their headquarters actually are right here in Philadelphia,
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.880]  which is amazing in terms of being a small world,
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.960]  maybe not where you'd think a company like Linode
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.040]  would be headquartered, but they are.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.760]  But they have 11 data centers worldwide,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.600]  all literally worldwide,
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.160]  all of them with enterprise-grade hardware,
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.400]  all of them with great network support.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.580]  Everything you get, SSD storage down the line,
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.600]  everything is great.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.340]  But while they can scale up to truly massive needs,
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.400]  they also have nanoed accounts
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.320]  that start at just five bucks a month.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.980]  Here's a spoiler right here.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.300]  Use this plan, promo code TALKSHOW20.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.720]  You save 20 bucks, you get $20 credit
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.000]  towards your next thing.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.920]  At the $5 a month plan, that's four months free,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.920]  and it is a great plan, like a hobbyist-level plan.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.640]  You'll never run up against the limits.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.360]  It's fantastic.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.260]  Four months free just by using that code TALKSHOW20.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.540]  Also, they have a new thing this year called Object Storage.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.040]  It's their S3-compatible, redundant,
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.880]  highly available storage option.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.040]  So if you've got code that hooks into S3
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.520]  and you wanna switch to Linode for the storage,
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.360]  you can do it.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.520]  It's API-compatible, super reliable.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.960]  It's been running all year.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.800]  Big hit.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.760]  It's like one of their big new features of the year.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.740]  Anything you wanna do.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.720]  They've got one-click installs of popular apps
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.000]  like WordPress, game servers for Minecraft.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.900]  I always mention become the most popular parent
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.200]  in your kid's circle because you can hook up
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200]  a game server for Minecraft
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.900]  or whatever other game they play
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.080]  and have all their friends
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.080]  palin' around on a private server, really great.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]  A lot of fun.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.560]  Makes you a big hit amongst the kids.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.440]  Or if you play yourself even, it's really great
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.860]  and it's a great solution for as low as five bucks a month.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.120]  Anyway, great company.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.600]  They also are hiring.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.600]  You can go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.480]  If you are the sort of person who is even thinking
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.040]  about looking at that careers page,
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.680]  you know the sort of jobs that Linode is hiring for.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.520]  But go check it out.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.560]  It's a great company.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.720]  And remember this.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.720]  You get a $20 credit by using the promo code talkshow20.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  And the URL to go to is linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.200]  I gotta interrupt and tell you, unsolicited,
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.960]  and I'm sure you didn't know this,
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.020]  we at Flexibits actually use Linode.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.480]  And you're happy.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.300]  Is it okay for me to say that?
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.140]  Of course.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:12.960]  And you're a happy customer.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.800]  All right, well, there you go.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.640]  There you go.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.460]  Thanks, Linode.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.560]  It's really, it's a great company.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.400]  It's one of the-
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.220]  I said Linode too.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.060]  I always say Linode.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:20.900]  It looks like Linode.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.480]  I don't even think that's crazy.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.840]  I think you kind of have to know,
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.400]  but maybe it was my dumb ability
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.120]  to mispronounce almost anything
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.680]  that thought Linux was Linux for years.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.820]  But I don't think Linode, I don't know.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.120]  They're good guys.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:38.960]  I do know that.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.780]  Good guys and gals.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.620]  I love them.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.320]  They're solid and good.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.320]  Let's talk about the indie development ecosystem.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.200]  Let's talk about pricing first,
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.320]  because that's really it, right?
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.320]  What does it mean to be an indie developer?
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.020]  What I'm talking about,
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:59.160]  and it almost seems crazy to have to define it,
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.440]  but I'm talking about small companies.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.560]  Maybe it's one person.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.920]  Maybe it's 10, 20 people, right?
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.500]  Maybe it's even more than 20 people,
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.920]  but by the scheme, certainly,
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.920]  of today's companies like Apple and Google and Amazon,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.520]  small companies that are making software
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.860]  and making money through the software
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.320]  that runs it as a profitable business, right?
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.400]  And make cool apps that users like to pay for
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.940]  and use and do use and go forward.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.320]  It's always of great concern to me,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.080]  because it's not just personal
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.400]  in that I have friends who do this
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.380]  and I want to see them survive,
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.360]  but it's also very selfish
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.480]  in that how I spend my day every day
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.960]  and what I use to do my work
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  revolves around up-to-date, thriving indie software
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.420]  on all of the platforms I use.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.200]  But it is counterintuitive,
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.780]  because personal computers are more popular
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.480]  than they've ever been,
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.480]  and everybody is spending more time on them
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.600]  than they ever did before.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.520]  But in a lot of ways, I think it's harder
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.960]  to be an indie developer and to make a business out of it
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.440]  than it ever has been before.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.000]  And it's so counterintuitive,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.560]  but I think it's almost undeniably true.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.960]  Yeah, it is, it is.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.880]  As much as the market has grown and the tools have grown
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.420]  and the, I guess, customer base has grown
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.040]  and the opportunity has grown,
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.960]  it is absolutely, positively a very, very, very, very,
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.640]  very hard thing to do.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.040]  Part of it is that pricing has changed so dramatically.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.320]  And I think, again, it's, I mean,
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.760]  let me put on my old man hat,
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.760]  but in the 90s, software was so expensive compared to today.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:03.020]  It's really hard to get people's heads wrapped around it,
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:05.600]  that you would buy a word processor
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.120]  and it would cost $199.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.960]  And that was just version two.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.040]  And when version three came out, it would,
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.200]  you know, you could upgrade,
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.400]  but you'd have to have a license key for the old one,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.360]  and the upgrade was $129.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.760]  Apple's OS's used to cost $129.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.760]  Like, if you wanted to update from like Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4,
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.360]  you'd have to pay like $129.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.740]  So, software was expensive.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.300]  I remember.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:40.260]  But it made money and it kept companies afloat.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:43.700]  And the downward pressure on pricing
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.420]  and what consumers think is a fair price has gotten so low,
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:51.180]  and it's been, for lack of a better word,
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:56.180]  perverted by how much is quote unquote free
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.660]  and, you know, monetized in different ways.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.320]  You know, that if you get all of Facebook and Twitter
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.700]  and Instagram and you can't pay them,
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.320]  there's nothing, there is no way,
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.640]  there is no pro option for Facebook
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.360]  where I can pay $10 a month and get a better version.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.620]  You can't even pay and you get all that for free
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.620]  and you want, you know, $20 for a text editor
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.780]  or whatever the name, you know.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.760]  The thing is, people think, well, that's crazy.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.420]  This is, you know, look at it, this is such a,
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.100]  you know, all this does is edit text files
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:34.540]  and I get all this for free from Google or Amazon
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:35.360]  or whoever else.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.900]  There's a built-in calendar app for free.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.740]  Why would I ever pay for a calendar app?
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.580]  Well.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.900]  Just to throw one out there.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.980]  So Fantastical is an interesting area, right?
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.740]  Like, so part of it is always the competing
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.060]  with the built-in apps, right?
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.100]  That's always been true, right?
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.260]  There's, you know, there's always been a text editor
[01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.260]  on, you know, simple text and teach text
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.080]  going back to the day.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.220]  And so, you know, you've always,
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:01.340]  that's like a baseline level of, okay,
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.340]  if you're gonna sell an app, it has to be better
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:05.180]  than the thing that's built-in free.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.500]  Right.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.820]  But when people think that, well, if this one's free
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:15.000]  and yours is paid, a dollar sounds fair to me.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.980]  You know, where do you even start if that,
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.460]  and again, I'm not exaggerating that there are people
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.200]  who think that one dollar might be a fair price
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.060]  for a professional calendar app.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.460]  Well, and they think one dollar might be a fair price
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.700]  for life, like in other words, the thing needs to work
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:33.460]  as long as my iPhone works or as long as iOS is an iOS,
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.280]  right?
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:40.620]  And it's, you know, it's all gotten more complicated, too,
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.040]  because, at least on the app, if we just talk
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.500]  about the Apple ecosystem for indie development,
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.160]  in some ways, it's this plethora of riches
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.900]  where we've got all of these extra devices now,
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.300]  like phones, and it's amazing to be able to have your app
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:58.700]  on the phone, too, and it's in your pocket, right?
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:00.680]  It's kind of awesome, like when you got started
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.140]  making Fantastical, well, in 2010, maybe you could imagine
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.780]  it, because the iPhone was out, but you go back far enough
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:10.520]  to when you first started making apps, and the idea
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.220]  that your app might be in your jeans pocket all the time,
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.820]  that's awesome, right?
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.180]  It's like, that's super cool.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, it was even in very early days
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.640]  for the iPhone when Fantastical came out, so it was still,
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:24.100]  it was at that first initial thing where it's like,
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.140]  okay, apps are allowed, and you're sort of like
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.900]  not really sure what it is or what it means
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.700]  or what it could do, but yeah, no, it was incredible.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.140]  But you've, you know, but then there's an expectation
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:36.880]  where if an app can sync, and let's just use the word
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.220]  sync loosely, because there's different ways of syncing,
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.500]  but more or less, if you can use the same thing
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.700]  from your phone and on your iPad and on your Mac,
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.900]  people expect to be able to, they want to be able to,
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.820]  but it's not really clear how you're supposed to monetize
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:55.820]  that as a developer, and it is, if not three times the work,
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:59.380]  it might be more than three times the work, right?
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:03.260]  That it's, you think like, well, the iPad app
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.820]  is really just a bigger version of the iPhone app,
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.300]  so it shouldn't be three times the work,
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.880]  and there's certain data models that you can use,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.460]  that you can reuse across the thing,
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.980]  but then you've got to make sure all of the integration
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:17.100]  and syncing works, right?
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.980]  It is, it's a lot more work, and yet people expect,
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.180]  well, I paid for the iPhone version,
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.880]  why in the world do I have to pay for the Mac version?
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.780]  Yeah, right, they see it as one app.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:31.220]  I paid for Fantastical, give me it all.
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.220]  Right, so Fantastical used to be,
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.780]  let's just be specific on Fantastical,
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:41.060]  so the traditional way to sell apps
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.080]  would be you'd sell a version for a price,
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.340]  the user would decide, okay, I'll buy it,
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.100]  and then you'd get a license code
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.380]  or in the app store or whatever,
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.180]  but then whatever the mechanism is,
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:54.620]  it unlocks it, and now you have it,
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:59.420]  and then if a new version came out a year later,
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.340]  two years later, you would get upgrade pricing for it.
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:04.620]  New users would still pay the new price,
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:09.060]  and existing users would get some kind of discounted price,
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:13.780]  and this worked for a long time in the industry
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:18.660]  at all levels, it's how everything from Microsoft Office
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.660]  to some 16-year-old kid's shareware app
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.320]  for the Mac worked and monetized,
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.260]  and it doesn't work anymore
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.900]  because the app store doesn't support that model
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.300]  and never has, and by this time,
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.140]  I think we can safely say never will.
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.960]  Yeah, we were at a weird time when Fantastical came out
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.660]  because here's what's even crazier, John,
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.180]  the Mac App Store launched in January of 2011,
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.420]  I remember this, and we launched Fantastical in May 2011,
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:53.620]  and when we were developing Fantastical in 2010
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.740]  a little bit before, we didn't know
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.820]  the Mac App Store was coming necessarily,
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.380]  so we were planning on just selling the app directly
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:04.180]  like we used to, so that was really a weird change for us
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.260]  because now we're selling it on the Mac App Store
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:09.660]  and our own store, and apps still weren't,
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.540]  I would say, differently valued then.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.340]  I don't even wanna necessarily call them devalued.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.180]  I've been thinking a lot about it
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.640]  since we switched to subscription.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.060]  I know you're gonna ask me about that a bit,
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.620]  but I feel like apps aren't devalued.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:23.100]  I feel like apps are valued differently
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.980]  than you and I in the old school days
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.340]  prior to the App Store.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:29.520]  Well, tell me how.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.820]  How do you think that they're valued?
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.260]  You're saying by users?
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.980]  Yeah, so I think what happens is someone buys a phone,
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.700]  which the irony is that an iPhone's very expensive, right?
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:42.940]  An iPhone's not certainly a cheap thing, not that,
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.100]  not that an Android phone is necessarily cheap.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.520]  You can get cheap Android phones,
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.740]  but in the sense of the iPhone land,
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.420]  it is not something anyone would ever describe as very cheap.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.660]  It is a premium product, so it shouldn't be,
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.600]  and that's sort of why I point this out.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.400]  The iPhone's a premium product.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.800]  You pay more for it because it's premium.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:03.220]  Well, that means the apps on the iPhone platform
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.540]  are more premium.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.060]  Therefore, yes, there's gonna be free ones
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.740]  like Facebook or Instagram or Uber or DoorDash or whatever,
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.900]  but then there's going to be also premium apps.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.400]  Yeah, there's gonna be also bad apps.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.460]  There's gonna be free apps.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.580]  There's gonna be hobby apps.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.220]  There's gonna be apps that just are overpriced and whatever,
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.960]  but what I find interesting about the whole iPhone scene
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.620]  is that the iPhone's a premium product
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.620]  that you pay more for because it's premium,
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.580]  but then when there's a premium app,
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:32.220]  people's value of that app is that it should be free
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:35.020]  or very, very, very cheap, and I think the reason for that
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.280]  is because the software that's built into the iPhone
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.860]  is free and really good, and third-party apps services,
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:43.160]  whether it be Twitter or Facebook or whatever,
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.340]  their apps aren't that bad either.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:45.180]  I mean, we can get into that,
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.920]  but I'm just saying in general, they're apps, right?
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.460]  They do what they're supposed to do,
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.940]  and I think that's where the, what did I say?
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:53.840]  I didn't say devalued.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.620]  I said where the different value or, you know, yeah.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.900]  I feel like it's people's idea
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.740]  of what an app should be valued is very, very different
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.060]  based upon what they paid for the device
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.940]  and what they get with it for free.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.020]  Yeah, and it's different ways
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.900]  of looking at how much you pay total, right?
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:19.180]  Like, so one of the ways that phones are so expensive
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:22.300]  is it doesn't even matter which phone you start with.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.500]  Your monthly, the phone is useless
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:27.580]  without paying a phone provider for service,
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:31.260]  and I know that US users pay more than users do in Europe
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.140]  and other countries, but at a basic level,
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:37.300]  at least here in the US, for decent phone service,
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:41.840]  you're paying at least $40 a month and probably more, right?
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.700]  Like, if you're on Verizon or AT&T,
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.200]  you're definitely paying more.
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.740]  And if you told somebody, like,
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.900]  how long does a typical person use their phone?
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:54.380]  Let's say two or three years.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.660]  Maybe that's extending, you know, to three years.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:02.480]  So if you take 36 months times just 50 bucks a month,
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.460]  that's $1,800 in phone service, right?
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.600]  And that's if you're only paying 50 bucks a month.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.020]  So if you told somebody when they came in
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.340]  to buy their iPhone that,
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.900]  whatever the cost of the iPhone is,
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.220]  you know, average selling price, $800.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.020]  Oh, and by the way, you need to pay us $1,800
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.700]  to have phone service for the next three years.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:26.400]  They would look around for hidden cameras.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.540]  They'd be like, what are you talking about, $1,800, $2,000
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:32.020]  for phone service for the next three years?
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.460]  That you're out of your mind.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.860]  I'm gonna go buy my phone somewhere else.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.640]  You're, you know, you're on crack.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.540]  But that's what you're going to pay.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.020]  Because, but they've internalized it,
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.500]  that they only pay it monthly
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.780]  and that you can only pay it monthly.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.740]  And I sort of feel like that's what's happening
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.700]  with app prices in a way where you get so much for free,
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.740]  it's just worn it down.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:57.580]  And when you're approached with the simple,
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.620]  if you could really just open the books
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.740]  and look at the, you know, be the accountant
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.220]  for an independent software developer
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.840]  and look at, you know, salary and healthcare
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.460]  and whatever other, all the other costs
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.300]  that go into running a company
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.740]  and the number of developers and designers
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.080]  that you need to pick your app.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.940]  You know, maybe it's a game, maybe it's a utility, whatever.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.260]  And then figure out how many users you'll have
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.700]  and multiply that by a number
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.260]  to get just a baseline breakeven price.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:29.140]  It's way higher than people think
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:30.380]  because they're not thinking of it
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:33.600]  in the same way that like what you pay for phone service
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.580]  over the life of your phone is way higher
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.760]  than a lot of people would think is right.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.660]  Even though they're actually paying it.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:42.660]  Which.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.500]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.320]  And there's support crews.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.160]  We need support, right?
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.460]  Because we've got to be able to reply on Twitter
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.900]  and support and get back to customers
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:49.100]  with bugs or whatever it is, right?
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:53.060]  Like, it is actually, if you're going to have
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.660]  an app that does a lot of stuff
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.460]  like syncing and multiple platforms
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.860]  and all the stuff we do at Fantascal, you need a crew.
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.420]  You can't just do it with one or two people.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.260]  You can't.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.220]  It's not possible.
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.060]  It's just not possible.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:06.240]  I can't mention this person by name.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.120]  But I don't even think that he makes indie software anymore.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.940]  But there was a well-known developer
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:15.980]  from like 15 years ago who had some very popular apps
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:19.100]  and was making, I think, a good business in it.
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.240]  And but had nobody helping with support.
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.920]  And I think I heard this story from Cable Sasser,
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.300]  our mutual friend at Panic,
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.420]  who we could talk a bit more about.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.580]  But Cable asked him one time, well, how do you do this?
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.620]  How do you ever get anything done without support?
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.500]  And he goes, oh, it's easy.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.860]  I hardly spend any time at all.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:36.700]  And he goes, well, what do you do?
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:40.020]  And Cable's thinking like, I think it was Cable,
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.000]  but thinking like, does he have some magical,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.420]  everybody's always looking for the magical
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.840]  bug tracking system that will actually,
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.860]  oh my God, we switched to this.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:52.620]  And all of a sudden, our support, 20 hours of support
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.620]  turned into one hour.
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.460]  Oh my God, what is it?
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.780]  He goes, just email, everybody just emails.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.620]  He goes, well, how do you do it?
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.460]  And he goes, oh, it's easy.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.980]  I just open up the email and I do select all,
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:02.900]  and then I hit the delete key.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.860]  Then I go back to work.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.260]  I gave him, and he laughed.
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:08.580]  And he's like, no, really, what do you do?
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.300]  And he looked at him and he's just like, no, no,
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.540]  that's what I do.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:14.940]  And the inbox is filled up with support.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.180]  I just select all, and then I hit delete,
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.780]  and then I go back to work and I make my next version.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.160]  And the irony is, if the app is that good,
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.300]  you could do that.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:27.020]  Well, if their emails are there, they're all right.
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:29.660]  But I'd never do it, but you could do it.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.500]  That's so funny.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.820]  But it is, it's an issue, and it costs money.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:37.620]  And support is very, very hard.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.420]  It actually is, as we're getting bigger
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.100]  and as the app is getting more complicated,
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.460]  support is actually the biggest problem,
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:44.620]  because we want our customers to be happy.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:47.340]  So on the flip side, though, there were problems
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.500]  with that old model of software.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.180]  And one of the problems was that the only way to,
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:57.140]  when you sort of reached, what's the word, saturation,
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.600]  market saturation, where if you've been established
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.380]  and you're around for a while,
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:04.500]  and you're not getting new users,
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.140]  you've got a large existing user base,
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.960]  and you're only making money from the existing users
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.600]  by selling upgrades, then you've got to time these upgrades
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.820]  in a way that they come out regularly enough
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:23.140]  that the company's revenue is regular in some way, right?
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.820]  But in that model, when you look,
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:28.740]  and I worked at Barebone Software 20 years ago,
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.720]  and I'm friends with so many people in the industry,
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.980]  but when you sell software that way,
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:35.820]  you really do have to internalize
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:40.120]  that the graph of your company's revenue
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.620]  has these bizarre spikes around releases.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:47.820]  And you have to internalize that three months
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.940]  before your version 6.0 is coming out,
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.420]  you think you've got it scheduled,
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:54.260]  you think you're in the final beta stages,
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.940]  you think you're about two or three months from shipping,
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:00.580]  but you've been working on it for 15 months.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.600]  And so maybe your revenue is really low.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:05.840]  You've got to have that gambler's mentality
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.740]  of knowing it's okay that our company's revenue right now
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.840]  for this month is unsustainably low
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.140]  because we're heading towards this big release,
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.500]  and that's when we're gonna get all these upgrades.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.340]  And then when the release happens,
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.220]  and it's a hit, and you make all this money,
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.700]  and it's like, oh, people love it
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.280]  because you added X, Y, and Z features
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.180]  that they've been waiting for,
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.920]  and they're happy to upgrade right away,
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.160]  and they're spreading the word,
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.180]  and Gruber linked to it from Daring Fireball,
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.220]  and people are upgrading, it's all great.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.980]  You have to then internalize that that amount of money
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:37.260]  isn't your new baseline,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:40.340]  and you can't go out and buy a Lamborghini, you know?
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.780]  A hundred percent, you've now normalized
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.540]  what you need to keep the machine running
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.540]  to provide that level of support, right?
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:50.020]  Compare and contrast with, say, running a restaurant,
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.580]  which is famously a very hard business,
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:55.860]  and a lot of them, most of them tend to not make it
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:59.860]  and go under, and that's before this whole COVID thing,
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.680]  which has ravaged the industry.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.020]  But for the most part, a restaurant makes money
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.220]  on a daily basis that pays the money
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:10.340]  for the day that it, you know, there's not like all
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:14.960]  of a sudden you make so much money on one day of the year
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.820]  that it funds the rest of the year, right?
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:20.000]  It's, you know, software development in that model
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.980]  was a feast or famine, and you, you know,
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.860]  a very brief feast, and then not really a famine,
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:28.840]  but it would trickle off,
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.380]  and then you'd come out with a new release.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.980]  But then the problem with this idea is
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.180]  that sometimes there are features you wanna add
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:40.180]  that take a long time, and when do you fit that in?
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.480]  And then it-
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:43.300]  How do you time it?
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.140]  How do you time it to something that also
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.500]  Apple isn't doing with widgets?
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:48.080]  For example, we had to get widgets done.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:48.920]  It's a big feature.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.140]  Apple, you know, would love it, right?
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:51.740]  And then we have to put something else on hold.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.860]  Right, right, you have to prioritize it,
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.900]  and well, wait, can we charge people for this?
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.640]  You know, or just look at some of the stuff,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.620]  just mundane stuff that people
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.840]  shouldn't have to worry about.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.100]  But if, you know, Apple says,
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:09.620]  hey, 32-bit binaries are being deprecated
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.480]  in a future OS release.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.380]  Now you've got to spend time moving
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:16.280]  your whole code base to 64-bit.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.820]  You have to, or else your app won't run.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.220]  How do you, you can't sell that as, you know,
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:26.020]  the flagship tentpole feature of version 8.0 of your app
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:28.640]  is 64-bit compatibility, you know.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.100]  It'll actually still run,
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:32.140]  but it might be a mountain of work, right?
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:32.980]  It's-
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:33.820]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.780]  Apple Silicon was actually, you know,
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.140]  the transition we're ready.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.880]  What I can say about that is it was actually pretty easy.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.100]  Like, it wasn't like a lot of stress,
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:43.060]  but that had to be done.
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.540]  We still had to take time away
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.260]  from other work to do that, right?
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:47.860]  Someone has to do that.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.940]  And there were bugs, and there are issues,
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:51.340]  and we have to get that done.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.420]  Widgets, we had to get that done.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:54.580]  Even other stuff, Big Sur,
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.460]  we have changes coming for Big Sur.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:57.540]  Got to get that done.
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.820]  And that doesn't include new stuff that we want to do.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:04.900]  And it's just, it really is a very interesting business
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:08.380]  of how much stuff you have to do just to be baseline
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:10.980]  before you actually do stuff that makes the thing great.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:15.880]  Yeah, you know, you can still double-click the app
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.980]  and it will launch.
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:19.980]  It's not really considered a feature by users,
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:23.060]  and shouldn't be, but at an engineering level,
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.060]  sometimes it's surprisingly difficult.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:30.060]  And so, you know, hence the overall industry shift
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:35.060]  of commercial software where the users pay the developers
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:39.040]  to use the software, shifting from buying versions
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.040]  and paying for version upgrades to subscription pricing.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.240]  Well, the funny you should bring that up,
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.080]  because if you don't mind,
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:47.920]  I want to talk about subscriptions
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.100]  when we launched in January.
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.720]  Yeah, when we launched in January our subscription.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.220]  So we've been in business, next year will be 10 years,
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:57.080]  so we'll say nine years as of earlier this year.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.060]  Changing to subscriptions was the biggest thing
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.900]  we knew we were going to do to our business.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.020]  And it was the biggest fear we've ever had
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.380]  in the sense of this could go wrong.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.600]  We didn't think it would go wrong,
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.420]  but we knew that it was the biggest change we had made
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:10.700]  since launching the app itself.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.860]  And when we launched,
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.720]  we actually knew we were going to get attacked
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.100]  and people would be rude.
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.660]  As you know, I advise a lot of companies
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:19.100]  and I've done a lot of products in the past,
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.220]  and I'm very, very, very into the scene and the industry.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.180]  So it wasn't a surprise to me,
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:26.500]  but we got attacked and people acted
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.040]  like we were the biggest jerks at launch.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.340]  Like it really, really, really is bad.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.440]  Anyone going from a paid app
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.660]  or even a free app to a subscription,
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.180]  every developer friend of mine,
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:38.700]  every company I've ever advised,
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.480]  every company I've ever worked with,
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.700]  it's always very hard at a transition to a subscription.
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:48.060]  Users feel slighted.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:48.900]  I don't actually,
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.540]  interesting is that after now that I've had
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.900]  like nine or 10 months to debrief this,
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.020]  I actually empathize with users.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.160]  I actually get why they're upset.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.540]  I actually understand why they're so unhappy.
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:45:59.920]  I actually get why they're mad.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.700]  I really, really, really, really, really do.
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.880]  But what always is funny,
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.440]  and I don't understand why it happens is,
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.780]  as you said, double clicking an app to launch
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.220]  is sort of a given,
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.220]  but the amount of work that we put
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:15.320]  into our subscription transition
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:18.640]  to provide the existing features harmoniously to continue,
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.620]  we did have some bugs that caused some confusion
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.860]  and we did have some things,
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.660]  there's always rough spots and warts,
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.480]  but we really, really thought about,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.740]  okay, we don't want this to be painful,
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:28.900]  so what do we do?
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.340]  They're gonna wake up one morning,
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.340]  their app's gonna change,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.220]  it's gonna look different,
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.060]  and it's gonna say,
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.020]  oh, by the way, for new stuff from now on,
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.580]  you need to pay.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.060]  And we get that, change is hard,
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.320]  and I get that as a consumer,
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.860]  you don't ever wanna see that.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:45.420]  But we gave all the existing features to users,
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.420]  we gave them ongoing support,
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:49.500]  the app wouldn't sunset or die,
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.380]  we gave them, obviously that means iOS 14
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.780]  and stuff in future development would happen,
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.020]  and yet everyone was still super mad and attacked us
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.480]  and acted like we were the biggest jerks,
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.520]  and here's the thing,
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.900]  I actually understand why they think that,
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.160]  we changed what they liked about us,
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.540]  we changed that we were a $5 app
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.940]  that now they have to pay $3 a month or so to keep us.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:13.820]  But we also changed our business model,
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:17.420]  we're now a premium app with very, very, very,
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.180]  not only powerful features,
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:21.780]  but really product, productive features,
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.080]  and we have such a big roadmap that,
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.460]  okay, we didn't post the roadmap
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.660]  because we really don't wanna announce future plans,
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.540]  we definitely nod to Apple for that,
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.200]  but we have so much on our roadmap, John,
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.940]  that the value of that $3 a month that you're paying now
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.580]  isn't for what you got on January 29th
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.700]  when we launched with version 3.0,
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.700]  it's, for example, we just launched widgets,
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.420]  widgets are free for everyone,
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:46.940]  the premium features of widgets you have to pay for,
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:49.420]  but the widgets themselves are free for everyone,
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:52.060]  not just even existing fantastic L2 users.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:53.080]  Well, guess what?
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.740]  The development from premium funds that.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.580]  And yeah, anyway, so the point I'm just saying is,
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:02.420]  is that it's very interesting that subscriptions,
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.160]  even, and we're offering a free mode,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.740]  so it's not like anyone is just,
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:08.860]  you're locked out of the app if you don't pay,
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:10.440]  but people really sure feel that way,
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.220]  and I don't really know what to advise
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.180]  except it is better for our business,
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.180]  it is better for the roadmap we have,
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:19.580]  and it is absolutely better for us
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.260]  to be able to develop and release
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.780]  as soon as we've done something
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:26.580]  rather than having to wait for a 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.660]  and charge every two years or one year.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:33.260]  Yeah, that was definitely part of the strategy of,
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:38.740]  and again, BB Edit, I'll just toss as an example,
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.980]  an app that's been in constant active development
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:46.980]  since 1992, it's been a commercial product since 1993,
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:52.360]  and that is still, I guess,
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.420]  because there still are paid updates
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.720]  outside the Mac App Store,
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.380]  but it's always, and Rich Siegel at Barebones
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:02.500]  has always had a good sixth sense knack for this,
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:06.940]  but it is part of the art is when to know
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:10.120]  that this feature should probably be held
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.940]  for version 7.0 and not released in version 6.5
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.640]  because 7.0 is a paid-up update
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.780]  and this is something worth paying for,
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:21.420]  but it's ready, right?
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.180]  And it hurts, it's sort of like
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.740]  the difference between writing for a paywall
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.220]  or writing a website that's free,
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.020]  like with the difference between me and Ben Thompson,
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:37.620]  so everything I write I can just put on Daring Fireball
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.820]  and everybody can read it,
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.100]  and Ben does a once a week column
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.500]  that's free for everybody and super popular
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.060]  and it's the most popular thing he writes all week,
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.180]  but then he does a daily update for his members every week
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.820]  and we were just talking about it on Dithering
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:50.720]  where it's like sometimes he'll have
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.940]  a really good daily update
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:54.340]  and he'll think like, oh man, I wish that was free
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:55.700]  so more people could read it,
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.060]  but then on the other hand he knows
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.660]  that he's providing, that gut feeling
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.040]  is providing value to the people who pay.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.720]  Same thing with a feature where it's like,
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.480]  oh, I wish I could have just given this feature
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.960]  to everybody who's already using my app,
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.420]  but I'm also glad that the people who pay for it
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.820]  in version 9.0 or whenever it comes out
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.500]  feel like they're getting their money's worth
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.420]  for their upgrade.
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:21.060]  Subscription pricing eliminates that sort of thing.
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.220]  It's like, hey, the feature's ready,
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:24.740]  we're tested it, it's ready to go,
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.580]  we can release it now,
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.900]  and you get it on a regular basis and you don't,
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.940]  and then you can also avoid this sort of thing,
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.700]  and of all companies, you know,
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.580]  Microsoft is the one who's most famously been bitten
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:43.580]  by stacking too many things behind a major update, right?
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:47.380]  I mean, they famously almost ran the whole Windows platform
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.420]  into the ground after Windows XP
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.740]  by making Windows, what was gonna be called Windows 7,
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.700]  I guess, so ambitious, you know,
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.260]  the whole file system will be replaced
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:00.580]  by an advanced SQL database or something,
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:03.060]  and all this stuff that wound up not shipping,
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.900]  and in the meantime, they were stuck on the same
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.140]  very major version of the most popular
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:11.900]  desktop operating system in history until that point
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.900]  for eight years or something, right?
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:17.460]  You can get caught behind that sort of thinking
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:20.700]  of we're gonna make version 2.0 so awesome
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:23.620]  that everybody's gonna beg us to take their money,
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.220]  and then all of a sudden, 2.0 never ships, you know,
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.700]  because you've built it up into this thing,
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:30.980]  whereas if you don't have that motivation
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:34.540]  of making it so awesome that everybody will pay for it,
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:35.900]  if everybody's already paying
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.600]  a regular monthly subscription,
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.460]  you just ship the features as they're ready,
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:42.740]  and so you know you don't get this amazing,
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.660]  holy crap, they added 13 amazing features all at once.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.900]  You get a feature here, you get a feature there,
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:52.100]  you get a feature there, you know,
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.780]  it's a different mentality.
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:56.180]  I think it scales better.
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.540]  Since we launched in January,
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:00.140]  me as a producer, director, I will say this,
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:03.540]  it is such a great feeling that we can see something
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.260]  and be like, okay, we're gonna do that,
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.860]  and if we think it's more important
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:08.420]  than something that was planned,
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.180]  then we pivot, we do it,
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:12.700]  and we're now developing Fantastical
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.660]  and other stuff that's in development
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.780]  at a much better pace than we ever did
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.660]  charging every two years or every one year,
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:21.820]  and actually, we were kind of crazy.
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:23.020]  I don't know, I should actually look
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:24.260]  at our version history quick,
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:28.020]  but we really, really, really didn't have,
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:29.180]  you know, maybe we should have had more.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:30.540]  Maybe it was bad we didn't have more,
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:32.900]  but we really didn't have a lot of upgrades, right?
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:36.060]  So we had Fantastical 1 that came out in 2011,
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:39.340]  and then we had Fantastical 2 come out in,
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:42.060]  where is it, in March 2015.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:43.940]  So it was literally four years
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.940]  until an upgrade from one to two, right?
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:48.100]  And then that means that from two to three,
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.740]  it was almost six years, right?
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:51.460]  So it's not like we're updating
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:53.220]  or shipping every one to two years,
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:54.820]  but that idea of, all right,
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.060]  we wanna do this really big feature.
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.940]  Oh, we're gonna hold it for the next major release
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.380]  because it's so much work,
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:00.220]  and we wanna, you know,
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.540]  we have to get reimbursed for all of our work
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:02.820]  because it takes so long.
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:03.940]  Now we just develop,
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.420]  and it really is such a different roadmap.
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:08.100]  Our roadmap is really big,
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.780]  and, you know, for anyone who is listening,
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:12.980]  it is either a Fantastical user or a Fantastical hater.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.580]  We have a lot planned that you haven't seen,
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:16.780]  and widgets were one of them.
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:17.780]  Widgets were free.
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:19.420]  We have a lot of stuff, no, we really do,
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.620]  that like, that $3 a month,
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.420]  we wanna return on that investment,
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:25.260]  and we're going to.
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.180]  Well, and let me just say this in Fantastical.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:28.700]  When you say it was a $5 app,
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.140]  you're talking about the iPhone app, right?
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:31.980]  It was.
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:33.100]  Yeah, the iPhone app, the Mac app was $50.
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:33.940]  That's true. Right.
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.940]  But that, believe it or not,
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:36.220]  that was even longer.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.580]  This is the crazy part, John.
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:40.340]  That was even longer of an in-between versions
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.540]  because the original Fantastical 1 had come out,
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.820]  like, shortly after Fantastical for Mac.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.700]  The original Fantastical 1 came out in 2012.
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.420]  Fantastical 2, this is gonna blow your mind,
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:56.260]  came out in 2013, okay, so two years later.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:57.840]  But, sorry, one year later.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:01.500]  But 2013, that app was a $5 app,
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.820]  which for seven years was updated
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:05.860]  with all the new stuff for seven years
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.500]  without an additional cost.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:11.060]  So it was like 78 cents a year.
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.300]  You got it, you got it, and yeah, I mean.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:18.500]  And Apple took 30% of the 78 cents.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.980]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.620]  And look, everyone will say,
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.940]  oh, you sold all these copies,
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:24.540]  or you'd sell more if it was this.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:27.460]  Yeah, there's lots of ways to skin this cat, and there are.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.420]  But we love the model we've done now.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.460]  While there's still a lot of negative reviews,
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:34.660]  and that is the number one thing
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:36.420]  if Apple would change anything,
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.900]  is to change how the App Store reviews work,
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:42.380]  and to actually show reviews from those who have paid
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.660]  versus those who are using the free mode.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.340]  Because if someone hates us
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.540]  and they don't like the subscription model, guess what?
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:49.620]  They rate us down
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:52.860]  and say their subscription stinks one star, right?
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.380]  Okay, if you're looking as John Gruber for our app
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.260]  and all you see are subscription hates,
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.420]  but you think the app looks good,
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:54:59.260]  you don't care, right?
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:00.260]  You tune it out.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:03.300]  But why, if Apple's pushing the subscription model
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.780]  and it's better, and we actually do think it's better,
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:08.300]  why isn't the App Store fixing the problem
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.100]  of letting free users basically harm an app
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.780]  on their subscription model, rather than say,
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.620]  okay, here's a tab.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:17.460]  Here's people who have actually bought the app
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.460]  and subscribed, even if they've canceled, that's fine.
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:22.580]  But you basically can leave a review for free
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:23.620]  and just bash someone.
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:27.620]  And is that really, truly a reflection of the app?
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.020]  Well, think about this.
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:31.340]  Apps are one of the few things
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:33.340]  where you can get caught up in that.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.380]  Let's say you wanna decide whether to watch a new movie,
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:39.500]  new Avengers movies coming out or something,
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.420]  and you don't know if it's good or not.
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.140]  Do you wanna go see the reviews?
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:45.820]  I don't know where you go to read reviews now,
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:49.500]  but wherever that is, maybe you go to Metacritic
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.260]  or maybe you go to Rotten Tomatoes, or you just go,
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.100]  maybe you have a favorite publication like The New Yorker
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.220]  and you wanna read Anthony Lane's review.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.340]  You'd never go to see,
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:02.300]  what are people saying about this movie?
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.540]  And then have it be riddled with complaints
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.540]  about how expensive the movie theater is.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:10.260]  And it's all, and I took my kid
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.900]  and he wanted a bag of Twizzlers
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:14.140]  and they wanted $7 for the Twizzlers.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.460]  And it's like, this is highway robbery.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:18.180]  And say, yeah, you're right, it is highway robbery.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.860]  A bag of Twizzlers should not cost $7.
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:22.420]  But that's nothing to do with the movie,
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.260]  you know what I mean?
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:25.100]  If you wanna lodge a complaint
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:29.140]  that AMC Theatres charges too much for a movie,
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:32.740]  it's a free country, and maybe you're right
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:36.260]  that they do charge too much, or the rental is too much.
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:38.580]  If you go to, now that these movies
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.660]  can't come out in theaters and you can pay $20
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:44.820]  to see Mulan, or $30, I guess it is,
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:46.780]  to see Mulan on Disney Plus,
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.340]  do you think that's too much?
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.700]  Maybe it is too much, I don't know.
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:55.180]  But that doesn't get conflated with the reviews of Mulan.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:57.980]  When I go to read the review in the New York Times
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:01.060]  of the new live-action Mulan,
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:04.940]  it's not 700 words about the fact that it costs $30.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.580]  It's a review of the movie.
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:07.980]  And the app store-
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:10.260]  I think it's a byproduct of reviews being free.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:11.100]  I really do.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.500]  I think it's because you can just go
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:15.020]  and just review the app by just downloading it.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:17.140]  The barrier to entry's so easy, Jon.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:19.700]  And this gets to a point, too,
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:22.820]  where people think the phone app should be cheap
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:25.700]  and maybe a Mac app should be more expensive.
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:27.660]  And so maybe the old dynamic,
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.540]  in some common-sense, back-of-their-brain way,
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.260]  the idea that Fantastical for Mac was 50 bucks
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:39.260]  and Fantastical for iPhone was $5 sounds about right.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:44.540]  But from your perspective, making the app, that's crazy.
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:49.500]  Because, yeah, just because the computer is smaller
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.340]  doesn't mean it's less work, right?
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:54.580]  Like the iPhone app isn't easier to make.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.860]  Isn't it actually more work?
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:56.700]  Isn't it more work,
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.060]  because we have to create a sync engine
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:59.100]  to make them all sync?
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.980]  And sometimes it is harder to put functionality
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:04.820]  on a small screen than a big screen.
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.580]  It's easier to get lazy as a designer and say,
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.260]  well, we'll just add another menu over there.
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:10.860]  Well, you can't add a menu on a screen
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:13.300]  with no room for another menu, you know?
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:16.380]  Design is much more challenging on the iPhone, absolutely.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:17.740]  Whatever the difference is,
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:20.140]  even if you could somehow prove
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.780]  that it somehow is less engineering work
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.540]  to make an iPhone app than the Mac app
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.180]  of comparable functionality,
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:27.940]  which I would dispute right there,
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.140]  but it certainly isn't a factor of 10.
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.180]  That's crazy that it's, you know.
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.740]  No way, it's not, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:38.140]  And so, you know, I would say fundamental
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:40.140]  to the complaints that you guys got
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.780]  for Fantastical in particular.
[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:45.700]  To me, Fantastical, because it's intended
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:50.100]  to be a great app on the phone and the iPad and the Mac
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:51.780]  and even, you know, your watch.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.460]  You guys have a watch app, right?
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.020]  Yeah, our Apple Watch app,
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.260]  I'm really super happy with how it turned out.
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:00.500]  It's very, very, very productive on your wrist.
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.420]  You get to see your tasks, your events,
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.860]  you're up next, the weather.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.500]  It's really powerful on your watch.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.900]  I'd actually say we overshot
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:08.540]  because a lot of things we're trying to do,
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.300]  we're really pushing the limits of the watch,
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.660]  but I just wanna hype it up
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:15.660]  because really, it was, we probably shouldn't have done it.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.660]  I say that, and I should know that you haven't.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:20.460]  I don't use apps on my watch, so I didn't know for sure.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:23.900]  And I'm still wearing my review watch
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:25.580]  where I haven't synced over my apps,
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:27.260]  but I figured you did.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.100]  I knew you did.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:28.940]  You gotta get Fantastical on there.
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:29.900]  You gotta get Fantastical on there.
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:33.620]  But anyway, basically the problem you guys run into
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:36.440]  is that subscription deal is a great deal
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:40.660]  if you use Fantastical across multiple platforms, right?
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:43.100]  From Mac to phone to watch.
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:46.820]  And $3 a month, all of a sudden, you can see it.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:49.860]  And if you really only ever use the iPhone app,
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:55.900]  and you used to pay $5 once in 2013 and use it forever,
[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:00.780]  and now you want $3 a month to get everything,
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.420]  it feels like a ton of money.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.540]  And I think the response would be,
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:07.260]  but wait, there is a free mode
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:10.780]  that still has all the features from Fantastical too.
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.220]  And people, they don't wanna hear it.
[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:14.620]  They want, you know what I mean?
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:18.260]  And I feel like my sympathy, I think they're wrong.
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.860]  I don't think they're thinking about this right.
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:24.860]  I think they're blinded by bad assumptions
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.520]  about how everything works and should work.
[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:31.220]  But I think that to be sympathetic to them,
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.620]  what they want is they want the best Fantastical.
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:37.060]  And the best one is the one you have to pay for.
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:41.980]  And all of a sudden, instead of $5 once several years ago,
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.380]  it's $3 a month, it's a big difference.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:46.220]  No, no doubt.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:48.140]  And I have truly started to empathize
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.700]  with everyone who's upset in that here.
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.260]  They want the best Fantastical.
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:54.060]  They don't wanna pay what they paid.
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:54.900]  There's even users who have said,
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.220]  well, can't you just do an in-app purchase
[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:58.520]  or something smaller that's sort of helpful,
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:00.080]  that we don't have to go ongoing?
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.100]  And the answer is no, because then if we fragment that,
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.560]  even if it makes those people happy,
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:06.740]  now our development time has now been split
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:08.460]  between them and the main app.
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:10.880]  And again, that removes what the subscription
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:12.580]  has done for us.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:13.560]  People will call it a money grab.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:14.580]  It's not a money grab at all.
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:15.960]  We know how much we need to make
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.460]  versus how much we're making.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.260]  And what the subscription does
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:23.700]  is it gives us a reliable income revenue stream
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:27.700]  that grows over time with subscribers that stay on, right?
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:31.420]  And we can now count on our revenue and just develop.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.560]  We don't have to worry.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:35.820]  We don't have to come up with gimmicks to sell, right?
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:39.380]  We're just, to be honest, we're the best indie developers
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.920]  we've ever been right now.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:41.980]  I'm glad to hear that.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:46.980]  I mean, so speaking of other indie developers
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:51.500]  and other models, a big new launch just last week
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.260]  is from our friends at Panic.
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.380]  They're Nova, they call it a code editor, text editor.
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:02.380]  But it's hard to, what Nova is is hard to categorize.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.140]  Fundamentally, I guess it's a text editor
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:08.820]  for programmers, but it's sort of like an IDE,
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:12.400]  and for example, and it has extensions and stuff,
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:15.840]  and you can do things like if you have a Playdate,
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.000]  Panic's upcoming little handheld Game Boy style
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.820]  video game player, the IDE for making Playdate games
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:26.940]  is Nova, and you can, same way that you can,
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:29.460]  when you're in Xcode, you wanna build your iPhone app,
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:32.340]  you do a command R to build and run, and it runs.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.260]  You can do that in Nova to build and run
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.420]  your Playdate game, and it runs in a simulator
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:41.260]  on your Mac, or you can connect it via USB
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:43.460]  and have it build and run and install it
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:46.860]  right on your actual Playdate device.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.880]  It's a very ambitious app, and it's sort of a sequel
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.880]  to their old code editor Coda, which they complicated,
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:00.740]  sold the name to and turned into Panic's code editor,
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.820]  because they knew they weren't sticking with it long-term
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:05.820]  and were replacing it with Nova, which really is
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:10.820]  both a replacement, but also sort of a shift in direction.
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:14.340]  Anyway, it's a great app, it is a Mac.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.380]  Very, very, very great app, by the way.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:17.220]  Very great app.
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:19.460]  Super ambitious, it is the sort of thing
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.820]  that is so ambitious that in less talented hands
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:25.260]  is the sort of thing that could sink a company,
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:28.780]  and 40 years from now, poor Cable Sasser
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:30.320]  would have a long gray beard and be like,
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.980]  it's coming out any day, but it's shipped, it's here,
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:38.660]  it is fantastic, it is exuberant, and if you love,
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:43.500]  really, that term, I think Brent Coyne, Mac asked Mac apps,
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.340]  it is a Mac asked Mac app, and a lot of the news
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:50.700]  in programming editors that people use on the Mac
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:53.460]  over the last five to 10 years have been things
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:58.500]  that aren't Mac asked Mac apps, they're electron dinguses
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:01.420]  that maybe have tons of features and maybe you listening
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.700]  use one and you like it, and maybe it's good
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.620]  for all sorts of reasons, but it's not good
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:10.260]  at being a Mac asked Mac app, and Nova is very much
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:13.740]  a Mac asked Mac app, which is great,
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.940]  but they have an interesting pricing model.
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:21.940]  What they're doing is they're selling it for $99,
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:24.980]  and if you already own their old app, Coda,
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:26.580]  you can upgrade for $79.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:29.620]  So, so far, this sounds like what we were talking about,
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.000]  right, this is the old way, you get an upgrade price
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  if you owned Coda and you pay $99 if you're new,
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:38.900]  but here's where it's sort of different,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:41.180]  is you get, from whatever day you pay,
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:43.120]  you get a year of all their software updates,
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.240]  whatever they update for the next 12 months, you get,
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:48.940]  and then when that update, 12 months from the date
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:51.760]  of your buying a license is over,
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:54.180]  you no longer get software updates,
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:58.220]  but your copy of Nova keeps working on your computer,
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:00.580]  you just don't get software updates for it,
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:03.260]  and if you want to, you can sign up
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:06.940]  to pay $49 a year after that,
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:10.160]  so let's say you pay $100 today,
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:14.740]  one year from today, your updates from that $100 are over,
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:18.900]  and your $49 a year, it is a subscription
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:22.900]  that you're paying, kicks in, and then you keep getting,
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:24.900]  whenever they introduce software updates,
[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:26.720]  you just keep getting them going forward,
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:30.620]  but if you don't sign up for that $49 subscription,
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:32.940]  the version you had 12 months after purchase,
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.620]  that's yours to keep, it keeps working technically,
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.900]  maybe a year later, there's some new feature they have
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:40.700]  that comes out, you're like, I would like that,
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.700]  and you can just get back on the upgrade gravy train
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:45.020]  for $49.
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:50.660]  Yeah, and to be fair, we always say it's about $3 a month
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.380]  for Fantastical, we could say it's $40 a year,
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:54.760]  but for their $49 a year, they're about $4 a month,
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:59.180]  and for a really expert professional tool
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:01.900]  that they're selling, $4 a month is ridiculously cheap.
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.620]  Yeah, it's, and again, and you're like,
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.420]  well, I don't use a text editor worth $4 a month,
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:08.960]  well, then you're not in the market, you know what I mean?
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.820]  This is a professional power tool, right?
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:13.020]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:17.820]  You can go to Home Depot and find very expensive saws
[02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.220]  or nail guns, like the best nail gun they sell,
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:21.340]  you're like, well, why in the world
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.940]  would I spend all this money on a nail gun?
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:23.920]  I don't even shoot nails.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.660]  Well, what are you looking, why are you complaining
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:26.940]  about the price?
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.780]  You don't shoot nails into the wall.
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:29.740]  Whereas if you spend.
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:31.820]  Yeah, their target customer wants to buy that app.
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:35.820]  Right, you live in it, you know, and it's,
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.920]  now, they're not in the Mac App Store,
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:40.580]  and I wrote about this and some people complained about.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.260]  You get the main complaints, you, the developer,
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:47.920]  like, and panic the developers of the app.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:50.060]  I get the secondary complaints,
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:51.940]  as the person who writes about these apps,
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.900]  from the people who don't like the pricing model.
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:58.960]  They complain to me, then, about celebrating
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.820]  or just mentioning it without, they yell at me
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:03.300]  for not complaining about the things
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.540]  that they complain about.
[02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:10.880]  Why are you supporting the things that we hate?
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:14.800]  But it's, you know, you can't please everybody.
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.860]  I guess the only way you can make everybody happy
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:20.860]  is if you became fabulously wealthy
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:24.700]  and funded a company to make these amazing apps
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:27.620]  and gave them to the world for free, I guess.
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:28.460]  Because then.
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:30.480]  I would bet you that would not even work either,
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.060]  because there'd be something.
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.000]  There'd be, you know, privacy people thinking
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.780]  that there's a scam, there would be,
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:40.300]  I wanna pay you, I don't know, there would be something.
[02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:43.300]  Well, it's noteworthy that nobody's done that, right?
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:46.580]  The George Soroses of the world have not devoted
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:49.140]  their lives to foundations to make fantastic,
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:52.680]  independent software that they give away to people for free.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:55.460]  I'll make a promise.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:58.020]  If this thing blows up bigger than I think it's going to,
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:00.820]  which it's not, if it goes that crazy big,
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:02.820]  I'll make Fantastical free for everyone,
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:03.740]  although I shouldn't say that,
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:04.820]  because someone will hold me to that,
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.780]  so forget it, that whole thing was a fallacy.
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:08.620]  The difference here between a regular,
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:13.620]  what we think of a subscription versus what Panic is doing,
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.580]  and what Panic is doing, to give credit
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:18.180]  to another very good indie app, Sketch,
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:23.180]  which is an illustration app with a decided market
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:27.500]  towards people using it to illustrate user interfaces,
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:28.580]  in particular, and certainly
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:31.060]  that's where I know Sketch best from.
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:31.880]  Has a-
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:32.720]  Yeah, they did a great job with that.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.060]  And they have a very similar model,
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:37.300]  and they've had years of success with it,
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:40.960]  and both with the app, which has won Apple Design Awards,
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.980]  and is very popular and ongoing,
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:45.240]  but same sort of thing, where the difference is,
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.060]  with most subscriptions, if you cancel your subscription,
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:53.720]  the app either stops working or you lose functionality,
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.440]  whereas with the Sketch and Nova model,
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:01.340]  when you stop paying, what you have keeps working,
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:03.340]  but you just don't get updates.
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:05.240]  But even that, technically,
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:07.300]  even just talking about obsolescence,
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.120]  eventually you will run out of time,
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.300]  and people will complain, right?
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:15.940]  Like, hypothetically, someone who has been in,
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:20.940]  let's say somebody had the foresight 12, 13, 14 years ago
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.940]  to invent this pricing model then,
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:28.040]  when it wasn't really necessitated by the market forces,
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.680]  but they came up with this idea then,
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.820]  and we went through the 32-bit to 64-bit transition,
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:36.880]  and people who had paid and said,
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:41.340]  I don't need any new features, but they would feel entitled,
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:44.100]  years after the fact, to that 64-bit update.
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:47.500]  Well, wait, that should be included free,
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.580]  even though I'm not paying for updates anymore,
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:52.100]  because my app won't even launch anymore.
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:56.140]  And it's like, well, pay the money, right?
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.980]  That model is definitely, to me,
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:01.500]  if we could have done that with being on the App Store
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:03.900]  and how things work, we looked at that model,
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:06.120]  and I think for Nova and Sketch, it makes sense,
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.740]  they're professional tools, they're off the App Store,
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:09.660]  it really makes a lot of sense,
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:11.620]  but there's also a lot of bookkeeping
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:14.740]  you have to keep track of in terms of what features work.
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:18.120]  If there is a bug that kills the app because of the OS,
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.740]  do you really fix it or not?
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:23.300]  There's a lot of implications,
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:24.580]  and I'm not saying that it's wrong,
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:26.180]  I'm just saying nothing's perfect, right?
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.580]  But I think for Nova and Sketch,
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:30.300]  being off the App Store and being professional tools,
[02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:31.980]  that really is the way to go.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:34.060]  You buy the app, you wanna keep using it,
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.620]  and I think most people will keep using it
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:36.460]  and keep paying for it,
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.500]  because they're professional tools, they want the updates.
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:40.300]  Yeah, and well, and I think it helps a little bit
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:42.460]  that they're Mac tools specifically,
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:43.900]  and again, I don't know, I don't even know,
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.220]  I'm not, I don't know.
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:46.480]  Is there an iOS companion?
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.480]  Right, I know Panic had the Coda editor for iOS,
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:56.820]  but, you know, Panic's been very clear over the years
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:59.660]  in their annual updates, that when they tried to expand
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:03.860]  what they've made work on the Mac for decades,
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:06.140]  when they tried to do the same thing for iOS,
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:08.600]  it did not work for them financially, you know?
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:10.700]  That if, and thankfully, you know,
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:12.860]  they didn't bet their company on it,
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:14.280]  it would have been ruinous,
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.500]  but the model they have had and continue to have
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:22.660]  to successfully sell delightful Panic-style software
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:27.100]  for the Mac was lost money for them on iOS.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:28.860]  Oh, definitely.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:31.880]  You know, but I think, so I think it's a model,
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:34.180]  again, you know, different apps have different markets
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:35.060]  and need different things.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:37.500]  Like, I think what works for Fantastical,
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:39.700]  a huge part of the reason is that you guys
[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:41.840]  are literally on every single Apple platform.
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.020]  I guess you're not, all right, you're not.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:45.340]  You're not, you don't have a TV OS app.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.260]  Or a CarPlay app, which ironically,
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.380]  someone on Twitter asked us
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:51.020]  if we could make Fantastical for their car.
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:56.020]  Well, I, what makes more sense, a TV app or a car app?
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.140]  A car app probably makes.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:11:59.380]  I don't know if neither makes,
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:00.980]  I actually don't know if neither makes sense.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.500]  I mean, I have ideas already spinning in my head
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.620]  of what we could do, but I don't know, man.
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.060]  Like, I don't, like, I don't know
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:07.900]  if that's where we want to be.
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:11.080]  It seems to me that using the Siri voice assistant
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.100]  makes more sense in the car than using an actual app
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:16.380]  and saying, you know, hey, Dingus,
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.340]  when's my next appointment?
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:21.180]  Or what's the address of the place I'm trying to get to,
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:22.520]  et cetera, would work.
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:24.540]  The other app I want to mention,
[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:26.180]  I want to mention an app called Agenda.
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.120]  Have you seen Agenda?
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:28.960]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.500]  And they have a similar model in the app store
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:32.260]  and they're making it work with the app store, actually.
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:36.320]  Yeah, and so Agenda is a really, again,
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.180]  and they sponsored Daring Fireball a while back.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.820]  Fantastic Al sponsored Daring Fireball.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:43.020]  So, you know, preface this with whatever you want
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:44.940]  as a disclaimer that these are people
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:46.780]  who sponsored my site, but I'm saying good things
[02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.460]  about them simply because it's a really great
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.840]  and interesting app.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.220]  But Agenda is a very interesting hybrid
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:59.220]  of a sort of notes plus to-dos plus scheduled to-dos.
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:03.300]  So it kind of goes into calendaring,
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.960]  not calendaring, but timed to-dos.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.780]  But basically, it's a great name.
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.620]  An agenda.
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:09.440]  It is an agenda.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:10.340]  It's a fantastic.
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:11.780]  Yeah, the name's perfect.
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:16.740]  Delightful design, very, very, very nice design
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:19.860]  that is sort of, oh, yeah, this fits right at home
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:23.880]  on a modern Apple system, but also is very branded
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:25.900]  and feels, you know, you appreciate it
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:26.860]  because you know what I'm, you know,
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:28.780]  fantastic Al has that going.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.240]  Anyway, their model.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.180]  Agenda's very well done.
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:32.020]  Very well done.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:35.580]  And their model for this sort of new way
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.880]  of approaching monetization is that you don't pay
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.820]  for versions, you pay for features.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:44.860]  And so you pay for Agenda, and then you get the pay,
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:45.940]  you know, there's a free version.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:47.140]  You can download it and use it,
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:50.360]  and it's useful and interesting for free.
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:52.260]  And then they have more features
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:53.300]  that you have to pay for.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:56.820]  And then if you pay for them, you get the paid features.
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:01.620]  And as time goes on, they will add new paid features,
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:03.820]  but since they came out after you paid,
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:06.020]  you have to pay for those features.
[02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:08.620]  And if you don't, if the feature is,
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:12.420]  now the pen, when you use the Apple Pencil,
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:16.900]  can write in purple ink for the first time.
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:18.260]  And you're like, well, I would never want
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:21.820]  to write in purple ink, so I'm not paying for that feature.
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.340]  And you don't have to pay for it.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:26.380]  And then later on, when they come out with a feature
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:30.300]  that you can make the Apple Pencils shoot emojis
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:33.140]  all over your agenda, and you're like, I need that.
[02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:34.940]  And you know, then you pay for that feature.
[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:36.220]  I just made up those features.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.100]  They're not actual features of Agenda at all,
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.820]  but that's what I'm saying.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:41.980]  You pay for the feature.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:46.540]  And I've seen people say, and it's already chimed up
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:48.900]  in my comments on Nova, like, hey, you say
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:50.380]  that Nova can't be in the App Store.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:52.060]  I didn't say they can't be in the App Store.
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:53.700]  I said they're not in the App Store.
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:57.980]  And the exact model that Nova is using
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.940]  is not technically possible in the Nova, in the App Store.
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:06.620]  Agenda proves that something sort of along those lines
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:09.580]  is possible if you design it with App Store rules
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.500]  and systems in mind.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.300]  But the other thing that people are ignoring
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:16.100]  is that the team behind Agenda is doing a lot of work
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:17.780]  to make that work behind the scenes.
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:18.620]  Where they're in-
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:20.860]  A ton of work, ton of work.
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.940]  And it might be worth it.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:23.500]  It may well be worth it.
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:24.860]  And I hope they're doing well
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:27.220]  because it's a great app from good people
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.940]  and it deserves to thrive.
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:30.860]  But do not underestimate the fact
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:35.500]  that they are building permanent scaffolding in the app
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:40.420]  to tie features to paid upgrades
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:42.380]  that you've paid along the way
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:45.500]  and doing it in a way that any, you know,
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:48.220]  they can't quite predict what combination of features
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:49.260]  you might have paid for,
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:52.100]  but the whole app still needs to function, right?
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:53.580]  I did realize actually something
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:55.220]  with Nova and Sketch and Agenda
[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:57.380]  that's interesting about their model.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.180]  They're a pay once a year,
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:01.700]  once an upgrade or whatever it is model, right?
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:04.700]  You have to pay the full 49, 59, whatever.
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:06.780]  The subscription model lets you pay monthly, right?
[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:08.300]  Without locking in a year.
[02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:10.260]  So the one thing with those apps
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:12.540]  is that you do have to pay a bigger amount upfront
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:13.940]  to get in, right?
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:17.020]  Where with Fantastical, yeah, it does turn off,
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:18.340]  quote, unquote, you go to free mode.
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:19.380]  It doesn't just stop working.
[02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:21.260]  It's just the premium features stop working,
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:24.060]  but you do have the ability to do the 499 a month
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:27.100]  as a monthly as you go and cancel at any time.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:28.140]  And it's just interesting
[02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:30.100]  because that is a lower bar to entry
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.340]  to try it out than the other apps as well.
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:33.860]  Yeah, I totally agree, right.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:35.740]  And then they...
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:37.420]  Just interesting, I never thought about that before.
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:39.780]  You know, it's complicated.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:42.620]  It is complicated.
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:44.260]  If there's anything I would ask,
[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:47.100]  it is that users should have sympathy for the plight
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:48.340]  of the indie developer.
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:53.340]  And that it is, you know, we're all in this together
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:58.060]  in terms of wanting awesome pro level indie apps,
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:01.940]  you know, like BB Edit and Nova and Fantastical and Agenda.
[02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:03.780]  And the list can go on and on, you know,
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.180]  everything from the Omni group.
[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:08.500]  And, you know, I can't start listing the apps
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:09.340]  that would qualify,
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:12.140]  but we want them to keep thriving as businesses.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.620]  And it's not simple.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:17.420]  And I guarantee you, I've never met any of them.
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:19.380]  Even the guy I was mentioning
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:22.900]  whose support method was select all delete.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:23.740]  Delete support.
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:26.140]  He still cared about his users
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:29.900]  and, you know, he wasn't trying to rip them off.
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.540]  I've never met an indie developer
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:36.300]  who wanted to do anything other than to give their users
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:39.100]  value for their dollar spent and appreciated it.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.060]  Yeah. And, you know, at the end of the day,
[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:43.740]  we're trying to work around this ecosystem
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.060]  that Apple has built, right?
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:47.340]  We're still as Apple developers anyway.
[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:50.340]  We have the iOS, we have iOS, iPad, OS.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.420]  I'm just saying we have all these things
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:54.540]  that we still have restrictions when we submit an app.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:57.060]  Okay, Nova and Sketch do not, they're off of it,
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:17:58.220]  but Agenda does.
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:00.700]  And regardless, there's still also limitations
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.140]  of just developer tools, right?
[02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:04.460]  That Nova and Sketch have to make work.
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:06.780]  It's not just as easy as do whatever you want
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:08.020]  and make the best decision.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.700]  There's also decisions that have to be made
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:12.060]  that were already made for you.
[02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:14.340]  Did you see Panic's tweet the other day where they're like,
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:15.900]  I can't tell you what a relief it is
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:18.460]  to just issue a software update when it's ready?
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:22.900]  Because they have a Nova 1.1 update and they released it.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:23.740]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:25.020]  And I thought of you immediately
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:26.700]  because you had just texted me the night before
[02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:28.900]  that you were, I think it was the very night before
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.700]  and you were like, I think we'll be ready
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:32.940]  for our widgets update the next day.
[02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:34.780]  Yup.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.220]  And instead you woke up and it was like,
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.100]  well, it was approved.
[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:40.980]  You literally went to bed not knowing
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:42.620]  when your software was going to.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:43.460]  Literally went to bed not knowing.
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:44.700]  We even have that with TestFlight
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:46.820]  because you know TestFlight has to be approved, right?
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:49.660]  So when you have a new app, just even to send to testers,
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:52.740]  we can't even have testers test our app until it's approved.
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:57.100]  It's very restrictive and again,
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.820]  there's a lot of things we have to do
[02:18:58.820 --> 02:18:59.660]  because we're forced to do.
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:00.500]  Right.
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:04.300]  Anyway, thank you for being here, Michael.
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:05.140]  It's been a pleasure.
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:08.740]  It's been a pleasure, it's a good conversation.
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.580]  Everybody. Thanks, likewise.
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:12.380]  So the best place to find out more about Fantastical,
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:15.260]  what's the best URL?
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:21.420]  Flexibits.com, F-L-E-X-I-B-I-T-S.com.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:24.700]  And you can go and find out more about Fantastical.
[02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:27.260]  Michael Simmons on Twitter, you're on Twitter.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.300]  What's your Twitter address?
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:33.540]  It's at MacGuitar, M-A-C-G-U-I-T-A-R.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:35.900]  It's a throwback from the old days of Mac.
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:36.900]  You can play in guitar.
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.780]  So that was it.
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:42.420]  I don't know, Nick, I came up with 90 something
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:43.740]  and it just always has been around.
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:45.220]  I have a weird mental thing.
[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:46.780]  As soon as you started saying it, I was like,
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:48.100]  oh yeah, he's MacGuitar.
[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:51.500]  But I can't remember what people's Twitter avatars
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.460]  or names are.
[02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:55.460]  I, you know, the only one whose name I remember
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:58.740]  is Syracuse's because it's just Syracuse.
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:19:59.980]  Everybody else, I forget.
[02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:00.820]  Is it Marco?
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:01.780]  Is it Marco Arment?
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:06.340]  Is it, you know, if your avatars or if your Twitter name
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:09.380]  is anything other than your last name, I'll forget it.
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:13.100]  But that's where people can go see you on Twitter.
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.180]  Let me thank our sponsors, our great sponsors,
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:16.180]  all of them, Repeats.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:17.620]  I love them all to death.
[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:20.460]  Squarespace, where you can sign up to make a website.
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.940]  Feels, where you can get premium CBD delivered
[02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:25.940]  right to your door.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:29.780]  And Linode slash Linode,
[02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:32.060]  our favorite cloud hosting provider,
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:21:00.020]  whose name neither of us is 100% sure how to pronounce.
