[00:00.000 --> 00:03.120]  I got really excited when I bought a, you know, mechanical keyboard, and I'm really loving it.
[00:03.120 --> 00:09.840]  It's this weird, um, Korean... I guess they call it a 60% keyboard, so it's got no function row,
[00:09.840 --> 00:13.040]  but it's super small, and it's very clicky, and I really like it.
[00:13.680 --> 00:16.720]  And I thought, aha, now I can get rid of this other keyboard. And I realized I have to keep
[00:16.720 --> 00:22.720]  the other keyboard, like, within arm's reach, because I can't type and talk.
[00:22.720 --> 00:23.760]  What brand keyboard is it?
[00:24.320 --> 00:26.480]  It's a Leopold.
[00:26.480 --> 00:26.800]  Send me a...
[00:26.800 --> 00:28.080]  Get them on eBay.
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.680]  Really? You can't buy them direct?
[00:29.680 --> 00:31.600]  Are they, like, used, or...?
[00:31.600 --> 00:32.880]  No, they're all new.
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.040]  That's just how they sell.
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.160]  Yeah, and they've got them in different, um, they got them in different, uh, like, uh,
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.120]  mechanisms. There are a couple different mechanisms of, you know, like, the different
[00:45.120 --> 00:51.760]  key switches. Mine is a, like, a cherry blue, but, um, I'll send you a link.
[00:51.760 --> 00:52.960]  I got them. I got it here.
[00:52.960 --> 00:54.480]  Mechanicalkeyboards.com.
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.920]  Yeah, yeah, and it's the FC660M is the one that I've got, and I love it because it's so
[00:59.920 --> 01:06.560]  tiny, and it's, it's really enjoyably, uh, clicky. I got the Matthias, um, small keyboard,
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.760]  too, and it's not bad, but it's, it's way bigger, like, the whole thing. It's got, it's
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.600]  got another, uh, row of keys, and it's got, the only problem with this one is you gotta
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.440]  map some of the keys, because it's missing, it's missing a few keys, but the, but the
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.640]  arrow keys are, like, properly oriented as arrows, and, um, and it's nice and clicky,
[01:24.640 --> 01:26.240]  and then I started buying keycaps, so.
[01:26.240 --> 01:30.400]  So you got blue cherry. What, wait, what do you mean keycaps? Do they, does this company
[01:30.400 --> 01:31.280]  sell the official ones?
[01:31.920 --> 01:38.000]  Uh, no, so I, I ended up on eBay. There are a few places including, um, I ended up with,
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.120]  uh, oh, what is it, the, the people that make the code keyboard. Um, they have, uh, they
[01:45.120 --> 01:52.240]  have a whole, uh, like, they have, like, like, a keycap, uh, shop where you can order custom
[01:52.240 --> 01:55.520]  keycaps, because the one I got came with, like, black keycaps, and they were sort of
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.800]  Windows keys, and I ended up spending probably way too much money on some, like, orange custom
[02:00.800 --> 02:03.200]  keycaps, um, which was kind of cool.
[02:03.200 --> 02:09.360]  I blame Josh, uh, Topolski. He posted a couple of, uh, pictures of, of this model keyboard
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.240]  that he's built, and I, I said, that's really interesting, and that was, then I was, I was
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.600]  kind of ruined, but, but it's terrible for podcasting, because the clicks, the clicks
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.640]  are very loud.
[02:20.640 --> 02:25.040]  There's, the one that, this picture I'm looking at of this keyboard, on the left side, at
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.640]  the bottom, bottom left corner, there's a control key, and then there's, there's, like,
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.000]  a keyboard key. It's a picture that has a, what is that?
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.880]  Yeah, I think that's the, um, operating system key, so that's, like, your, your, uh, command
[02:38.880 --> 02:40.160]  key or your Windows key.
[02:40.160 --> 02:42.960]  Oh, it's like the Windows key. I can't use the Windows logo.
[02:42.960 --> 02:48.160]  And then I mapped, yeah, I mapped it all to, uh, to Mac, so I actually flipped the keys
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.600]  around, so that's my option key.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.600]  So what does cherry blue feel like?
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.560]  This is the thing that confuses me, and I, I have, I have a collection of Apple extended
[02:56.560 --> 03:03.760]  twos, and I'm using, I'm using my third one of my lifetime right now, um, including
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.080]  one, I forget who sent me the one that was, that's mint.
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.280]  I still have one, I have one that is literally, like, sealed mint in the, in the box, which
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.680]  I'm saving, you know, and the one that I'm using now was, like, truly near mint when
[03:15.680 --> 03:21.600]  I started using it. Um, I've tried other mechanical keyboards, but I've never found
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.240]  one that I really like, and, and it doesn't have the same feel, and I get so confused
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.840]  by this, the different switches, and it's, it's very confusing to me.
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.720]  Honestly, when I, uh, was shopping for this, I went to Matthias's website, and they have
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.800]  a, uh, they have audio clips of a few different key, uh, mechanical key switches that you
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.360]  can actually sort of listen to the sound of them being made, like, just typing, and I
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.840]  listened to that for a while, and, uh, and I thought that, that the cherry blue sort
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.040]  of sounded like I want, like, I kind of wanted it, and it's not all sound, right?
[03:55.040 --> 03:56.800]  It's, it's like, it's like taste.
[03:56.800 --> 03:59.920]  It's, it's, uh, when you eat something, you're tasting it, but you're also smelling
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.280]  it, and those two things go together.
[04:01.280 --> 04:02.240]  Keyboards is like that.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.560]  It's, it's the feel, and it's the sound, and they go together.
[04:06.560 --> 04:12.400]  Um, and like I said, I ended up with the Matthias one, which is supposed to be more like the
[04:12.400 --> 04:17.200]  Apple extended, um, I think, and then, and I got this one, which is the cherry blue,
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.200]  and I like the cherry blue better.
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.640]  I, I mean, the Matthias is fine.
[04:20.640 --> 04:21.200]  I like it.
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.160]  It's, uh, it's a little more, um, of what I'm, what my, at least my sense memory of
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.520]  those old Apple keyboards was, which is a little more kind of like clunk, clunk, clunk,
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.000]  clunk, and this is a little more clicky, like high-pitched clicky, clicky, click, click.
[04:34.000 --> 04:34.560]  I gotcha.
[04:34.560 --> 04:34.960]  I gotcha.
[04:34.960 --> 04:38.960]  I say, I think I don't like that, so yours is maybe a little bit more like the IBM style.
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.760]  I know that IBM buckling spring is different, that the buckling spring ones are different.
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.400]  That, like Rich Siegel uses, uses that style, I believe, and he's like, that's, you know,
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.240]  it's sort of whatever mechanical keyboard you grew up with, I think is the one you end
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.680]  up gravitating toward.
[04:53.680 --> 04:58.240]  Um, I wish there was a place, I'm sure there is, I'm sure like keyboard people get together
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.440]  and have little key parties where they, where they type on the different mechanisms and
[05:03.440 --> 05:04.880]  you can really get a sense of it.
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.680]  Um, but I'm just sort of slowly, uh, slowly learning about, about the different, different
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.520]  ones, but I've been, you know, I've been happy with it.
[05:11.520 --> 05:14.160]  It's been, I, I, I didn't use a mechanical keyboard for a long time.
[05:14.160 --> 05:20.400]  I was just sort of using, um, analogs of the, of the MacBook keyboard because I, I, you
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.480]  know, was using a MacBook as a primary system.
[05:22.480 --> 05:26.640]  So I kind of wanted my, my keyboards to all match and feel as much as possible.
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.080]  But now that I'm sitting at an iMac for a lot of the day, I thought, why don't I give
[05:30.080 --> 05:30.560]  it a try?
[05:30.560 --> 05:31.680]  And I've been pretty happy with it.
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.080]  It is, it's good that I'm working in a, in a closed office with nobody in it because
[05:36.080 --> 05:39.280]  it would drive everybody else crazy if they could hear me typing.
[05:39.280 --> 05:45.360]  If, if the chair, if the blue cherry switches are what I think that they're like, I, the
[05:45.360 --> 05:50.160]  more clicky than funky, then that's actually, to me, it's more, that's, maybe it's just
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.520]  my ears, but it's a, it's louder or more prominent.
[05:54.160 --> 05:58.480]  Yeah, I think it might, I think it might be, um, it depends on what frequencies you're
[05:58.480 --> 06:03.040]  tuned into, but, but I do enjoy going back to that, to having that tactile feedback.
[06:03.040 --> 06:10.000]  As much as I, um, loved, uh, the MacBook keyboard style, I totally get, now that I've been back
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.600]  on a mechanical keyboard for a while, I totally get why people criticize them for feeling
[06:13.600 --> 06:14.160]  mushy.
[06:14.160 --> 06:15.680]  I get what that means now.
[06:15.680 --> 06:18.320]  So there's blue cherry and brown cherry.
[06:18.320 --> 06:21.440]  Yeah, there's multiple different kind of cherry switches.
[06:21.440 --> 06:22.720]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.680]  And I have no idea.
[06:23.680 --> 06:25.200]  I am not, I'm not an expert.
[06:25.200 --> 06:27.360]  I just kind of took a shot in the dark on one of them.
[06:27.360 --> 06:31.200]  Truly where shopping on the internet is the worst.
[06:31.200 --> 06:36.320]  Like this is the sort of thing where like in the old days, you want to buy 10 keyboards.
[06:36.320 --> 06:36.880]  I know.
[06:36.880 --> 06:40.320]  And I, and I hate sending stuff back.
[06:40.320 --> 06:42.080]  It's just like, and it's irrational.
[06:42.080 --> 06:48.000]  It makes no logical sense whatsoever that I would rather just have $110 keyboard that
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.680]  I'd put in the closet and never use, but I just hate sending stuff back.
[06:51.680 --> 06:55.760]  I don't, I just don't like it, but I just sent a keyboard back and I didn't love it,
[06:55.760 --> 07:00.080]  but I, it was, I tried that, uh, mechanical keyboard for the iPad, the razor.
[07:01.120 --> 07:02.800]  Um, and it just wasn't that good.
[07:03.920 --> 07:06.640]  And so I, I did go through the rigmarole of sending that back.
[07:06.640 --> 07:09.600]  Cause that was a pretty pricey thing, but I hate doing it too.
[07:09.600 --> 07:13.760]  And so you end up, uh, a lot of times not buying things cause it's just like, it's too
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.320]  complicated.
[07:14.320 --> 07:15.440]  I don't know what to pick.
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.040]  And so I'll just kind of give it up, but I took a shot in the dark with this one and
[07:19.040 --> 07:20.960]  I'm, I'm pretty happy with it.
[07:20.960 --> 07:23.040]  Is it the best keyboard for me?
[07:23.040 --> 07:23.600]  Maybe not.
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.680]  There may be some other one out there that's totally, you know, one, I would prefer to
[07:27.680 --> 07:34.800]  this, but, uh, I, I haven't gone and, and, and bought five different keyboards yet.
[07:34.800 --> 07:40.000]  Anyway, I, I have also, I have bought, um, some, I think at least two keyboards from
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.920]  Matthias over the years and specifically billed by Matthias as being for aficionados of the
[07:45.920 --> 07:47.680]  Apple extended keyboard too.
[07:47.680 --> 07:49.840]  And I have to say that I didn't even think it was close.
[07:49.840 --> 07:53.920]  It, it, I, for whatever reason, the Matthias ones don't appeal to me.
[07:53.920 --> 07:59.680]  I'm so picky about these keyboards that I don't even like some Apple extended keyboard
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.480]  twos, even ones that are seemingly in good condition, that, that there's variants between
[08:04.480 --> 08:12.080]  them that I, I detect that it's some of them, it's like a, like the one that I had from
[08:12.080 --> 08:12.640]  college.
[08:12.640 --> 08:14.800]  And I think I've told this story before.
[08:14.800 --> 08:16.880]  I loved this keyboard.
[08:16.880 --> 08:20.960]  I should see, I, I, somebody once said that they could fix it.
[08:20.960 --> 08:22.960]  Somebody who knows how to solder could probably fix it.
[08:22.960 --> 08:26.880]  It's the E key that broke, which is probably because it's the one I typed the most.
[08:26.880 --> 08:27.040]  Right.
[08:27.040 --> 08:27.520]  It makes sense.
[08:29.680 --> 08:37.360]  My sophomore year of college, I was playing, uh, John Madden football in the dorms and
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.280]  there was, uh, let's see, it was, so it would have been like Madden 92.
[08:41.280 --> 08:46.480]  And I was, uh, always the Houston Oilers with, um, who was the great quarterback that the
[08:46.480 --> 08:47.680]  Houston Oilers or moon.
[08:47.680 --> 08:48.000]  Yes.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.360]  Warren moon, Warren moon with a cannon of an arm.
[08:51.360 --> 08:55.120]  I mean, like it was like on a skit, like the, the stats were like up to 15.
[08:55.120 --> 08:58.800]  It was like 15 distance, 15, 15 arm strength, 15 accuracy.
[08:58.800 --> 09:01.600]  And, uh, this other kid, I think his name is Jeff.
[09:01.600 --> 09:04.480]  Who've always played with the Philadelphia Eagles, the buddy Ryan Eagles.
[09:04.480 --> 09:11.120]  Uh, so it was me with my pass, happy, uh, long bombs and him with these like bone crushing,
[09:11.120 --> 09:12.400]  uh, defensive guys.
[09:13.280 --> 09:14.880]  And we had a great rivalry.
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.960]  And one time we bet, I think I bet, uh, 50 bucks cash up against his Apple extended keyboard
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.200]  too, because I had a Mac LC, which came with the real shit keyboard.
[09:25.200 --> 09:27.520]  I don't even know what it was small and mushy.
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.720]  And he got the Mac SE 30, which came with the, uh, extended keyboard too.
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.040]  So the deal was, it was winner takes all one game of Madden football, where if I want,
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.600]  I got his keyboard and I'd give him my crappy one.
[09:39.600 --> 09:41.200]  So he'd, you know, have a keyboard.
[09:41.200 --> 09:44.880]  And I think, I think I put up 50 bucks cash, which I knew was a good deal because they
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.360]  sold for like $180 to get one new.
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.240]  Uh, and I won the game and that's where I got my keyboard and it was the best one I've
[09:54.240 --> 09:54.960]  ever used.
[09:54.960 --> 09:58.160]  I still feel like I still take it out of the closet sometimes and type on it.
[09:58.160 --> 10:01.760]  And I still feel like, you know, this, other than that E key that's busted, it's still
[10:01.760 --> 10:02.320]  it's busted.
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.520]  It still feels better.
[10:03.520 --> 10:06.240]  I should find somebody who can just fix that E key for me.
[10:06.240 --> 10:06.960]  You should.
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.360]  And there may be a keyboard out there that, that is a closer match for what you're looking
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.640]  for than the Matthias.
[10:12.640 --> 10:13.200]  I don't know.
[10:13.200 --> 10:13.520]  Yeah.
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.160]  W it's WASD keyboards is where I got my key caps and they sell, I think they make the
[10:18.160 --> 10:22.560]  code keyboard and they sell, um, they sell mechanical keyboards and it's like literally
[10:22.560 --> 10:24.880]  choose your size and choose which switch type.
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.320]  But again, you know, you can't reach through the screen and feel how the keys, they have
[10:30.320 --> 10:31.040]  audio files.
[10:31.040 --> 10:34.480]  I think like I said, Matthias does too, but it's not quite the same because that's only
[10:34.480 --> 10:36.800]  one, the sound is part of it and the feeling is part of it.
[10:37.440 --> 10:43.040]  Um, the only, the only reason I don't, I never do like a real deep dive and try to find a
[10:43.040 --> 10:43.520]  new keyboard.
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.600]  Is it once I try it and I do have a couple and I've spent probably, I don't know, it's
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.000]  a couple hundred bucks on keyboards out of curiosity.
[10:50.560 --> 10:52.720]  And then I think to myself, why am I doing this?
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.160]  I, the Apple, my Apple extended keyboard too is the best keyboard I've ever had and it
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.600]  works perfectly on my boy.
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.480]  If it works, that's the thing.
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.320]  So I've got, I don't know why I do it.
[11:00.320 --> 11:01.280]  I don't know why.
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.160]  I don't know why I've got an extended here in my, in my office and I've got a couple
[11:06.160 --> 11:11.760]  of the USB ADB converters and I don't know whether it's that the keyboard is bad or whether
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.720]  it's the converter is bad, but I have a problem where, uh, I, or is it that I type too fast?
[11:16.720 --> 11:19.920]  Cause I, I find that it, it, it drops key.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.960]  It drops characters.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.640]  Maybe with your extraordinary typing skills.
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.240]  Maybe I've every once in a while I've, I've noticed some weird things.
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.600]  There was a thing I got panicked, uh, where there was one key like a couple of months
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.360]  ago, I think it was like T and every, it was like, and it was like an insidious typo where
[11:39.360 --> 11:40.880]  it would, I would be just be typing.
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.000]  And every time, like maybe once out of every a hundred times I typed a T I'd get like three
[11:46.000 --> 11:46.400]  T's.
[11:47.360 --> 11:48.240]  Oh yeah, I've seen that.
[11:48.240 --> 11:48.800]  That's it.
[11:48.800 --> 11:49.440]  I've seen that.
[11:49.440 --> 11:58.080]  Eh, and it's, I, it's something, you know, combined with like my slightly worse vision
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.560]  and, and it's just like a couple of T's together.
[12:00.560 --> 12:03.040]  Like in the word little, it's like an extra three T's.
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.040]  It's like, it would just slip through, you know?
[12:05.040 --> 12:05.540]  Right.
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.120]  Uh, and I got real panicked cause I thought this is definitely like, it's not me holding
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.560]  the key down too far.
[12:12.560 --> 12:14.000]  And it was always like the letter T.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.680]  So I knew it must be like electrical, but then it just went away, solved itself, fixed
[12:17.680 --> 12:18.000]  itself.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:19.440 --> 12:20.240]  That's my concern.
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.160]  And, and I've seen it is that, is that you're going to end up, um, you're going to end up
[12:24.160 --> 12:29.040]  with a, with a problem with the hardware or with the, I mean, presumably there are still
[12:29.040 --> 12:35.680]  thousands of USB ADB adapters out there that are sitting for, you know, get on eBay or
[12:35.680 --> 12:38.720]  something, but, but that's my fear is that something's going to break down either the
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.560]  keyboards or the, or the adapters or something in the system that changes and that you're
[12:44.560 --> 12:47.760]  going to, then you're going to need to find, uh, a replacement.
[12:47.760 --> 12:48.160]  It's great.
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.080]  I mean, honestly, how great is it that you're using these keyboards that are 25 years old
[12:54.080 --> 12:56.160]  and, and, and they're huge too.
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.720]  That's the other thing is I like the, I like the smaller keyboard cause I like to have
[12:58.720 --> 13:05.600]  my, um, my, uh, my like track pad as close to the, the keys as possible.
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.600]  So I don't like have a number pad or anything like that.
[13:07.600 --> 13:10.560]  So I always preferred, and I think it goes back to having an SE.
[13:10.560 --> 13:12.560]  I had the SE, which had the smaller keyboard.
[13:12.560 --> 13:14.800]  It was still clicky, but it wasn't the full extended.
[13:14.800 --> 13:19.040]  It was like a little mini one with the power, like the horizontal power button at the top.
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.000]  And I think that sort of set me down, set me down that path.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.360]  But you know, I, I don't know.
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.920]  I think you may have to go on a quest one day.
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.000]  Um, but as long as it's working for you, that's the, that's, it's kind of brilliant that you've
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.200]  got, you know, that old tech still, I'm still on the first, my first ever Griffin ADB.
[13:35.200 --> 13:39.200]  It was called the I-Mate and it's, it was, I got two of those here.
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.040]  It's, it's Bondi blue, Bondi blue, whatever that, whatever.
[13:44.080 --> 13:44.320]  Right.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.240]  Well, they, you know, they had plastic.
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.960]  Everybody was making blue plastic things in 1997.
[13:48.960 --> 13:51.360]  But it's funny because the only thing you'd ever want to, it's like,
[13:52.880 --> 13:58.160]  it's funny that they made the adapter in the trendy 2001 Apple, you know, clear plastic
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.560]  colors when the only thing you could possibly want to plug into it was going to be the classic
[14:02.560 --> 14:03.040]  beige.
[14:03.040 --> 14:04.000]  Everything was beige.
[14:05.760 --> 14:06.480]  Yeah.
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.360]  But how do you, how do you add coolness to an ADB adapter?
[14:09.360 --> 14:10.800]  The answer is clear plastic.
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.760]  Do you remember the Apple extended keyboard one, the original, it was, it was very similar
[14:15.760 --> 14:17.920]  to the extended keyboard too, but it was short-lived.
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.840]  I'm not sure why it didn't go up and down.
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.280]  It was like at a, it was, so it was a little bit bigger, I think even the extended keyboard
[14:25.280 --> 14:26.000]  too.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.360]  And it had a definite different feel to the keys.
[14:29.360 --> 14:31.440]  It was more, I would say more clacky.
[14:32.320 --> 14:34.400]  It was louder and a little bit more clacky.
[14:34.960 --> 14:38.640]  My, all my, uh, early Apple keyboard experiences were in my college newspaper.
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.920]  So that would have been like nine D 1990 era.
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.760]  And, and so it really would have been like, what keyboards did we have there?
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.080]  Cause we had a keyboard attached to a two CX and we had a bunch of keyboards on the,
[14:50.080 --> 14:51.840]  uh, the SEs that we used.
[14:51.840 --> 14:53.440]  And then later we got a two FX.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.680]  Um, and so that's, I, we had some that had the extended.
[14:57.680 --> 15:01.680]  The two FX would have come with the extended keyboard too, but I'll bet that, I'll bet
[15:01.680 --> 15:04.560]  that you're, I bet you, if you saw one, you'd be like, Oh yeah, I remember that.
[15:04.560 --> 15:06.080]  It was like just slightly different.
[15:07.120 --> 15:07.840]  Probably.
[15:07.840 --> 15:09.360]  Uh, you know what other keyboard I loved?
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.600]  I loved the, uh, the keyboard that came with the, uh, Apple two GS.
[15:14.480 --> 15:15.440]  Do you remember that keyboard?
[15:16.720 --> 15:17.440]  I never had one.
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.280]  I had a, I had a friend who had a two GS, so I vaguely remember it, but not that.
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.800]  Well, if you let's see if it was ADB, that was the GS two GS had a had ADB.
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.200]  That was the other computer that wasn't a Mac that had the ADB plug on.
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.160]  It was the two GS.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.880]  Yeah, that, that's actually a lot like that, uh, that early, uh, the se keyboard that I
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.320]  had where it's got that big, the wide power button at the very top.
[15:40.320 --> 15:40.800]  Yep.
[15:40.800 --> 15:41.280]  Yeah.
[15:41.280 --> 15:43.440]  Well, you had to restart those machines a lot.
[15:43.440 --> 15:44.320]  A lot.
[15:44.320 --> 15:44.880]  It's true.
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.240]  It's true.
[15:46.240 --> 15:46.640]  Yeah.
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.840]  It's uh, I don't know.
[15:49.840 --> 15:52.960]  It was very easy to write your own program that completely wedged the machine.
[15:54.640 --> 15:56.480]  Oh man, that was a good keyboard.
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.240]  And it had like the weirdest key caps I've ever seen where they were sort of like, uh,
[16:00.240 --> 16:02.400]  it's just, I'll just put a picture in the show notes.
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.640]  I swear to God, but if it's just the weirdest key caps where they weren't really, they were
[16:06.640 --> 16:10.960]  like squares, but then on top of the squares were like, like round racks.
[16:10.960 --> 16:11.360]  Yeah.
[16:11.360 --> 16:11.760]  Right.
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.640]  It's like two tier, uh, key caps.
[16:15.520 --> 16:16.640]  I love keyboards.
[16:16.640 --> 16:18.880]  You know what, I'll tell you what, I was thinking about this too.
[16:18.880 --> 16:23.360]  When, when you were going to be on the show, um, I wasn't thinking about keyboards, but
[16:23.360 --> 16:26.480]  I was just thinking, I know you're a baseball fan and sometimes when a baseball fan is on,
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.960]  I will try to have a conversation that will be of interest to even all of the stop.
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.160]  Don't skip, don't skip.
[16:32.160 --> 16:32.640]  Yeah.
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.680]  Even to all of you who don't like baseball, just sort of, for me, a sort of melancholy
[16:37.680 --> 16:44.240]  week with Alex Rodriguez, uh, getting dumped from the Yankees, uh, as we record on Thursday,
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.600]  he'll be playing tonight in Boston and then tomorrow night he's playing in New York.
[16:47.600 --> 16:48.560]  And then that, then that's it.
[16:48.560 --> 16:49.200]  He's going home.
[16:49.200 --> 16:49.600]  That's it.
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.440]  And combined, it just is interesting to me that, you know, he's, you know, he's, he's
[16:55.440 --> 16:57.200]  me that, you know, he's 41 years old.
[16:57.200 --> 17:04.160]  He's had a very contentious, really up and down career with, uh, his, his controversies
[17:04.160 --> 17:06.080]  over the performance enhancing drugs.
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.360]  Um, and the same week, uh, Ichiro Suzuki, uh, who's now playing for the Florida Marlins,
[17:13.360 --> 17:15.680]  got his 3000th hit in major league baseball.
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.880]  And Ichiro is to me, a guy who, if, if you could just like show, put some video clips
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.360]  together and, and talk about it, he's a player that would be of interest even to not
[17:25.360 --> 17:26.400]  in sports fans.
[17:26.400 --> 17:31.120]  Cause he's, he's, he's like, he seriously is like a, like an alien.
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.560]  He's, he's like, you know, he's, he's, he's like a creature who was just born to play
[17:36.560 --> 17:38.880]  baseball, but he doesn't play like anybody else.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.520]  Well, it's like the, um, what was it?
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.200]  Uh, the, back in the 19th century, there was a player named Wee Willie Keeler.
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.280]  And I believe he was the one who, who famously said, uh, I hit him where they ain't.
[17:51.840 --> 17:54.480]  The idea is that like, they're like, how are you such a great hitter?
[17:54.480 --> 17:57.680]  And he says, well, I hit the ball where the other, where the fielders aren't.
[17:57.680 --> 17:58.720]  And that's it.
[17:58.720 --> 18:00.080]  Like, it's so simple.
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.480]  And yet when you look at Ichiro and I think Tony Guinn was kind of like this too.
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.400]  It there in, in a century of baseball players, you get a couple of people who's
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.040]  like, somehow this guy can use that stick to put that ball.
[18:13.040 --> 18:16.880]  That's coming at him at a hundred miles an hour, wherever he wants it.
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.320]  And that's just unbelievable.
[18:18.320 --> 18:18.720]  I read it.
[18:18.720 --> 18:20.320]  I was just read a story the other day.
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.840]  It was actually in response to somehow like from one link to another in a
[18:23.840 --> 18:26.960]  Twitter conversation with somebody, you know, discussion that was started with
[18:26.960 --> 18:28.880]  Ichiro and it led to Tony Guinn.
[18:29.520 --> 18:32.960]  Um, and just talking about like the best hitters of the last 20 years, like, but
[18:32.960 --> 18:37.840]  the best hitters of, of like, you're in my adult life and there's the power guys.
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.440]  Like I think, A, number one, I think Bonds is the best hitter we've ever seen.
[18:41.440 --> 18:45.440]  And I don't, I can't, I don't really caught into any discussion otherwise.
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.600]  Um, but take the steroids out of it and he probably still is.
[18:49.600 --> 18:49.840]  Yeah.
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.200]  Well, maybe, but even with, I mean, the numbers are there and they're just
[18:53.200 --> 18:53.760]  astounding.
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.440]  I mean, the one, the, the one year he had 200 and some intentional walks.
[18:57.440 --> 19:03.280]  So in a game where you have 162 games, he, he drew over an one intentional walk
[19:03.280 --> 19:03.680]  a game.
[19:03.680 --> 19:05.520]  It's no, there's never been anything like that.
[19:05.520 --> 19:07.680]  I watched every one of those games too.
[19:07.680 --> 19:08.800]  It was a daily occurrence.
[19:08.800 --> 19:10.320]  They walked them with the bases loaded one time.
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.640]  That's true story.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.600]  True story.
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.280]  Rather than let Barry Bonds hit with the bases loaded, a team actually chose to
[19:17.280 --> 19:19.280]  walk him on purpose and give up a run.
[19:19.280 --> 19:20.640]  And they won the game because of it.
[19:20.640 --> 19:21.920]  So, you know, good call.
[19:21.920 --> 19:26.160]  So Alex Rodriguez right now, as it stands has 696 home runs, career home runs,
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.520]  fourth of all time, uh, truly a great home run hitter.
[19:29.520 --> 19:32.880]  I mean, fourth of all time in the history of the 100 and some history of the game
[19:33.760 --> 19:38.000]  bonds had more intentional walks in that one season than Alex Rodriguez has had in
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  a 20 year career, a 20 year career.
[19:43.040 --> 19:43.280]  Yep.
[19:43.840 --> 19:46.080]  It's anyway, bonds is great.
[19:46.080 --> 19:47.600]  Quinn was amazing.
[19:47.600 --> 19:48.400]  And I read this story.
[19:48.400 --> 19:49.200]  Favorite player ever.
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.920]  So he is absolutely my favorite baseball player ever.
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.960]  Tony Gwynn used to call it the 5.5 hole, meaning it was between, uh, the there's
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.760]  numbers for the player.
[19:57.760 --> 20:01.920]  So in between shortstop, who's six and the third baseman, who's five on the
[20:01.920 --> 20:05.920]  scorecard, uh, he just tried to hit the ball between the shortstop and third base
[20:05.920 --> 20:09.040]  and could do it with remarkable accuracy.
[20:09.040 --> 20:13.920]  But the thing I read was like, like when he started slowing down a little bit, his
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.280]  average dropped and for him dropping men, he got close to 300.
[20:17.280 --> 20:21.760]  Uh, and the difference was that he wasn't beating out the ones that the shortstop
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.200]  would backhand anymore.
[20:23.200 --> 20:28.560]  And he had a conversation with Ted Williams and Ted Williams, uh, told him to
[20:28.560 --> 20:29.040]  start.
[20:29.040 --> 20:29.840]  He said, you got it.
[20:29.840 --> 20:31.040]  You need to pull the ball more.
[20:31.680 --> 20:36.560]  And just that one conversation with Ted Williams and all of a sudden Gwynn purposely
[20:36.560 --> 20:38.000]  started trying to pull the ball a little more.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.600]  And that was when he, that was, uh, led to the seasons where he was hitting like
[20:41.600 --> 20:43.040]  350, 360.
[20:43.040 --> 20:43.360]  Yeah.
[20:43.360 --> 20:44.800]  I mean, it's so simple, right?
[20:44.800 --> 20:45.040]  Right.
[20:45.040 --> 20:47.360]  Like just to hit the other, to the other part of the field, they're like, all
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.400]  right, I'll do that then.
[20:48.400 --> 20:52.960]  Because like Ichiro, Gwynn could, uh, seemingly put the ball wherever he wanted
[20:52.960 --> 20:53.040]  it.
[20:53.040 --> 20:53.520]  Right.
[20:53.520 --> 20:56.000]  So there's two things about Ichiro.
[20:56.000 --> 20:57.600]  Number one, you have to watch him.
[20:57.600 --> 21:00.480]  If you don't, if you, even if you don't like baseball, just go to YouTube and
[21:00.480 --> 21:02.320]  Google Ichiro hitting.
[21:02.320 --> 21:04.560]  He starts running before he hits the ball.
[21:05.280 --> 21:06.880]  He's a left-handed batter.
[21:06.880 --> 21:10.960]  And when he sees the ball, he, his batting stance is such that he's running to
[21:10.960 --> 21:14.880]  first base as he makes contact with the ball, which nobody has ever done.
[21:14.880 --> 21:16.160]  Nobody would ever teach.
[21:16.160 --> 21:18.880]  If you, you know, saw a little kid doing it and you're coaching little league,
[21:18.880 --> 21:21.600]  you'd immediately say, no, no, no, you can't do that.
[21:21.600 --> 21:22.640]  You're never going to hit the ball.
[21:23.440 --> 21:28.240]  The other thing is that he treats his bats as though they're samurai swords.
[21:28.240 --> 21:32.880]  And this is where I'm going with the keyboard, where it's, he, he comes in and
[21:32.880 --> 21:36.560]  spends like an hour a day, like examining his bats.
[21:36.560 --> 21:40.720]  It's with like, from like with his eyes, like an inch away and rubs over every
[21:40.720 --> 21:41.520]  surface of them.
[21:41.520 --> 21:42.720]  He carries them.
[21:42.720 --> 21:47.600]  It is a collection of them that he carries in like a custom made, like a, we call
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.240]  it like a humidor.
[21:48.240 --> 21:49.280]  What do you put cigars in?
[21:49.840 --> 21:50.880]  It's like humidor.
[21:50.880 --> 21:51.200]  Yeah.
[21:51.200 --> 21:56.800]  It's, it's a moisture proof carrying case that he carries himself by hand and
[21:56.800 --> 21:59.120]  doesn't hand over to like the team equipment people.
[22:00.720 --> 22:03.840]  And, and when you know this and you realize this about him and then you watch
[22:03.840 --> 22:07.440]  him on TV, you realize that his bats are all in like mint condition.
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.960]  Like most of the bats are all gunked up with pine tar and nicked and have marks
[22:12.960 --> 22:14.880]  from where they hit balls and batting practice.
[22:14.880 --> 22:18.480]  Ichiro's bats all look like they're in mint condition.
[22:19.120 --> 22:23.760]  Yeah, they're, they're his professional tool and he treats them as such.
[22:23.760 --> 22:27.280]  And when you see him use them, you can see it's like an extension of his body.
[22:27.280 --> 22:30.320]  It's, he is, it's surgical precision with what he does with them.
[22:30.320 --> 22:33.360]  The other thing I read about Ichiro is that every year, or I think it's every
[22:33.360 --> 22:38.960]  year, but at least several times he has visited the hall of fame in a Cooper's
[22:38.960 --> 22:43.600]  town in the off season and, uh, you know, orchestrates a behind the scenes, you
[22:43.600 --> 22:46.320]  know, tour and he takes out the bats.
[22:46.320 --> 22:47.280]  He gets some of the bat.
[22:47.280 --> 22:50.160]  He has like a list of hitters whose bats he wants to examine.
[22:50.160 --> 22:54.400]  And, and he, you know, I saw pictures of it and he's got the white gloves on,
[22:54.400 --> 22:58.800]  you know, cause these are like historic artifacts and he studies the bats of
[22:58.800 --> 23:04.160]  great hitters and, and weighs them and, and like examines them in fine detail.
[23:04.160 --> 23:05.920]  It's, it's just amazing.
[23:05.920 --> 23:09.600]  And that to me, that to me is like what justifies me caring so much about my
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.000]  keyboard.
[23:10.880 --> 23:13.360]  Yeah, I think it's your, it's your professional tool, right?
[23:13.360 --> 23:16.800]  It's how you, it's how you make your living and that's the bottom line.
[23:16.800 --> 23:21.520]  And so writers do writers talk about things like, uh, like keyboards and,
[23:21.520 --> 23:24.160]  and you know, notebooks and pens and things like that.
[23:24.160 --> 23:24.800]  Yeah, they do.
[23:24.800 --> 23:29.360]  But, but you have to understand it is, it is actually a professional tool.
[23:29.360 --> 23:32.560]  It's like how, how our livelihood happens.
[23:32.560 --> 23:32.800]  Yep.
[23:33.680 --> 23:34.560]  It's worth it.
[23:34.560 --> 23:34.720]  All right.
[23:34.720 --> 23:38.320]  Let me take a break from all this great keyboard and baseball discussion.
[23:38.320 --> 23:40.960]  I was trying to keep us off of baseball by talking about keyboards.
[23:40.960 --> 23:42.000]  No, we did it both.
[23:42.960 --> 23:45.360]  And tell you about our first sponsor.
[23:45.360 --> 23:46.160]  This is a great company.
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.360]  It's Global Delight.
[23:47.360 --> 23:49.840]  Now we all use headphones and we're going to talk a little bit more later
[23:49.840 --> 23:53.120]  in the show about headphones, um, to listen to music on our iPhones and
[23:53.120 --> 23:53.760]  iPads.
[23:53.760 --> 23:57.680]  But no matter which headphones we use, the audio often feels like it lacks
[23:57.680 --> 23:58.480]  depth.
[23:58.480 --> 24:01.600]  Global Delight, they're the company behind the Mac app.
[24:01.600 --> 24:02.320]  Boom.
[24:02.320 --> 24:04.800]  That, uh, it's like an audio enhancer for Mac.
[24:04.800 --> 24:05.840]  It's a great app actually.
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.840]  And it was the, uh, actually if it rings a bell, it's, they were a sponsor
[24:09.840 --> 24:10.960]  on the show a couple of weeks ago.
[24:11.520 --> 24:14.320]  Um, so these are the same guys behind the Mac app.
[24:14.320 --> 24:14.960]  Boom.
[24:14.960 --> 24:17.200]  They have an iOS app that solves this issue.
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.440]  It's called boom for iOS.
[24:19.440 --> 24:22.800]  Now iOS, you can't have like a system wide extension that enhances audio
[24:22.800 --> 24:23.360]  across the board.
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.480]  It doesn't work like that on iOS.
[24:24.480 --> 24:27.680]  So boom on iOS is a music player app.
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.520]  And no matter which headphones you use, it turns the music you listen to
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.520]  into an amazing 3d surround sound.
[24:33.520 --> 24:38.160]  And it's, it's an amplifier, uh, uh, you know, like a sound filter music
[24:38.160 --> 24:38.720]  player.
[24:38.720 --> 24:39.680]  It doesn't stop there.
[24:39.680 --> 24:41.200]  You can change the equalizers.
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.120]  You can adjust the base and the intensity of the audio with fine control.
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.000]  You can be real picky.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.880]  This is for people who really care about what this stuff sounds like in your
[24:48.880 --> 24:49.360]  headphones.
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.160]  Uh, boom plays its magic with the downloaded music from your iTunes
[24:54.160 --> 24:54.480]  library.
[24:54.480 --> 24:57.840]  So it's not like you have to like, you know, do any kind of magic stuff or
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.000]  a pain in the butt stuff to, uh, to import your music into it.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.680]  Just plays the system stuff, the system stuff in your iTunes library.
[25:05.680 --> 25:07.440]  And it's very, very simple to use.
[25:07.440 --> 25:09.280]  Uh, here's the best part.
[25:09.280 --> 25:09.760]  It's free.
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.560]  It's a free download.
[25:10.560 --> 25:11.920]  So if you don't, you're skeptical.
[25:11.920 --> 25:13.120]  You don't know what it's going to sound like.
[25:13.120 --> 25:16.160]  Go download it, get it from the app store, try it out.
[25:16.160 --> 25:19.840]  Uh, and then it's an in-app purchase to unlock everything.
[25:19.840 --> 25:21.280]  If you, if you like the way it sounds.
[25:21.280 --> 25:22.320]  So open your browser.
[25:22.320 --> 25:28.160]  Um, if you want to see their website, it's boom for iOS.com.
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.320]  So just spell boom, then F O R I O S.com.
[25:32.880 --> 25:34.800]  And you'll be taken to the boom app directly.
[25:34.800 --> 25:36.480]  And then you can hit the download button.
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.360]  All you need to do is then just buy the in-app purchase if you like it.
[25:39.360 --> 25:40.800]  And, uh, and you'll enjoy it.
[25:40.800 --> 25:41.920]  It's a great app.
[25:41.920 --> 25:44.880]  These guys do a great job, even though their specialty is obviously audio.
[25:44.880 --> 25:47.760]  They do a phenomenal job with the user interface stuff.
[25:47.760 --> 25:49.680]  Their stuff looks exquisite.
[25:49.680 --> 25:52.400]  Always very, very, very impressive UI design.
[25:52.960 --> 25:54.800]  Um, and here's the best part.
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.440]  They've got a special offer for talk show listeners.
[25:57.440 --> 26:00.080]  They got a sale running through the 21st of August.
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.960]  Uh, I think it's normally $4.99 for the in-app purchase.
[26:04.960 --> 26:06.800]  Yes, $4.99 right now.
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.040]  You'll buy it right now before August 21st.
[26:09.040 --> 26:10.640]  You get it for a buck 99.
[26:10.640 --> 26:13.280]  So that's two bucks and you get this great app.
[26:13.280 --> 26:18.000]  So go download boom for iOS and try it out and buy it before August 21st.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.440]  And you'll save, save a couple bucks.
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.000]  Uh, we had, there is a lot of news.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.720]  I don't, we probably was probably pretty stupid to waste so much time on keyboards,
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.000]  but I, I do love them.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.600]  You do chapter markers in your podcast.
[26:33.600 --> 26:34.480]  That'll solve everything.
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.160]  I don't.
[26:36.160 --> 26:36.400]  Yeah.
[26:36.400 --> 26:42.240]  You know, I should mention this that I, you know, I, I, cause ATP does it and you guys do too.
[26:42.240 --> 26:43.360]  Do you guys do chapters?
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.320]  So here and there, not on everyone, but on some of them.
[26:46.320 --> 26:46.800]  Yeah.
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.040]  Uh, so for everybody who wants them on this show, we are looking into it.
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.400]  Where it's, it's, there's a tooling issue where it's actually, there is no good tool for this yet.
[26:56.400 --> 27:00.560]  Uh, uh, a friend of the show, Marco Arman is actually working on such a tool.
[27:00.560 --> 27:06.080]  Uh, so I'm aware of that and there will be chapters on this show, uh, eventually.
[27:06.800 --> 27:07.120]  All right.
[27:08.400 --> 27:10.560]  Uh, so the news, what do you want to talk about first?
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.960]  I guess we should talk Gurman stuff.
[27:13.920 --> 27:14.160]  Yeah.
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.480]  I mean, so Mark Gurman, right?
[27:16.480 --> 27:18.080]  He is, he's, he's back.
[27:18.080 --> 27:18.880]  He's at Bloomberg.
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.480]  We saw, he had a report like a month ago, but he's, he dropped a few reports this week that,
[27:24.480 --> 27:26.800]  that are, you know, his sources are so good.
[27:26.800 --> 27:31.760]  Um, especially in the hardware side that, that it feels like confirmation to me.
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.600]  And I know it's not, it's just an, it's another story with anonymous sources saying this is
[27:37.600 --> 27:40.400]  what Apple is going to do, but it feels like confirmation.
[27:40.400 --> 27:43.760]  Now that Gurman has said, you know, given the nod and been like, yeah, this is what's
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.240]  going to happen with the, with the iPhone and with the, with the new Mac book pro.
[27:48.240 --> 27:50.720]  It's like having a four run lead in the bottom of the ninth.
[27:50.720 --> 27:52.000]  You're probably going to win.
[27:52.000 --> 27:52.320]  Yeah.
[27:52.320 --> 27:52.560]  Yeah.
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.640]  And I mean, I feel like, and it's funny because now that he's at Bloomberg, um, you know,
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.960]  Bloomberg, I know some people who have, who have worked or do work at Bloomberg and Bloomberg
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.000]  is a very, um, they're a little idiosyncratic in what they do in terms of like their style
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.160]  guide and their, their, their, uh, copy desk and things like that, but they're sticklers.
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.920]  And you can see it in, in Gurman's reports that some of the phrasing is kind of different
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.400]  than maybe he did a nine to five Mac where they probably just, you know, made sure that
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.640]  you know, I don't, I don't want to impugn nine to five Mac, but you know, most online
[28:24.640 --> 28:27.840]  stuff, including stuff I do, you give it a read and then you put it up, you don't have
[28:27.840 --> 28:30.560]  a copy desk with who are sticklers.
[28:30.560 --> 28:36.080]  And, uh, and so it, it's sort of, uh, been interesting to see how, how they, they change
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.680]  some of his phrases or they make, make it very specific about like what he knows and
[28:39.680 --> 28:41.680]  what he doesn't know and what the details are.
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.440]  Um, and so it ends up being a little bit fuzzier.
[28:45.440 --> 28:49.840]  At nine to five Mac, I would say it was always, you know, mentioned and he never, he always
[28:49.840 --> 28:54.560]  wrote in a sort of reporter-y fashion, even at nine to five Mac, um, not as opposed to
[28:54.560 --> 28:58.560]  like a columnist style, like Joanna Stern and I were talking about that on the last
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.520]  episode of this show that I, I could do it, I guess, but it would feel, it would feel
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.280]  like, like drudgery to me.
[29:05.280 --> 29:08.800]  Like I've always wanted to be a columnist and write in my own voice.
[29:08.800 --> 29:13.440]  So Gurman always wrote in a reporter's voice, but he would just, the biggest difference
[29:13.440 --> 29:18.880]  I would say is that when he had a scoop, he would put the, according to, you know, sources
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.840]  familiar with it once in the first paragraph and then the rest of the story would be, here's
[29:23.840 --> 29:28.560]  what I've found out, whereas the bigger, the biggest stylistic difference with Bloomberg,
[29:28.560 --> 29:35.040]  with him at Bloomberg is that the, according to the people, uh, there's an awful lot.
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.840]  It just keeps coming back and back that this is according to what people have told him.
[29:39.840 --> 29:44.640]  And I personally, we, you and I were engaged in a thread on Twitter about this.
[29:44.640 --> 29:46.160]  I actually like this better.
[29:46.720 --> 29:47.840]  I, I really do.
[29:47.840 --> 29:52.720]  And maybe it's a little inside baseball, you know, like that you and I think about these,
[29:52.720 --> 29:54.560]  the copy desks and stuff like that.
[29:54.560 --> 30:00.720]  But I like it that it emphasizes that this is not a known fact and that Gurman isn't
[30:00.720 --> 30:06.080]  saying that he's seen this thing himself, which would, uh, you know, alleviate the need
[30:06.080 --> 30:07.040]  to source it.
[30:07.040 --> 30:11.040]  It's from sources who said that they know this.
[30:11.040 --> 30:13.600]  And I think that's worth emphasizing.
[30:13.600 --> 30:13.840]  Yeah.
[30:13.840 --> 30:18.320]  And, and, and them, you know, being sticklers, that's what they want to do is say, we've
[30:18.320 --> 30:20.880]  got information, but we haven't confirmed it ourselves.
[30:20.880 --> 30:22.640]  It's from a source that we trust.
[30:22.640 --> 30:25.680]  And so we're going to say it's an anonymous source.
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.160]  And then throughout the story, every time we cite something, we're, if we can't say
[30:30.160 --> 30:34.720]  it as a fact, because we saw it with our own eyes, essentially, we have to say, we have
[30:34.720 --> 30:36.640]  to attribute that to whoever got it.
[30:36.640 --> 30:40.320]  And so as a result, you, you get the, uh, things about that, you know, there won't be
[30:40.320 --> 30:44.800]  a headphone Jack, the source has said, or people, they, I think I said people, the people
[30:44.800 --> 30:45.440]  said, right.
[30:45.440 --> 30:49.600]  But that's interesting too, because it's, it, it's a way of corroborating that, that,
[30:49.600 --> 30:53.680]  that piece of information came from multiple sources.
[30:53.680 --> 30:54.160]  Exactly.
[30:54.160 --> 30:54.640]  And that's good.
[30:54.640 --> 30:55.360]  That's clarity.
[30:55.360 --> 30:55.600]  Right.
[30:55.600 --> 31:00.000]  And it may feel weird to read it that way because it's definitely being done with, with
[31:00.000 --> 31:00.880]  great care.
[31:00.880 --> 31:07.840]  But as a user of that information, it's really good to have clarity about what, you know,
[31:07.840 --> 31:14.480]  what Mark Gurman is being told by his sources and what he may be is extrapolating from that.
[31:14.480 --> 31:19.200]  And I like, I like having that because then, then we, we can leave it to our judgment,
[31:19.200 --> 31:23.120]  but it also eliminates just the confusion of like, what's he really saying here?
[31:23.120 --> 31:25.760]  Is he, does he know that or is he supposing that?
[31:25.760 --> 31:30.720]  And, and the way it's the Bloomberg process seems to have taken his stuff is it's a little
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.760]  bit clearer about the stuff that he, he has been told by his sources, like sort of laying
[31:35.760 --> 31:38.640]  it out, like this is what we know from, from sources.
[31:38.640 --> 31:45.760]  The other thing that you and I know, and I, I think it's probably true for you too.
[31:45.760 --> 31:46.640]  I definitely think so.
[31:46.640 --> 31:51.280]  I think that the whole reason that you and I have eked out, you know, these positions
[31:51.280 --> 31:55.440]  we have is that we attract, we don't attract the most readers, but we attract discerning
[31:55.440 --> 31:56.800]  readers, right?
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.200]  Like I, there's no way that the readership of your stuff and my stuff combined amounts
[32:01.200 --> 32:04.320]  to a hill of beans from the Huffington Post perspective, right?
[32:04.320 --> 32:07.200]  If we're counting page views, we're, you know, little fish.
[32:07.200 --> 32:07.360]  Yeah.
[32:07.360 --> 32:08.880]  But we attract discerning readers.
[32:08.880 --> 32:13.840]  And so a lot of times when I go off on a track like this about just how meaningful it is
[32:13.840 --> 32:19.200]  when Bloomberg or a Wall Street Journal says, you know, prints out a rumor, sometimes I
[32:19.200 --> 32:24.000]  get a lot of pushback from readers who are skeptical readers, which is good.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.280]  And I'm not surprised that I have readers who are like, Hey, you know, I don't believe
[32:27.280 --> 32:28.640]  it just because it's in the Wall Street Journal.
[32:29.280 --> 32:30.000]  And that's true.
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.680]  And I think everybody should read all the, everything they read, my stuff, your stuff,
[32:33.680 --> 32:37.440]  and especially news reports with the, you know, skeptical mind like where did this information
[32:37.440 --> 32:37.840]  come from?
[32:37.840 --> 32:42.000]  I think being a critical reader of journalism is, is an essential skill.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.720]  It should be taught, emphasized in schools, I think, in a way that it wasn't for me.
[32:48.560 --> 32:54.000]  So I'm not saying it's true, but you do, you know, inside baseball, it's like, you know
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.200]  that like a publication like Bloomberg or the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times
[32:59.200 --> 33:05.680]  knows that when something like this gets reported, what almost everybody else says is Bloomberg
[33:05.680 --> 33:11.040]  says the big iPhone is going to have two cameras and they don't go into that.
[33:11.040 --> 33:16.160]  Nobody else reports that it's Mark Gurman who says this one reporter, like if it doesn't
[33:16.160 --> 33:19.120]  turn out to be true, it's, it's mostly on Bloomberg.
[33:19.680 --> 33:25.360]  Yeah, Bloomberg is a huge company with financial information.
[33:25.360 --> 33:30.720]  I mean, reporting about one of the largest, if not the largest public company in the world,
[33:31.680 --> 33:37.920]  getting information wrong about their biggest product, that would be colossal, right?
[33:37.920 --> 33:41.680]  And so not only they want to, they want to be careful with it, but it also says something
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.360]  that, you know, when he reports this stuff, they are standing behind it.
[33:45.360 --> 33:51.200]  And, and, and as observers of what Gurman has done over the years, I, I, we can see
[33:51.200 --> 33:55.440]  why because his sources are, his sources are good. He always has been careful.
[33:55.440 --> 33:58.640]  I think he's actually a great fit for Bloomberg because of all of those things.
[33:58.640 --> 34:01.120]  He's not a super speculative guy.
[34:01.120 --> 34:04.320]  He's somebody with good sources who lays out what his sources say.
[34:04.320 --> 34:04.880]  It is funny.
[34:04.880 --> 34:05.680]  It's funny to me.
[34:05.680 --> 34:11.520]  I heard, I, I found out that he was going to Bloomberg back in March where whenever
[34:11.520 --> 34:14.640]  it was that Apple held an event in California, what was that March?
[34:15.280 --> 34:17.600]  I think it was March, like mid, mid March.
[34:17.600 --> 34:23.520]  Uh, and it wasn't, uh, it seemed like, it wasn't like an open secret, but there were
[34:23.520 --> 34:29.040]  a couple of other people in the, the, you know, cover Apple press game who knew, uh,
[34:29.040 --> 34:30.720]  that he was going to go to Bloomberg.
[34:31.360 --> 34:34.720]  Uh, and it was funny to me that it never, it never actually was published.
[34:34.720 --> 34:40.480]  Like the guy who's the guy who's, who's known for spoiling Apple's secrets, his own
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.000]  secret, everybody was just like, it just seemed like uncouth because it, it seemed
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.720]  like everybody seemed to not want to publish it or tweet it or anything just because it
[34:48.720 --> 34:51.200]  just seemed like, well, let's, you know, let's not bother the kid.
[34:51.760 --> 34:52.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[34:52.480 --> 34:55.760]  I mean, I think kind of happy for him too, because he does good work.
[34:55.760 --> 34:57.120]  He, he's, he's really young.
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.160]  He was in college, you know, he, he, he has done some incredible things and, um, and
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.720]  now he's got a really high profile job at a major, uh, source of news and business
[35:06.720 --> 35:07.200]  information.
[35:07.200 --> 35:09.280]  So it's like, yeah, we kind of didn't want to wreck it for him.
[35:09.280 --> 35:11.120]  He's, he's, he does good work.
[35:11.120 --> 35:15.120]  It's a, I think it's a really good fit because Bloomberg in particular, in my opinion,
[35:15.120 --> 35:17.760]  really emphasizes scoops.
[35:17.760 --> 35:26.400]  They really pride themselves on, on breaking things like this, um, being first while
[35:26.400 --> 35:29.840]  simultaneously being completely accurate, right?
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.720]  As opposed to, you know, they won't cross that line of being first by taking a chance
[35:34.720 --> 35:37.840]  that it's not true, but they really want to be first.
[35:37.840 --> 35:42.240]  And it's a feather in their cap as a, as a provider of, of business intelligence.
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.720]  Cause I mean, the number one way Bloomberg makes money, as far as I can tell, um, and
[35:46.720 --> 35:48.320]  what I've heard is it's like the terminal.
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.520]  They, they have these terminals, they're in the offices of people in the financial
[35:53.520 --> 35:54.240]  sector.
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.160]  They are giving real time business information and news.
[35:58.160 --> 36:02.400]  And from when you view Bloomberg through that lens where they're not like a wire, a
[36:02.400 --> 36:06.320]  wire service or something, they are a financial information provider.
[36:06.320 --> 36:08.640]  And news is one of the things that they do.
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.640]  When you think of them that way, um, it sort of, it sort of makes sense.
[36:12.640 --> 36:12.800]  Yeah.
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.040]  And that's where the culture, that's exactly where the culture of being first and having
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.000]  the scoop comes from is the culture from the terminals.
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.440]  Cause you want to get ahead as an investor.
[36:21.440 --> 36:22.640]  You want that extra edge.
[36:22.640 --> 36:23.120]  Right.
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.080]  Um, I re I worked at, um, a firm on the Philadelphia stock exchange when I was in college.
[36:28.080 --> 36:30.880]  I had an internship doing like it stuff.
[36:30.880 --> 36:32.080]  I wasn't doing investing stuff.
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.520]  I was, you know, on the computer team.
[36:33.520 --> 36:37.920]  Um, but they had the, you know, the traders had the Bloomberg boxes of course.
[36:37.920 --> 36:43.280]  So I got to see them interesting, fascinating devices for the mid mid nineties.
[36:43.280 --> 36:43.520]  Yeah.
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.800]  And well, the funny thing, and there's a, um, and they were fast.
[36:46.800 --> 36:50.640]  That's the one thing is that, well, that's, that's the whole, that's the whole story.
[36:50.640 --> 36:51.440]  There's a story somewhere.
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.760]  I'm trying to find it that, um, the, the problem with the Bloomberg terminal is, so it is,
[36:55.760 --> 36:56.720]  they call it the terminal.
[36:56.720 --> 36:58.960]  It looks like a DOS interface.
[36:58.960 --> 37:00.560]  It's got these weird keyboard shortcuts.
[37:00.560 --> 37:02.320]  It's like something like word star or something.
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.200]  It's that kind of thing.
[37:03.200 --> 37:03.360]  Right.
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.040]  It's a strange, strange thing.
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.880]  But, um, the thing is the people who know how to use the Bloomberg terminal, they can
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.000]  do everything fast with a couple of keystrokes.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.120]  It's this incredible thing.
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.520]  So it's a huge UX problem because it's impenetrable on one level, but once you know it, you can
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.360]  have complete control over it and they're loath to change it because they're, they're,
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.240]  uh, uh, they're loyal, loyal customers want, want to know how to use it.
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.520]  So it's the, they end up in this weird place where just like, can we improve this product
[37:33.520 --> 37:36.320]  or do we need to leave it looking like a DOS terminal forever?
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.240]  Well, and there's never a day for it for the traders.
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.880]  There's never like a slow day, you know?
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.960]  So there's never a day where, well, all right, we'll, you know, we'll install this new version
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.640]  that I don't know how to use and I'll be lost all day, you know, trying to figure out it.
[37:52.640 --> 37:54.800]  No, they can't, can't ever do it.
[37:54.800 --> 37:55.040]  Right.
[37:55.040 --> 37:59.520]  So it's better, better to just let your, your interns and your new hires read the manual
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.040]  and learn how to do it and get up to speed and just leave it the way it is.
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.080]  Um, and it's, yeah, it's fascinating.
[38:06.080 --> 38:07.760]  They, and they, that's the whole thing.
[38:07.760 --> 38:10.640]  They're, they're not afraid knowing people who've worked at Bloomberg.
[38:10.640 --> 38:14.640]  They are not afraid to be, um, different from the crowd.
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.800]  Like they have different terminology for stuff.
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.120]  They don't call the laptops that their journalists get aren't called laptops.
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.560]  No, they're called like travel units or travelers or something.
[38:24.560 --> 38:26.480]  Like it's just, they've got their own terminology.
[38:26.480 --> 38:27.440]  They've got their own rules.
[38:27.440 --> 38:28.400]  It goes down.
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.280]  It's just, it's, uh, they are, they are different.
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.120]  And I think that maybe comes from Mike Bloomberg that, you know, he was, you know, he's a maverick.
[38:35.680 --> 38:38.480]  He's not afraid to, to say, let's do things kind of differently.
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.000]  And it also comes from the fact that they are a, not a traditional, uh, you know, ad funded
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.040]  journalism outfit.
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.120]  They're this, they're a financial services outfit.
[38:47.120 --> 38:47.360]  Yeah.
[38:48.080 --> 38:56.720]  Um, so, uh, Germin's two articles, recent articles, uh, first was the one about the new iPhones.
[38:56.720 --> 39:07.440]  Um, so it's seemingly confirmed that, uh, definitely said that the, the plus size one
[39:07.440 --> 39:16.640]  will have the two, the two camera system and seem to confirm that the 4.71 won't, but doesn't
[39:16.640 --> 39:18.240]  quite say that.
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.760]  And this is one of those things where the, the sourcing is kind of interesting.
[39:21.760 --> 39:22.960]  Here's the, I'm going to read the paragraph.
[39:22.960 --> 39:26.560]  The dual dual system sharpens photos taken in low light environments.
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.520]  The person said the combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows
[39:31.520 --> 39:33.600]  users to zoom while retaining more clarity.
[39:33.600 --> 39:40.080]  The person added the smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses.
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.840]  KGI securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo said earlier this year.
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.880]  Now that that last bit is fascinating to me because seemingly German's own sources didn't
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.920]  didn't or couldn't say whether the smaller phone has the two cameras.
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.600]  He's only referring to a report from Ming Chi Kuo.
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.320]  It may be, or may not because later they talk about the headphone jack, uh, being removed
[40:02.320 --> 40:08.080]  and they, they reference, um, Mako Takara as being the original report.
[40:08.080 --> 40:15.600]  So I'm not, I couldn't read this and say whether they're, uh, you know, whether he doesn't
[40:15.600 --> 40:16.720]  actually know that for sure.
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.800]  Cause it sounds like he actually just said that it's not, I think it's more likely that
[40:20.800 --> 40:26.720]  he may be doing in a Bloombergian kind of way, the hat tip of, of who originally reported
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.080]  this because he didn't originally.
[40:28.080 --> 40:28.400]  Yeah.
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.240]  I think that's, I think, no, the Mako Takara, but,
[40:32.240 --> 40:34.480]  Oh, well for Mako Takara it's for sure that way.
[40:34.480 --> 40:39.840]  But I wonder if maybe the, the Ming Chi Kuo attribution is, is that, which is just look,
[40:39.840 --> 40:42.000]  you know, this person got it first.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.920]  We should tip our cap to them.
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.160]  Uh, confirms no headphones.
[40:46.160 --> 40:49.440]  And the other, you know, none of this is new.
[40:49.440 --> 40:52.880]  There's not one bit of it that is new, but it's confirmation of a whole bunch of these
[40:52.880 --> 40:53.840]  rumors that are floating about.
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.320]  The other thing is that the home button now won't physically click.
[40:58.320 --> 41:06.400]  It will, uh, be tapped like the, like the track pads, like, you know, the modern Mac
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.440]  MacBook track pads.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.600]  Um, which is interesting.
[41:11.600 --> 41:16.880]  And I think, I wonder, you know, there's often a lot of German story doesn't mention waterproofing
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.880]  at all, but one of the things that has been floated about is that whether Apple will bill
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.880]  it as waterproof or not, that the, one of the design, the features of these new iPhones
[41:24.880 --> 41:28.720]  would set, they will be even further water resistant than previous ones.
[41:28.720 --> 41:28.960]  Right.
[41:29.600 --> 41:37.120]  Um, and I can only imagine that a force touch home button would help in some way in terms
[41:37.120 --> 41:41.840]  of waterproofing simply because it seems like every button that actually moves is a, is
[41:41.840 --> 41:43.760]  a place where moisture could get through.
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.160]  Yeah. And it's also going to reduce, um, repair incidences because, you know, even if it's
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.720]  not that common, um, home buttons malfunction, because I mean, it's a moving part, it has
[41:52.720 --> 41:53.440]  to go up and down.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.200]  And so you take that out of the equation and it's not actually moving anymore.
[41:57.200 --> 42:00.080]  You just feel like it's moving when you, when you press on it.
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.640]  Um, I can see, assuming they do it right, although, you know, the 3d touch and the force
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.680]  touch and the track pad is, uh, they did a good job with that.
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.840]  So assuming they do it right, so that you really do get that, that, uh, that sense of,
[42:11.840 --> 42:14.400]  of action, cause it would be the worst thing in the world if you're like, why is my phone
[42:14.400 --> 42:14.800]  locked up?
[42:14.800 --> 42:16.640]  And you try to press the home button and nothing happens.
[42:16.640 --> 42:18.080]  You're like, yeah, what do I do now?
[42:18.080 --> 42:19.200]  So they got to get it right.
[42:19.200 --> 42:24.400]  But there are a lot of benefits to, um, you know, simplifying the shape of the product.
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.400]  Basically, it's one of those things that might be like keyboards where it, some people might
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.600]  really like it and others might not cause it's, will feel different.
[42:31.600 --> 42:33.440]  And I love the new track pads.
[42:33.440 --> 42:35.760]  I think you, I don't know, maybe you do too.
[42:35.760 --> 42:36.880]  I have a, yeah, I do.
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.640]  I have a review unit of Mac book pro that Apple gave me to test, um, what's the new
[42:42.640 --> 42:43.040]  operator?
[42:43.040 --> 42:43.520]  Sierra.
[42:43.520 --> 42:44.880]  Yeah, I've got one right behind me.
[42:44.880 --> 42:45.200]  Right.
[42:45.200 --> 42:47.920]  And so my personal Mac book pro has, is older.
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.680]  It's, it's, you know, I forget, I think it might be two years old at this point or close
[42:51.680 --> 42:52.640]  to two years old.
[42:52.640 --> 42:53.520]  Doesn't have it.
[42:53.520 --> 42:54.000]  I love it.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.280]  It's a 13 inch Mac book pro.
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.240]  It's probably now my favorite Mac book that I've ever owned.
[42:58.240 --> 43:01.840]  I really, the more I use it, I really appreciate how good it is.
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.480]  Um, the one thing I really like better about the review unit one is that track pad.
[43:06.480 --> 43:08.400]  I really liked the force touch track bed.
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.480]  And I think the main reason why is that I tend to click a lot at the top of the track
[43:12.480 --> 43:20.320]  pad and the mechanic that the lever that is the moving track pad, it, the fulcrum is at
[43:20.320 --> 43:20.720]  the top.
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.160]  So it's actually a lot easier to click towards the bottom than it is at the top.
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.640]  And I love that on the force touch one, it's just as clicky everywhere on the whole thing.
[43:30.640 --> 43:31.840]  I know other people don't like it though.
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.200]  I think Marco Arman does not like the force touch track pad, so maybe the home buttons
[43:35.200 --> 43:36.160]  will be the same way.
[43:36.160 --> 43:38.320]  Yeah, it could be the, yeah, Marco doesn't like it.
[43:38.320 --> 43:38.880]  I do like it.
[43:38.880 --> 43:45.600]  I actually use the, the desktop magic track to, and I, and I really like it.
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.640]  Um, Amazon did this with the, um, Kindle, which one was it voyage?
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.880]  I think they put like, uh, it's now with page turn buttons, which they had taken off
[43:54.880 --> 43:56.800]  of an earlier model, but it wasn't really a button.
[43:56.800 --> 44:00.720]  It was this haptic thing where you squeezed this thing on the side and it gave a little
[44:00.720 --> 44:04.320]  vibration and it didn't, it didn't work there.
[44:04.320 --> 44:08.160]  Although that was kind of cheaply done and I expect Apple to do a better job than that.
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.640]  Um, but they ended up with their, the Oasis that they have now, it's just back to being
[44:12.640 --> 44:15.440]  a physical button because that was just a better experience.
[44:15.440 --> 44:21.920]  Um, so it can be done badly, but, um, I would imagine given the force touch track pad that,
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.160]  and I think that's why the reference is being made to it is that whoever described this
[44:26.160 --> 44:28.560]  to Mark Gurman is like, no, no, it's going to be like the forest touch track pad.
[44:28.560 --> 44:32.000]  You're not going to even be able to believe that it doesn't move, which that's, that sounds
[44:32.000 --> 44:32.560]  good to me.
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.840]  Yeah, it's funny to me because I thought one of my complaints for years with iPhones was
[44:37.840 --> 44:42.320]  that the home buttons were not good enough and maybe I just got bad phones.
[44:42.320 --> 44:42.640]  I don't know.
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.440]  But like in the three G three GS and maybe even like the iPhone four era, like there
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.400]  was like a certain squishiness to it that I didn't like year after year.
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.160]  And I think I even wrote about it on tearing fireball that on a device where there's really
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.320]  just one main button, that button should feel really good.
[45:00.320 --> 45:03.920]  Yeah, if you're going to minimize buttons, the buttons that you have left have to be
[45:03.920 --> 45:06.000]  really good because they're really going to stand out.
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.120]  And it's the sort of thing that Apple should pride itself on doing well.
[45:09.120 --> 45:16.320]  And I think that they've now they've gotten a great, like the clickiness of, um, the,
[45:16.320 --> 45:19.760]  the touch ID era home buttons to me is terrific.
[45:19.760 --> 45:22.720]  To me, it feels like one of the best buttons in the world.
[45:23.600 --> 45:24.480]  Yeah, it's good.
[45:24.480 --> 45:30.000]  Um, there, there are, I mean, there are lots of speculations about how Apple, I mean, cause
[45:30.000 --> 45:30.720]  it's Apple, right?
[45:30.720 --> 45:35.280]  Apple wants to eventually have no buttons and no ports because that's sort of the platonic
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.600]  ideal of a device and as thin as possible, um, that they would get rid of the home button
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.280]  entirely at some point, or at least the physical home button, even if there's a way to do the,
[45:43.280 --> 45:44.240]  do a gesture.
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.080]  And this seems like a, a step in that direction, which is okay, now we've got it so that we
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.080]  can read your fingerprint and you can press on it in order to get what, where you want
[45:52.080 --> 45:54.560]  to go, but there's actually nothing moving.
[45:54.560 --> 45:55.840]  And that's like step one.
[45:55.840 --> 46:01.600]  And maybe step two is that they put, you know, they put that on, uh, uh, you know, the bottom
[46:01.600 --> 46:03.520]  center of the screen or something.
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.000]  And it's, it's seeking that out, whatever a future iPhone design might be.
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.440]  I don't know, but that, it does seem like it's, it's, it's a very Apple step to make
[46:11.440 --> 46:13.440]  to eliminate a moving part.
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.240]  Um, and so I, what are we left with the focus on here?
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.440]  The fact that the 4.7 inch phone apparently won't have dual cameras and it's, you know,
[46:23.440 --> 46:28.000]  the rumor chain has, has been pretty consistent on that regard, especially if you believe
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.040]  the supply chain links of the backs of these phones, there's never been one, a credible
[46:33.040 --> 46:38.480]  one that showed two cameras, the two camera oval on the four and 4.7 inch iPhone.
[46:38.480 --> 46:41.600]  And there's usually one on the 5.5 inch.
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.400]  Um, I'm a little bummed about that because I prefer the 4.7 by far in terms of hand feel.
[46:48.400 --> 46:53.680]  And in fact, as you know, anybody read my, my iPhone SE review, if anything, I have mixed
[46:53.680 --> 46:59.120]  feelings about the 4.7 inch versus the, the iPhone SE size four inch phone.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.880]  Yeah, I, I've been thinking about this and I think it's probably not true.
[47:02.880 --> 47:07.920]  I think the 4.7 is probably the mainstream phone and will remain so, but I did have that
[47:07.920 --> 47:13.040]  moment where I thought with the iPhone SE doing, I think way better, Apple even admitted
[47:13.040 --> 47:14.320]  way better than Apple expected.
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.320]  And now we're talking about differentiating the iPhone plus at the high end with a much
[47:20.320 --> 47:23.680]  better camera, which in some ways is taking advantage of the fact that it's just got
[47:23.680 --> 47:24.240]  more room.
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.320]  Um, and it's, and it's more expensive so they can pack stuff in there.
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.440]  Um, I do have those moments where I think, why would you get the 4.7 inch iPhone?
[47:33.440 --> 47:36.080]  Like if you really care about photography, get the big iPhone.
[47:36.080 --> 47:39.360]  If you're somebody who uses your phone all the time and wants the biggest screen possible,
[47:39.360 --> 47:40.560]  get the big iPhone.
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.400]  And if you, if you care about size and that's your, your priority, or if you care about
[47:44.400 --> 47:46.880]  price, the iPhone SE is right there.
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.440]  Um, and it's just, again, it's probably not realistic, but I, I feel like it's interesting
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.840]  that Apple is making the edge phones kind of really appealing in almost like the, the
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.360]  simplicity of the one and the power and complexity of the other.
[48:01.360 --> 48:03.280]  And then what's the 4.7 inch iPhone?
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.480]  Well, it's just your average iPhone, I guess in the middle.
[48:06.480 --> 48:14.400]  Um, there are other rumors that there will be three iPhones, new iPhones.
[48:14.400 --> 48:16.720]  Have you seen, have you seen this?
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.640]  That will be the pro and the plus.
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.120]  Yeah.
[48:19.120 --> 48:21.280]  So it would be like, I forget.
[48:21.280 --> 48:24.000]  I don't think they're going to call it iPhone seven, but maybe they will.
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.360]  But let's just say that they do.
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.880]  Cause otherwise, and let's note Mark Gurman story at no point calls it the iPhone seven,
[48:30.880 --> 48:31.200]  right?
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.040]  At no point, uh, hold that thought.
[48:35.040 --> 48:39.040]  Cause there's, that's key to understanding this, his sources or one of the keys.
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.440]  So let's just say they call it the seven that this other rumor would say there'd be the
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.040]  iPhone seven, 4.7 inches, the iPhone seven plus, which would be 5.5 inches and still
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.880]  have the same camera, probably with like the image stabilization, but the single camera
[48:56.880 --> 48:57.680]  circle on the back.
[48:57.680 --> 49:05.440]  And then the iPhone seven pro, which would have the dual camera system and presumably
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.520]  like maybe like 256 gigs of, of storage.
[49:10.160 --> 49:17.040]  Um, I, I, and part of that rumor is based on like supply chain links that show some
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.640]  of these plates that look, they're the bigger size, but they only have one hole for the
[49:20.640 --> 49:22.720]  camera and who knows if they're fake.
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.280]  I don't know.
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.560]  Some of those, it's like the, when those pictures come out, they go so super viral that
[49:28.560 --> 49:31.520]  there's, you know, some of them have been fake over the years.
[49:31.520 --> 49:35.360]  I don't know what the motivation is for people making these fake ones, but it's crazy.
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.440]  That, this does, that doesn't make any product marketing sense to me.
[49:40.240 --> 49:40.800]  Yeah, I agree.
[49:41.600 --> 49:43.760]  And, and we've just defined, right?
[49:43.760 --> 49:46.400]  We, we got a, what's an iPad pro, right?
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.120]  I feel like they could do an iPhone pro, but to have a pro and a plus and the regular iPhone
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.600]  and the se see and have the pro and the plus be essentially the same, except one of them
[49:55.600 --> 49:58.000]  has this like one esoteric difference.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.800]  It seems too complicated.
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.760]  And, um, which is not to say that I'm not intrigued by the idea of like an iPhone pro
[50:05.760 --> 50:08.640]  that is the two cameras and maybe support for the pencil.
[50:09.200 --> 50:11.280]  Um, that that's interesting.
[50:11.280 --> 50:15.280]  That's an interesting idea of, of, of branding that product that way, but to have that, and
[50:15.280 --> 50:19.520]  then I, it feels more likely to me that it's just, you know, what we're seeing is the,
[50:19.520 --> 50:26.320]  is, is the success plus just again, maybe, maybe slightly altered, but just the success
[50:26.320 --> 50:26.800]  plus.
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.400]  And, and that's a question is like, what do they keep traditionally Apple has kept the
[50:30.400 --> 50:32.720]  previous year's phones in the lineup.
[50:32.720 --> 50:35.520]  Um, so, you know, what happens there too?
[50:35.520 --> 50:36.320]  I don't, I don't know.
[50:36.320 --> 50:39.280]  It seems unlikely though, that they would have two identical phones except for like
[50:39.280 --> 50:40.320]  the cameras on the back.
[50:40.320 --> 50:40.960]  Yeah.
[50:40.960 --> 50:48.080]  And it just, uh, it, it makes it harder like with by calling them the iPhone six and the
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.960]  iPhone six plus, and then the success and the success plus, they can just say, they
[50:52.960 --> 50:58.800]  can say shot with iPhone six and all of the new phones are carried with that.
[50:58.800 --> 51:02.880]  Whether you have the plus or not, the plus is just refers to the size, even though the
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.360]  camera was technically slightly better because it had the optical image stabilization.
[51:07.360 --> 51:11.280]  They didn't need to say that they could just say they could run ads and billboards that
[51:11.280 --> 51:16.320]  just say iPhone six or iPhone success and it covers both.
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.560]  Whereas if they do this, they, it doesn't, they'd have to run on separate campaigns.
[51:20.560 --> 51:25.040]  And then that would, it would peg the ones that are going to sell in greater quantities.
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.720]  The lower price ones that the, the regular and the plus, it would peg them as being on
[51:30.720 --> 51:35.840]  the, on the lower tier from day one, which is, it just, I don't know.
[51:35.840 --> 51:37.280]  Something about that doesn't sit right with me.
[51:38.000 --> 51:38.880]  I guess it's possible.
[51:38.880 --> 51:40.880]  Like I wouldn't be shocked if that's how it turns out.
[51:40.880 --> 51:45.360]  But Gurman's story makes it seem like there's just two, 4.7, 5.5 and the 5.5 has a better
[51:45.360 --> 51:46.480]  camera.
[51:46.480 --> 51:50.080]  It has these double, you know, dual lens system, which is a cool idea.
[51:50.080 --> 51:56.400]  I mean, I think, I think the place where smartphones could still get better, right?
[51:56.400 --> 51:58.400]  Back in the old days, it's like, they could get better everywhere.
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.080]  It's like everything could be better, but now the place like number one place where
[52:02.080 --> 52:06.400]  I think a smartphone could get better in terms of priority has to be the cameras.
[52:06.400 --> 52:09.920]  The cameras could get so much better because we, we know what good cameras look like.
[52:09.920 --> 52:14.000]  And although the cameras on smartphones are amazing compared to what they used to be,
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.240]  they could still be so much better.
[52:16.240 --> 52:21.120]  So I like the idea that Apple is going down that path and saying, what if we put two lenses
[52:21.120 --> 52:25.600]  on and use software and put them together and they should be doing that.
[52:25.600 --> 52:27.840]  That's absolutely the right thing for them to do.
[52:27.840 --> 52:28.080]  Yeah.
[52:28.080 --> 52:34.000]  And I don't even think Gurman's description of it is, his description is about, it's
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.800]  first mentioned sharpening photos taken in low light environments.
[52:36.800 --> 52:37.840]  I mean, that could help with that.
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.560]  But the biggest difference of the two lens system isn't really light sensitivity.
[52:42.560 --> 52:46.720]  That's a problem that's really hard to solve just because of the physics of optics
[52:46.720 --> 52:52.400]  with the, the size of these devices and how small the sensors are compared to like a full
[52:52.400 --> 52:56.480]  size or even, even like the four thirds system cameras or something, you know, the ones with
[52:56.480 --> 53:02.880]  small sensors like APS-C, like in a camera camera, those small sensors are so much bigger
[53:02.880 --> 53:04.880]  than the sensors that you can fit in a phone.
[53:04.880 --> 53:08.560]  Like it's, it's absolutely remarkable how good the photos you can get off these devices
[53:08.560 --> 53:12.240]  are with how tiny the sensors are, but that's really a limiting factor for light
[53:12.240 --> 53:12.960]  sensitivity.
[53:12.960 --> 53:18.000]  The two lens system is really about having two lenses of different focal distances.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.360]  So you've got the one that's wide angle, like the one we already, we've always had
[53:21.360 --> 53:22.080]  on our phone.
[53:22.080 --> 53:26.960]  And then to have a second one that has a, a longer focal length, like, you know, I don't
[53:26.960 --> 53:31.200]  know what it would be the equivalent in 35 millimeter terms, but you know, a 50 or an
[53:31.200 --> 53:32.240]  85 or something.
[53:33.440 --> 53:39.520]  So that when you zoom, it can actually do it optically instead of like, if you're trying
[53:39.520 --> 53:44.080]  to shoot something far away and get it closer and, you know, fill up more of the frame,
[53:44.080 --> 53:49.040]  the optics of that are way better if you actually have, if you're doing it with a real longer
[53:49.040 --> 53:54.000]  lens instead of with, you know, just cropping the wide, the wide lens picture.
[53:55.280 --> 53:59.200]  And there's going to be, ought to be ways, there might be ways to do 3D stuff, you know,
[53:59.200 --> 54:02.800]  slightly 3D stuff, you know, for the live pictures and stuff like that.
[54:02.800 --> 54:05.120]  It could be all sorts of really cool optical stuff with this.
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.840]  So I better get bigger, bigger pockets.
[54:09.840 --> 54:13.520]  Yeah, I know that's, that's my thought too is I, I've always rejected that phone because
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.880]  it's so large, but I would be, if anything would tempt me to get a larger phone, it would
[54:18.880 --> 54:19.760]  be something like that.
[54:19.760 --> 54:25.520]  Like a much better camera would tempt me to, to just swallow my pride and expand my pockets
[54:25.520 --> 54:27.440]  and get the, get the big phone.
[54:27.440 --> 54:27.840]  Yeah.
[54:27.840 --> 54:32.480]  The second factor for me in a little bit, like the hand, the size and the pockets in
[54:32.480 --> 54:33.600]  the hand, I'm never going to like.
[54:33.600 --> 54:39.920]  But the second factor for me personally is that I'm like my, I'm rushing towards needing
[54:39.920 --> 54:42.080]  reading glasses when I wear my contact lenses.
[54:42.080 --> 54:45.040]  Like I've mentioned this on the show before, but long story short, when I wear my contacts,
[54:45.600 --> 54:49.040]  I, I need reading glasses to read in low light environments.
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.400]  Now I can't focus at reading length when I have my contacts in.
[54:52.400 --> 54:56.720]  When I'm wearing my glasses, I can because the, and I talked to my eye doctor about this
[54:56.720 --> 55:01.600]  because when you wear glasses, they're further from the, the lens of my eye.
[55:01.600 --> 55:03.760]  Whereas contacts, literally they're right there.
[55:03.760 --> 55:05.760]  And so it's at a distance.
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.960]  I see exactly the same, you know, clarity with glasses on and contacts, but at a close
[55:10.960 --> 55:15.760]  distance, when you start getting presbyopia in your forties, it really, it makes a big
[55:15.760 --> 55:17.360]  difference whether you have contacts on or not.
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.280]  So, but really when I have my glasses on, what I like to do when I read is take them
[55:21.280 --> 55:22.720]  off and I'm, cause I'm nearsighted.
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.120]  I can, without any correction at all, I can read.
[55:25.120 --> 55:26.240]  That's when I read the best.
[55:26.240 --> 55:31.200]  I actually read tons and tons on my phone lately in the morning before I put my contacts
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.000]  in just with, just because it's actually the, the way I see clearest is with no correction
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.320]  at all with my phone right in front of my face.
[55:39.840 --> 55:41.360]  But I wear contacts most of the time.
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.400]  But having the bigger phone and being able to make the text bigger would actually, would
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.560]  actually be optically good for me.
[55:49.120 --> 55:49.360]  Yeah.
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.680]  My, my wife has a 6s and uses it in the mode where it's blown up to essentially it's
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.000]  pretending to be a five because she's, cause she's got for the first time cause she's
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.520]  always had perfect vision, but she's in her forties now and now she needs reading glasses.
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.320]  And so she's just, that's been one of her concessions to be able to use her phone without
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.480]  having to switch to reading glasses is, is using that extra screen space just to make
[56:12.480 --> 56:13.360]  everything bigger.
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.640]  What I've been doing, I haven't given into that zoom mode, but I do go into the text
[56:20.640 --> 56:21.360]  size.
[56:21.360 --> 56:22.080]  Oh yeah.
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.120]  And it is, it just made, it makes me feel good about the fact that I've been promoting
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.800]  accessibility features long before I needed them, but now I really do.
[56:30.800 --> 56:36.800]  I mean, and, and my vision problems, I always want to say this, if anything, it makes me
[56:36.800 --> 56:42.080]  appreciate how good my vision still is, you know, cause it's like having a scare with,
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.160]  you know, losing the, all the vision in my eye when I had the retina detachment, it really
[56:46.160 --> 56:49.600]  makes me appreciate just how bad some people's vision really is.
[56:49.600 --> 56:53.120]  People who are, you know, on some scale legally blind.
[56:53.920 --> 56:56.240]  But you know, there's some people who are legally blind can still see.
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.600]  Uh, something, but the, the accessibility features in iOS, it's like, it's so great.
[57:01.600 --> 57:04.800]  It makes me, and now I'm actually somebody who benefits from them.
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.720]  Well, that's how my wife uses her Apple watch.
[57:06.720 --> 57:10.800]  Cause you know, you can't really do the large screen mode on the Apple watch and she has
[57:10.800 --> 57:14.800]  used the accessibility feature to increase the, the, the text size and it makes her Apple
[57:14.800 --> 57:15.360]  watch usable.
[57:15.360 --> 57:18.960]  Otherwise it's like, it's great that I have this watch on, but if I have to put my glasses
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.080]  on every time I need to read anything on the screen, it's pointless.
[57:22.080 --> 57:24.480]  So she uses the type size control.
[57:24.480 --> 57:25.280]  I do too.
[57:25.280 --> 57:27.440]  It is a great, great, great feature.
[57:27.440 --> 57:30.880]  Um, so I don't know.
[57:30.880 --> 57:32.160]  I guess I'm going to have a big phone.
[57:32.160 --> 57:32.560]  I don't know.
[57:33.680 --> 57:34.160]  I don't know.
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.440]  I mean, we'll have to see how, what exactly the devil's in the details.
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.880]  And this comes back to what you were saying about, um, where Mark Gurman's sources are
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.000]  is, is a lot of times with these Apple products, I always say this.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.600]  I mean, it's just, it's so true.
[57:45.600 --> 57:50.480]  You got to know where the rumors are coming from and what, and the, what we know is what
[57:50.480 --> 57:53.600]  is a, we know the product, but we don't know the story.
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.120]  And it's the marketing and in some ways it's the software.
[57:57.120 --> 58:00.640]  Like we know that there are two cameras and we can speculate on what those cameras do.
[58:00.640 --> 58:05.280]  But Apple will probably have a very particular story about how those cameras work together.
[58:05.280 --> 58:08.400]  When one camera gets used, when the other gets used, do they get merged together?
[58:08.400 --> 58:09.120]  How does that work?
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.280]  Is there UI to flip between them or change the focus or things like that?
[58:13.280 --> 58:15.200]  And that we, we really don't know.
[58:15.200 --> 58:15.440]  Yeah.
[58:15.440 --> 58:17.680]  Like what's the scenario where this is going to be better?
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.080]  Like I said, a scenario I can think of that, and I'm sure, you know, you run into the
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.080]  same thing too, is parent in the auditorium and the kids on stage.
[58:26.080 --> 58:31.360]  That's where the phone, the phones is a terrible camera for that situation because you really
[58:31.360 --> 58:36.800]  want a picture of your kid, but it's, there's no way that optical zoom in a dimly lit auditor,
[58:36.800 --> 58:39.520]  not optical zoom, uh, digital digital zoom.
[58:39.520 --> 58:44.000]  Yeah, it's the worst of a wide angle, a wide angle lens with a tiny little sensor.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.600]  It's you might as well not even do it.
[58:45.600 --> 58:51.680]  I always wonder when I see these parents holding their phones up for the entire thing, I really
[58:51.680 --> 58:55.120]  want to play that Louis C.K. rant of, of, Hey, just be here.
[58:55.120 --> 58:55.680]  You know what I mean?
[58:55.680 --> 59:01.120]  Just be here from, cause it's not just that you'd be better off just being there and watching
[59:01.120 --> 59:06.720]  it, uh, that the actual image you're getting from that camera, from a cell phone halfway
[59:06.720 --> 59:08.800]  back in an auditorium is going to be useless.
[59:08.800 --> 59:13.760]  You're not going to make out your kid's face, but a longer lens might, it might actually
[59:13.760 --> 59:14.240]  save that.
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.760]  Yeah, I was, we were coming back from a long weekend and we were driving, we were in Southern
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.200]  Oregon and so we were driving back, driving South and you go past on interstate five,
[59:23.200 --> 59:27.040]  you go past Mount Shasta, which is huge volcano.
[59:27.040 --> 59:33.200]  Um, there's a, uh, it's, it's like two miles above the rest of the landscape around it.
[59:33.200 --> 59:37.280]  And even middle of summer with a 90 degrees outside, there's snow and glaciers and stuff
[59:37.280 --> 59:38.000]  on the top of it.
[59:38.000 --> 59:38.960]  And it's spectacular.
[59:38.960 --> 59:41.360]  You're driving down the freeway and there's this huge volcano right in front of you.
[59:41.360 --> 59:45.120]  And I get on my iPhone to take a picture of it and I open it up and I look and it's just
[59:45.120 --> 59:48.320]  like, it's like, it's not even there because it's that wide angle shot.
[59:48.320 --> 59:50.800]  It's got both sides of the windshield, it's got the road and all that.
[59:50.800 --> 59:55.040]  And I zoomed in and I got, I got an okay shot with the digital zoom, but those shots are
[59:55.040 --> 01:00:00.640]  no good because they are zoomed in so far that any of the majesty of it is now lost
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.480]  in all the little pixelation that happens.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.360]  Yeah, it is.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.240]  It does, it, it will make for, and I presume it'll be Schiller who does it because that's
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.280]  Schiller's gig.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.680]  These years, this is usually the, he's the guy who does the new iPhone in September on
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.320]  Tuesday and I happen to know that, you know, Schiller is a truly, you know, real photography
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:22.880]  enthusiast.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.720]  He really knows his shit about cameras and he really cares.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.560]  But it's such a hard thing to present when you're saying how awesome this camera is.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.360]  And this other phone that we also want you to be excited about doesn't have it and can't
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:35.760]  do it.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.920]  But that is, it's a perfect scenario though.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.440]  Like you want to get the mountain top, you know, and that is exactly the sort of thing
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.680]  where a second lens that is longer will make a dramatic difference.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.200]  But when they show you the dramatic difference, it's going to be in comparison to what you
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.880]  get with the other new iPhone.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.200]  I think they're just going to have to say, like, you know, we could do this because it's
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.600]  a much larger phone and, and, and they're going to have to explain it that way.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.320]  The only way we could do this is because the iPhone 6 Plus or 7 Plus or whatever it is,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.360]  is this much bigger.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.560]  And, and so we can have, we have the room to do this, but I'm looking forward to that
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.000]  demo because I imagine that's going to be the ooh and aah demo of the whole thing.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.200]  Because they're going to have some, first, they're going to have hired spectacularly
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.240]  good photographers to take all the sample images.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.840]  And then they're going to, they're going to be perfect ones to show off when you flip
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.320]  a switch or you slide your finger or something, you go from A to B and everybody goes, whoa!
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320]  And you can see what it's going to be.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.280]  It's going to be a winner, that demo, yeah.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.760]  Yeah, I totally think so.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.520]  Before we leave iPhone, I'd hinted a few minutes ago that not knowing the product names is
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.880]  a clue to German sources.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.800]  Like the product names in my, in my experience, there are, that is like need to know basis
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.600]  within Apple.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.600]  And I think that the number of people, even like who work in product marketing, who know
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.760]  the name of the new iPhone is probably pretty small.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.840]  Yeah, names, prices.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:58.640]  Yep.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.040]  And it also means they're also changeable, right?
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.040]  Right.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.160]  Like the hardware, the hardware has been locked for ages now.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.280]  The software is basically locked.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.720]  Although, yeah, they will have little bits, but it's stuff that they've had to be working
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.160]  on for months and months and months.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.320]  Names, unless it's shipping that day and it's still, the name is iPhone, right?
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.280]  They could literally ship a box that just says iPhone on it and it would be okay.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.040]  So the names that you can leave those pretty late in the game and prices you can really
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.920]  leave late in the game.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.640]  And so it's a very small group of people who are doing that in terms of marketing.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.560]  And PR and they don't leak as much unless they want to.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.840]  I think they don't, unless the company wants a leak, I think they don't leak as much.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.120]  It comes from supply chain and it comes from kind of people in the broader company who
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.240]  know little bits about it and can leak those little bits.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.080]  But my experience, I don't know.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:58.160]  Do you remember when they did Mountain Lion and everybody expected there would be no OS
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:05.120]  update for like another year or six months and we all got briefings about Mountain Lion.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.360]  And I literally didn't know what I was being briefed on.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360]  I walked in and said, yeah, there's a new version of OS 10.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.240]  It's called Mountain Lion.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.520]  It's going to come out and we're going to announce it in two weeks.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.840]  And I just, nobody had been talking about it.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.720]  And literally it was not, I mean, the embargo dropped and everybody's minds were blown.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:28.080]  That was a really instructive thing for me about how buttoned up Apple in Cupertino,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.080]  in the marketing department could be, because that was something that didn't leak.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.880]  And why didn't it leak?
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.080]  Because not very many people knew and nobody in the supply chain knew.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.960]  Nobody outside of Infinite Loop knew really.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.760]  Yeah.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.600]  And I don't know how they do the packaging, like where and how they make all the boxes
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.000]  for these phones, but that's, you know, like here, my box here, I have one right here on
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.400]  my desk and it says iPhone 6s.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.760]  So somewhere there's somebody making all these boxes and that could leak.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.920]  But it's different than a regular supply chain.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.920]  And it's notable that the phones themselves don't have the numbers on the back.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.760]  They usually just say iPhone.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.760]  Last year they put the S underneath, but it just says iPhone S.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.640]  And the iPhone SE has an SE underneath it on the back etched into it.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.000]  And that name did leak because it was etched on the things that they were making in the
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.560]  supply chain.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:21.840]  Yeah.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.960]  And you wonder about like, yeah, the security of who's printing, you know, the boxes.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.200]  Yeah.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.040]  Where do they get printed and assembled and who is that?
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.480]  And presumably that's all happening in China because they're shipping them direct from
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:32.880]  China.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.360]  But I'm not saying too that you couldn't, you know, you could hedge on the name if you
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.600]  wanted to, but the name was probably chosen, but it's a smaller group and they can keep
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.960]  it buttoned up more easily.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.920]  And you see that in a lot of reports where there are details from the hardware side,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.240]  but not from the marketing side.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:56.480]  And that allows us to keep some degree of a mystery, at least for a while.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.760]  Often you will see those reports happen like a day or two before the event when they have
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.560]  to tell people.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.000]  But those people in the know can be really secretive about it right now.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.320]  Yeah.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.760]  And once, you know, boatloads of these things are, you know, en route or I guess they fly
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.280]  the first couple batches, I don't know, but once they're starting to put them on pallets
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:22.640]  and ship them across the Pacific Ocean, then there's obviously more sources for leaks.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.040]  Right.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.840]  Then the jig is up.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.600]  Although that's one reason why they're not usually available today, right, when they
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.440]  announce them is that they are not quite in the chain yet at that point to keep some amount
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.520]  of secrecy, I think.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.000]  Right.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.720]  I wonder how much they, you know, that they only do like a small number of boxes beforehand
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.640]  so that they can give us the review units and stuff.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.920]  But then once they announce it is when all of a sudden like there's some place in China
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:52.400]  where they start printing out literally millions of boxes with the product name, like Go.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.360]  Oh, because I presume that they can print these boxes a hell of a lot faster than they
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.320]  can assemble phones.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.840]  Oh yeah, sure.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.240]  I'm sure.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.600]  I'm sure.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.120]  It's probably a cool machine to see.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  Yeah, I was thinking I wonder if you could print on an assembled box so like just keep
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.720]  the, just keep the edge that says whether it's a 6 SE or a 7 or something else and just
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.200]  stamp it.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:15.680]  Probably not.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.840]  They probably print it on the cardboard and fold it up.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.520]  Uh, let's take a break before we talk about the Mac rumors.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.960]  Um, and let me thank our next sponsor.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.200]  It's our good friends at fracture.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:34.400]  Fracture is a photo decor company that is out to rescue your personal favorite photos.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.960]  Speaking of cameras, uh, from the digital ether.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.880]  You guys know if you're a long time listener of the show or other shows, you know, this
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.720]  is a company that you send them your photos and they print them directly on glass.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.320]  They don't print your photos on paper and then like glue the paper to glass or something
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:48.640]  like that.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:54.160]  They have a proprietary process that is amazing where they print them directly on glass.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.280]  I don't know how it works, but it looks amazing.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.720]  They really pop.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.600]  They have great vibrant color and contrast.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.720]  It just, it just looks like an exquisite print of a photo and it is a great way to bring
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.600]  your photos to life.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.160]  It is such a great thing and it is such a lost thing that we, even I'm guilty of it.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.360]  I have them as a regular sponsor and I buy them all the time and when I really think
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.920]  about it, I don't get enough of my pictures printed by fracture.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.480]  I'm going to get some printed after the show because I love them.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.920]  I love having them around the house.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.640]  Everybody loves having pictures hanging up on the wall.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.080]  They look so great.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.800]  It is amazing how good digital photos, even from your phone now look when you get them
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.080]  printed analog on, on something that you can actually touch.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.760]  I can't say how happy these, every time I buy these fractures, I can't tell you how
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.720]  happy they make me.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.480]  They even call it their happiness guarantee.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.000]  It's 60 days, so buy it.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.240]  Go.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.240]  If you don't just want to take my word for it, buy it, get them, take a look at them
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.080]  and you have 60 days where if you're not happy with the print that you ordered, you
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.680]  can send it back and they don't care.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.160]  They do them.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.200]  They're handmade in Gainesville, Florida from US source supplies in a carbon neutral
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.880]  factory so you can feel good about that.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.720]  Here's what you do.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.280]  Go to fractureme.com slash podcast.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.360]  I love this note.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.240]  URL ends in podcast, not the name of your podcast.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.040]  Fractureme.com slash podcast and you will get 10% off your first order and then they're
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.200]  going to give you a survey and it's got one question and the question is, how'd you
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.000]  hear about fracture?
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.320]  And then that's where you say the talk show or daring fireball or whatever you want, whatever
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.800]  you want to say.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.160]  So go there.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.840]  Fractureme.com slash podcast.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:29.680]  Love those.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.680]  I'm surrounded by those right now.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.280]  Yeah, they're great.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.120]  It's just so great.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.720]  I cannot say enough good things about this company and it's not really gift giving
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.640]  season in the middle of August, but my God, it is the best.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.160]  It is the best gift for family people you could ever imagine.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.520]  It's like they do actually assemble them, you know, in in Florida.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.840]  So they have limited limited.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.360]  Basically, they I think they they get busy at the holidays, so it's not bad to order
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.200]  ahead quite honestly, because they these are not they don't have just a factory where
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.080]  they can just turn it up.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.200]  They've got their their their their people who make these either last year or the year
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.000]  before, I remember doing a read where they specifically the read included like in bold
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.240]  print, like, you know, order now.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.480]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.160]  Please tell people to order by the end of November, because by December 1st, we might
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.760]  be backlogged past Christmas.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.000]  Yeah.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.320]  All right.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:22.880]  Back to Germin.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.320]  So Germin had the second thing.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.080]  And more recently, I think it was just a couple of days ago, he had a report on the new MacBook
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.880]  Pro.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.200]  Yeah.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:36.160]  And some of it there was one bit that was new to me, I think, but the rest of it wasn't
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.360]  the bit that was new to me was he said specifically that it is not a tapered design like the regular
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.120]  MacBook or the MacBook Air.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:50.000]  It is still a symmetric thickness across the side, which surprised me because I I sort
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.680]  of thought that they would go to a tapered design that it would that that they would
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.160]  go.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.320]  It would be like like think of a MacBook Air, but with the retina screen.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.960]  Yeah, I mean, they must just this is a way to differentiate it.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.680]  This is a way to have more room in there for battery and stuff.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.080]  I mean, it sounds like it's still thinner, slightly thinner, he says.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.800]  Yeah.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.000]  But not tapered.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:12.880]  That's a little surprising.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.520]  I think I think that was the the going theory was that it would be more like the like the
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.680]  MacBook Air or the or the MacBook just a little bit more chunky than that.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.400]  Yeah.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.200]  Chunkier still.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.120]  Part of my thinking it would be tapered is it's three factors.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.680]  One, Apple tends to make things thinner.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.320]  I don't know.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.560]  I don't know if you've ever thought about this or noticed.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.520]  Jobs's law.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.120]  That's the jobs law right there.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.720]  I don't know if you ever noticed, Jason.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.000]  But over the years, Apple tends to make devices thinner.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:40.880]  Interesting.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.920]  And going to a tapered design is a way to make it thinner and parts while still having
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.600]  you know, there's certain things that maybe require the thickness and they can stick them
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.320]  in the back.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:50.560]  Right.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.680]  Two is there was a report earlier this year from Ming-Chi Kuo, the supply chain analyst
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.560]  over in Asia who has very almost no sources, I think, within Apple itself.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.080]  But some very good supply chain sources in in the Asian countries where these factories
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.240]  are.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.840]  And he reported he had a curious report about a 13 inch MacBook, meaning like the 12 inch
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  MacBook that that we have today.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.560]  There's just plain MacBook, a 13 inch version.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:20.880]  Right.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.600]  Which makes no sense whatsoever.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.040]  Like 12 inch and 13 inches, not enough differentiation.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.800]  And the 12 inch was just updated.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.160]  Like if if they wanted to change the 12 inch to 13, I could see that that would be believable
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:39.120]  if they wanted to go back and have two versions, 111 and 113, like they used to with the air.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.720]  I could see that.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.800]  But 12 and 13 isn't it's you know, you've got to have like small and large.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.000]  You can't have like large and semi large.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.840]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.160]  So to me, that made sense only in the context that it wasn't a MacBook, that it was a MacBook
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:54.660]  Pro.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:12:00.100]  And, you know, maybe he was just wrong and there is no 13 inch tapered MacBook, but that's
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:00.900]  just what I thought.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:07.300]  And then the third factor is wishful thinking because I I've said this before, for years,
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.540]  my portable was an 11 inch MacBook Air.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:16.820]  And it was it was really slow because it I tend to the thing that I do that really slows
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:22.180]  down a Mac is I have like 30 or 40 Safari windows open each.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.220]  I swear to God.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:28.020]  I swear to God, I think I have like 40 windows over here on my iMac, each of them with like
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:28.580]  eight tabs.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:34.980]  And on the MacBook Air, that would really, you know, I'd have to call tab bankruptcy
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:39.860]  way more frequency than I want frequently than I wanted to because it just was slowing
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.340]  it down.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.980]  But the thing I loved about it and got addicted to and even two years into having this 13
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:48.660]  inch MacBook Pro still can't get used to is when I take it out of a bag.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:54.820]  I set it in front of me the wrong way because the tapered design made it instantaneously
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.980]  knowable, which is the front and which is the back.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:03.060]  And I still have if I want to do it visually, I'm so old and I'm so used to the old power
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.620]  books that I still remember when the Apple logo looked right when you were sitting in
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.540]  front of it closed, not when it was open.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.700]  And so that doesn't help me either.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.140]  Yeah, I still have my 11 inch Air here.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.260]  That's my laptop that I take around if I need to.
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.940]  And I thought, yeah, I think there's a group of people who are like, well, that MacBook
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:27.940]  is not for me, but I'm sure the new MacBook Pro will be smaller and lighter than the existing
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.020]  MacBook Pro, and that'll be close enough.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.100]  And I think that's the question here.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.540]  And that's what you're getting at with sort of wishing that it's more of a wedge shape
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.300]  is the hope that it's, yeah, it's a MacBook Pro, but it's still really thin and light.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:49.620]  And that may not be possible given that they do want it to truly be a Pro and have the
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.460]  power that the MacBook doesn't.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.700]  Yeah, that the Pro, they're really serious about the Pro part of the name.
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:00.900]  And that makes sense to me that because it is Pro and they really want to emphasize graphics
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:07.060]  and there's, according to Germin, some options to have these really nice AMD graphics, GPUs
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:11.940]  and other, you know, battery life and other things, you know, obviously it's easier to
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.180]  put a bigger battery in a device that isn't tapered.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.220]  So it makes sense.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:21.700]  And maybe it still has the nicer keyboard if it's thicker, because I kind of, you know.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:26.580]  I assume that these are going to have a keyboard that's more like the Magic Keyboard.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.100]  So different than the Classic Keyboard, but not the MacBook Keyboard.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.180]  That's my, that would be my guess is that they engineered this other kind of keyboard
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:40.100]  for a reason, and it's probably not just as an external Bluetooth keyboard, that this
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.980]  would be the basis of the MacBook Pro keyboard too, instead of the super thin MacBook keyboard.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.740]  Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:49.240]  I hope so.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:55.780]  And I guess the other thing now, again, this was, you know, rumored before, I think maybe
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.140]  from Germin, probably from Germin when he was at 9to5Mac.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:04.100]  And I've heard other things elsewhere, but that the function keys are being replaced.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.940]  There will be no more function keys on the keyboard.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.540]  The F1, F2, F3, which most people use for the other purpose.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.540]  They don't usually use them as function keys, but as the, whatever the little icon is, you
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:18.020]  know, the volume up, volume down, keyboard brightness, etc.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:25.380]  That those are going away and it'll be replaced with an LED touchscreen that will be software
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.020]  configurable.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:33.460]  So it'll be like having almost like an iOS device on the keyboard, where you tap on these
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.460]  buttons, that would be software configurable.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:36.340]  Right.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:40.260]  Which presumably means that then there will be a, when this is announced that all the
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:45.940]  like app developers are going to be given no time to be handed a new API of like, here's
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.660]  how you do this.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.940]  And then they're going to have to kind of jump to it, or we're going to see slow adoption
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:55.700]  of it, which is the downside of having a fancy new bit of hardware that requires software
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.780]  adoption because there'll be a lag.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.660]  I'm a little skeptical of this.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.660]  It's all about the implementation, but I'm skeptical only in the sense that I don't look
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:10.740]  down at my keyboard a lot and you use it by feel, and this is going to be an area that
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:16.340]  you presumably can't use by feel unless there's some other aspect of this that is not clear
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.220]  in these reports.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.740]  And that concerns me.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.820]  Like if you have to look down in order to mute your system because you don't know where
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:27.220]  the mute button is, or if it's even visible, that seems less good to me.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.980]  Can you hit the mute key without looking?
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.020]  I can't.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.020]  I can't use any of those function keys without looking.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:37.860]  I can touch type, but I even after, I don't, I'm not even, I can't even touch type numbers.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.220]  I have to look when I type numbers.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.460]  I can only do the alphabet and the, I do it some of the time I can, I can touch type some
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.420]  of them some of the time.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.340]  And sometimes I do look if I'm, if I'm not oriented, if my hands aren't on the keyboard,
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.260]  I think, um, I think it's true.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.340]  But you know, that's the argument is that you just, you look, you glance down and you
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:54.820]  tap.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.020]  I also, I'm kind of excited.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.140]  I used to have a Bluetooth keyboard that had a volume control.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.260]  Um, that was, uh, you, it had a little strip that you just slid your finger on.
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.420]  And I think that's interesting that some of the things we do with these, with these devices,
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:14.100]  like making the, the brightness, uh, more or less, or making the volume louder or quieter,
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:20.820]  don't really have to be, they're not even the best way to control them is not two keys
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.860]  or three keys.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.340]  It's probably because it's a, it's a spectrum and on a, on an iPhone, you just, you just
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.540]  slide a slider.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.460]  I could see that for something like this too, where instead of having keys to control the
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.460]  brightness of your display, there's just a brightness strip and you slide your finger
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:35.940]  on it.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.340]  Right.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:40.900]  Once you touch it, once you turn it like the slider pops up next to it, right?
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.300]  Like you put your finger on brightness and then slide your finger to adjust.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:45.860]  Exactly.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.140]  Even if you don't look, if you just, if you know where to land your finger for the brightness
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.060]  area, then at that point you're at wherever you are now and you just slide left or right
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.540]  to make it brighter or dark or, or likewise with volume.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:59.380]  And then if you want it quiet, you just touch the volume thing and slide to the left until
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:00.900]  it says it's muted.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:05.060]  And that's, that's a better interaction than tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on a key.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:05.540]  Yeah.
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:11.780]  Uh, I could see that, you know, I mean, and I, uh, for system-wide stuff, I can definitely
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.260]  see it.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:18.180]  I'm, I, it's not that I'm skeptical, it's just that I can't, I've yet to imagine a scenario
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.460]  where I would want per application stuff.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.260]  And that's one of the things Gherman said, the point was that, you know, depending on
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.180]  what application you're in, you could have different things.
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:31.620]  So, you know, would it be helpful, like if you're using Photoshop or, or, you know, an
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:37.620]  image editor, uh, to have the, the tool palette on the keyboard so that you could...
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.060]  I guess the argument is like, you know, I'm Final Cut users sometimes would have like
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.540]  stickers that they put on keys in order to say like, this is what I need to do to do
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.500]  this thing that you wouldn't need.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.860]  You could just have custom labels.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.020]  I mean, it's just like with the iPhone, you have the custom label.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.860]  So even if it's essentially the same as command shift option K or it's, you know, you know,
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:03.780]  command F2 that instead of that, it just has a thing that says, you know, split clip and
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.940]  you, and you tap it and it does what you want.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:07.060]  I guess that would be the idea.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.820]  I guess, I guess there's some, you know, and it ties it back in with our earlier discussion
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.820]  about custom key caps, you know, where I've seen like you, I've seen that you can buy,
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:18.260]  like if you use Final Cut as a professional, you can get like, especially not just stickers,
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.620]  you could just buy a keyboard that has the, you know, the keys.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.380]  I think there's Photoshop versions of that too.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:23.780]  Yeah.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:27.860]  Well, you know, on ATP at one point a few months ago, they talked about that.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:32.340]  I think there's an incredibly expensive keyboard that has custom keys.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.580]  Like they're like little screens.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.820]  Oh, I have seen that.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:37.140]  Yeah.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.500]  And that's madness, but you know, that, that, that idea.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.580]  So yeah, I mean, it's, it's true.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:49.620]  And, and, you know, I could see Apple pitching it as being a way to unearth the most important
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:54.340]  and little used features in your app in a way that, you know, you can expose them by
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.500]  giving them their own dedicated space on the keyboard.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:03.700]  My fear is that Apple is going to have some really great examples with their apps.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:08.260]  And then all the third-party developers are going to be like, well, you know, and, and,
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.820]  and they're going to not adopt it, or they're going to do it badly.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.940]  That we'll have to see, because that's a, that's a real challenge for it.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:19.940]  Like Mac software developers suddenly have having to do this whole new approach to their
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.460]  UI, which is this only on MacBook Pros, by the way.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:23.940]  Right.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.580]  I don't know.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.300]  It's weird.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:29.860]  Well, maybe, presumably I would think if it takes off, if there's any kind of traction
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:36.580]  with it whatsoever, it will come to the regular MacBook next revision around and maybe we'll
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.260]  come to the magic keyboard.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:38.820]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:39.460]  I mean, maybe.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:46.820]  I think it's a little weird as I, as I think about it and imagine it, I can imagine it
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:47.380]  being cool.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.820]  I can imagine it being a gimmick.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.700]  I'm not sold on it purely as an idea.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:51.860]  Yeah.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:21:00.500]  But I do think it's weird, a weird mashup of touch screens and the, the abstraction
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.140]  of the pointer-based macOS, right?
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:07.860]  That you've got a screen on the laptop that is abstract, meaning you have to use a track
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:12.660]  pad or a mouse to move a pointer that is a representation of you in the system.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.180]  And then to have an actual touch screen right there, right?
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:21.220]  It gets to the whole point of people thinking that they want touch screens on the Mac itself.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:26.900]  But it remains inside Apple's philosophy of it, which is that you don't go out of the,
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.780]  out of the plane.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.900]  You don't go perpendicular, that people don't want to do the zombie arms thing.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:31.220]  Right.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.740]  But if your hands are down on the keyboard and on a laptop, you know, you're looking
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.660]  at the screen, but you're also looking at the keyboard.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.300]  It's right there.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.740]  You can't really look away from it.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:43.140]  And that at the, you know, and then your fingers are already, you know, right next to that
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:43.700]  touch area.
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.300]  So you're not having to lift up and then reach out and touch the screen.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.100]  So it does fit.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:54.180]  It's a way for them to do touch screen technology short of replacing the entire keyboard with
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.140]  a touch screen while not kind of breaking their philosophy of not doing a touch screen
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:00.020]  on the main screen.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:00.260]  Right.
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:06.980]  Which would also require you to redo the entire UI of the macOS to make things of a size that
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:11.700]  would be amenable to being touched, which would make it, all the controls incredibly
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.180]  large for everybody using a mouse, which would be, which is one of the reasons why I don't
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:16.980]  think it's ever going to happen.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:23.940]  It doesn't say, Germin doesn't say whether the touch screen strip for function keys,
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.300]  as he describes it, will be a taptic.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:32.500]  I hope that it is because to me that would make it make a lot more sense because then
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.340]  you could navigate by feel a little better.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:35.220]  Right.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.780]  I don't know if you can, though, because if it's a touch screen, then if you're
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:44.500]  running your finger over it, you're touching it, unless it's pressure sensitive.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.000]  Right.
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.500]  I don't know.
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.740]  I mean, there's a lot of questions about this one.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:54.500]  This is a real mystery where not knowing anything but the existence of the hardware, we're
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:23:00.180]  left to put our own judgments on it that may have nothing to do with the real approach
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.820]  and the real way Apple's going to explain it when they roll this out.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:08.500]  It also says it'll have USB-C but doesn't say how many USB-C ports.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:16.420]  Or if they're removing USB altogether or Thunderbolt or is there a mix?
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.660]  It's just sort of like there will be USB.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.100]  It will include USB-C.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:21.140]  That's it.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.740]  One of his sources said.
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:28.100]  Which ties back to how long will I be able to get away using an Apple Extended Keyboard
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:28.340]  2.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.980]  The adapter I have goes to regular USB.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:34.820]  So you just have a USB-C to USB to ADB.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.460]  Just a chain.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.820]  Just keep chaining them forever.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:38.900]  Eventually, though.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:39.860]  Right.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:46.180]  So I'll be able to keep going with a USB-C only iMac if let's say the next one I replace
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:51.300]  this iMac, if that one only has USB-C, although I presume on an iMac, they're not going to
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.660]  get rid of the, you know, they can afford to just have a bunch of ugly ports because
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.700]  they hide them all on the back.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.220]  Yeah, probably.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.820]  So I probably won't.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.020]  And that's where I use this keyboard.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.820]  I don't I've never used the I've never used it with a MacBook.
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:07.540]  You know, it doesn't make any sense to plug an extended keyboard, you know, an external
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.580]  keyboard into a MacBook.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:13.300]  So I'm not too worried about it, but it makes me wonder about, you know, at some point eventually,
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:20.260]  I think before the the death of the Mac, I I wouldn't be surprised if I'm using a Mac
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.300]  that doesn't have any ports at all other than power.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:29.380]  So, yeah, you know, 10, 15 years from now, will I will there be USB ports on a Mac?
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.340]  I don't know.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.900]  Well, you'll be going from wireless standard to USB-C to USB to ADB at that point.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:38.980]  Yeah, I'm sure there'll be a I'm sure there'll be a chain of adapters that you can use to
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.180]  keep using your 30 plus year old keyboard at that point.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.140]  I guess that's what I'll need.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:49.540]  I'll need a USB port that a hub that goes to wireless wireless, the Bluetooth 8.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.020]  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.300]  He also the other report in here that I thought was really interesting when we talk about
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:01.700]  sort of how he qualifies his sources at Bloomberg is he says Apple has also considered bringing
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.220]  space gray, gold and silver.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.980]  I mean, it's still silver.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:08.980]  It already is a big, but basically adding the other two colors that they have on the
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:14.420]  iPhones and on the MacBook to the new line, a person said, right?
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.340]  And then he says, it's unclear if this will happen.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.140]  So basically he had one person say that they were talking about it and we don't know what
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:24.580]  the outcome is and if they're actually doing it or not, just that they thought about it.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.740]  Yeah, I think they probably will.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:28.580]  I hope they do.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:33.940]  I mean, I feel like, I mean, I've been on other podcasts, I've been complaining about this
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:39.300]  for a while now is I kind of miss the old days of like the colorful iPods and stuff.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.540]  And even the colorful Macs, if you go back to the original iMac and they ended up having,
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.460]  you know, eight different colors of those.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.260]  I kind of missed that.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.940]  Like we were all silver Apple products for so long.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.460]  And now we've got the gold and the space gray and that's good.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:26:00.580]  I think it's a good step, but I do feel sometimes I know that there's supply chain issues and
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:06.980]  store issues and all of that, but I do kind of miss having more personality and color.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.980]  I'm like, if somebody wants to buy a blue MacBook, that would be great.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.180]  I would love that.
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:17.540]  But at least one of the things I like about the MacBook is that it isn't just the silver
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.020]  color that you can get it in the gold or the rose gold or the, or the space gray.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:22.180]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:26.980]  It's been a long time for me where there's one color for a MacBook and you're going to
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.540]  like it.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.740]  I had the black MacBook when they made that and I loved that.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.540]  And then that was the last MacBook I had before I switched to the MacBook Air and it's been
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.580]  all silver laptops.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:41.460]  I saw someone in Starbucks with the black MacBook earlier this summer, maybe earlier
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.020]  this year, and it was a great condition.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:49.220]  I mean, this guy really obviously cares for it because at a glance, at least it was, it
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.220]  certainly wasn't grungy at all.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:57.380]  Uh, and I was, I was, I had this moment where I was just like, Whoa, what is that?
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.420]  That thing looks great.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.460]  And then I realized that what it was and I was, and then I, then I kind of saw how thick
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.620]  it was and I was like, uh, they were more prone to fingerprints than the white ones,
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:09.300]  but I think they were more resilient overall because the white ones were super shiny.
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.420]  And so they got scratched pretty easily, but the black ones were this matte color.
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.140]  At a glance, I thought it was gorgeous.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.580]  The other one that I've had that I don't, I haven't seen one in years now, but long
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:25.220]  after it was discontinued, occasionally I would see the 12 inch, uh, I think it was
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.260]  called a PowerBook.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.300]  Yeah, 12 inch PowerBook.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:30.260]  The one where the keyboard really went edge to edge.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.060]  Yeah.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.260]  Just like the MacBook now.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.340]  I mean, that was the, that was the original edge to edge.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:38.260]  This, this laptop cannot be any wider than the keyboard, the full size keyboard.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:38.740]  I love that.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.380]  That was my favorite.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.060]  Before the 11 inch Air, that was my favorite.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:48.180]  For years afterwards, after its discontinuation, when I'd see one, like at a press event
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:54.340]  or in a coffee shop or something, I'd have this moment of, whoa, what brand computer
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:54.740]  is that?
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.300]  That is a hot look that, you know, like, wow, Apple should get on that mix.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.860]  Oh, Oh, yep.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.100]  Cause I knew it wasn't, you know, like the modern, I instantly did recognize it as something
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:11.220]  different than what is available now and instantly recognized it as something that was gorgeous.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:11.540]  Yeah.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:15.780]  But boxy because it's so thick now, but in terms of the width, I mean, it was, it was
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:19.540]  incredibly small, way smaller, smaller than the MacBook because the screen was so much
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:20.020]  smaller.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.660]  Yeah.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.580]  But, but then, but then super thick.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:23.140]  Yeah.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:27.140]  It had, there was a certain elegance to the way that the keyboard looked edge to edge
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.500]  where it's sort of like the same appeal as like those infinity pools.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.540]  Like it's just looks as something in my brain registers that is beautiful.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:36.580]  Like it's the same way.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:41.540]  Like there was somehow instead of being awkward that there was no edge around it, it, it,
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.980]  the proportions were so nice that it just looked sharp.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:49.220]  Like really, I always felt, I always felt that that computer was like a keyboard that
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.820]  had a computer around it, that it was like the computer and the keyboard were just all
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.340]  part of the same thing in a way because of that design.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.580]  I, I, yeah, that was my, that was my favorite.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:03.060]  That was my favorite. The 11 inch took it over as my sort of favorite Apple laptop ever.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.780]  But for a long time it was that 12 inch.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:10.900]  The MacBook is, is kind of, kind of owes something to that now, but it's not quite the same.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:11.140]  Yeah.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:17.540]  There's a framing device in Gurman's story that I don't buy at all, which is that, and
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:23.060]  if you watch the video he did with Bloomberg TV, they emphasize it too, which is sort of
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:32.180]  like Apple is doing this new MacBook Pro because iPad sales have tapered off and the iPad didn't
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:36.660]  really succeed at being the replacement for laptops.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.180]  I mean, here's, I'll just read his words.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:42.100]  This year's MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.820]  consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:48.340]  Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years while they
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.940]  buy new iPhones every 18 to 12 months, according to a person familiar with Apple strategy,
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.620]  which blah, blah, blah.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.420]  That has nothing to do with why this MacBook is coming out now.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:02.580]  Yeah, it sounds to me like he had a tidbit, which is that Apple research seems to have
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.580]  twigged on what the buying pattern is for the iPad, which we've all been wondering,
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:08.020]  like, what is the cycle?
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:15.300]  And it sounds like his sources suggest that Apple thinks it's three years, but it doesn't
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.740]  seem to have, I mean, like they weren't going to update the MacBook Pro.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.300]  If the iPad was doing great, they were just never going to update it again.
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.580]  I think most people would say that it's surprising it's taken them this long because they were
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.500]  waiting out Intel and Intel had some issues and they thought they could skip a generation
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500]  and get away with it, but then they got bitten.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.660]  And now they're like, now it's too long.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.820]  440 days or something like that.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:38.100]  Yeah, well, it's very clear that they thought that they could get away with skipping that
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:42.500]  one Intel processor generation and skating by because the next one was going to be great.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.900]  And then the next one had issues.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:45.860]  And now here we are.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.180]  But, you know, I don't think it has anything to do with the iPad.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:55.140]  Yeah, why why has it taken so long for this iPad, this new MacBook Pro to come out?
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.580]  And we're speaking about it as though it's out and it's not out yet.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:01.700]  And now we can even may not be out until October or November even.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:08.260]  And I think what you said is I don't think with this in particular, like the Mac Pro
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.460]  is a totally different story.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.340]  And I don't know what is going on there because it's been nine years or nine years, but it
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:17.380]  feels like it's been about nine years since it came out.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.460]  Three years without any updates at all.
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:25.380]  And that there's the story on that has to be more complicated and might be more worrisome
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.820]  to people who really depend on those those those machines.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:32.580]  With the MacBook Pro, though, I think the story is exactly what you said.
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:37.700]  I think that there was an Intel generation of chips that Apple thought they could skip
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.980]  and wait for the next one in this because it's like, why do a new version of the MacBook
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:48.740]  Pro of the old MacBook Pro as we know it with just with the new chipset when this new thing
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:53.220]  is coming when and we have all these plans for the, you know, keyboard and it's going
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:53.780]  to be thinner.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.700]  We'll wait, you know, we'll wait and we'll wow them with that.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:01.380]  And it's taken longer than they thought it would because it's too many.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.980]  They sell too many of these like it's easy to say that their eye is off the ball on the
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.980]  Mac Pro because it just doesn't sell in high quantities.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:10.100]  But the MacBook Pro is a big moneymaker.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.700]  It really is.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.740]  I think it's there.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:17.780]  I mean, my my money would be on it being their number one Mac that they sell, right?
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:22.100]  Because they sell somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of the Macs that they sell.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.380]  They don't break it out anymore, I think.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.260]  So we can't tell.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.420]  But it's a huge number.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.500]  The majority of the Macs sold are laptops.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.380]  They're not desktops.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.580]  They're laptops.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:34.900]  And I would think that, I mean, MacBook Air probably isn't selling very well now.
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:36.260]  The MacBook is probably doing okay.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.100]  But MacBook Pro, that's the workhorse.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.860]  That is at a normal time.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:43.300]  That's got to be the most important of all the Mac product lines.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:48.500]  And certainly by revenue and profit, because if it's not quite there in quantity, it is
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.380]  a much higher price, especially and because it attracts pros.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:57.300]  I'm sure that more people buy them and max out the storage and the RAM and stuff like
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.740]  that and the graphics, you know.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:02.740]  Whereas the people who buy, certainly the people who are buying MacBook Airs are buying
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.380]  them for the price at this point because the specs aren't there.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:06.500]  The screens aren't retina.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:12.020]  Whereas people buying the pros might be buying the ones that cost, you know, $2,500.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.620]  So by revenue, it's got to be.
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.100]  So I think Apple is internally furious about the delay on this.
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:23.140]  So the other thing Gherman reports, and you alluded at it, Gherman says that they're
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:29.460]  not planning to debut them at the event next month, which I expect to be on September 7th.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:34.980]  And that's mainly just going by history, which is that for the last three or four years,
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:41.460]  they've had an event somewhere around, this is like March 7th, or September 7th to the
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.940]  7th to 11th, 12th, something like that.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:48.100]  And if you look at the calendar, March or September 7th is the day.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.060]  It's a Wednesday.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:53.140]  And the Monday two days before is Labor Day, which is why they're not having it on Tuesday.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:53.620]  Exactly right.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.540]  Well, it was two years ago was the 9th.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:56.820]  And I think last year was the 8th.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:59.540]  And I think that making it the 7th this year makes a lot of sense.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.780]  If they're sticking with that pattern, that'll be what it is.
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:07.860]  I would have expected, and again, I have no inside information on this whatsoever, but
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:13.860]  just based on the fact that last year they used one event to do everything that was coming
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:20.260]  out in the fall, including the iPad Pro, which wasn't coming until late October, that even
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:25.300]  if these MacBook Pros aren't coming till October, that they would use this one event to unveil
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:25.460]  them.
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:30.100]  And the one thing I do know, just from last year, was talking to people at Apple, that
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:36.980]  it was definitely a purposeful decision to go to one event in September for everything
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:41.060]  they were going to do that fall, instead of what they had done in the previous few years,
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:46.020]  which was a big-ish event in September and then a small-ish event, usually at Town Hall
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.660]  and Cupertino in October, that they found that too hard to do back to back.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:50.820]  Yeah.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:35:00.020]  You know, I think they could announce them at the event and just say, look, we love the
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.860]  Mac and we have a whole bunch of new Mac stuff, and here's a really quick look at where the
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:07.220]  Mac is going this fall, and they would say, this is coming out in October, this is coming
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.260]  out in November, of course, Sierra is out now, blah, blah, blah, we're done.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.660]  They could do an event.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:18.020]  Also, I mean, I know people don't like it when I say this, but there are, Apple can
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:23.060]  release products without an event, and for something like the Mac, which we all love
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:28.260]  but at the same time is a small part of Apple's overall business now, is it the end of the
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:33.940]  world if Apple does a MacBook Pro press release?
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.820]  I mean, it would be a whimper, but they could.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.980]  They could also do a really small event somewhere.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:43.060]  They've done that before, where it's a Mac event and it's got a very limited invite
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:46.340]  and it's Town Hall, and they could even do that.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.980]  I don't think they're ever going to go back to Town Hall, but they got options.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:54.260]  They don't have to give it 30 minutes on stage on September 7th.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:36:00.020]  Yeah, my guess is that they either give it 30 minutes on stage September 7th, or they'll
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.580]  release it without an event and do product briefings.
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:05.300]  Yeah, they'll do briefings and press release and big website.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:11.140]  I mean, the fact is, Apple can release a product without an event and still get lots of press
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:16.420]  coverage because they invite their key journalist contacts to pre-briefings and give them an
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:23.060]  embargo, and then one day you wake up and suddenly all of these reviews are posting
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.220]  about the new MacBook that just was announced.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.660]  Yeah, I think when they do the briefings, there's obviously fewer press than at an
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.500]  event, but it's not super exclusive either.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.540]  I remember when the watch came out.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:40.980]  There was an event in March that was the year that I couldn't travel because of the eye
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:44.820]  surgery, but they didn't have watches to give out yet.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:51.220]  And then when they did, they did product briefings in New York and on campus in Cupertino for
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:55.460]  U.S. coasters, so I went to New York, but it was tons and tons.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.820]  I mean, a big, big operation.
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.740]  I mean, it wasn't just like, oh, they invited three people and give them a watch.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.540]  I mean, it was an operation.
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:08.900]  Yeah, although that's in part perhaps because they thought they would be able to give them
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.660]  out at the March event, and they couldn't.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.740]  But they can do that with the MacBook, I'm sure.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.980]  They certainly absolutely could.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:21.780]  Yeah, I'm trying to think, anything else about the MacBook Pros?
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:22.420]  I don't think so.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:23.620]  I don't know.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.820]  I mean, we mentioned the seven years it's been since the Mac Pro got updated.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:33.940]  I do think that that's an overarching question that we still need an answer to is what's
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:37.780]  going on with the rest of the Mac line, other than the MacBook.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:43.620]  This would be the season, this fall would be the season where they would do at least
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.540]  a speed bump on the iMacs.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.220]  And maybe the Mac Mini, and certainly a story about what's going on with the Mac Pro.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.260]  And it sounds like, you know, they're working on that stuff.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:57.220]  I've seen reports that all of that stuff is in process.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.500]  And it's just a question of when does it get formally announced and shipped.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.820]  And it sounds like we may end up with a fall where the entire Mac line turns over, except
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.380]  for the MacBook.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:08.500]  And yeah, I hope so.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:10.900]  I really do.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:17.300]  Because it is, you know, it's damn curious if you want to use a Mac Pro that you have
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.140]  to buy a three-year-old computer.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:21.140]  I can't even believe they're still selling them.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:26.740]  I mean, it's almost unconscionable that those products are still for sale because they're
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.340]  so outdated now.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:34.500]  It would be fascinating to know how many of them they're actually selling, because even
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:40.660]  more than the MacBook Pro, it's almost certain that nobody goes in and actually sells them
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:43.540]  accidentally, just on a whim, buys a Mac Pro, right?
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:50.020]  Like, it truly is the most pro of any computer they sell.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.060]  It's very expensive.
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.180]  It requires a display, you know.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.340]  I wonder if they're selling them to institutional sales now, where they actually buy a bunch
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:59.780]  of them and they give them a big discount.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:03.700]  And yeah, you can buy them on the Apple store on apple.com.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.500]  But that maybe if they're selling any, it's really that.
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.860]  And it's to people that they may need a Mac Pro and they need it today.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.300]  They need a hundred of them.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:16.340]  I can totally see, though, how a lot of people coming in to buy a MacBook of any sort or
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.620]  an iMac, they have no idea when the last time it was revised.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.260]  And they don't care.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:20.820]  Sure.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.780]  Just look at it.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:22.660]  It looks great.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:23.940]  And it seems to be very fast.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.380]  It's very fast right there in the store.
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:25.940]  Hey, I'll buy it.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.260]  Whereas the Mac Pro is only selling to people.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:34.660]  Whatever the reason, whether they're videos editors or photographers or developers, they're
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.860]  selling to people who know that this is a three-year-old computer.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:44.660]  And people who know, A, know that it's old, B, know that it's no longer a good value for
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:49.380]  the dollar, and C, know that it's going to physically pain them to buy one and then have
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.100]  a new one come out in short order.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:52.580]  Exactly.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:56.100]  Also, I wouldn't feel bad buying an iMac now, even knowing there will be an iMac in the
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:56.260]  fall.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:02.660]  Because the 2015 update to the iMac, I mean, those are good, modern, fast systems.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.260]  It's not the same situation.
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.580]  They're all faster than the Mac Pro, too, basically.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.980]  So yeah, Mac Pro is baffling.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:12.900]  I got the first 5K iMac I'm looking at right now.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:17.220]  And I don't even feel bad about that one, even knowing that the next one came with the
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.620]  increased color gamut, which is gorgeous.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:23.060]  But I'm never going to see it side by side with this one.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.900]  And this one still looks drop dead.
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.060]  This display is the best display I've ever had.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.980]  So I don't even feel bad about that.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:30.500]  Yeah, I'm colorblind.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:36.260]  I can see color, but I don't appreciate some of the finer details of color.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.340]  And the color gamut thing, basically.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.380]  I can see it a little bit.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:41.540]  But yeah, it doesn't make me feel sad.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.980]  I got the Core i7.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:46.020]  Yeah, this is the i7 iMac.
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.780]  I did the build to order of the high end.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:50.340]  It's the most powerful Mac I have ever owned.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.700]  Even though it's a 2014, I'm happy with it.
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:59.540]  A friend of the show, Craig Hockenberry, is doing, he's a developer at Icon Factory.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:05.220]  He's doing a lot of research into color technology.
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.060]  Long story short, I helped him out.
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:10.340]  But I looked at, he had an image of whatever you want to call it.
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:15.140]  What's deep resolution, whatever that's called, the extra color.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:16.420]  It's like the wide color gamut.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.380]  The wide color gamut.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.740]  He had a photograph that took advantage of it.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:26.260]  And I looked at it on the iMac, and then I looked at it on the iPad Pro,
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.820]  which is, I think, the only device I have that has that.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:30.100]  The 9.7, yeah.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:30.580]  Yeah.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.300]  And I could see the difference, but it was not a heartbreaking difference.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.940]  It was a, wow, Apple's really killing it with these displays.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.900]  But it did not break my heart that my iMac doesn't have it.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:43.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:44.900]  That's, I think that's exactly right.
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:48.580]  If I were a photographer working in that color space,
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:53.220]  and being frustrated that my display couldn't properly display it,
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.740]  then I would jump on it.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.420]  If it was retina versus non-retina, then I would just pick up this iMac
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:01.860]  and throw it in the garbage and head to the Apple Store.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.820]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:05.220]  So I feel like Mac, what is it?
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.900]  MacRumors saying don't buy an iMac.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.980]  It's like, yeah, you know, you could buy an iMac.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:11.540]  I suppose if you're reading MacRumors, you're savvy enough.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.940]  But it's like you could buy, I think you could buy an iMac.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:14.340]  If you need it.
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:14.900]  It would be fine.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.620]  If you need it.
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:17.780]  If you have the need, you should definitely do it, I would say.
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.780]  Yeah, because it'll get better in the fall, there's no doubt.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:20.820]  But it's already pretty great.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.220]  That's a, it's going to be fine.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.900]  But the Mac Pro, no idea.
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.260]  MacBook Pro, same thing.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:31.300]  So I hope, I guess that's what I'm saying is I hope that there's more behind this exciting MacBook Pro,
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.580]  which is absolutely should be the number one thing on the list of Mark Gurman reporting about it.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:40.020]  But I hope behind that there are a raft of,
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.260]  even if it's just sort of speed bump announcements of all the rest of the Mac line.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:48.820]  Intriguingly not mentioned in Gurman's report is anything about the displays,
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:55.620]  including pixel sizes and including a pixel count of the new iPhones.
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:01.300]  And whether they're going to get the wide color gamut and the room temperature,
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.700]  the temperature sense shifting.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:05.460]  What do they call that feature?
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.500]  I don't have an iPad.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:07.540]  True tone.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.040]  True tone.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:12.820]  Which I kind of, even though Gurman didn't mention it,
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:16.180]  I'm just going to guess that it does have true tone.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:19.060]  Yeah, I'm going to guess that, yeah.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.380]  Because, here's why I'm guessing that.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:23.060]  A, it's their flagship device.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:26.500]  And the best stuff usually comes to iPhone first, and if it doesn't come first,
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.660]  it's like off by six months, which would be exactly right with the true tone.
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:33.460]  And when it was introduced, Schiller said,
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.220]  once you get used to it, you can't go back.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:38.740]  Which makes me think that maybe Schiller already knew
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.020]  that he wouldn't have to worry about missing it on his iPhone.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.300]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:47.460]  I think Apple is committed, just as it was obvious a few years ago,
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.420]  that Apple was committed to bringing Retina to the entire product line.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:53.620]  I think Apple is committed to bringing the wide color gamut,
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:57.860]  and the true tone stuff to certainly the iOS line,
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:02.340]  and probably with the true tone stuff, even the Mac line at some point.
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.540]  Because I think they've decided that this just improves the user experience.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.660]  That if you're in a place with yellowy light,
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.980]  then you ought to match the white point on your display.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:11.940]  And you can turn it off.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.060]  I mean, people freak out sometimes.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.660]  They're like, oh, you're messing with my colors.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:15.860]  Like, well, you can turn it off.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:20.820]  But a lot of people would prefer to have the computer screen color
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:22.900]  match the light of the room color.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:24.580]  And I think Apple thinks they've got a winner with it,
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.260]  that it's kind of a crowd-pleasing feature.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.420]  And all it really takes, I mean, they've got the new screen technology,
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.020]  but they seem to have that down now.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:37.460]  And you need a light sensor that is more than just a one-bit light sensor,
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.620]  because you've got to detect the color temperature of the room.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.660]  And that's it. You're done.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.300]  That's it.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:45.220]  Yeah, and it's just another little chip in the pile of,
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:51.140]  here's the year-over-year improvements that are in the iPhone that everybody will,
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:56.260]  not everybody, but the press at large will sigh and say, that's it?
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:04.900]  But it's exactly the sort of feature that on a checklist of what's new in the new iPhones
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:12.580]  this year versus last year's models is easy to pooh-pooh, but is just like one iteration
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.060]  after another of all of a sudden, two, three, four years down the road,
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:21.780]  you've got a device that absolutely blows away the old iPhone.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.620]  And if the average buying cycle on a phone is two years, and it probably still is,
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.180]  even though some people will upgrade every year and other people will wait,
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:31.300]  especially now that there's the different financing options,
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.140]  it might wait two and a half, three years.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:37.060]  If two is the sweet spot, then Apple really only needs to make half the case
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:40.980]  for an upgrade every year, because you're not upgrading from the 6S,
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:44.420]  you're upgrading from the 6, and now you've got to add all the 6S features
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.380]  and all of the whatever this new phone is features together
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:49.220]  when you make the case to buy an upgrade.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:50.820]  Totally agree.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:51.780]  All right, let me take a break.
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.700]  Thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.700]  This is a great new sponsor.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.660]  I love this company's product, Eero.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.900]  E-E-R-O.
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.860]  Here's the whole company, Eero, is founded on the idea that Wi-Fi is broken.
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:10.580]  And their analogy is, imagine if the electricity in your house
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.420]  was better in some spots than others.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:16.500]  If you plug in your phone to charge it in your living room, it's great,
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.900]  but if you plug in the same plug, put it in your bedroom,
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:22.180]  and it's half the speed, half the charge.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:23.780]  Electricity doesn't work like that,
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.540]  but that's exactly what Wi-Fi is like in the house.
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:30.820]  And it's fundamental that Wi-Fi, the signal of Wi-Fi,
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.380]  does not go through walls easily.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.380]  It's not meant to, it goes through the air.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:42.100]  So if you live in a house or a home or an apartment that has walls and floors,
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:46.020]  like a lot of us do, your Wi-Fi signal degrades.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:51.540]  So Eero is a system of little puck-shaped devices,
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.420]  sort of roughly the size of an Apple TV, except they're white.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.940]  They look like an Apple device.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:47:00.420]  They're very cute, little round squares, little pucks, very small, very nice.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:05.140]  You just get a couple of them, and their default is like a three-pack.
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:07.140]  And you strategically place them around the house.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:12.740]  You only plug one into your cable or whatever it is that your internet comes from.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:15.700]  And then you use their app, and it's an iPhone app.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.900]  It's a really nice app, and you configure the network.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.980]  And then all of a sudden, they do all the hard stuff.
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:28.180]  You get effectively a professional, I don't know what you would call it,
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.780]  like if you had IT experts, networking experts,
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:36.020]  come into your house and set up a Wi-Fi system with a bunch of devices.
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:38.820]  That's what you get with Eero, except you don't have to be a networking expert.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:42.100]  You just plug them in, put them around the house on different floors.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:45.300]  Their recommendation is one for every 1,000 square feet.
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.860]  Three-pack's a good starting point.
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.940]  And you use the app to set it up.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.500]  It's great.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.180]  It is so easy.
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.060]  It is so easy.
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.220]  30-day money-back guarantee.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.060]  You can't regret it.
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:03.060]  So if you set it up and it's not better, you can always return it.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:05.540]  And if you want to, you can even return one of them.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:08.580]  Like if you get the three-pack or a four-pack,
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.580]  and you end up with two saturates your house with solid Wi-Fi,
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.940]  well, then send the other one back.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:14.440]  That's great.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.940]  It really is a terrific product.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.340]  If you don't believe me, search for the reviews.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.660]  Walt Mossberg wrote a great review of it.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.500]  Really, this is the first place I heard of it, even before they sponsored it.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.700]  It really just works.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.500]  It really is exactly what you think.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:35.700]  Totally simple Wi-Fi system that saturates your whole house
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:38.420]  with really strong Wi-Fi signal.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.540]  So can't say enough good things about them.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:48.420]  Go to ero.com and remember the code, the talk show.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:49.860]  The talk show.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:50.740]  Use that code.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.780]  And you know what you get with that?
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.500]  You get free overnight shipping.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.460]  So go there.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.660]  Go to Eero.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.220]  See it.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.900]  When you order, use the code D talk show.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:01.700]  And if you're listening right now, do it right after the podcast ends.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.140]  You'll have them tomorrow.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:04.580]  They'll be there free overnight.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.460]  And that's for free.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.060]  So can't beat that.
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:07.940]  My thanks to them.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.140]  I have them installed here.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:10.900]  It is a great Wi-Fi network.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.620]  Couldn't be easier.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.580]  Couldn't be a better signal.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.080]  Eero.
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:14.020]  Yep.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:14.900]  Got them here too.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:15.400]  They're great.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.460]  That read went on long, but it's because I'm so enthusiastic about the product.
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:22.500]  I cannot.
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.260]  I really rolled my eyes when they sponsored it first because I thought,
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.380]  well, I know they're going to want me to.
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:29.620]  If I'm going to talk about it, I got to set it up.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:33.700]  And I thought it was, I really, really thought I don't want to spend an hour
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:38.260]  setting up a Wi-Fi thing at my house that I'm just going to have to disconnect
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.380]  a closet when I'm done.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:42.260]  It seemed like way more, you know, it's being a podcast.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.980]  It's easy to get lazy and think that that's hard work.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:46.500]  But A, it didn't take an hour.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500]  It's like it took like 15 minutes.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:53.220]  And B, it's like better than my old Wi-Fi.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.460]  I was like, oh.
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:55.700]  Yeah.
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.820]  I think there's a great benefit in designing a Wi-Fi system for multiple
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:02.740]  routers instead of just the single base station that most of them are designed
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.740]  for and it, and it shows with that product.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.060]  Yeah.
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.180]  And in, you know, here in Philly, everybody, you know, everybody's townhouse.
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:09.780]  So it's, you know, we have lots of floors.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:13.540]  It's not, you know, floors are probably the bigger problem in my house than
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.460]  the walls because we live right.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.260]  Cause you're vertical.
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:16.580]  Yeah.
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:17.300]  Right.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.340]  And there's, and the cable is on, it's not in the middle.
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:20.980]  It's down below.
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:23.060]  Yeah, that's hard.
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:23.860]  No, it really is.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.100]  It's amazing.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:26.900]  I've said it before.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:30.900]  It's, I know it's, I guess the read continues to go on, but in our garage, we
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:33.860]  never got good Wi-Fi in the garage before we had the Eero.
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:37.700]  And it was a problem in the garage because it would often be like, you'd
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:40.660]  want to, you'd get in the car and you'd be like, oh, I wanted to, you know, I
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:44.020]  wanted to open overcast and download, you know, finished downloading podcasts.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:48.580]  But with like immediate, it was like, there's enough of a signal easily enough
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.900]  of a signal that it wasn't going to LTE.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.100]  It was still on Wi-Fi.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:56.180]  But it was like, when you see two bars on the Wi-Fi, that means like, you know,
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:59.220]  you're on like a 56K modem, right?
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:02.900]  Like if you don't have all the bars on the Wi-Fi, you're screwed.
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:03.140]  Yeah.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:04.900]  Anyway, Eero.
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:11.860]  You want to talk about Rick Tetzeli's Fast Company piece or, I guess there
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:12.820]  was a second piece too.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:16.260]  There was an interview with the Bizoma St. John.
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:20.180]  Right, that Mark Sullivan did, but Rick Tetzeli wrote the main piece.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.300]  Yeah.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:26.820]  I listened to your show, your upgrade with Mike Hurley, and I thought it was
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:27.140]  interesting.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.940]  You guys both seemed a little non, it's like the casual, the new meaning of
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:35.220]  nonplussed, like not that enthusiastic about it.
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:36.900]  I loved this story.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:37.700]  I really did.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:42.260]  And I thought you and Mike were surprisingly like, I didn't really, I
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.300]  didn't really love anything.
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.820]  To be fair, one of the things about that podcast is we recorded on Monday
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:50.100]  morning, and so literally I woke up, saw that there was this story, read it, and
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.700]  then we did a podcast about it.
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:52.900]  I was surprised when I heard it.
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.660]  I was like, wait, I just read the story.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:58.740]  I went for a run, and I was listening to your show, and I was like, how are
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.620]  they talking about this?
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:03.380]  And then I realized that the air date of the podcast was like, I literally must
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:06.740]  have downloaded it as I left the house.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:09.380]  The Wi-Fi radius allowed you to download it.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.340]  Part of it for me is that I see the artifice behind it, and most people won't
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.340]  ever see that, but as somebody who has written and edited magazine features
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:25.380]  before, I looked at this and I thought, okay, I can see why this thing is
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.260]  constructed the way it is.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:30.580]  And also part of it is some of my own personal bias, where I look at a story
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:37.300]  that begins with like a lengthy anecdote about the surroundings of Apple and,
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:43.220]  um, and, you know, running into Eddy Cue and describing what he's wearing and
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.700]  the temperature in Cupertino and all of that.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.820]  And there are two ways to view that.
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.580]  And one is, this is a feature story.
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:49.380]  He's setting the scene.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:52.180]  He's letting his readers get the sense of who these people are and what this
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:52.820]  place is like.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.700]  And that is how it's intended.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:53:02.100]  As an editor, I also look at that and think, um, you're, you know, you don't
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:05.460]  have, you don't have a lot of material to pack in here.
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:08.580]  So you have the, you know, you have the room to tell a story.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:12.420]  And in fact, you kind of need to tell, uh, uh, weave a story here and some
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:17.540]  imagery, uh, because the, you know, that's, that's part of what you've got
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:21.060]  is the access and that maybe you don't have, you know, if you had Tim Cook
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:24.340]  saying something, you know, pretty profound and deep in terms of
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:26.820]  pronouncement, you probably lead with that, but you don't.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:29.780]  So you lead with the atmosphere and it's like, I, I kind of get the
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:30.900]  artifice of that.
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:34.020]  And part of it is just, yeah, as somebody who's been to Apple and has
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:37.620]  talked to and talked to a lot of these people, for me, I read that story
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.460]  thinking, what are they going to say?
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:43.540]  That's new and describing cafe max and the smell of the chicken masala
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:44.500]  doesn't do it for me.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:45.700]  So part of it is that too.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.620]  So I like to come with my biases.
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:48.740]  I liked that though.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.220]  I really did.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.660]  I did that a couple of years ago.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:53.860]  I think it was the time that you're talking about where Apple, Apple
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.740]  called us in for a briefing where they didn't tell us what the product
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:56.980]  was.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:00.580]  And I had a briefing with Schiller in New York and they said they, they
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.420]  made clear to me that the whole thing was on the record.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.060]  I was like all of it.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.500]  I can write about all of it.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:08.660]  And so, and really, instead of writing about the, the version of macOS
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.540]  that they showed me, I wrote what it was like to have the product
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.500]  briefing with Schiller.
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.580]  And Apple did not like that.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:18.660]  I, I was, I was then told that there was a, a quote unquote, grouper
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.620]  clause added to future on the record briefings, where it's the, what's
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:26.180]  being talked about the product is on the record, not the.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:30.020]  Yeah, not the quotes and don't, yeah, I've gotten, I've gotten read
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:30.980]  that riot act too.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.700]  So thanks for that.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:35.780]  But no, it's, you know, it's, it's all about what you want to get out of
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:39.140]  it and how you, I think it's a fine story.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.740]  I think it's got some good stuff in it.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.380]  I think it's, you know, it's interesting that was done a while ago
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:47.140]  because it's clearly been held for a magazine deadline because they
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.140]  still apparently publish in print.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:49.700]  Good for them.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.860]  And so it's like from when the warriors lost the NBA finals, which is
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:54.980]  a while ago now.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.540]  So it's not like it's, it's kind of breaking news, but they did get
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:57.940]  access.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:01.540]  It's not, you know, again, I read between the lines and think they
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.500]  didn't get a lot of time with Tim Cook and a lot of time with Eddie Q.
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:08.020]  and Craig Federighi, but they got some and it's a, and it's a, I think
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.140]  it's a perfectly nice piece.
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:12.980]  I think the thing that impressed me most about it is that it cited all
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:15.940]  of the misconceptions about Apple without buying into them.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.660]  And, and that's hard for a magazine piece or really any piece to do
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:26.260]  where usually you either see pieces that are denying the conception or
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:28.180]  you see them buying into it entirely.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:29.620]  And this piece didn't, didn't do that.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.940]  This piece was like, this is how it's perceived.
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:36.340]  But there are lots of reasons why that may not actually be accurate.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.300]  And I was impressed that he walked that line because nuance is really
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:39.860]  hard to do.
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:41.460]  And I think he did a good job with it.
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.420]  I think he really did a good job of painting a picture of what Apple in
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:49.620]  2016 is, you know, and, and it's true.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:54.820]  And it's an interesting amount of time post Steve Jobs.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.140]  Am I off by a year here?
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:58.100]  I'm pretty sure it's five years.
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:02.020]  I think it was 2011 where, where I think you're right, right around now in
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.420]  August, they, Steve announced that he was, uh, stepping aside as CEO to
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.580]  become chairman of the board.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:11.700]  And then it was October when, when, when he died.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.140]  So five years is, you know, sort of a round number and it's an interesting
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.100]  period of time and it's been a very strong five years for Apple.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.580]  You know, they mentioned in the article that the head, the company's
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.580]  employee count has doubled in that time.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.900]  Certainly their finances have, you know, for whatever, how much
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:30.100]  hand-wringing you want to give over the year over year decreases in the
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:35.620]  last two quarters overall there, those quarters are still above 2014.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:41.540]  And, you know, it's just the abnormal ness of 2015 with the abnormal
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:46.660]  success of the iPhone six, um, that, you know, and again, not good, but
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:50.340]  still overall, the company is way bigger financially and profits and
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:54.820]  revenue and, and, you know, number of just number of users than they were
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.620]  five years ago.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:57:02.980]  It's it truly is, um, Apple, the industry behemoth now they are.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:05.060]  I mean, there's no other way to avoid it.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:09.540]  And I, I've been thinking about this a lot, like big picture, Apple stuff,
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:14.020]  you know, as a commentator and columnist that I think in my heart, I liked
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:15.780]  Apple, the little company better.
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.540]  You know, it, it was more appealing to me personally.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:21.540]  And I mean, it's, it's, you're a star Wars fan.
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.740]  It's like, you're rooting for the rebel Alliance when it's, it's old
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:25.140]  Apple.
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.820]  And now I had this conversation with my friend, Greg Noss, who knows
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:32.020]  everybody on the internet, apparently, uh, who I went to college with.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.100]  And he was saying, you know, it's kind of hard to root for Apple these
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:34.340]  days.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:37.060]  This was a few years ago, but, or, or to even do something like read the
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:40.500]  Macalope, because it was one thing when they were the underdog and they
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:43.140]  were the rebel, but now they're kind of like the big guy.
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.860]  And it doesn't make me, you know, uh, I don't know, there's just, the
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.500]  tone is different.
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:49.380]  The feeling is different.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.740]  And, and you, you're right.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:51.780]  This article gets it.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.140]  I mean, I think the maps anecdote was the most is the most illuminating
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:55.860]  thing in it.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.940]  And it's illuminating in so many different ways.
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:01.060]  Like they talk about, they talk about the fact that they were kind of in
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:05.460]  a bubble where all the maps in California were good or in Cupertino or in
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:06.260]  the Bay area were good.
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:09.220]  And so they didn't realize they had data problems and that they thought
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:13.780]  thinking like old Apple, which was, we have to do this with a very small
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.020]  team, um, because we have to do it.
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:19.700]  And nobody's really disputing that they had to do their own maps data, but
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:22.100]  they like, they had this little team that did it and they were kind of
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.900]  undersized and underpowered and it was a disaster.
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.020]  And now they, they said like it went from a couple dozen people or dozens
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:32.020]  of people to like more than a thousand people working on maps now.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:35.220]  And, and I thought, I thought that's, that's that moment where you realize
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:40.020]  the old playbook doesn't work for like, you have to do this thing, this
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:43.220]  maps thing, because it's, it's key to your business and the future products
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:45.780]  that you do that you have your own, your own source of map data.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.100]  Okay.
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:49.380]  Um, but you can't, you know, you can't do it in the old way, which has put a
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.860]  small team on it and have them kind of hack something together.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:54.260]  You actually have to spend a huge amount of money and hire a whole bunch
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:58.660]  of people and, and make it really good everywhere in the world.
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:01.700]  And that was, I, I mean, I thought that was really interesting, not just
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:05.060]  because they say this is the reason why there are public betas now, because
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:08.900]  they need to test it more broadly than their insular community, but also
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:12.020]  just because what it says about how they need to embrace the fact that
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:16.580]  they are playing on a much larger stage and the stakes are higher and they
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.660]  can't, there's some stuff they can't do the old way, just because that's
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.620]  not who they are anymore.
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:23.060]  And that's not the game they're playing anymore.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.940]  Uh, a thousand employees.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:27.460]  I mean, they don't say what they're doing.
[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:31.380]  Like, are the, are these people who are just driving cars, driving cars?
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:31.540]  Yeah.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:35.460]  That's, that was my thought is, is, is, is because there's a, you know,
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:38.740]  there's a too, you know, too many chefs spoil this soup.
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:39.540]  Right.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:42.100]  But you know, but there's all the, there's all the data and there's
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.580]  probably working with data sources and there is driving the cars.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:47.300]  I do wonder sometimes when they say Apple's employees have doubled, how
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:50.660]  much of that is retail and people like driving around cars.
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:51.300]  Right.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.260]  I don't, I don't know.
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:57.460]  And just manually going through the reports that people submit of places
[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:02.100]  and maps and just the grunt work of, oh, that's, that's no longer a
[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.020]  laundromat now that's, that was raised.
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.180]  And now it's a townhouse, you know?
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:07.220]  Exactly.
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:12.020]  But a thousand employees with an average salary of a hundred thousand
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.180]  dollars, that's a hundred million dollars a year.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:17.220]  I mean, and even if it's lower than that as an average, because some of
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:21.220]  them are, are doing more menial tasks and they're not like engineers or
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:26.980]  something, even if you have that to 50,000, you know, that's still 50
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:27.940]  million dollars a year.
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.140]  That's a significant investment.
[02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:32.660]  And I think it's exactly an example of, again, one of my favorite parts
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:39.620]  of the story, um, it is exactly the, under Tim Cook, Apple is an industry
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:43.540]  behemoth that can do something like create a thousand person mapping
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.260]  division.
[02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:49.700]  Whereas the Apple of, you know, when, when they unveiled the maps and
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:53.380]  Steve Jobs was the CEO was, I don't even know if they considered a big
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:55.540]  team, like every, every team at Apple is a small team.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:58.100]  That's just, that was the Apple way of doing things.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:02.420]  Um, and I don't want it to come across that like, you know, like,
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:05.460]  that like, Oh, Apple is spending money like a drunken sailor now.
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.420]  Cause that's not the case.
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:10.260]  In fact, I know for a fact that Apple still, I think, I think Tim Cook,
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:14.260]  this is one of the ways that we're Tim Cook and Steve jobs really were
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:19.700]  similar, um, in their, in their disposition is that it hurts them to
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:21.300]  spend money and hire lots of people.
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:23.060]  Like they don't, they don't, they don't want to do it.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:27.620]  Apple is not managed as, as if they had more than a hundred billion
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.340]  dollars in the bank, even though they do as if they weren't generating
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:34.340]  seven, eight, nine billion dollars in profit every single quarter.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:34.740]  Right.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:35.780]  They're not managed like that.
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.740]  They, every hire is scrutinized every team.
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.940]  There's always question like, does this team need to be any bigger?
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.580]  It's true.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:45.940]  So that's why it makes this map thing such a big step for them to be
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:49.460]  like, you know, if we think this is what we need to do or the car thing,
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:52.260]  potentially, if we're going to do it, we have to do it.
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:56.580]  And that means hiring lots of people and spending lots of money because
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:58.180]  we're not a small company anymore.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:00.980]  We are a company that has huge revenues and huge profits.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.100]  And if we want to, if we want to stay that way, we have to spend money.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:08.260]  I think that institutionally, I know, I know from the various friends I
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:12.580]  have worked there and acquaintances that the people at Apple, and this
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:16.260]  came from Steve Jobs and it's one of those things that quote unquote is
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.540]  instilled in the company's DNA.
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.420]  They are deathly afraid of making bad hires.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:24.580]  And not in terms of talent, although that's part of it, but just in terms
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:26.900]  of whether people get the Apple way.
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:30.820]  And that, you know, that, that there's nothing that would sink the company
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:36.740]  faster than, than, you know, polluting it with, with bad hires, bozos.
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.380]  Bozos.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:38.020]  That's right.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:42.100]  And the same, same goes for if you speed hire, if you hire a lot of people,
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:44.580]  if you staff up really quickly, the danger there is that some percentage
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:46.340]  of those people are going to be bozos.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:49.460]  And, and that's why Apple's teams have traditionally been so small.
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:51.060]  They are so careful about it.
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:51.700]  They are run.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.900]  I think it's not, you know, Apple's near death experience and, and, and the,
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:02.100]  the discipline of the way the culture changed when Steve came back and they,
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:04.500]  they got away from that near death experience.
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:06.660]  It informs the culture to this day.
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:08.340]  I think they have to fight when they do things like this.
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.780]  They have to fight against it because it is a different place that they're in
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.020]  now.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:17.140]  But I see that, you know, my dad grew up in the depression and he lived his
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:22.020]  entire life being incredibly concerned about what money was being spent on
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:22.980]  what and all of that.
[02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:26.740]  And, and reusing things and fixing broken things that most people would just
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.700]  throw out because he had that experience in the great depression.
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.340]  And I feel like Apple has that in their culture too.
[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:33.940]  Like we almost went out of business.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:37.300]  And so we're going to be really careful about every dollar we spend,
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:40.020]  even though we've got a hundred billion in a mattress somewhere.
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:43.460]  I think that the debut of Apple maps is one of the greatest stories that's
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.740]  really never been told.
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:46.020]  You know, from what I know,
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:49.540]  I know more than what was in the story, but it's, it's like,
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.420]  nobody really has it.
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:54.740]  And part of the reason nobody has it is that Scott Forstall has never broken
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.060]  his silence, even off the record.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:04:03.060]  Like he stood to this date has never said a goddamn thing about anything.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:06.500]  He's other than that, when he popped up, when he was producing that play on
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:10.900]  Broadway, which had nothing to do with Apple, but he's never leaked a damn word,
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:13.860]  you know, about his time at Apple.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:16.740]  And my understanding, and again, this isn't,
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:19.540]  it was not from a source that I could ever say.
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:22.100]  I feel like I can podcast it, but I can't write it.
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:24.740]  But I spoke to someone at Apple, not high up.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:28.500]  It was just like run of the mill person who worked at Apple,
[02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:33.780]  but was in management and said that the word on the street in,
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.900]  in, in Apple was that he had a two-year,
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:41.140]  you know, you can't talk clause.
[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:43.940]  That gardening leave kind of thing where they're paying, they're paying him.
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:45.060]  And he doesn't say anything.
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:46.660]  And that's part of his severance or whatever.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.100]  That it was a very simple deal.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:50.420]  It was a dump truck full of cash.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:54.580]  And, and you keep your mouth shut for two years.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:55.380]  And that was it.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:58.500]  But even if that's off by a year or two, it's expired.
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:01.860]  I, you know, I mean, it's possible, it's possible.
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.020]  Keep your mouth shut about Apple forever.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.140]  But you can talk about, yeah, I don't know.
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:08.180]  That's unlikely though.
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:08.820]  You know what I mean?
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:12.100]  It's, it just seems like those packages are usually, and I think it's by choice.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:14.580]  I think it just, you know, it's, that's the, you know,
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:18.500]  unsurprising that someone who is so successful under Steve Jobs
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:20.660]  for his entire career and within Apple,
[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:25.780]  would it be of the nature to keep his mouth shut even afterwards?
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:26.100]  Right.
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:27.940]  It's how do you, how do you fill a company?
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:30.420]  You know, how do you, how does the company keep its mouth shut collectively
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:32.740]  by hiring people who keep their mouth shut?
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:33.060]  Right.
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:36.660]  So my impression, my impression too, is that, is that maps may have been
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.820]  the precipitating factor for him to be kicked out, but that, that, you know,
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:44.180]  if this was the one mistake he had made, that he would still be there.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:47.780]  That was not, this was the precipitation, not the, not the crime.
[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:50.900]  But anyway, all of that is to say though, that nobody could write the definitive
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:55.940]  thing on maps unless they could get, get forestall to open up, because otherwise
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:06:00.660]  it's all one-sided, you know, and there is a sort of throw forestall under the bus nature
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:03.460]  to it, but that is my understanding of actually what happened.
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:08.820]  The gist of it, like, I don't even know how, part of it that doesn't get talked about is
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:13.620]  the whole negotiations with Google aspect where their, their agreement with Google to
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:16.660]  use Google Maps and iOS was running out and needed to be renewed.
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:19.700]  And so Google and Google knew that.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.260]  Apple wanted vector maps.
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.860]  You remember at the time they only had the bitmap maps, so they wanted vector maps
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.620]  and they wanted turn by turn directions.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:33.620]  And Google was holding this over them in exchange for allowing Google to get more user
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:38.180]  identifiable data, like get people to sign into their Google account and then using the
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:43.780]  built-in maps in iOS, Google would have, you know, information about you, you know, all
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:47.220]  of your location searches and stuff like that, which Apple didn't want to give them.
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:53.540]  And so Apple, because of this, sort of knew that they had to switch to Apple Maps ready,
[02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:56.660]  as ready, you know, make it as good as it can, but we need to switch now because it
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:01.140]  but we need to switch now because our contract is up and we're at an impasse with Google
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:05.380]  over getting an extension to use their stuff and to get the stuff that we need, like turn
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:06.660]  by turn and stuff like that.
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:10.740]  So it wasn't like Apple collectively thought Apple Maps was just fine.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.580]  They knew that it was going to be a step backwards.
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:19.860]  But from what I've heard this from multiple people, but that effectively what, what Eddy
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:26.340]  Q said is very true that at a senior executive level, what they saw firsthand using the betas
[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:27.380]  was pretty good.
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:28.260]  Yeah.
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:29.540]  It really is pretty good.
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:32.020]  And I know depending on where you are as a listener of the show, you really might not
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:35.940]  believe it, but really right from the get-go in the Bay Area, it was pretty good.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.620]  I mean, you live there, right?
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:41.220]  I live there and, and people to this day, people will be like, I can't believe you use
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:41.700]  Apple Maps.
[02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.420]  I'm like, well, I live, I live an hour from Apple.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.620]  The maps here are pretty good.
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.180]  That was never a question.
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:50.340]  It's everywhere else in the world that it's a question.
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:55.140]  And, you know, this is, you know, obviously this is a very complex story, but long story
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:59.540]  short, they, what they saw firsthand with the betas was pretty good for stall to, you
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:03.940]  know, gave them an impression of how good they were worldwide, which was, you know,
[02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:08.180]  raise your hand up to here when in fact it was way lower, like forestall did.
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:10.260]  And again, this is not forestall side of the story.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:11.380]  This is what I've heard.
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:16.340]  But that forestall led them to believe that the rest of the data was better than it is
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:20.100]  not as good as Google, not as good as it needed to be, but that it was better than it would
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:26.340]  be and that what further infuriated the rest of the executive team was the amount of time
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:31.220]  that forestall and his had his team spend on the fancy pants flyover stuff.
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:32.340]  Right.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.700]  Remember when they first demoed up?
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:38.820]  Oh, yeah, the most enforced all did the demo, you know, and, and as Apple does, you know,
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:42.260]  who, you know, whoever worked on it and let it is the one who does the demo.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.260]  It wasn't just like you're randomly assigned to do it.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:48.260]  It's like forestall spent personally spent a lot of time overseeing Apple Maps and they
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:52.260]  spent almost all of his time on stage demoing the fancy pants flyover stuff.
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:58.500]  And that what I've heard is that the amount of time he spent in the demo on the fancy
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:02.020]  pants stuff was commensurate with the amount of time his engineering team had spent working
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:02.420]  on that.
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:08.660]  And there was, you know, a, you know, anger that, hey, we wasted all this time on this
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:12.980]  flyover stuff and you people, you know, can't even get a direction from their home to their
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:13.540]  office.
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:19.300]  It does, you know, people, people are being told to drive, you know, into a brick wall.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.660]  And then I have no idea.
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:22.740]  The other thing that, you know, it's widely reported.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:23.620]  I can't verify it.
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:28.900]  I don't have first, you know, unless you get Tim Cook or forestall to go on the record.
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:31.300]  I don't know how you, how you'd get it on the record.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.220]  But there's that whole story that about the apology letter that Tim Cook ended up signing
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:41.540]  himself and that supposedly either forestall was supposed to sign it or he was supposed
[02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:43.860]  to co-sign it with Cook and refused.
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:48.660]  And if that's true, I've always thought this, assuming that that's true, that he was, you
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:52.820]  know, Cook wanted him to either sign it himself instead of him or co-sign it with him.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:56.420]  And knowing Tim Cook, I wouldn't be surprised if it was co-signed because it doesn't seem
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.740]  he seems to me like I know the buck stops here.
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:08.580]  But when the CEO asks you to sign a letter apologizing for something, your only choices
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:10.180]  are to sign it or to quit.
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:11.220]  Yeah.
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:16.020]  Like the fact that Scott forestall seemingly, you know, and I've also heard that he was
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:19.060]  taken by surprise by his eventual ouster later that year.
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.420]  And I've never heard anything to the contrary on that.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:28.820]  It's shocking to me that he thought that he was like an indispensable man, you know, and
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:34.020]  I think, you know, his years, you know, working under Steve Jobs maybe misled him as to his
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:37.860]  political stature within the company because there's, I don't see how you, you know, when
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:42.900]  the CEO says, sign an apology, you can't say no and expect to keep your job.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.340]  No, that, that seems pretty fundamental, right?
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:49.540]  That, that at that point you need to own up to this.
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:52.420]  And even if it's just like, look, we need to make a message here.
[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:56.900]  We need to, we need to explain to the customers that we hear them and it's almost defiant
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.020]  of like, no, it's fine.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:01.220]  Or, you know, denial or whatever it is.
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:06.660]  Um, but yeah, to be at that point also you could, you could argue that maybe that is,
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:11.300]  that is enough stuff had built up with him that maybe this was a like, look, you're
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.020]  going to do this.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:13.940]  This is, this is your mess.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:14.820]  You're going to clean it up.
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:21.060]  And if you refuse that, it's like, okay, I guess there's no way forward from that.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:24.420]  There's that, that's a symptom of a, of a bigger problem.
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:24.660]  Right.
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:28.020]  And that, and the only way out apparently was to have him leave.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:33.780]  Um, anyway, I thought, so it was about as interesting and on the record take of that
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.420]  as I've seen.
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:40.340]  Um, yeah, I, I loved, I loved just the line from Q that, um, that, uh, it was good here
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.940]  and we lost perspective.
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:45.460]  And that's one of the reasons we do public betas now is because we want more perspective.
[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.180]  And that's, that was really, that was really good.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.780]  Um, that was a, that was a, that was a good thing to hear, even though we all kind of
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.620]  expected that it was good.
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:57.220]  It was good to hear that they, they have, you know, they've, they've learned it and
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:00.740]  internalized it and change what they've done because of that lesson that they had to, you
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:01.860]  know, they got beat up for.
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:06.100]  And overall, I really think Ted Sally painted an accurate picture of Apple as it currently
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:11.380]  is the big giant company that they've, you know, that their success inevitably led them
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:16.580]  to be and, and, you know, why it means that they can't really be quote unquote doomed.
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:18.660]  I agree.
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:20.340]  It's a, I think it's a good story.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:24.980]  Um, yeah, my, my quibbles about it are, are, yeah, are, are a lot of kind of just the art
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:30.340]  of it that I feel like he, he seems, I don't know, I'm not a big fan usually of the stories
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:35.460]  that take 500 words to paint a picture of the smell of the, of the, of the food at the
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.860]  restaurant where the interview is being conducted.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.860]  I don't, unless, unless you're gay to lease.
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:40.180]  Right.
[02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:42.340]  And Mr. Sinatra has a cold.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.780]  Um, that's what I liked.
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.340]  It's, that's exactly, that's exactly what he's going for.
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:46.740]  Right.
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:47.060]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:48.020]  And it, it is.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:50.900]  And, and if you like that sort of thing, then I think that, that it'll work for you.
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:56.420]  It was nevermind really my cup of tea, but, but the fact is that the, the, the Apple executives
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:00.980]  he talked to were forthcoming about things in a way that is not something we see very
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:01.220]  often.
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:01.460]  Man.
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:04.020]  How about that picture of, uh, uh, Federighi?
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.420]  Man, what a handsome son of a bitch.
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.700]  He's blue stealing it there.
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:10.820]  That is total.
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:12.020]  He's going to be, uh, yeah.
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:13.140]  Future is a male model.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.180]  I haven't seen any memes with it yet, but it's inevitable.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:21.220]  Somebody sent me one and, and, and I think it was in the context of, please make more
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:26.900]  memes with Craig Federighi's like eyes and what he's, you know, he's staring at you.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:29.460]  He's got, and he's got his hand out on the table with a wedding ring.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.660]  So it's like, sorry, ladies.
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.100]  The other thing about the story that impressed me and I liked was that I really think it
[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:36.660]  serves the purpose.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:40.580]  I don't know how many people read Fast Company, but for somebody who's not as in tune to Apple
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:45.460]  as I try to be, and certainly as you try to be, as a more of a lay person and someone
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:50.260]  who might be prone to think like, Hey, Apple's, you know, I keep hearing bad stuff about Apple.
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.300]  Maybe they're in trouble.
[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:57.700]  I think it was a very good way of, of saying, of putting their recent troubles in context
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:03.060]  of where the company really is, that this is a very good company that continues to thrive,
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:08.180]  that has suffered some recent hiccups, that it is not a company that is in turmoil.
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.340]  And if anything, they're more stable than ever.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:12.020]  I agree.
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:19.140]  I mean, I could even argue that the, that the, the article gives too much voice to the,
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:24.260]  you know, the other side of these sort of, by discussing some of these really dumb arguments
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:30.100]  about Apple, that they're giving it too much credence at some point.
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:35.060]  But I did appreciate that, that he takes the time to bat them all, bat them all down and
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:38.580]  say, these are ridiculous arguments and yeah, you might read about it at Fortune, but that
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:39.460]  doesn't mean that it's real.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:43.380]  And I think for a, for a, an audience, a broader audience that, that doesn't read the McElope
[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.740]  or anything like that, right?
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:48.900]  They're, they're going to go, come out away from this thinking, oh, I see now, I understand
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:53.540]  more about what Apple's trying to do and not that they're, they're, you know, their sales
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:55.940]  are plummeting and it's a disaster and they're doomed.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.620]  And, and I, I value that story for doing it and being so nuanced about it.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:01.140]  I know you got to go.
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:03.060]  I know that we've been going on a long time.
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:05.620]  Just briefly, have you, have you been watching the Olympics?
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:08.900]  Yeah, I've been, I've been, I've been trying to.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:13.620]  I mean, it's not humanly possible to watch the Olympics in all its places.
[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:17.300]  Cause there's like 6,000, it would take a human being who didn't sleep like eight months
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:20.900]  to watch all the Olympics stuff that's being made available on TV.
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:26.020]  And I've had the, I've had the prime time NBC on, um, in, in the evening, we haven't
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:27.540]  been watching a lot of other TV instead.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:31.300]  We've been, you know, kind of having that on while we're looking at stuff on the internet
[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:34.180]  and sort of tuning, you know, swimming and volleyball and whatever.
[02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:38.740]  And then I've done some stuff with the, with the Apple TV streams and with, uh, on my iPad.
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:42.820]  Too, a little bit, which is the great thing about having everything available on video,
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:46.980]  on the iPad or the Apple TV or, or on the web is you can pick a.
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:53.700]  A sport, like if you want to see table tennis or rugby or whatever, you know, they, some
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:58.660]  of those may be on cable, but all of them have a feed on the internet.
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:02.020]  I just can't help, but think that the app is so bad.
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:07.540]  It's so comically bad that I really can't help, but think that it was designed by people
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:09.380]  who really want you to watch on regular TV.
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:11.620]  That's pretty good.
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:15.940]  Give it, given the fact that literally every item on the Apple TV says Olympic sports,
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:20.980]  like that's their level one header of every single item is Olympic sports.
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:25.380]  So you've got like 20 items that just say Olympic sports instead of what the sport is.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:26.100]  It's like, what?
[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.020]  I don't even know what I really can't.
[02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:29.060]  It's not a new feature.
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:33.860]  I really can't believe that the iPad app doesn't support split screen view or the picture in
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:34.500]  picture.
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:34.740]  Yeah.
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:38.980]  Well, I'd say I'm a, I watch soccer, I watch like English premier league soccer and they
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:40.580]  have all those games on there too.
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:43.700]  And it's, it's been like this, I think it's cause they're doing a custom video player
[02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:47.940]  so that they can do their ad insertions and they want to stick a batter, a banner ad on
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:50.260]  the screen next to their video and stuff like that.
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:54.020]  So they're, they're basically motivated to not do picture in picture.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:57.620]  And it drives me crazy because what I want to do is pop it in picture in picture and
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:01.140]  do other stuff on the iPad, which is the whole point of the feature.
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:04.980]  And it was exactly, I wanted to watch the U S men play Australia.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:06.900]  It was a good basketball game yesterday.
[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:08.420]  And I thought this is a perfect reason.
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:10.580]  I'm going to be like the kids today.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:15.780]  I'm going to work on my iPad and this will be great except it doesn't support any of
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:16.740]  those features.
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:17.300]  Nope.
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:18.820]  Oh, it makes you crazy.
[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:19.060]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.700]  It's I think, you know, they've come a long way from the, you know, from the pay-per-view
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.980]  triple cast and all of that.
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:29.780]  And, and I feel like Comcast actually, now that they're running the show at NBC, they're
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.460]  more, they're more open.
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.100]  Like they're running.
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:35.540]  I don't know if you noticed this, they're actually running sports in prime time on cable
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.060]  channels, which they used to not do.
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:40.180]  Like when it was on in prime time on NBC, everything else went dark.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.380]  It's like everybody very quiet.
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:45.540]  Now we're going to watch Bob Costas and, and they're playing with that now.
[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:48.820]  And they've got this gold zone channel, which is like the NFL red zone, where you can
[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:52.820]  theoretically just turn it on and it will just whip you around to all of the different
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:57.060]  venues and show you different stuff that's going on live, which is a really cool idea.
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:02.340]  So I feel like in the end, maybe the Olympics is going to be best when it's completely
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:08.420]  non-linear and that all the only thing that we have that's linear is a best of the day
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:11.060]  recap, which is the three hours in NBC prime time.
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.740]  I think that may be the ultimate destination of the Olympics.
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:18.340]  And it, I think it was obvious that that was the ultimate destination maybe like 12 years
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:23.460]  ago, but it it's taken till now for maybe for Comcast and NBC to realize it's the obvious
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:24.020]  destination.
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:28.260]  It, it's just so frustrating because it's obviously not for a lack of money.
[02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:31.940]  This is a multi-billion dollar operation.
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:35.620]  So it, and, and it just screams for it.
[02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:40.260]  It is like in the old days before the internet, it trying to cover all of these sports from
[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:43.620]  all of these countries on a TV channel.
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:44.660]  It was impossible.
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:46.580]  Whereas the internet, this is the perfect solution.
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:51.700]  You can watch your favorite sport and you can see your country, you know, it it's so
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:52.340]  poorly done.
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.100]  Oh, it makes me frustrated.
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:57.620]  I feel like I'm actually a little optimistic now because I feel like they've got the pieces
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:01.540]  in place now and that maybe they even realize where they're, where, where they need to head
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:03.300]  ultimately, they're always going to be issues.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.260]  People get frustrated by it.
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:06.420]  It's like they, they spend billions of dollars for this.
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:10.260]  So they're going to be ads and they're going to have stuff that's behind a cable login
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:11.460]  because it's Comcast.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.740]  They spent a lot of money.
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:14.980]  They're going to get their money back one way or another.
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:16.580]  They're going to get, they're going to make their money back.
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:21.780]  But I feel like now they are headed in the right direction where this could actually
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:26.420]  be good maybe in two or four years where they like fully embrace the internet, especially
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:27.140]  if there's an Olympics.
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:30.660]  I don't know what the next Olympics is, but when, when there's one that's completely off
[02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:34.900]  time zones from the United States, I feel like, I feel like then they're really going
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:38.740]  to be able to embrace it because they're going to have to because you know, nobody's going
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:42.180]  to, nobody's going to want to, the prime time stuff's going to be not live at all.
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:44.340]  Well, it's going back to China soon, so maybe then.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:48.660]  Anyway, I will say one good thing about being a Comcast customer.
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:53.620]  And I think, I think this is what happened when I did authenticate with the app for my
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:54.340]  cable subscription.
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:56.500]  I didn't have to sign in with a username or password.
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:00.100]  I think that Comcast somehow figured out, you know, that I'm, you know, they could tell
[02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:02.100]  I'm on a Comcast network and they're like, good enough.
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:03.780]  Yeah, yeah, me too.
[02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:07.140]  And that was, that was good because sometimes the authentication thing is the, is the most
[02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.780]  broken, especially at high, at high times where everybody's trying to log in, those
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:12.740]  things tend to break.
[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:16.660]  So I think, yeah, it looks and says you're on a Comcast IP.
[02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:17.140]  Good enough.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.780]  Uh, Hey, I want to say congratulations.
[02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:22.180]  You, your, uh, upgrade podcast.
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.620]  I've, the one I just mentioned listening to is episode one Oh one, you guys hit a hundred
[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:27.620]  episodes on upgrade you and Mike Hurley.
[02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:32.900]  So that means two years you've been, uh, going indie and in binary.
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:34.340]  What is one zero one?
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.340]  Uh, it's five, it's five.
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:37.860]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:40.100]  I'm yeah, I'm really bad.
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:41.620]  I'm really, I could work it out.
[02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:41.940]  Right.
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:44.580]  Like one and then one zero is, and I was like, Oh yeah, that's five.
[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:44.900]  Okay.
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:45.300]  Got it.
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:46.180]  But no, thank you.
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:51.060]  Um, yeah, it's coming up, you do a podcast every, every week and it totals up to it's
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:55.300]  almost the reason I know that September 9th is when they did the event, uh, not just last
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:59.140]  year, but the year before is because that was basically my last day at Mac world was
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:02.660]  September 9th, uh, of, uh, 14.
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:07.780]  So it's been almost, almost two years now of, of doing this, which is, it's been great.
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:12.820]  Like, you know, I, I think I've said this before, but you are obviously an inspiration
[02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:16.340]  for me to go out and try to do this on my own.
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:20.020]  And I ha I've got, you know, I've got two kids that are going to be headed off to college
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:20.980]  in the next few years.
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:24.340]  And I live in the Bay area, which is very expensive place to live.
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:29.380]  And my wife doesn't have a full-time job and it was very stressful, but we have managed
[02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:30.980]  to make it work, uh, for two years.
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:35.700]  And my wife was just saying to me the other day, um, you know, I, I was very much in the
[02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:37.140]  let's give it six months mode.
[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:41.620]  She said when we started this and now she's kind of out of that mode and like, it's working,
[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:42.260]  which is great.
[02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:44.100]  And, you know, you never know what's going to happen.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:48.260]  And you, you know, better than anyone, you got to watch everything and keep in mind,
[02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:49.940]  like, what if this happens and what if that happens?
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:53.940]  But it's been great that I've been able to actually live my life and do stuff that I
[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:57.220]  love, which I kind of wasn't doing at the end at my old job.
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:58.900]  I know that feeling.
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:00.340]  Um, yeah, you got it.
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:04.420]  You know, I, I, when I went full-time on during Fireball, I, I don't even think I was doing
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:05.220]  a podcast yet.
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:10.980]  And if it, if I was those, like the whole first run of that show with Dan Benjamin,
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:12.740]  we didn't, we never had a single sponsor.
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:16.820]  We did, we kind of put some feelers out and people were like podcasts.
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:18.660]  So we just say, well, let's, we'll just do it for fun.
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:19.460]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:24.020]  I mean, literally, I guess we lost money on the show because, you know, we, you know,
[02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:29.860]  whatever we paid for web hosting and, and I think like Amazon storage, you know, I never,
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:34.500]  when I went full-time on during Fireball, the idea that I'd be 50% of my income would
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.220]  be from podcasting wasn't even, I didn't even think it was possible.
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:38.980]  I didn't even think I was good at it.
[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:44.500]  I don't, not sure I am, but it's, well, nobody knows what makes a good podcast.
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:45.940]  Even now they don't, but you're right.
[02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:52.340]  I didn't even, I mean, even two years ago, I didn't, when I left, all of my calculations
[02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:59.620]  were, can I, can I do a site that became six colors and can I do freelance writing and
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:02.340]  can I make that work even then?
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:05.940]  And maybe a little from the incomparable, but even then I wasn't really counting on
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:10.420]  what if I did some other podcasts with Relay and throw those into the pot.
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:15.380]  And now, yeah, it's, it's a, I don't know if it's 50-50, but it's certainly a huge
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:15.700]  part.
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:21.060]  If I stopped podcasting, I would not be able to speak with as much confidence about making
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.860]  it work as I can because I'm also doing podcasting.
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:24.360]  Yeah.
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:25.700]  My thanks also.
[02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:26.420]  So my thanks to you.
[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:27.460]  Upgrade.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:29.940]  People can just, just Google for upgrade.
[02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:30.980]  Relay.fm.
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:32.580]  Relay.fm and you'll find it there.
[02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:34.020]  And there's a whole bunch of other podcasts.
[02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:37.620]  And of course you've got like 30 podcasts at the incomparable.
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:38.740]  And yeah, there's a lot of them.
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:41.700]  I'm not on most of them thankfully, but yes, there are a lot of them there.
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:43.700]  And the, you know, home base, let's face it.
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:45.940]  I don't care how much time we spend podcasting.
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:48.900]  We're writers and do your writing primarily.

[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:00.660]  Yeah.
[02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:02.180]  You put the U in there, it redirects.
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.820]  Uh, my thanks also to our three sponsors today.
