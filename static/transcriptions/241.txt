[00:00.000 --> 00:04.440]  It's been too long since you've been on the show Joanna. It really has been way too long
[00:04.440 --> 00:09.980]  I've even heard your voice and not on the show. Yeah, what about this show? Oh, that's the nice of you to say
[00:10.000 --> 00:16.400]  Yeah, I don't think we've bumped into each other the last few Apple shindigs or if we have bumped into each other at
[00:17.640 --> 00:20.980]  The one in Brooklyn. Yeah, it was too cold, right?
[00:21.160 --> 00:25.120]  It was are you waiting in line to go look at the MacBook Air and I was like
[00:25.120 --> 00:30.840]  I don't care enough to wait in this line, right? You and David Pierce were like, we're out of here. Yeah
[00:31.200 --> 00:34.680]  we'll see this thing tomorrow when we get a review unit and then
[00:35.360 --> 00:38.640]  We did have a great conversation which has like I still have this on my list
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.740]  But it sparked a great thought for me to do. I want to do an investigative piece on Apple watch bands
[00:45.120 --> 00:51.160]  Hmm to real investigative piece because remember we were you were standing with panzerino and we were taught I was like
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.040]  I got this watch band. It's the the Milanese watch band, right?
[00:55.280 --> 00:56.280]  Because what have you said?
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.680]  Oh, I like that watch band the I like that you have the Milanese watch band or whatever and I was like
[01:00.680 --> 01:07.600]  It's it's I don't want to tell anyone here, but it's a $10 version on from Amazon and me and panzerino
[01:07.600 --> 01:13.760]  We're standing there doing comparison between the legit Milanese band and mine to see if it had the little finger
[01:14.320 --> 01:17.800]  The little you know indent if it has the little finger
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.360]  The fingernail to get them to get the magnetic clasp off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:23.960 --> 01:25.600]  You don't remember this. Yes, I do
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.400]  No, I do remember because I remember that it left a lasting impact on me clearly not as much on you
[01:30.400 --> 01:31.040]  But no, no
[01:31.040 --> 01:37.400]  I remember vividly because it looked it we really had to look very hard to find differences like it is it
[01:37.680 --> 01:42.680]  It wasn't you know, the fact that it was only ten dollars is rather remarkable because it really did look
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.360]  The same I mean, yeah, it's so right here. I love this thing and and
[01:47.880 --> 01:54.840]  The the biggest problem I have with it now and I I need to get the other Milanese band to see the comparisons
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.400]  This is my investigative piece. Is that the magnet really sticks to the MacBook Air?
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.360]  hmm, and so when I'm typing the I have to take off the watch because my
[02:04.880 --> 02:08.600]  Wrist is like stuck to my MacBook. Oh, that's not weird
[02:08.600 --> 02:14.960]  Oh, it's probably because there's magnets in I was like, why would it stick to aluminum?
[02:14.960 --> 02:17.800]  Aluminum isn't magnetic but it's because there's magnets in the MacBook Air
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  Yeah, there's got to be a magnet in like the some sort of magnet in the track, you know in the the palm rest, you know
[02:26.360 --> 02:29.040]  Yeah, they like latch the screen. Yeah
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.160]  basically the $10
[02:32.480 --> 02:34.480]  Amazon band is just as good as the
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.440]  150 dollar one. Yeah, I noticed I noticed a week or two at
[02:39.720 --> 02:45.520]  Target they have they just call them target. They don't give them a new name, but there's these mini targets here in Philadelphia
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.160]  there's a couple of them here in Center City Philadelphia right in the middle of the city and they're nowhere near as big as like a
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.000]  suburban target, but they're really nice to have in the city because they're
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.000]  You know pretty big for a store right here in the Center City and I noticed up in the electronics section
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.560]  that
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.600]  I get a total end cap was devoted to I'm guessing its targets in-house brand
[03:08.600 --> 03:09.440]  I forget what it's called
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.760]  But like in that they're in-house brand of Apple watch bands and it was I there might have been something for like a Fitbit or something
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.960]  You know, I don't know there might have been almost all Apple watch. Yeah
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.080]  And some of them look pretty cool. I mean, yeah, that's it
[03:25.040 --> 03:27.040]  It's a big thing these third-party
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.720]  watch bands that are considered considerably less expensive than the ones you can get from Adable and work just as well and something like
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.240]  Some of them like the styles are they're clearly different, right?
[03:36.240 --> 03:39.320]  Like they're trying to go after like you can't get this at Apple so you can get this
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.080]  What I like, yeah, I consider pretty ugly chain or something. Yeah
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.520]  Yeah, I see a lot of women with like the pink chain one and you know, that's look
[03:48.520 --> 03:51.520]  I'm not gonna judge everyone else's style, but where I am and it's bad
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.720]  Yeah, yeah the ones that was the one thing I found interesting about the target ones, too
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.640]  Is that none of the ones that our target was selling were knockoffs of Apple's own bands?
[04:03.640 --> 04:09.560]  They were all very different in very different ways, you know, like like one of them was, you know
[04:09.560 --> 04:11.560]  clearly like a masculine one like a
[04:13.800 --> 04:20.080]  Like no like a chunky link bracelet, you know, like yeah sells that one that they call the link bracelet
[04:20.080 --> 04:22.720]  but it's sort of sleek and this was more of like a
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.740]  Fossil watch. Yeah, you know like like a traditional chunky sport watch, you know stainless steel
[04:30.740 --> 04:34.080]  Thing, you know, but very different than anything Apple sells and they had
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.680]  the other ones they had were ones with like patterns, you know, like like
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.800]  Yeah, I don't know. I think it's pretty interesting and I think it's just a sign of how many gazillion people have Apple watches now
[04:44.800 --> 04:50.200]  Agreed. Yeah, I see him. I mean, I am always looking out to see the bands that people have
[04:51.480 --> 04:57.560]  But yeah, and I also do like the sly look to see if they have the cellular version. I'm always keeping an eye on that
[05:00.680 --> 05:02.740]  That's an interesting question, you know, it's funny we
[05:03.380 --> 05:07.920]  So Amy and I both have third generation Apple watches, so I didn't get a new one this year
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.600]  But we both got the cellular ones last year and we pay for the cellular. I never use it
[05:13.600 --> 05:20.520]  Can I tell you that it's funny? I'm currently paying for the cellular, but I don't I bought a series four that doesn't have cellular
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.380]  Yes, because my review unit
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.400]  Needed cellular and they're like you need to put it on your account
[05:29.860 --> 05:35.260]  So I did that but then after my review I liked it so much that I bought it myself
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.000]  But I was like, I don't need the cellular. I really don't
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.800]  I hope so. I wanted $10 a month to Verizon, right? Oh, well, we're paying 20, I guess cuz we have two
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.780]  And we never use it
[05:48.780 --> 05:55.700]  I mean, it's just I it is cool and like but I literally only used it when I was
[05:57.280 --> 06:04.600]  Testing it. Yep, and when it gets warmer, you know, I jog when it's warm and then I get lazy and fat all winter long
[06:04.600 --> 06:07.660]  You know, I guess I'll do it
[06:07.660 --> 06:15.120]  But the thing for me was that they didn't have the ability to play podcasts through third-party apps over the watch to air pods
[06:15.480 --> 06:21.120]  Working quite right yet, you know, and I know Marco Arman is working on it with overcast. Like that's my podcast app
[06:21.920 --> 06:28.500]  So like the dream would be for me to be able to go jogging with just the watch and air pods with no
[06:28.500 --> 06:36.220]  phone hmm, like yeah in a goofy I like when I do take it I put it in a goofy fanny pack that I tuck under my
[06:36.220 --> 06:40.020]  You know, I put it under my shirt, but I still feel ridiculous even just knowing it's there
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.380]  So that's my dream and I might so I might use cellular
[06:44.380 --> 06:49.100]  But I feel like if it warms up and that problem still isn't solved the next time I buy a watch
[06:49.100 --> 06:51.100]  I'm not going to get the cellular
[06:51.460 --> 06:58.180]  And yeah, I just like I did retest it and obviously, you know, I had my issues with the series 3 cellular
[06:58.180 --> 07:02.300]  So it's very I know they corrected all of them since my original review of that
[07:02.300 --> 07:06.180]  But so I tested it on the series 4 and I was just like it's not worth the extra money for me
[07:06.180 --> 07:09.240]  Yeah, I just don't I just personally don't know I'm paying for it
[07:13.780 --> 07:18.220]  But actually I had to call Verizon earlier this week and then I asked about that and like oh sorry
[07:18.220 --> 07:22.640]  We need to transfer you to another section and then I was like on hold for 10 minutes and I had another meeting come up
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.640]  So I just hung up on customer service
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.440]  So and cuz I can't cancel it through the Verizon app for some reason. Oh
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.720]  For the reason that you can never do anything
[07:32.280 --> 07:35.000]  Yeah, but that's true. So true, right? They've
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.400]  definitely want you to have to suffer and then maybe give up but before you do anything to
[07:41.960 --> 07:47.240]  To do that and they've accomplished it. Yeah, I had a terrible time. I
[07:48.960 --> 07:53.640]  Have what was my story? I think I've told this on the show before so I'll try to keep it short and I now forget
[07:53.640 --> 07:56.800]  The details but I had an absolutely horrible time
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.280]  getting an
[07:59.280 --> 08:04.000]  Apple watch replaced like I I I think it's this one
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.560]  I have this series 3 like so at some point last year the one that I bought
[08:08.400 --> 08:13.760]  Broke I forget what happened, but it was clearly like a software. It just it just was dead. That's right
[08:13.760 --> 08:16.820]  Hmm, I think I had like a water problem or something
[08:16.820 --> 08:22.680]  I was we were on vacation and I was just in like the pool was literally like
[08:22.680 --> 08:28.880]  It was I was actually talking to my family that the pool wasn't even deep enough for me to feel like I could
[08:29.280 --> 08:32.200]  You know even sit and get wet. It was like a baby pool
[08:33.080 --> 08:35.480]  So I clearly didn't exceed the limit
[08:35.760 --> 08:41.000]  You know the depth limit for the Apple watch and I looked at my Apple watch and it was just black and touching it didn't
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.740]  Do anything and I thought it was cuz my hand was wet
[08:42.740 --> 08:48.600]  But it never turned on again and plugging the charger and even after charging it, right? Right even if you get the snake
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.520]  Did you get the snake thing? No, nothing nothing on screen
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.720]  Mm-hmm, you know, it's just completely dead. I mean and because I was in a pool
[08:55.720 --> 08:59.360]  It's clear that there was some kind of water got in and shorted it out and it was dead
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.720]  I took her store and you know, they had no questions asked replaced it
[09:03.720 --> 09:11.240]  Although the thing that was annoying was that they didn't give me one on the spot like in the Apple store
[09:11.240 --> 09:17.040]  It was like, okay, you know, we you know, we totally agree that this is you know, and it's well within the warranty
[09:17.040 --> 09:22.040]  We'll send you a new one and I had a wait, you know, wait like three days. Yeah, that seems weird
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.680]  It seems like they should just give me one from the back from the store. Yeah, because I could buy one, you know
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.660]  But I guess they don't stock them and and the replacement came in the most adorable little package because all they sent me was the watch
[09:33.660 --> 09:40.760]  Not the bands not the bar and no box right? No, not the traditional long. No, it's the just it's it's a box
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.300]  Just an adorable little box. That's just big enough to hold an Apple watch
[09:44.300 --> 09:49.920]  Um, it's funny that you mentioned the box. Well go on and I'll tell you why well, the problem was that
[09:50.940 --> 09:58.780]  it was like that it was like my phone still remembered my old watch that I had given that's dead and I had given to Apple and
[09:59.500 --> 10:02.580]  I set up the new one and like
[10:03.660 --> 10:09.860]  it's like that whole process of like restoring from a backup with the watch is just crazy to me right and
[10:09.860 --> 10:15.500]  And and and hopefully the one they sent you did have watch OS 5
[10:16.020 --> 10:22.340]  Yeah, but it because that that is one of the most frustrating things I've encountered with Apple in the last year
[10:22.340 --> 10:25.140]  It is trying to update the right a watch OS
[10:25.500 --> 10:31.380]  Full version number is like it can take days right the bottom line of restoring it
[10:31.380 --> 10:34.220]  I forget what I wound up doing if I restored or just set up new
[10:34.220 --> 10:39.380]  I think just setting it up new every time is the better way to go because there's really nothing on the watch that that's worth
[10:39.380 --> 10:40.420]  keeping
[10:40.420 --> 10:45.820]  Activity data should sync right like you could still have that in your iCloud your and it's on our phone
[10:45.820 --> 10:51.020]  Yeah, it's on your phone in your in your history. So, you know, I don't think you need I mean settings, right?
[10:51.220 --> 10:57.120]  You have to re customize your watch faces. Actually, that's true because I just did this too. I got a new iPhone 10r
[10:57.740 --> 11:01.300]  needed to pair it with the watch my watch and
[11:02.340 --> 11:05.100]  Did the same thing and set it up as new and was like, oh, you know
[11:05.100 --> 11:11.260]  I spent so long customizing this watch face with my colors and my little yeah, you know complications. Yeah, and
[11:11.780 --> 11:14.580]  I think it's neat that they give you so many colors, you know
[11:14.580 --> 11:16.420]  Like there's some of these watch faces where it's like, all right
[11:16.420 --> 11:20.460]  You can pick the color of the seconds hand and and it's like a list of like 40 colors
[11:21.260 --> 11:27.180]  It's like the color of the rainbow for the I do the I don't even know the name of it the one that's like I put
[11:27.180 --> 11:33.260]  Something in each corner a complication in each corner and then there's the one in the in the center right at the time in the center
[11:33.260 --> 11:34.500]  but
[11:34.500 --> 11:38.740]  I actually so I did this big massive send back of all my review units and
[11:39.020 --> 11:42.820]  I had a number of watch review units and they just kind of had been sitting here and
[11:42.900 --> 11:47.500]  For those interested the reason I keep a lot of these review units is like I usually try to
[11:47.780 --> 11:53.780]  Test the new version against last year's version even though I don't use the models that are around I buy my own
[11:54.380 --> 11:55.380]  They sit here
[11:55.380 --> 12:00.980]  And so I was packaging up a ton of these Apple watches and I was just thinking like the box is like the most
[12:00.980 --> 12:03.460]  inefficient Apple packaging I think ever
[12:04.780 --> 12:07.700]  Because the phone is so compact you have a small box
[12:07.700 --> 12:12.180]  Yeah, the MacBooks are as compact as they I feel like they can be because you've got the you know
[12:12.180 --> 12:20.320]  The chunky charger below it, but the watch is like the the the box height is like five times the height of the watch
[12:20.460 --> 12:25.100]  Yeah, yeah, that's true. And it's yeah and they ship it long the long way
[12:25.100 --> 12:33.380]  yeah, and I guess that makes sense for certain of the straps like I guess maybe you I don't know the strap is so narrow in
[12:33.380 --> 12:35.380]  The little in in there, right?
[12:35.380 --> 12:41.440]  Like why not ship it sort of like already like rolled up, you know
[12:42.020 --> 12:48.340]  Yeah, the length of the box too is quite long for what you like if it's like it is a giant wrist if you need
[12:48.340 --> 12:54.020]  A that length of a bands. Yeah, you know, it's a different conversation. We should have
[12:54.020 --> 12:57.740]  Yeah, well anyway, here's the thing when I got that replacement watch the biggest problem I had
[12:57.740 --> 13:00.860]  So setting it up the Apple aspect of it was sort of annoying
[13:01.460 --> 13:05.920]  Replacing it and having my phone still think it knew the old watch and I was just like forget about that watch
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.980]  I can't you know and it was like it the phone wants to connect to the old watch to wipe it and it's like it
[13:10.980 --> 13:14.540]  Can't it the phone is dead and I don't even have it anymore or the watch is dead
[13:14.540 --> 13:15.420]  I can't don't even have it anymore
[13:15.420 --> 13:20.380]  Anyway solve that the biggest problem was the new watch wasn't on my cellular account
[13:20.380 --> 13:26.440]  Like it and and I had been told at the Apple Store that down out you just set it up restore it and it'll take
[13:26.440 --> 13:31.440]  Over the the cellular spot that the old one had so I was paying still paying for the old one cellular
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.320]  had a new replacement cellular watch and couldn't do it and I I
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.440]  Spent a long time trying to do it myself on Verizon's website couldn't do it
[13:41.160 --> 13:46.080]  Called them and I got the nicest woman. She was so great
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.760]  She was just a really really nice woman, but I could tell as we were talking to her
[13:50.920 --> 13:52.480]  She understood the problem
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.400]  But I could tell that she was just going through the Verizon website
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.840]  Like as she was describing what she was doing and I was like, I don't think that's gonna work
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.120]  But you know, maybe you'll find something I didn't and I swear I timed it like cuz you know
[14:04.120 --> 14:07.860]  You're the one thing about yeah phones is they tell you how long the call is
[14:07.860 --> 14:14.200]  I was on the phone for like 57 minutes and it wasn't because I was on hold. It was a 57 minute phone call
[14:14.200 --> 14:20.580]  Where you know, she did have to put me on hold eventually and go talk to like, I don't know somebody
[14:21.240 --> 14:28.000]  Else and eventually it got taken care of but it literally took me 57 minutes on the phone with Verizon just to get my replacement
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.540]  Watch to take over the cellular spot that I was already paying for
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.200]  Yeah, I feel like actually that's sometimes more frustrating when you've got someone nice who's trying to help
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.280]  Yeah, doesn't know the answer. She was mean, you know, you're like
[14:41.280 --> 14:48.560]  You try and yeah, like I'm sure many of the listeners to your podcast who feel many times like we feel
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.240]  We're like we know more than you probably
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.440]  Yeah about some of this and that you try not to come off like that
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.600]  And I mean, maybe I'm the only one who tries not to come off that way
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.360]  but I'm like I hear you but maybe you can try this and
[15:03.020 --> 15:07.800]  You just end up feeling like you're gonna you're never gonna get off the phone and your problems never gonna be solved
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.360]  Yeah, so here's another thing I wanted to talk to you about
[15:10.360 --> 15:16.400]  Have you have you used the walkie-talkie feature? I used it when I was testing
[15:16.400 --> 15:17.880]  Yeah, not anymore
[15:17.880 --> 15:24.700]  So Jonas had a series zero Apple watch in other words when the first one that came out we got him
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.340]  And he's worn it and like everything he's taking care of, you know
[15:29.340 --> 15:35.520]  Taking care of it and but it's like it that thing did not get software updates. Yeah. Yeah, it's it
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.600]  Didn't support walkie-talkie. It's all sorts of stuff
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.280]  I don't even know if it got watch OS updates anymore. It doesn't yeah
[15:42.280 --> 15:49.640]  And those things didn't get good battery life to start and four years in he really couldn't get through a day
[15:50.320 --> 15:58.100]  Yeah, but he wore it. He liked it. So for his birthday was last week and we got him a new Apple watch
[15:59.040 --> 16:02.720]  And he was series four. Yes series four
[16:03.200 --> 16:08.360]  Actually got the Nike one because I like the Nike ones just because they come with the extra watch faces
[16:08.360 --> 16:14.560]  The the Nike ones which I think are cool and they're the same price as this regular aluminum ones
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.120]  And if you don't like the Nike stuff, you don't you don't see it, you know
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.360]  There's no Nike logo on the actual watch. If you don't like the Nike strap, you don't have to wear it
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.960]  But that strap is cool. It looks like Swiss cheese. I like those those I like the holes
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.000]  I like the ones with the holes better than the the regular Apple ones that don't have the holes
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  Yeah, if you don't like them swap them out
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.080]  So now he's got a new Apple watch. He was very happy with it
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.760]  but had to decide do we get cellular or not and I thought you know, it's like a hundred bucks more and
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.760]  $10 a month and I just it's not wasn't like I was trying to cheap out on it
[16:47.760 --> 16:49.760]  But I honestly don't think it's worth it
[16:50.320 --> 16:55.960]  Because he's never without his phone like I can't imagine the scenario where I mean
[16:55.960 --> 17:02.520]  I guess theoretically if his phone was stolen or lost, you know, and he still has watch on that might be convenient but it
[17:03.400 --> 17:07.600]  You know, I don't know it just seems like I I I just don't see the use case for it
[17:07.600 --> 17:12.280]  But anyway, now he's got walkie. He's got a watch that supports walkie-talkie. It's so much fun
[17:12.480 --> 17:19.080]  Is he bothering you all the time? No, no, but it's like in school and he's under his desk being like no
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.360]  I haven't come in. I haven't got one from school yet, but I'm waiting for dad come in
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.760]  But it's a really fun feature and
[17:27.240 --> 17:32.640]  We have a house where we're stacked. It's a townhouse and you just can't you know, like from the living room
[17:32.640 --> 17:35.400]  You can't yell to his bedroom and expect him to hear you
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.140]  But being able to walkie-talkie to him that like hey dinners dinner in two minutes
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.000]  It's really super convenient. That's where we have the same situation now
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.040]  We have just working on well on one floor to another floor. I have the Alexa
[17:49.120 --> 17:51.120]  conference set up
[17:51.920 --> 17:52.560]  But yeah
[17:52.560 --> 17:54.680]  I didn't think about the watch and the other
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.840]  The other problem with walkie-talkie and the reason I've only discovered the fun of it
[17:58.840 --> 18:10.560]  Other than just testing that it worked in the review period is that Amy did have? does have a series-3 watch that is walkie-talkie capable and she refused to accept my invitation
[18:11.480 --> 18:13.480]  She's like she doesn't want to be bothered
[18:14.440 --> 18:16.440]  exactly
[18:17.760 --> 18:24.360]  Yeah, I mean it's I mean there's stuff built it right you go back and forth so it like you initiate and then you're connected and
[18:24.360 --> 18:25.240]  You can go back and forth
[18:25.240 --> 18:31.580]  So I guess she couldn't like you couldn't interrupt her during a time where she doesn't even just didn't even want to try it
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.160]  Yeah, I understand. I'm on team Amy
[18:35.760 --> 18:37.760]  Yeah, no, I mean
[18:37.960 --> 18:44.920]  Maybe that's a better solution. It's my wife both where the Apple watch instead of getting another Amazon indirect. Um, yeah
[18:45.760 --> 18:48.880]  It really works well for that feature. I mean I it's
[18:49.800 --> 18:54.600]  It's really fun. I really it I was unconvinced that it wasn't a gimmick
[18:54.600 --> 18:58.920]  You know, I technically I tried it in a work, but I find that it's really cool
[19:00.480 --> 19:06.720]  Yeah, I guess if you're like at a play like a concert or something you like want to keep well a concert be hard
[19:06.720 --> 19:09.000]  Cuz you wouldn't be able to hear it loud. Yeah, or like
[19:09.800 --> 19:12.000]  Yeah, you kind of need to text at a concert
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.320]  But the other thing though that I find myself doing because I do use Siri dictation a lot
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.120]  You know where I'll dictate a text, you know, if I'm especially in the winter, you know
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.780]  What it might have gloves on or something like that. And when I'm talking to Jonas on the walkie-talkie thing, I find myself
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.200]  almost on the cusp of like saying period or
[19:31.720 --> 19:33.720]  question mark
[19:34.600 --> 19:40.880]  Like I'm so used to if I'm talking into my watch I'm I'm I need to spell out the punctuation
[19:41.480 --> 19:47.720]  That's that's actually really funny because it's like I I do I whenever I think to do the text-to-speech
[19:47.720 --> 19:51.200]  I never remember to do the punctuation and
[19:51.760 --> 19:55.880]  Like I because I it's just not part of my like it's not part of my habit
[19:55.880 --> 20:00.520]  And so I'm always like oh crap and I like delete it and then do it again with the punctuation, right?
[20:00.560 --> 20:06.240]  So it's like so ingrained in your muscle memory to do that. It's just not in mine. Yeah
[20:08.360 --> 20:15.160]  All right, maybe I should take a break here before we get really started you have a bunch of stuff to talk about right I
[20:15.160 --> 20:16.560]  I
[20:16.560 --> 20:21.480]  Mean we could talk about whatever you want to talk about. I want to talk about the iPhone 10r. All right
[20:21.480 --> 20:23.560]  well, let's hold on on that and
[20:24.320 --> 20:27.720]  Right now let me tell you about our first sponsor
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.800]  Believe it or not
[20:30.800 --> 20:33.780]  New new new sponsor on the show LinkedIn
[20:34.520 --> 20:38.240]  Whoa, yeah, the right hire can make a huge impact on your business
[20:38.240 --> 20:40.240]  That's why it's so important to find the right person

[21:00.120 --> 21:02.620]  and discover job opportunities LinkedIn

[22:13.580 --> 22:16.420]  Because I just decided to log in to LinkedIn
[22:17.620 --> 22:21.860]  unlike the stat that you provided I don't log in as often as others and
[22:21.860 --> 22:28.140]  I have a lot of people wishing me a happy five-year work anniversary. So
[22:29.380 --> 22:36.080]  Sorry to all of you who wished me this but I didn't respond and likely won't respond. But thank you
[22:36.900 --> 22:39.660]  Five years at the Wall Street Journal. Let's talk about that. I'm yours
[22:40.660 --> 22:43.420]  Sure, what's different now you do a lot more video, right?
[22:44.820 --> 22:50.920]  Yeah, I mean I spent the last year and a half almost two years helping lead our video department
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.620]  which was
[22:52.620 --> 22:54.140]  very
[22:54.140 --> 23:01.220]  Informative about how to how to be a manager. So I did sort of a crash course in management over the last two years
[23:02.980 --> 23:07.700]  But yeah, I mean I spend more time doing my own video and now I'm actually getting back into
[23:08.340 --> 23:11.420]  writing and and making my own videos in a more regular basis because
[23:12.740 --> 23:15.600]  Our video department is running along very smoothly
[23:15.600 --> 23:17.600]  I
[23:18.600 --> 23:20.600]  Was it what's your weekly
[23:21.280 --> 23:26.120]  Output I know you do you try to you get one big sort of column a week
[23:26.240 --> 23:32.440]  It's usually you know, like a review or like a like you were talking before like an investigation into something like no
[23:32.440 --> 23:35.640]  I mean I so before I did my video department gig
[23:35.640 --> 23:42.060]  I became the deputy head of video executive editor a video about two years ago to be two years in March before that
[23:42.060 --> 23:46.920]  I was always I was doing a column once a week and it was at a column in video once a week
[23:46.920 --> 23:50.560]  And that was like it was pretty demanding especially with the video right because the video
[23:51.560 --> 23:55.160]  Takes time to script takes time to shoot edit and then you know
[23:55.440 --> 24:00.360]  Especially lately the ones that I've been doing have been a lot more higher production value and I've been going after some pretty
[24:00.360 --> 24:05.240]  you know crazy stunts in in a way literally stunts with the Apple watch video and
[24:06.400 --> 24:08.000]  So those take a little bit longer
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.160]  But then when I started doing the the video department gig and and more of the management position. I started I moved to
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.380]  About every other week. I published something now
[24:18.560 --> 24:22.800]  Maybe give or take there was a big month the chunk of time or I was
[24:23.040 --> 24:26.080]  I took about six months off from like barely writing at all
[24:26.960 --> 24:28.040]  but now I'm
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.780]  and he I was actually really good period for me because I really started to figure out what I wanted to focus on and how
[24:32.780 --> 24:36.160]  I wanted to broaden out what I what I focus on or write about
[24:36.160 --> 24:40.900]  But you know, the fall is usually Apple stuff. Like it's my year is usually
[24:41.860 --> 24:48.060]  Cover other things in the off season of not covering the big fall gadget season
[24:48.940 --> 24:49.940]  Yeah
[24:49.940 --> 24:51.220]  Yeah
[24:51.220 --> 24:57.180]  Yeah, I don't know. Is that interesting to anyone? No, I think it definitely is I cuz you know, it's I
[24:57.780 --> 24:59.780]  don't think people think about how
[25:00.180 --> 25:03.460]  and they don't they shouldn't they should just you know, see our work and
[25:03.460 --> 25:07.140]  Read what they enjoy but for us on the inside. It is very
[25:08.180 --> 25:15.300]  Cyclical annually, right? And yeah, and and it's even crazier like I was talking to deeter bone about it
[25:15.300 --> 25:17.300]  like it's even crazier for
[25:18.900 --> 25:26.420]  You you you who review stuff outside of Apple but fall just for me reviewing Apple stuff alone is
[25:27.060 --> 25:31.620]  Incredibly, it's crazy. I mean on the other hand and this year for me was crazy, too
[25:31.620 --> 25:38.900]  like I look at me and it actually like I've spoken to some people about this and probably not that publicly but people said to
[25:38.900 --> 25:42.180]  You know, like you really took your reviews in a pretty crazy direction this year
[25:42.180 --> 25:45.940]  Like if you look at the videos I did, you know for the 10 10 s max
[25:45.940 --> 25:53.140]  I got George mirror Sean the big basketball ex basketball player to review it because I was like this thing's giant and I need a
[25:53.140 --> 25:56.420]  Giant to review it and I just was like, let's do that. I
[25:56.420 --> 26:01.940]  the the Apple watch piece I was
[26:01.940 --> 26:07.060]  Ever since they had said on stage like when they said it when Schiller said on stage about the fall detection
[26:07.060 --> 26:09.060]  I think it was Schiller, right?
[26:10.020 --> 26:14.180]  Yeah, I think it was Schiller. I was like I need to test that and best no no no
[26:14.820 --> 26:18.180]  Jeff Williams Jeff Williams. Yeah, you're right. It's Jeff Williams
[26:18.180 --> 26:22.020]  I'm like, I've watched that clip a couple times now or multiple times now and I should remember
[26:22.020 --> 26:25.620]  And I was like, I I need to test that in like a real way
[26:25.620 --> 26:32.340]  And so it took I mean the behind the scenes production of that piece where I got these stunt doubles was weeks in the making
[26:32.340 --> 26:35.620]  Like it was it was especially working in a place like the Wall Street Journal
[26:35.620 --> 26:38.820]  There was a lot of legal things I had to do to make that piece happen
[26:38.820 --> 26:42.020]  And people were just like why did you do these things this year? And I was like frankly
[26:42.020 --> 26:45.460]  I think I was getting a little bit bored of the same thing every year
[26:46.340 --> 26:50.900]  And like, you know, look that goes to actually just the same thing that's probably happening in the smartphone market
[26:50.900 --> 26:52.900]  And in some ways or shape or form like
[26:53.780 --> 27:00.660]  Phones or phones and reviewing them as becoming harder and harder for us to do because a lot of it's not changed
[27:02.180 --> 27:04.740]  But yeah this year this year I pushed myself and
[27:05.380 --> 27:10.020]  There was a couple of weeks where I just was like, I think I'm gonna collapse from exhaustion
[27:10.020 --> 27:13.620]  But in a good way cuz I had so much fun doing all of those pieces
[27:13.620 --> 27:22.680]  Doing all of those pieces literally collapse my fall detection would have gone off if I had collapsed
[27:24.980 --> 27:29.060]  I have heard anecdotally from a few readers who've you know, who've who've
[27:29.620 --> 27:34.020]  You know fallen down a step or two or you know, something like that it it seems to work
[27:34.560 --> 27:40.820]  Remarkably well like with very few false positives and when they've fallen it's actually, you know been helpful
[27:40.820 --> 27:43.700]  You know or accurate at least like hey, are you okay?
[27:44.820 --> 27:48.740]  Yeah, so far so good. Everybody who's told me about this has actually been okay. So
[27:49.780 --> 27:52.660]  yeah, I mean that was like the crazy thing about taking the
[27:53.940 --> 27:59.300]  The leap to do that video was I had to get all these things set up with getting these stunt doubles who are really gonna
[27:59.300 --> 28:01.140]  fall who are really gonna like
[28:01.140 --> 28:02.740]  Take these tumbles
[28:02.740 --> 28:07.940]  And I didn't really know it was gonna work because I had kept trying to test it on my own with fake falls
[28:07.940 --> 28:11.700]  And it wasn't working. Yeah, so it was like I'm putting a pretty
[28:12.340 --> 28:14.420]  expensive bet on this working
[28:15.060 --> 28:19.460]  I mean, I thought like the way I pitched it to my boss was like even if it doesn't work
[28:19.540 --> 28:21.540]  We're still gonna do the story
[28:21.540 --> 28:25.300]  like we'll have these people falling and it doesn't detect it and then we'll have
[28:25.700 --> 28:32.180]  Apple's comment about why it doesn't but as you see in the video it detected it pretty much every time, right?
[28:32.180 --> 28:40.500]  Right and like we like recreated I tried to recreate each of the different trips and falls and slips that they did on stage
[28:41.860 --> 28:43.220]  so
[28:43.220 --> 28:46.420]  I remember talking about it that it was it was interesting because
[28:46.900 --> 28:51.940]  They like as a marketing thing for apple, like it's obviously an interesting feature
[28:52.660 --> 28:55.140]  But how do you show it without showing?
[28:55.700 --> 28:57.360]  things that are
[28:57.360 --> 28:59.780]  Unseemly, right? It's like and you know
[28:59.780 --> 29:05.380]  It everybody has said this every everybody I know immediately after the keynote was thinking about like if you've got
[29:06.180 --> 29:09.140]  Older parents or you know, anybody, you know who's older
[29:09.300 --> 29:15.540]  I mean that's it's a fall that somebody needs medical help for is more likely to happen to somebody who is older
[29:17.460 --> 29:21.220]  But apple didn't show that right it because it's you know
[29:21.860 --> 29:24.820]  Yeah, they don't want to seem to be marketing it that way, right?
[29:24.980 --> 29:28.180]  they want to seem to be like we're marketing at this towards a certain age or
[29:28.180 --> 29:31.460]  Right. And so they showed somebody like on a mountain, you know active
[29:32.020 --> 29:35.300]  Young man on a mountain bike taking a fall or something like that
[29:35.780 --> 29:42.340]  Yeah, they showed they've because I have watched it a number of times. They showed you a foot on a on a stool on a step stool
[29:44.100 --> 29:48.660]  Yeah, I mean but like the crazy thing is like I after testing it so much
[29:48.660 --> 29:55.540]  I was like, I think everyone of all ages should have this thing turned on. Yeah, like it can happen, you know, yeah
[29:55.540 --> 29:57.220]  You know, yeah
[29:57.220 --> 29:59.940]  No, and the other thing too is to demonstrate the different types of falls
[30:00.020 --> 30:05.780]  They switched to like pictograms instead of showing people falling they showed like little cartoon outlines of people
[30:06.580 --> 30:11.060]  Yeah, a little like circular things with people in the center, right? Because yeah
[30:12.260 --> 30:17.460]  It'd be kind of funny if they showed it and it was like a jackass, you know, like the old TV show jackass
[30:17.460 --> 30:24.260]  Is people taking terrible actual they should have done. What I did was get real stunt doubles. I would have solved all the problems
[30:29.220 --> 30:31.220]  Yeah, no, it's
[30:31.460 --> 30:34.340]  No regrets about doing that whole video. It was totally worth it
[30:35.540 --> 30:40.980]  All right. What else do we have to talk about? What were you saying you wanted to talk about after the sponsor break?
[30:40.980 --> 30:47.940]  Well the 10r. Oh, okay. Let's talk about the iphone 10r. So you just got one. I just bought one. Yeah. Yeah
[30:48.660 --> 30:49.620]  Yeah
[30:49.620 --> 30:50.500]  Yeah
[30:50.500 --> 30:55.300]  But I wrote a piece last week or two weeks ago after um, well two things happened one
[30:55.860 --> 30:59.220]  apple revised its its outlook and there was a lot of
[30:59.940 --> 31:04.340]  coverage of that and then the journal had a story right on the heels of that that the
[31:04.340 --> 31:11.460]  10r we didn't use the word flop, but that apple has cut back production and in a big way
[31:12.340 --> 31:15.300]  Apple has missed the mark according to themselves, right?
[31:15.300 --> 31:21.860]  Apple thought that they were going to sell many much more of these phones and they haven't and they and especially in china
[31:21.860 --> 31:28.900]  They thought they would and the the journal scoop was about how they they basically, you know, have cut back production and
[31:28.900 --> 31:35.860]  are disappointed in the sales, especially in china and I read that and like, you know said to my editor
[31:35.860 --> 31:40.580]  Can I write something on this because well one of the editors said do you want to write something on this and I was?
[31:40.900 --> 31:46.180]  Sort of feeling that like I want to write something on this because I think this is the best phone apples made in a really long
[31:46.500 --> 31:51.940]  time and the the narrative about it right now is that it's a flop and I think it's like
[31:52.580 --> 31:55.140]  I bought this phone. I recommend this phone to everyone
[31:55.140 --> 32:01.460]  I gave it a glowing review. Like I want to have a voice in this about why why do I think this is happening?
[32:02.820 --> 32:09.700]  And also like it was around I had gotten like a couple days earlier the marketing email from apple saying you can buy this phone for
[32:10.400 --> 32:14.900]  $450 right and then you read it and you're like, oh, okay because I have to trade in a phone and then it turns out
[32:14.900 --> 32:18.100]  Actually, I can only buy this phone like get $200 off my other phone
[32:19.940 --> 32:21.540]  So, yeah, I like
[32:21.540 --> 32:27.300]  I just I love I love the phone. I do. I want to say I mean, I don't use it. I use the 10s
[32:29.140 --> 32:32.580]  For two reasons I I actually do use the the
[32:32.880 --> 32:38.820]  telephoto camera lens a lot and it was the one thing that in like the two week week or two I spent using the 10r for
[32:38.820 --> 32:44.340]  The review full-time the one thing I missed was i'd see something like out in the street or something
[32:44.340 --> 32:48.500]  I want to take a photo of and i'd go to switch to 2x and it's like oh not there
[32:48.500 --> 32:54.100]  like I just forget I just I but like the main thing is after having after having used the 10s for
[32:54.660 --> 32:57.380]  over a well over a month the 10r didn't feel
[32:58.340 --> 33:04.340]  it it didn't feel like I I I kept thinking the 2x camera was there because
[33:05.540 --> 33:11.300]  It just felt so much like an iphone 10 actually it's you know at that point i'd been using an iphone 10 or 10s for
[33:11.540 --> 33:15.940]  You know over a year. Yeah. Yeah, the 10r completely feels like an iphone 10
[33:15.940 --> 33:23.540]  Um, right. I do use that 2x camera. I think most people don't I anecdotally, you know talking to friends and family like
[33:23.540 --> 33:28.580]  You know, I who have it to iphone 10. I some of them don't even know it has a 2x camera
[33:28.580 --> 33:32.580]  They just you know, they turn on the camera. They point it they shoot and that's it
[33:33.620 --> 33:38.900]  No, look, it's the one thing I miss and that that's where like i'd been using the review unit and I just finally came down
[33:38.900 --> 33:40.900]  and said I need to buy a new phone and
[33:40.900 --> 33:46.180]  The battery life is you know, really the best the best thing about the phone
[33:46.180 --> 33:50.180]  I think the biggest leap apple's made in in battery life in years. Yeah
[33:50.820 --> 33:55.140]  And I was like, I you know, this is what I need like I for me I can go
[33:56.740 --> 33:58.900]  Well, let's see what am I at right now i'm at
[33:59.940 --> 34:01.380]  73
[34:01.380 --> 34:04.180]  I probably actually haven't talked I talk on the phone a lot. So
[34:04.180 --> 34:10.500]  Usually like i'm at like 60 by midday on this thing. I don't think i've talked that much on the phone today
[34:12.660 --> 34:16.500]  But like i'm gonna make every day I make it and have at least
[34:17.220 --> 34:23.060]  15 battery life before i'm going to bed. I mean one thing i'm sure you'll agree on is and i'm like a very heavy user like
[34:23.380 --> 34:26.580]  On twitter. I might on email like all the time
[34:26.580 --> 34:31.140]  Especially if i'm in meetings during the day and I don't want to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to be
[34:31.140 --> 34:35.700]  All the time, especially if i'm in meetings during the day and I don't want to be the person on my laptop, you know, so
[34:36.660 --> 34:40.980]  um, so even on a regular day you're a heavy phone user, but I think you'll agree that while
[34:41.380 --> 34:45.780]  You're writing a review of a phone you use that heck out of it, right?
[34:45.860 --> 34:52.740]  Because you're you know, you're trying to get all of this stuff in you know, there's you know an embargo date that's lifting on monday
[34:53.060 --> 34:57.540]  So you're trying to test the camera you're trying to test this you're you know, you you use the heck out of it
[34:57.540 --> 35:03.940]  You you you're shooting video which is a real battery killer because you want to get video footage to test it and stuff like that
[35:04.340 --> 35:07.940]  When I was testing the 10r it was like I was using it, you know
[35:07.940 --> 35:13.060]  and i'd get to like, you know five o'clock or something like that and then i'd like look at the battery and it would be like
[35:13.620 --> 35:18.500]  70 I was like this is insane. Like I cannot believe this because i've been using this all day like
[35:19.300 --> 35:21.300]  and I do think that
[35:21.300 --> 35:27.300]  that it it's like the battery life is so good on the 10r that it actually I think has
[35:28.020 --> 35:33.300]  Put apple in a marketing quandary where they're actually seem to be saying it more and more
[35:33.620 --> 35:38.420]  In there like as they tweak the 10r message like i've seen yeah
[35:38.420 --> 35:44.260]  I think them I think the marketing around the phone has been horrible. I feel like it's like they don't
[35:45.380 --> 35:47.780]  like it's it's most obvious on the
[35:47.780 --> 35:53.940]  The uh, very excellent in terms of like the idea and helping you make your decision
[35:53.940 --> 36:00.020]  But when you say you go to their compare page for iphones and at the top there's a nice drop down and you can pick
[36:00.740 --> 36:03.720]  Any three iphones that are currently available?
[36:04.340 --> 36:10.820]  You know everything from the 10s max down to the iphone 7 or whatever the you know, the the last one that they're still selling is
[36:11.460 --> 36:12.340]  um
[36:12.340 --> 36:18.900]  And compare them the seven and it gets really weird when you compare the 10s 10s max and 10r
[36:19.060 --> 36:25.860]  The three new ones on battery life because they don't really come out and tell you. Hey the 10r kills on battery life
[36:26.340 --> 36:31.540]  It's like instead of it says like one hour more. I mean I can pull it up. I think it's one hour more on like
[36:32.160 --> 36:34.420]  wireless web and then it's like
[36:35.060 --> 36:38.900]  Or maybe let me just pull it up. It's like there's like a very small delta between
[36:38.900 --> 36:43.540]  No, but they don't even compare them. They stay the same. They don't even compare them to the same things
[36:43.700 --> 36:48.740]  It's like they pull it up and see but it's like as I recall they compare the 10r to like the iphone
[36:49.540 --> 36:54.980]  8 plus and say how much better it is than an iphone 8 plus but the 10s and 10s max
[36:55.060 --> 36:57.060]  They only compare to the iphone 10
[36:58.420 --> 37:04.260]  So they're not even comparing against the same phone the 10s and 10s max get compared against last year's iphone 10
[37:04.660 --> 37:07.860]  And the iphone 10r gets compared against the 8 plus
[37:07.860 --> 37:10.980]  So that they're not even comparing the same thing
[37:11.940 --> 37:13.940]  well, you can do it in the manual like
[37:14.500 --> 37:16.500]  compare drop downs
[37:16.980 --> 37:20.980]  Yeah, but the i'm telling but that's such a weird formulation that they compare, you know
[37:21.060 --> 37:24.100]  You're looking at all three and two of them. You're right. You're totally right
[37:24.180 --> 37:28.660]  It says lasts up to one and a half hours longer than the iphone 8 plus
[37:29.060 --> 37:32.980]  Lasts up to one out one and a half hours longer than the iphone 10
[37:32.980 --> 37:38.260]  But then if you go down and you scroll down it says talk time. Yeah up to 25 hours
[37:38.660 --> 37:42.500]  Up to 25 hours up to 20 hours on the iphone 10s
[37:43.140 --> 37:48.980]  Then it says internet use for the iphone 10r up to 15 hours internet use on the 10s max
[37:49.140 --> 37:54.420]  13 hours internet use on the 10s 12 hours. Yeah, so they do some you know
[37:54.980 --> 37:59.220]  Yeah, but I I think in in practical use it in practical use
[37:59.220 --> 38:06.020]  It's in practical use. It's it these numbers aren't even like ranking, right? I I I really do think that in practice
[38:06.020 --> 38:13.140]  So what's here? Let me just do the math real quickly 15 divided by 13 is 101. So 15 more on
[38:13.780 --> 38:19.700]  On quote in on the internet. I'm telling you anecdotally you get way more than 15 battery life on the 10r
[38:20.420 --> 38:23.380]  It's way. Yeah, I mean that's compared to the max. But yeah, I mean
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.020]  I look I
[38:26.020 --> 38:29.620]  They just and I feel like they don't want to hammer that point home
[38:29.940 --> 38:35.240]  Because they don't want to make the 10s and 10s max which costs so much more look bad in comparison
[38:35.700 --> 38:37.140]  you know that that
[38:37.140 --> 38:43.860]  This the 10r really should be emphasized as the by far the best battery life apple has ever put in an iphone
[38:43.940 --> 38:45.460]  But they don't really want to hammer
[38:45.460 --> 38:50.840]  I feel like they can't bring themselves to hammer that point home because it makes the 10s and 10s max look bad in comparison
[38:51.380 --> 38:54.420]  Yeah, so when I was writing this piece about why I don't think the 10r is done as well
[38:54.420 --> 38:56.980]  I mean one of the reasons I think is that the 10r
[38:57.860 --> 39:01.380]  As I said the piece the 10s and the 10x max, you know that to me
[39:02.020 --> 39:07.540]  The higher end people who early adopters people have the money they bought those right? They're like, oh, this is the best iphone
[39:07.540 --> 39:10.660]  I can get right that's where I actually like will argue
[39:10.660 --> 39:14.660]  I don't think it's the best iphone you can get I think the 10r is the best iphone you can get but apple like
[39:14.660 --> 39:20.900]  It makes sense. That's a more expensive phone better screen better, you know, slightly better camera with the extra lens, whatever
[39:20.900 --> 39:27.540]  the 10r like then has they have to make the argument that the 10r is this like middle better middle case scenario that
[39:28.100 --> 39:34.340]  You know is less expensive than the higher end but not as expensive or not as cheap not as
[39:34.900 --> 39:39.780]  Affordable or cheap as the iphone 7 and iphone 8 so it's like this weird middle child
[39:40.260 --> 39:45.060]  And it doesn't they don't do a great job of marketing why you'd want that one like the best
[39:45.380 --> 39:50.020]  The best thing they seem to have come up with is colors and it's like that's not the answer, right?
[39:50.020 --> 39:52.980]  The answer right the the marketing is that it's more fun
[39:53.300 --> 39:53.700]  Yeah
[39:53.700 --> 39:59.700]  Like the like the video the the ad where all the people are running around in the streets with the with the suits on and it's like
[40:00.180 --> 40:02.180]  What like no this is
[40:02.660 --> 40:06.020]  To me, like i've said it a couple of times like this is the best iphone i've used in years
[40:06.420 --> 40:12.660]  And to me that's that's not only because of the battery life. It's just the blend of everything right like the battery life the form factor
[40:13.380 --> 40:19.300]  Yes, I do miss the zoom sometimes but not enough like and you still can zoom you still it's just not optical
[40:19.300 --> 40:21.300]  You know, you're just getting digital soon
[40:21.460 --> 40:27.940]  Well, this was like what I harped on in in my review of the 10r which you know, I forgot about uh, frankly
[40:27.940 --> 40:32.020]  Because I I now have a real child a human child and not just my dog
[40:32.580 --> 40:38.580]  Um was like when they told me in the briefing no portrait mode for animals. I freaked out. I was like what?
[40:39.300 --> 40:41.860]  Why not? What is it so much harder to do animals?
[40:42.100 --> 40:47.300]  Like like, you know, what did I they they shared some things on the record off the record about you know
[40:47.300 --> 40:51.860]  The the algorithms and how they're using it to identify faces and all of that
[40:52.500 --> 40:54.580]  But you know, I thought that was going to be the biggest thing to me
[40:54.740 --> 40:58.260]  like am I going to miss portrait mode on on browser and
[40:58.820 --> 41:01.300]  Turns out I didn't and that's why I went for the 10r. Yeah
[41:02.260 --> 41:03.940]  um
[41:03.940 --> 41:07.300]  yeah, and the other thing too is that
[41:08.260 --> 41:09.780]  the
[41:09.780 --> 41:11.780]  the biggest
[41:12.020 --> 41:14.020]  Other than the camera the other big reason
[41:14.020 --> 41:17.620]  That the other big difference is that the 10r has an lcd
[41:18.260 --> 41:19.220]  led
[41:19.220 --> 41:20.740]  lcd screen
[41:20.740 --> 41:25.220]  Not oled right, uh, and it's 2x retina instead of 3x retina
[41:26.020 --> 41:27.860]  um
[41:27.860 --> 41:33.140]  But it turns out I mean I actually asked I was like is that the reason it gets better battery life and I was told
[41:33.140 --> 41:35.220]  Yes, that yes that the led
[41:36.100 --> 41:40.100]  Both both because led is led and because it has fewer pixels
[41:40.100 --> 41:47.620]  Right the lower resolution. Yeah lower resolution means the gpu has to control fewer pixels on screen and it actually is more efficient
[41:47.620 --> 41:54.580]  It's it's that's the reason the 10r gets better battery life than the bigger 10s max and way better
[41:55.220 --> 41:57.380]  Battery life than the slightly smaller 10s
[41:58.900 --> 42:03.860]  And you say well, okay, so it's more efficient but it's a cheaper screen and it's only 2x
[42:03.940 --> 42:06.740]  It's like not even 10 quote unquote 1080p
[42:06.740 --> 42:12.420]  Um, I like the led screen. I do see the difference in in blacks, right?
[42:12.420 --> 42:16.260]  Like the oh, I definitely see the difference when I go back to using yeah
[42:16.260 --> 42:24.260]  But to me side by side the only place where I really prefer the oled is like when when having really deep blacks matter
[42:24.260 --> 42:30.180]  Like watching if you're watching video or something and it's a dark scary thing or black or whatever
[42:30.180 --> 42:36.820]  But I don't watch tons of video on my phone and the type of videos I do watch on my phone are just like you know
[42:36.820 --> 42:43.220]  Like youtube reviews, you know, and so the the depth and my videos. Yeah. Yeah, exactly
[42:43.220 --> 42:48.500]  That's what I meant like, you know product. That's what you meant. Yeah, Joanna's videos. No, I that actually is true though
[42:48.500 --> 42:50.500]  I probably do watch most of your videos
[42:50.500 --> 42:57.220]  I'm gonna put more black scenes in my in my videos for you. I don't do much where where I don't do much
[42:57.220 --> 43:01.060]  I don't do much where we're having the true black of oled
[43:01.780 --> 43:08.580]  Matters if anything I would rather have an oled ipad because I do watch stuff like netflix on my ipad
[43:09.220 --> 43:15.940]  Where you know, i'd rather have an oled ipad and an led phone than the other way around I I understand
[43:15.940 --> 43:19.780]  Why the ipad hasn't gone oled yet for technical and cost reasons
[43:19.780 --> 43:23.300]  But but that's where I watch videos in my day-to-day life on the phone
[43:23.300 --> 43:28.100]  In my day-to-day life on the phone. I don't most of everything I look at is, you know white background
[43:28.340 --> 43:31.940]  And I actually like the led. I feel like it it it
[43:32.500 --> 43:34.660]  Has better if anything better
[43:37.380 --> 43:40.660]  Angles, you know, like you can look at it from any angle and it and it
[43:41.220 --> 43:45.700]  And it looks great and the 2x 3x retina thing I think is a total
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.020]  checklist looking at the specs nonsense because
[43:50.020 --> 43:57.620]  Sure in theory 3x is better than 2x, but the way that oled works where it actually
[43:59.140 --> 44:06.020]  You know, there's there's a different count of the sub pixels. It's on led. It's simple every single pixel is red green blue
[44:06.740 --> 44:08.740]  on oled
[44:09.300 --> 44:13.860]  I don't I'm sorry for those of you who care but I forget which one it is
[44:13.860 --> 44:17.060]  But it's like there's like a green pixel for every pixel
[44:17.060 --> 44:21.460]  For every pixel, but only every other one gets a red and only every other one gets a blue
[44:21.460 --> 44:27.540]  It's like when you look at it under a microscope. It's not a simple RGB layout and this is a neil patel conversation
[44:27.540 --> 44:34.580]  Yeah, it's not for this. Yeah, I think we did talk about it when it was on but basically though if you count sub pixels
[44:35.060 --> 44:38.260]  The actual basically saying I didn't listen to that whole thing now, you know
[44:39.540 --> 44:41.540]  it's actually uh
[44:41.540 --> 44:47.380]  if you count sub pixels the actual red green and blue diodes under the screen a
[44:48.340 --> 44:54.340]  Three or 2x led has a is very close in resolution to a 3x oled
[44:54.340 --> 45:00.420]  Like the reason oled is 3x is because at 2x it would look terrible. It would look it would look worse than it
[45:01.140 --> 45:06.100]  And so it's it's not even that much better, you know, and I don't see the difference
[45:06.100 --> 45:10.260]  I don't look and I know you know, I'm I'm getting older and I don't have the vision I used to but
[45:10.260 --> 45:12.260]  I don't look at the 2x
[45:12.740 --> 45:17.380]  X10r and think oh those pixels are too big. I can see the pixels. It's it's a great display
[45:18.100 --> 45:22.020]  It's a great display. And I mean going back to taking photos with it
[45:22.580 --> 45:27.940]  I you know for me that's always the biggest kind of test with the oled is like I when I'm taking photos with it
[45:27.940 --> 45:31.780]  Is it look as as good as the shot? I'm gonna take right, right?
[45:32.740 --> 45:37.940]  And I like I don't have that with the 10r or just like take I like taking photos with it
[45:37.940 --> 45:40.420]  I like taking photos with it. I think my photos look great on it
[45:41.060 --> 45:43.780]  again, just wish I could have portrait mode of browser, but
[45:44.740 --> 45:45.860]  You know
[45:45.860 --> 45:52.660]  Yeah, it's you know, I think it'll come someday. I think apple's gonna be working on portrait mode for browser on on the 10r for me
[45:52.900 --> 45:54.900]  Well, I think that the technical reason
[45:55.460 --> 45:59.780]  It's browser mode. It's what they're gonna they're calling it internally. I heard I it's because
[46:00.260 --> 46:06.180]  Portrait mode with the the cameras with two lenses use both lenses right at the same time
[46:06.180 --> 46:08.180]  to get the depth
[46:08.500 --> 46:10.500]  Mask or whatever they call it
[46:10.660 --> 46:13.380]  Whereas with only one camera lens, they've got to
[46:14.180 --> 46:19.140]  Figure out the depth thing software right and the software it's like the machine learning thing. They have it's
[46:20.260 --> 46:22.420]  specifically trained on human faces, you know
[46:23.700 --> 46:29.540]  Well, that's for the video. I went I hit this other crazy idea for the video that I wanted to find like animals that look like
[46:29.540 --> 46:31.540]  humans
[46:31.540 --> 46:38.660]  Um, but I ended up going to a farm to shoot it. Yeah and tried it with like every animal I could goats cows
[46:39.460 --> 46:45.060]  Uh, we had a duck in there and you know, I couldn't I couldn't get it to work. I did get it to work
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.820]  If you've watched the video with the front-facing camera
[46:49.380 --> 46:53.140]  So if you hold the front-facing camera because there's two cameras there
[46:53.940 --> 46:59.620]  and you do a selfie with an animal or you hold the camera around the other side you flip the other side and you're
[46:59.620 --> 47:02.020]  Shooting with that you can use portrait mode
[47:02.820 --> 47:07.460]  To get animal photos. I tried it with mannequins. This is this is oh, yeah. Yeah
[47:08.660 --> 47:09.860]  and
[47:09.860 --> 47:13.220]  it it works great if it's sort of a
[47:14.660 --> 47:18.100]  It works exactly as you'd think with a mannequin that is pretty much
[47:19.860 --> 47:22.500]  Human realistic but most stores
[47:23.700 --> 47:27.540]  These days use sort of iconic mannequins, you know
[47:27.540 --> 47:31.140]  Like they don't really have eyes. They're just sort of like blank faces. You know what I mean?
[47:31.860 --> 47:35.940]  And so that's a weirder idea that then testing with the farm animals
[47:35.940 --> 47:40.100]  I have to say it makes a lot of sense that a realistic it really does a realistic mannequin
[47:40.100 --> 47:45.540]  It works great and with the sort of unrealistic would you just never give me an idea? Yeah
[47:45.540 --> 47:49.620]  It's I ended up not publishing those because I didn't I felt like I didn't take enough of them
[47:49.620 --> 47:55.540]  Like I took a couple have enough comparison. Yeah, and it's like when I first found the one that was there's like a
[47:55.540 --> 48:02.340]  Sort of like a second-hand shop nearby that often puts they have like a it's creepy little girl mannequin
[48:02.340 --> 48:08.740]  But it's really, you know human realistic, you know painted eyes, you know, it actually it's not just a blank, you know
[48:08.740 --> 48:10.740]  It has the coloration, you know
[48:11.940 --> 48:13.220]  And so out of the corner of your eye
[48:13.220 --> 48:18.420]  It looks like a little creepy little girl just standing perfectly still outside their store and you know
[48:18.420 --> 48:24.260]  The 10r portrait mode just it got her it worked perfectly every time when I was shooting pictures of it
[48:24.260 --> 48:29.540]  And that like and I'd already taken a few of other mannequins that have like blank faces
[48:30.340 --> 48:35.540]  And it never it didn't work with any of them and then the manager of the store called the police on exactly like what?
[48:36.900 --> 48:41.140]  So this guy taking pictures guys taking pictures of a child mannequin
[48:42.980 --> 48:46.020]  From multiple angles from multiple angles
[48:47.300 --> 48:51.700]  And then he keeps taking out different phones and taking them. Yeah, that was true
[48:51.700 --> 48:53.700]  Yeah, that was true
[48:54.740 --> 48:58.100]  Absolutely true totally normal guy, right?
[49:00.100 --> 49:05.300]  It is funny because I think I think one of my favorite portrait mode photos i've ever taken with an iphone 10 was
[49:05.780 --> 49:11.620]  Of a dog last year. I don't even know whose dog it was. I was at some beer garden place, uh outdoors
[49:12.180 --> 49:15.620]  And their neighboring table had this adorable like a black lab
[49:16.260 --> 49:16.980]  uh
[49:16.980 --> 49:19.780]  very friendly and he just was looking right at me like
[49:19.780 --> 49:24.180]  Just like like he wanted his picture taken and I said do you mind and I asked I said do you mind if I take?
[49:24.180 --> 49:27.780]  A picture of your dog nice because I wanted to see how portrait mode worked and they're like sure go ahead
[49:27.780 --> 49:29.700]  You know and I took a picture and it was just
[49:30.340 --> 49:34.980]  And it just one of those portrait mode shots that you it comes out and it's like I cannot believe I just now sure with
[49:34.980 --> 49:37.940]  I cannot believe this came off a cell phone, you know, yeah
[49:38.660 --> 49:40.660]  No, that's I have a couple I mean
[49:40.820 --> 49:48.420]  Having a real child. I I now appreciate those moments so much more too because I like not that I don't love my dog as much
[49:48.420 --> 49:53.300]  If not more than my real child, yeah, but I love them equally
[49:53.860 --> 49:57.060]  You love all your children equally one of the other cool things. You only have one child
[49:57.060 --> 49:59.780]  But do you have it you have a pet? No, we don't have pets
[50:00.500 --> 50:05.140]  Yeah, we travel too much. That's what I tell them. Yeah, they're all they're constantly on me about it
[50:06.660 --> 50:08.660]  Everybody wants pets but but me
[50:09.620 --> 50:12.820]  Yeah, but then you have another feeling of your head of your son
[50:14.020 --> 50:16.020]  You know bonding with your dog. Yeah
[50:16.020 --> 50:17.620]  I don't know
[50:17.620 --> 50:19.620]  It just seems like a lot of work
[50:19.620 --> 50:21.620]  It is a lot of work and now
[50:22.340 --> 50:24.340]  Yeah, it's a lot of work
[50:24.340 --> 50:26.340]  and now january
[50:26.580 --> 50:28.580]  Yes, exactly
[50:28.740 --> 50:34.340]  I see people walking the dogs outside and i'm like not me and I know that if we had a dog it would be me
[50:34.340 --> 50:38.020]  It would be me out there walking the dog. It's me every night and every morning
[50:39.620 --> 50:41.220]  Yeah
[50:41.220 --> 50:44.100]  You know and it's just easier to say no before you're in love with a dog
[50:44.100 --> 50:46.100]  I had a dog growing up and I loved him
[50:47.300 --> 50:52.580]  Tremendously, so I know exactly what it's like and if I had you know, if he came back I would I would you know
[50:52.580 --> 50:57.620]  I would I would of course do everything I could to make him as happy as I could but it's easy to say no before you
[50:57.620 --> 50:59.620]  Fall in love with the dog
[50:59.620 --> 51:04.340]  Yeah, and before you see your child fall in love with the dog. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[51:04.580 --> 51:08.740]  Yeah, because I was I was the closest to our dog growing up because I was the kid, you know
[51:10.020 --> 51:11.140]  Yeah
[51:11.140 --> 51:15.940]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean our dog currently hates our kid. But yeah
[51:16.820 --> 51:20.900]  I mean, he loves him when he's dropping. He loves him when he's dropping food. It's it's wonderful for him
[51:20.980 --> 51:23.620]  he's like this is a full-on buffet and then
[51:24.420 --> 51:26.580]  The kid is like pulling his tail and you know
[51:27.220 --> 51:30.260]  tugging at his ears and trying to give him a hug and he's just like
[51:30.580 --> 51:32.580]  I don't like hugs and I don't like to be touched by you
[51:33.780 --> 51:37.380]  But he just sits there and takes it. Yeah, he really does. He's such a good dog
[51:37.380 --> 51:39.380]  Oh
[51:41.140 --> 51:48.500]  So but speaking of battery life have you gotten these the new battery cases to test I got mine this morning, yeah
[51:49.140 --> 51:51.860]  Um, I haven't gotten the 10r one. Hmm
[51:52.820 --> 51:58.740]  Do you have the 10r one? No, I only I only got the one for the 10s because yeah, that's what you have
[51:58.820 --> 52:01.460]  I've still like like you I still have my 10r review unit
[52:01.460 --> 52:06.660]  But the only one the only phone I used right now is my daily carry personally owned 10s
[52:06.660 --> 52:11.780]  So I got I just asked for the 10s battery pack. Well, yeah, I mean I that's the same like I just
[52:12.740 --> 52:17.300]  I bought the the red 10r a couple of weeks ago and i've been just using it
[52:17.300 --> 52:19.940]  And so i'm like when I get the battery case on here
[52:19.940 --> 52:26.180]  I think i'm i'm estimating but even before like really looking at the the milliamp hours and all that i've seen a lot of it
[52:26.180 --> 52:29.540]  I don't I don't even want to look at it. I just want to i'm betting I can go
[52:29.540 --> 52:37.140]  Two full days without charging. Hmm. What do you think? When did your show up?
[52:37.140 --> 52:40.980]  Oh, I haven't gotten the 10r battery case yet. It's it's going to come next week. They said all right
[52:41.220 --> 52:46.340]  I guess I should just go to the store. But yeah, um, I got the 10s, but i'm not using the 10s anymore
[52:46.420 --> 52:51.620]  I'm not you know, I don't feel like usually it's taken out. I don't like to carry multiple phones anymore. I'm just too forgetful
[52:52.260 --> 52:58.420]  I don't need this battery pack on a daily basis. I I I think in even with the iphone 10
[52:58.420 --> 53:00.420]  It's since i've you know in the last
[53:01.700 --> 53:04.500]  I guess what is that 13 months 14 15 months?
[53:04.580 --> 53:09.460]  Whatever long since i've been using an iphone 10. I think that there have only been maybe two days
[53:10.100 --> 53:12.500]  Where my phone has actually run out
[53:13.140 --> 53:15.140]  and I think maybe even
[53:16.180 --> 53:17.940]  only
[53:17.940 --> 53:22.260]  I could probably count on my fingers and toes the number of days where my phone's gotten to the red
[53:22.820 --> 53:26.340]  Um, probably what kind of life do you live? What do you do?
[53:26.340 --> 53:28.500]  Well, I I don't know
[53:30.180 --> 53:34.740]  I don't know how I I don't know I I guess because i'm not on the phone during the day that much. I don't know
[53:35.380 --> 53:39.380]  Um, but I usually I I get through the day notifications turned off all of them. No
[53:39.540 --> 53:42.020]  No, I don't do anything like that. I get lots of notifications
[53:42.820 --> 53:45.240]  Yeah, like are you not that popular? You don't get a lot of notifications
[53:45.700 --> 53:49.620]  I don't know i'm on my computer so much of the day when i'm working that it's you know
[53:49.860 --> 53:56.020]  I don't know I I get through the day easily on the phone most days and it's days like when we're on vacation or something
[53:56.020 --> 53:58.100]  Like that and i'm on only on the phone
[53:58.740 --> 54:03.140]  And not near a charger or something that I need something like a battery pack or something
[54:03.140 --> 54:06.340]  So I would never it wouldn't even occur to me vaguely to use this battery
[54:07.140 --> 54:10.100]  case all day every day, but like when I go to
[54:11.060 --> 54:16.660]  Like what the days when apple has an event, you know death on the battery because it's i'm on the phone on the phone
[54:16.900 --> 54:18.900]  And it's you know
[54:18.900 --> 54:26.260]  Trying it's a struggle to get a signal because there's a thousand other people all you know, trying to get a signal
[54:26.340 --> 54:33.140]  I'm taking lots of pictures, etc. Etc. Um, so for like something like that. I like this case is definitely going in my
[54:34.340 --> 54:36.260]  travel bag
[54:36.260 --> 54:37.700]  I think it'd be great
[54:37.700 --> 54:40.580]  But it's weird like it's it's the weird thing for me
[54:40.580 --> 54:46.420]  It's like I could I we'll see what happens with the testing but like if I could go two days without test without charging
[54:46.420 --> 54:49.860]  Do do I even care right like I can charge at night?
[54:50.580 --> 54:54.980]  Um, and I also just got this fancy clear case for the 10r
[54:55.060 --> 54:59.620]  I've been testing clear cases for the 10r and by testing I mean just buying random ones on amazon
[55:00.340 --> 55:06.260]  And I put like a wallet attachment on the back and I kind of would rather have the wallet attachment than a big battery hump
[55:08.820 --> 55:12.020]  I actually did a review. I don't know if you saw it. I should write a piece of that
[55:12.020 --> 55:18.100]  Okay, I wrote it but then I did a video review on twitter of the uh, clear battery case. I don't do videos
[55:19.140 --> 55:21.140]  It was my favorite
[55:21.140 --> 55:23.060]  I I I I
[55:23.060 --> 55:26.420]  It was clear. You're like, it's like just like hearing the box. Yeah
[55:27.220 --> 55:32.500]  It was completely wordless and a lot of people enjoyed it. I just opened it up and and yeah
[55:32.500 --> 55:37.220]  I watched that I bent it and I tapped it on our our kitchen counter because I you know
[55:37.220 --> 55:42.020]  I feel like that was the point of that was to sort of try to convey through the video
[55:42.500 --> 55:46.260]  A sense of what type of material it is because that it's you know
[55:46.420 --> 55:51.860]  The clear case is a very different material than apple's other silicone cases because it's you know
[55:51.860 --> 55:55.060]  You have to use a tightly entirely different materials to make it clear
[55:55.780 --> 55:57.540]  um
[55:57.540 --> 55:59.940]  I had so much fun making that video
[56:00.180 --> 56:04.660]  Uh, yeah after I watched it. I said I I watched I said we need him to come work at the wall street
[56:04.660 --> 56:09.380]  Journal video department I watched that and I said now this is i've got to recruit him
[56:09.780 --> 56:13.220]  There were like one or two people though who were really our recruiters should be in touch soon
[56:13.540 --> 56:15.780]  There were one or two people though who were so upset that I didn't
[56:16.500 --> 56:19.140]  Didn't say anything. They were like, but I want to know what you think
[56:20.340 --> 56:22.020]  I was like, I don't know. It's
[56:22.020 --> 56:24.660]  You know wait for the review. Um, but I do think it's a nice
[56:25.540 --> 56:30.500]  It's a nice case, but the button on the side of the apple case is very is very hard
[56:30.500 --> 56:35.540]  Yeah, it's uh, it's it doesn't have a lot of give so now i'm using this case from
[56:36.100 --> 56:41.620]  Spigen and the button on the side is just the right amount of give but I don't it's a little bit thicker than the apple
[56:41.620 --> 56:45.620]  Case I have the spigen one. I bought a few too, even though I
[56:46.420 --> 56:47.700]  I don't
[56:47.700 --> 56:52.660]  Play I don't plan to buy and own a tenar but it you know in the name of uh, uh,
[56:53.460 --> 56:57.140]  Having an opinion and being able to it's perfect that I did now. I feel like i'm justified
[56:57.140 --> 57:01.300]  I've I spent we're having this conversation. This is the review. Yeah, it's a business expense
[57:01.940 --> 57:06.660]  Uh, yeah, but I bought the spigen one because it was well regarded and the thing that drives me nuts about the spigen one
[57:06.660 --> 57:10.820]  Is that they put so much text all over the sides like look at the sides
[57:10.900 --> 57:17.460]  It's like I know and it's all sorts of crazy stuff like like in the corners. They have it labeled as like anti
[57:18.180 --> 57:21.700]  cushioning, you know anti fall cushioning technology and
[57:22.260 --> 57:25.940]  It's clear. I don't have that on mine. No look on the one corner. Come on
[57:25.940 --> 57:30.820]  Come on, it's like the bottom right corner on the side. There's like what color is your oh there it is
[57:30.820 --> 57:36.900]  But yeah, mine's red. So it's really concealed it is because it's a clear case. It is very concealed
[57:38.420 --> 57:40.420]  You know, what color is your 10r?
[57:42.660 --> 57:45.940]  Yeah, you would be able to see this way better if I have like one of the blue ones
[57:46.100 --> 57:50.980]  Yeah, the blue one. I was gonna say if you had a blue one this I didn't notice that till now
[57:50.980 --> 57:54.820]  I mean, it was bothering me already that it said spigen on the side. Oh, no, I don't have the blue one
[57:54.820 --> 57:57.940]  I have the white one. I have the boring. Yeah, you'd see it on that too. Yeah
[57:58.020 --> 58:02.980]  Yeah, because I have the red one, which is the best one and I like the red
[58:02.980 --> 58:07.220]  I asked for red and I got white I bought the red. So yeah, it was just no no-brainer
[58:07.540 --> 58:13.380]  It was funny because I think that they were a bit constrained on the review units and it was like they at first apple
[58:13.380 --> 58:19.380]  PR was like hey, well, you know, what color 10r would you like and I I think I asked for blue
[58:19.380 --> 58:24.420]  I think I asked for blue or blue or red. I think I said and then they were like, how about white?
[58:24.820 --> 58:26.820]  And I was like, okay
[58:27.060 --> 58:32.740]  So my funny story with that is they gave me a black and I said is there any way I can get a red?
[58:33.780 --> 58:37.460]  and I had already known in my head that my I wanted the video to be
[58:38.260 --> 58:40.260]  um
[58:40.260 --> 58:44.100]  I had I had an idea that I wanted to hang the phones in an apple tree
[58:45.380 --> 58:48.580]  And because I wanted the whole review to be you know, which apple do you pick?
[58:48.580 --> 58:50.020]  right and
[58:50.020 --> 58:51.700]  For some reason they were like, yeah
[58:51.700 --> 58:56.660]  We can get you the red and it like just worked out really well because you don't want to have like a black phone hanging
[58:56.660 --> 58:59.540]  in an apple tree well, and that was partly why I
[59:00.740 --> 59:03.540]  happily accepted the white one which I think was the
[59:04.180 --> 59:08.980]  Well black probably would have been the worst one because it would look the most like my the 10
[59:09.300 --> 59:12.340]  I had black iphone 10, right? So white was better than black
[59:13.940 --> 59:16.260]  Even though if I were personally to buy a 10r
[59:16.260 --> 59:19.780]  I'd probably get black because I just buy black everything. Um
[59:20.580 --> 59:23.940]  but the reason I I got the sense from apple pr that
[59:24.580 --> 59:30.100]  There weren't enough of every color for everybody to get red or blue or whatever the most vibrant ones
[59:30.260 --> 59:34.980]  I think i'm the only one who had the red. I I've from the reviews. I saw it. I think so
[59:35.620 --> 59:37.620]  And I don't blame. Oh, no, um
[59:38.580 --> 59:40.580]  MKBHD got red, of course
[59:41.220 --> 59:42.660]  Yeah
[59:42.660 --> 59:44.660]  Because how could you not give him red? Yeah
[59:44.660 --> 59:50.500]  This is brand but I don't do the video reviews and I don't take my own product photography for my reviews. So
[59:51.140 --> 59:52.180]  you know
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.420]  yeah, I happily took one for the the
[59:55.140 --> 01:00:01.780]  My my colleagues my fellow reviewers across the spectrum that you know, let let the ones who actually are going to shoot videos
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.260]  Take the colorful ones. I'll happily take the boring white one with no complaint
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.900]  But anyway, and if you're wondering
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.700]  Or anyone here listening wondering why i've put so much time and effort to my case shopping
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.900]  It's that I broke my original review unit
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:22.340]  You break review units all the time every time I broke the 10s max
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.140]  And I also broke the 10r
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:31.940]  And it's because I don't have cases on it. I they slip out of my pocket they slip off of things
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.060]  when i'm charging them
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:39.940]  And it's yeah the 10r on the back just shattered in the corner
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:45.940]  Which by the way, like if you don't have apple care it is like it it costs you like half the phone to replace the back
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.580]  At this point it's like five hundred dollars to just swap out the back if you don't have apple care
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.420]  I don't have apple care. I don't either I haven't bought apple care. That's why I have a case
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:02.340]  I haven't you on the upgrade program. No, i'm not because I don't like things like that. I don't understand it
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.380]  I might maybe I would save money. I I do buy myself a new iPhone
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:13.540]  I don't I I yeah, but I don't understand it. I I like the simplicity of okay the phone you want costs
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.160]  1149 dollars and then I pay
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:23.700]  1149 plus the tax and now i've paid the money and now I own the phone and the phone is mine. I don't well, I think
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.140]  We're both probably privileged enough to afford that on one hand. I think we're also I don't know about you
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.860]  But I like i'm like I don't want to necessarily give that phone back
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.940]  What if I want to keep it? What if it's a you know, what if I wanted to be a family family heirloom?
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.300]  Like whoa, I don't want I don't want to give you this phone when i'm done with it
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.180]  and i'm with you the same the like last one is like I want to pay it out, right and like
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.900]  Not have any hidden fees anywhere. Like I just want to know where my money's going, right?
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.780]  Yeah, anytime I do a story on upgrade programs or cellular
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.020]  whatever
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:02.900]  Program monthly bills that at&t or verizon are trying to sell you on some new great monthly thing that's going to bundle everything
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.340]  It's always it's it's never beneficial to the customer the consumer. It's like
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.580]  Pretty much my reporting anytime I do anything on cellular plans
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:20.180]  Yeah, and so like I and i'm an idiot I keep all i've got every iphone i've ever owned
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:26.980]  and so i've got like a little mini museum of iphones and I I don't do that with my other stuff, you know
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.540]  I I guess but I
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.620]  I guess I do I guess I do have a bunch of old macs but I don't have them set up like in a museum or
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.820]  anything like that. They're just in boxes. But every once in a while I like to get out an old
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:45.300]  iphone and just sort of compare it. But like with amy's we just you know sell them or give them to
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.580]  friends or hand, you know, you know, you know, put them to good use, you know, like
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:56.900]  trade it in for the 10r. Right. Well, we don't do the trade in but it's like, like my friend lee
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:02.820]  who runs a place here in philly hopson laundromat. He doesn't like buying new funds. So we just sell
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:10.500]  him amy's old one every year. Yeah. But you can't do that with the trade in program. I again, I
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:17.220]  think that yeah, like you said, I almost certainly would save money, but I'm not on it. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.180]  Like, I don't like leasing. I don't I've never leased a car. And I understand if you want to get
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:28.020]  a new car every three years, it's better to lease but I just, yeah, currently leasing a car for that
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:33.620]  reason. Right. But I see on the other the idiot who's driving a car from 2006 because I own it
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:40.100]  and it has nothing wrong with it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.180]  know. I actually that's not an idiot. That's like one of the few areas of my life where I'm
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.780]  financially sensible. Yeah. And if you know that that kind of car is going to work for you for
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:57.060]  10 years, then why not know 15 years? Would you say since 2006? Yeah. Yeah. 2006. Well,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:02.900]  we don't drive much. It's we have one car, right? It just literally just this week went over 55,000
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.620]  miles. So it's we don't we don't do a lot of driving. So what is that? That's like,
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:14.260]  5000 55,000 miles since 2006. Yeah. So Wow. 12 years only 55,000 miles.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:23.380]  Wow. Really honest. City driving. Yeah, I'm in the same boat. Right. But I, I just figure I'm
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.500]  going to outgrow this car. And I had thought last year. It's a five year lease. Yeah. Well,
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.500]  it is tech. Technically, it's actually ridiculous because the car doesn't even have
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:38.820]  it. It doesn't even have a tape deck in there. Yeah, I literally have it has a tape deck and
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:44.260]  a CD player. And you have one of those tape. You're the tape to 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:50.580]  in there. We did, but it at some point broke and I never bothered to replace it. I probably should
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:56.420]  buy those work with the night. No, they do. They work with the dongle. Right. Yeah, it's an iPhone.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:00.660]  Yeah, I'd have to get it. I have to use dongle. I guess. I don't know. I guess I should get a new
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:06.820]  one. I don't know. We just usually just listen to the XM radio. So but how do you have XM radio in
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.700]  there? Oh, yeah, it came with it. Oh, like a subscription. Yeah. But we don't have any,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.900]  you know, not only, you know, carplay, forget about carplay. We don't even have
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:22.420]  the 30 pin connector for the old iPods. Like, there's no, I don't even have a CD player in
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.060]  here. Yeah, well, we do have a CD player, but we don't have CDs anymore. It's ridiculous.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:34.260]  Yeah, actually, we're in this like book of the month club for for Noah. And it came,
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.260]  one of the books came with a CD last month. And I was like, What the hell is this? Like,
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.780]  he's like, look, you know, he's like, he's playing around with it. Like, it's a Frisbee
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.820]  or something like, it's like, where would I put this CD?
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:58.500]  We, we got some friends, kid a gift. It was a pen and teller magic kit for Christmas,
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:04.580]  or over the holidays. And it comes with a DVD. And it was like, I even said I was like,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.300]  I don't know what you're gonna do with the DVD. Sorry.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.540]  Yeah, sorry. It was a DVD. It was a DVD that came in with the book.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.340]  Yeah. I don't what am I gonna do with that? I don't have a DVD player anymore.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:27.380]  I bought the I forget what brand. But I bought like a USB DVD player a while back, knowing,
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:33.380]  you know, that we don't have any, we don't have any max in inactive use anymore that have
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:40.580]  the slot. So I bought one. And so I thought, you know, just in case when I need it,
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.020]  but I don't know where I put it. It's somewhere in my office, I guess.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.500]  No, I have one of those two. I don't know where it is. When I used to, I used to test the MacBook
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:58.100]  Air so often the old MacBook Air with Windows. So I had a USB powered, same thing, CD, DVD drive.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.780]  Yeah, where's that thing was made by Samsung. It was like pretty cheap.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:08.260]  Yeah, I don't know. So I've got one, but it's, but on the other hand, since buying it probably
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:13.780]  at least a year ago, maybe longer, but at least a year ago, I've lost track of where I put it in
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:20.980]  the office, never used it, and have never once thought, Oh, now I need it. You know, I just I've
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.460]  literally gone an entire year without once even having the vague urge of Okay, I've got this
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:32.980]  CD or DVD in my hand. You know, where's that thing? So like, that's just a technology that
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:39.060]  is just dropped off the face of the earth. Right? Like, possibly at some point soon,
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.380]  USB ports and headphone jacks. You know, it's kind of funny thinking about it. Like
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:49.380]  it wasn't that many years ago where Netflix when they first tried to make the switch from their
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.940]  discs by mail delivery, and wanted to rename that they picked a goof, I forget what the goofy name
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:02.500]  for it was, and just use the Netflix name for the online streaming. And there was outrage,
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:09.220]  outrage from the people who were getting their discs by mail. But talk about, you know,
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:15.460]  a being ahead of the, you know, being ahead of the curve. Like, I think if you went around to
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.900]  teenagers today and told them that, you know, yeah, what Netflix used to be, like 10 years ago.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:27.220]  Yeah. You'd have to explain to them. I mean, how many episodes would feel like? How many episodes
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:33.460]  of Stranger Things? Or what did I else did I just watch on Netflix? I just watched like the worst
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:39.300]  series on fx, would you how many CDs would you need? Well, you couldn't even binge, like we have
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:44.420]  any DVDs would you need? Yeah, we've we've had Netflix since that era. And it was wonderful.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:50.100]  It was really so much better than going to video stores. But But to get like a TV series,
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:55.860]  you'd have to like mail, you know, watch, I guess TV series, usually the DVDs would have more than
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:59.380]  an episode it have, right? Yeah, they would have they'd have multiple but like, I'm looking at
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:05.940]  friends because I used to watch friends on DVD. And I feel like one season was a couple of was
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:17.940]  a couple of discs. Okay, so it on the box set the complete series of friends on Amazon 100 bucks is
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:27.060]  40 discs. Good story. That's a funny story. Like you just give that to like a millennial who's
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.340]  been watching that millennial I don't know like, yeah, but whatever young teenagers, teenagers,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:37.540]  yeah, teenagers, and see if they could figure it out. Did I tell you? Did I tell you this the last
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:43.460]  time you run? It's a total thing that teenagers love friends. My, you know, Jonas just turned 15.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:49.780]  He, over the last two years has watched the entirety of friends. All really all seasons twice.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:56.500]  What I love about it. He's just like, he just I mean, I guess what's changed?
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.060]  Nothing. I've tried to you know, I'm like, what is it about? And he's like, I don't know. I just
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.460]  think it's funny, you know, and he's watched Seinfeld too. But friends to me stands out more
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:11.060]  as a I can't believe it stands the test of time. And Amy was telling me it's it is such a sensation
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:18.180]  on Netflix is so popular on Netflix that the cast of friends is still making every one of them is
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:24.500]  still making like $20 million a year from their residuals on friends because of the Netflix deal.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.900]  What was funny because last night I was watching shameless. You ever watch the show on no time? No.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:35.140]  And it I mean, you shouldn't anymore. The first couple seasons are amazing. And now it's like,
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.220]  ninth season. And I'm like, I'm still watching. Why am I still watching? But Courtney Cox was on
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:44.180]  it. And I was like, does she have to do this show? No, like, she's Yeah, she's on like the ninth
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:50.100]  season in the middle of the series and the season. What is Courtney Cox doing on here? Like what?
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.900]  She doesn't have to do it. And she's like, what else she's been in? What's it called lately?
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.740]  Some other cable thing.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.420]  I saw somebody had a story I might have been in New York Times somebody had like a
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:09.460]  culture story on the the unbelievable popular sustained popularity of friends and and the
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.980]  bizarreness that it's it's like core audience now are kids who weren't born when friends was on.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.460]  And, you know, you can't prove what the appeal is. It's all subjective, but that
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:28.580]  that there's something about the pre internet pre phone world that friends has that there's
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:34.900]  a simplicity to life in that era that appeals to kids in today's, you know, text, text, text
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:41.540]  era. I will read that story because that sounds interesting. Now it's fascinating. And you know
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:46.500]  what one of my favorite things about that friends thing because I'm, it just appeals to me. I just
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:55.860]  like it when people are good people. And I like it when people behave in a I like that stories
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:02.420]  of camaraderie. And I just love that the six key cast members of friends throughout the entire run
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:09.140]  of the show, always negotiated together, everybody got paid the same amount. And it was they just
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:14.260]  negotiated everything as a block. And as you know, like Jennifer Aniston, maybe Jennifer Aniston got
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:20.660]  more popular, or maybe Courtney Cox was more popular at the beginning or Chandler, you know,
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.620]  whatever, whoever, you know, was it they just they just like, Nope, we like each other. We're
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.500]  this is great. But let's keep it simple. We'll negotiate as a block and all six of us will get
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:35.060]  the same salary. I just love that. Yeah,
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:42.180]  it just. I mean, I watch him like on those shows. I watch him on like TBS. I love TBS still.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.660]  Because like, I think we've talked about this on one of your podcasts before. It's just like the
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:52.020]  the serendipity of turning on and turning on TV and watching something that you didn't think of
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:56.180]  watching. Like I love that still. And it's the pretty much the only reason I still have cable.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:02.420]  And like, I just like, yeah, it's just like, for me, like, I don't want to go to something
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.740]  sometimes in a mood. I've had to made a lot of hard decisions during the day. I don't want to
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.980]  make a tough decision of what to watch on Netflix. And I don't really want your algorithms trying to
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.900]  pitch me on something that like, you think I'm going to like, and then I lose myself in it,
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:19.780]  because I want to watch till the end, because that's the kind of person I am. Yeah. So yeah,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.140]  like, I watch on TBS all the time. And it's every time I turn to turn it on, it's like,
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:30.020]  it's still funny, or still like, makes you chuckle at the ridiculousness of, I don't know,
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:40.260]  something. I have to go soon. How soon? Like 10 minutes. All right. Well, I got it. I got
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:45.540]  to squeeze in pencils at an hour and a half. All right. And I started late. Well, let me let me

[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:46.100]  here's before we go, I want to talk Mac book air, got to talk keyboards. I just want to say one
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.180]  thing about the battery case that showed up. It showed up, had totally dead charge. I put the
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:55.540]  phone really put the phone in and it, and the iOS recognized it and instantly gave you that smart,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.700]  clever thing that says, okay, your phone's at 99% because it was like first thing in the morning.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:04.260]  The battery case is at zero and so far everybody I've talked to like Renee Richie got one a couple
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.860]  days ago, every, and a couple of people are starting to get them today. Just, you know,
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:13.060]  pre-orders everybody's shows up with zero charge. And I think it's a legal thing with
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:17.540]  standalone lithium ion batteries because one thing Apple does say on the ordering page at
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.620]  apple.com is that they have to ship by ground. You can't pay for air shipping.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:28.180]  And because it's at zero, I mean it was enough to let it see it. I took it up and I put it on my
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:32.660]  bedside. I put my phone in it, put it on my bedside charger on the, the key, cheap, cheap
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:39.300]  charger. And it did, it lit up the key charger like, okay, this is doing something. And I actually
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:44.740]  went back to sleep for a bit and then I woke up and the, the case was even deader than it was
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:49.780]  originally. It like no longer even like the iPhone didn't even know it was plugged into a smart chase
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.860]  smart case. Like the key charging did nothing. And so I think it's supposed to charge the phone
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.100]  first. Yeah. And I think it did that and it was already at zero and it just was like, I think
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:05.620]  you need to have some kind of charge to do Chi because it's like a two way handshake. So I think
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:12.020]  a completely dead, but thing can't charge by Chi. I think you, so when you get it, anybody out there
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.260]  and I think Apple should tell you this and it doesn't seem to tell you in my perusal of the
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.660]  guide, you should charge it by lightning first, even if you plan to charge it by Chi going
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.460]  forward. I thought at first it might be broken. I thought maybe I got a, a dud, but I charged it
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.860]  by lightning and everything is fine after that, including Chi charging. But when you, was the
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.620]  phone dead or did they had the phone charging? The phone was completely charged, but after,
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:42.580]  you know, the, the case, which started at zero, it went from being at zero, but the phone could still
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:47.300]  see that it was zero to being like, it was like a, like, like it wasn't a battery case at all.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:51.780]  Like it was just a case. Like it didn't even the, you know, when you'd go to the battery thing
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:57.460]  in control center, that tells you, Hey, here's your phone's charge. Here's your case's charge.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.820]  The case didn't even, it wasn't even listed. It didn't even give it a zero.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:06.100]  Yeah. Cause I got an email from Apple just explaining some of the
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:11.780]  info about it. And they were saying that, you know, depending on how you charge your phone,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.820]  it depends the order of charging the phone or the case matters on the type of charger you have. So
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:23.780]  like a five watt charger is going to charge the phone first, a 10 or 12 watt charger is going to
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:31.300]  charge the iPhone and the case simultaneously. And higher up it goes more like, I don't know,
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:36.500]  case 30 watts, I don't know, 40, 10, 18 watts. It will do, you know, fast charge the iPhone then
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:44.180]  fast charge the case. I think obviously they've made this, this battery pack more smarter,
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.020]  quote unquote, than the last one in terms of how fast it can charge.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.380]  Yeah. And I think that's why they're not talking about mega amp hours, because it's not really,
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:19:00.820]  that's not a good metric. It's really, it's a lot more complicated than that. And the smartness,
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.300]  you know, is definitely there. It's definitely pretty clever. Anyway,
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:11.940]  I mean, I just wrote back because this is anyone who knows my, my biggest fight against Apple now
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:18.740]  knows that it it pains me that they still sign up to sell the five watt charger in or when you buy
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:24.500]  an iPhone, the five watt charger charger is what's included. I bring this up in every review and
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:32.260]  every meeting with Apple. So well, the more reason they should sell it with a 10 watt or 12 watt
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:37.940]  charger. All right. Let me push back on that, though. I I wrote that around point two and said
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.740]  I even described it as shameful, I thought with the iPhone 10. But the pushback I got from people
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:47.700]  was that some people charge overnight. Well, they're not they don't care about how fast it is.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:53.780]  They care about how small it is. And that Apple can make it that small. Well, that a little bit
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:00.260]  bigger, right? That would be the ideal would be something faster than five watt, maybe even if
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:04.660]  it was like seven and a half watt or something, you know, but could they get a 10 watt charger
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:10.260]  into a size like that? I don't know. But yeah, the size of the five watt charger is a big deal.
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:17.140]  And there really are a lot of people who prefer it. And I know you say this, to some people who
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:21.140]  really think it's, you know, just are concerned about speed. And they're like, that can't possibly
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.700]  be true, who would prefer it, but they really there's just, they don't they don't know. They
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:30.740]  don't care about the speed. It's so where are they putting what, like, where are they putting
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:35.780]  it that there's no space for a little bit bigger charger? Well, I think it's like some people have
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:40.820]  said pocket. Some people have said, women with small purses like to keep one in their purse.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.380]  And that's sometimes you can be like in a coffee shop or something like that. And because somebody
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.500]  already has something in the one socket, you there's not room. Okay, I see that point. I see
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:57.220]  that point the ones that cover like right, you know, the longer chargers that cover the other
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.580]  other socket. Right. I see that. I see that point. The thing I you know, I'm just telling you that
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:07.380]  it's not me. I you know, I don't really like that charger. I don't like the way that the prongs are
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.180]  always sticking out on it. I like the ones even if they're bigger. I like the way to have the prongs.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:16.580]  I don't know why. But I don't like that the prongs are always sticking out on it.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.940]  But I'm just telling you that there are people and I you know, let's face it, though, it's also
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.500]  gotta be it's cheaper for Apple to include the five. Well, that's why I get so angry about it.
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:28.980]  Right. But I do think because then they want to upsell you to the 12 watt charger. Most people
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:35.060]  who have an iPad have a 12 watt charger. So it's not like you can't just find one lying around.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:40.260]  But if you want to upgrade to that, you're paying like 2020 bucks. I mean, obviously,
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.900]  you can just buy like a better anchor one on on Amazon, which is what I've been suggesting for
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:52.340]  like five years now. But no, I think that the next iPhone, I'm actually not sure about the USB C
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:22:03.300]  rumors. I don't know why I say no way and I'm not speaking. I say no way on the USB C port on the
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:12.020]  iPhone itself. Right. But I could see them moving to a higher watt charger. Yeah, with a USB C in.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:21.540]  Yeah. Because it at this point, all of their new Mac books and the iPad Pro can charge a phone,
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:27.060]  but they can only charge it with USB C out. Right. So I think what the next iPhone will come with is
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:33.220]  a, hopefully, right, it'll still be a lightning charger, but it'll be USB C on the other end.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:37.700]  And with some kind of USB C brick, which hopefully would not be five watts.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:45.620]  Yeah, so this would be the year. But, you know, hopefully, because I think it's ridiculous that
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:50.020]  you can't charge a brand, you can go into an Apple store and buy a brand new MacBook
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:55.140]  and a brand new iPad Pro and a brand new iPhone. Right. And so you Wow, aren't you a great Apple
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:59.700]  customer, you're spending 1000s of dollars on these three products. And then you take them
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:08.100]  home and you can't charge the phone from either of those $2,000 plus devices without buying an
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:15.060]  very expensive, you know, $30 cable from Apple or using a dongle. And if you use the dongle,
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:22.100]  you're losing the power delivery. Yeah. And I mean, one day we may get out air power.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.700]  So we can charge some of these things simultaneously, though, that'll be slower.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:31.620]  I mean, that's gonna be wireless speeds. But yeah, it's just ridiculous that if you buy a brand new
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:38.740]  MacBook and a brand new iPhone, you can't charge the phone from the MacBook without spending $30
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:45.780]  on a cable that you charge the MacBook, you mean you know, you can't plug the phone into the
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:50.980]  MacBook without an extra cable that doesn't that isn't included. I mean, you know, Google does the
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:56.660]  right thing with the pixel and they ship you know, it takes USB C in but it has it they ship it with
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:02.820]  a little dongle so you can charge it from any USB C like it's in the box so you can charge it from
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:10.180]  a US USB C to USB C or you can charge it from USB A to USB C right there in the box and you know,
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:15.700]  for a $750 phone it doesn't seem like a lot to ask for put the dongle in the box.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:20.020]  No, no, but don't I'm not thinking it through and it's like if you have
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.380]  the USB C, you know, whatever the other side of the cord
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:32.820]  that's, it's gonna, I mean, it'll be a slow it'll be a hard adjustment for some people. But,
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.500]  you know, most of the ecosystems moving to USB C in any way.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:43.140]  I don't believe that Apple will switch the iPhone itself to USB C. And I know that somebody piped
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.380]  up with a rumor this week that they did and there's a report this week. Yeah, but I don't
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:53.140]  buy it. And it wasn't. It didn't seem like a report came from anywhere sensible. I think
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:58.100]  that it's one of those cases where yes, the iPad Pro did move to USB C. But I think it's
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:03.620]  one of those cases where if you listen to what Apple said about why the iPad Pro has USB C,
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:08.580]  they are telling you the honest truth. There's no spin on it. And and their explanation for it
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:15.540]  was that it's the iPad Pro is more is meant for professional use. It's meant to do more of the
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:20.180]  things that you can do with a laptop and that involves plugging peripherals in and therefore
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:25.860]  it has USB C. It is, you know, I read that those things don't apply to an iPhone, you're not going
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.260]  to plug in, you know, audio equipment to an iPhone. I know some people do stuff like that with an
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:35.460]  iPhone, but it's not, you know, it's not common. I really don't think so. And I think that there's
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.540]  just no way they're going to give up the proprietary advantages of having complete control
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:46.180]  over lightning. They love having control. And it's been I mean, I guess it's been a while
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.820]  now. It's been since iPhone five. Yeah. And the other thing, too, don't forget,
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:57.700]  nerds like us, people who listen to the show, we understand the, you know, the differences and we
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:04.580]  can see this panacea of it theoretically would be great if everything you owned all charged by
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:09.620]  USB C and you could have this one cable that you could plug into an iPad and a MacBook and a phone
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:14.980]  and you'd have all this cables you could get rid of. But out there in the normal world, every time
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:19.700]  when when Apple switched from the old adapter to the lightning, the people thought it was a
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:24.340]  money grab. They were like, they just want me to now they want my money for, you know, all these
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:29.140]  new chargers and stuff like that. And if they switched it to USB C, again, they'd think it's
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:34.020]  a money grab, even though they would be switching to an industry standard. Right. And also, like,
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:39.860]  it was a bigger like, it was a much bigger deal when they did away with the 30 port was 30 pin.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:47.860]  Because it's a 30 30 pin connector. Because because at that point, there were so many
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.660]  accessories that were plugging in that way. But now it's like feels like everything's
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:59.220]  I don't know, what was the last time you plugged your your iPhone into like a speaker dock?
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:05.140]  Yeah, I don't know. Even in hotels, I don't I don't know. I don't use that. I don't use those.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:10.500]  I don't trust them, to be honest. Yeah, I just feel like you don't plug in as much like it would
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.820]  be an ecosystem shift, but not as big as it was back then. But I still don't think they'll do it.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.500]  I still don't think they'll do it. Yeah. All right. Let me take a break and tell you about
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:25.460]  Dashlane. Dashlane is a password and personal information manager. Let's just start store things
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:30.740]  like your passwords, your logins, your credit cards, your passport numbers, anything you need
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:36.980]  to store securely, you can store it in Dashlane. And they have apps for every platform you might
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:44.740]  use iOS, including both iPhone and iPad support Mac, a nice native Mac app, Windows, Android,
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:51.540]  all the major platforms. So especially if you are a cross platform person, maybe at work,
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.900]  use Windows, maybe at home, use Mac, you have iPhone, but you have to use Windows.
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:03.460]  Dashlane is for you. They include a browser extension that enables autofill so you can
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:07.620]  access all of your login information, your credit card numbers, right where you need it,
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:13.380]  when you need it right in the form in the webpage, bring it up, sign up for a new account somewhere,
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.540]  need to generate a new password. Dashlane will do it for you, give you a secure password,
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:25.300]  fill it in and store it in Dashlane for subsequent use. How often are you ready to buy something,
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.500]  but you don't have your credit card handy? Dashlane means you never need to have your
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:33.540]  credit card handy. It'll autofill because it's saved. You think it's crazy? Let's address this
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.660]  elephant in the room. You think it's crazy to store all your information and passwords
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.380]  in one place? You're worried about the security? Here's what Dashlane does. They use a master
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:47.220]  password to encrypt all your data. Only you know your master password as it's never sent or stored
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:52.500]  on Dashlane servers. That means even if Dashlane were to get hacked, your information is completely
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:58.740]  safe because everything that's stored on their servers is securely encrypted and you'd need your
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:07.300]  master password to decrypt it. Only you have it and don't forget it. Dashlane Premium is a service

[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:37.460]  My thanks to Dashlane. All right, we got to talk MacBooks before. Okay, yes. So you've got the new
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:42.900]  MacBook Air. You bought it. Yes. I had the company buy it for me, but yes. Well, Jonas has one too.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:48.820]  That's he needed a new laptop. And it was a he was a good sport about it. But he had, you know,
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:54.100]  he needs it at school. He's, you know, his school that kids bring a laptop. He had to use his old
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:31:02.020]  MacBook that had a broken keyboard. So he was literally using an extra magic keyboard connected
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:08.100]  by Bluetooth to his MacBook for like the first two months. Because I knew that the MacBook Airs were
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.380]  coming. And yeah, I wanted to see it before we decided what to buy. And I was glad that we did
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:19.700]  because he is such a good dad. He loves it. You know, it's, you know, it's absolutely, you know,
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:23.620]  no doubt in his mind, he wanted the MacBook Air, which is great, because it was also less money
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:32.340]  than a MacBook Pro. Yeah. All right, why'd you buy it? I mean, this is what I wanted. I wanted
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:39.140]  it for a long time. This was they made the laptop I've wanted for many, many years. And I think I
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:43.060]  tweeted a couple of weeks ago, like it is everything I said in that initial review, I love
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:49.060]  it. The one thing like, yeah, I'm the I'm living the dongle life right now. I've got a couple of
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:54.900]  things hanging out of it as I podcast here. The battery life has been great. The you know,
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:32:00.900]  everything the form factor of it, you know, it's like, I was carrying around a 13 inch old MacBook
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:05.860]  Pro with all of the ports on it. So it was like, I don't even know how many pounds that thing was.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.100]  So I it just it's been great for me. I still you know, I still don't love this keyboard. I just
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:14.740]  don't love this keyboard. But otherwise, like, it's been great. The keyboard is the one thing
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:22.900]  that keeps me from switching to one I'm still on a 2014 13 inch MacBook Pro. And for for reasons,
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:29.860]  you know, basically visual reasons that I, my eyes are at a weird place. And I,
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:36.820]  I see much better looking at a laptop from laptop distance than my iMac. So I used my MacBook Pro
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:42.820]  the last year or so. Mostly, you know, I don't use my iMac anywhere near as much as I would if
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:48.900]  I didn't have the visual thing. And because I'm using it so much, I want the keyboard. And so
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:53.060]  because of the keyboard, I'm sticking with the 2014 MacBook Pro. And also, frankly, my MacBook
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:57.380]  Pro doesn't feel slow at all. Like I don't, you know, it's in it is retina, and it's not
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:01.220]  much heavier than a MacBook Air. But the keyboard keeps me on it.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.980]  I mean, I've adjusted. And it's like, people are like, you know, thought that was an unfair thing
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.500]  of me to say, I think I said, like, the keyboard is still terrible. You know, maybe that's too
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:18.020]  harsh. It's just not as good as what it used to be. But I just, sometimes I feel like I don't
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.180]  write as good. That might seem stupid.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:25.460]  I do too. I'm picky about keyboards, you, you know, and you've always been picky about track
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:31.060]  pads. And you, you know, and one of the reasons I've always been a genuine, I'm not just buttering
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:36.500]  you up, because you're on the show. But a huge, huge fan of your work is that you really have,
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:44.260]  to me, a very open mind about Mac and Windows, like you get both and that you, you know, like,
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.820]  I can't review a Windows laptop, because it doesn't matter how good the hardware is. I think
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:55.540]  Windows is disgusting as an operating system. And it's, I really do like Jonas got a gaming PC for
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.460]  Christmas, and I'm helping him set it up. I haven't used Windows in forever. It's disgusting.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:04.260]  It's worse than ever, in my opinion. I can't I can't get past it. So I couldn't I can't judge
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:09.380]  the trackpad or the keyboard or the performance of Windows 10 is not you think Windows 10 is
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:13.620]  disgusting. I think it's disgusting. I think it's hard. Really? Yeah. Because it's like, it's like
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:17.620]  Windows 10. It's like you go into like the settings and there's like the new window 10
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:22.740]  settings. But then there's an advanced button and you hit it. And it opens up the windows. It opens
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:26.740]  up the windows seven settings. And then the windows seven settings has a button that opens
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:32.100]  up the old XP style thing. Like they're all Yeah, it's a mess. It's just Yeah, it's still a mess.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:38.500]  But I see how it's better in some ways. But you open up the start menu and it looks like all of
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:42.980]  a sudden I'm in Las Vegas. It's like what the hell is going on? There's five columns and all these
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:49.140]  and all these colors and I can't stand it. So I can't Yeah, I can't review one objective. Well,
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:55.060]  look, I don't I don't I'm not a laptop reviewer anymore. I would be very rusty if I mean I did
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:59.220]  for for this for the MacBook Air review. I did do a big call in of what I thought were going to be
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:05.460]  the best Windows laptops and I reviewed an HP and a and a surf the surface laptop next to it because
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:12.020]  I wanted to, to pretty much compare what Apple had said was a big leap ahead in certain places
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:18.260]  to what what the what the windows side has been doing actually for the last two or three years.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:23.780]  So you know, in terms of battery life in terms of keyboard in terms of screen. Look, I found the
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:29.540]  and that's actually one of the so I found everything to you know, pretty be pretty status
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:36.900]  quo for on both sides. I thought the the battery life on this this HP specter I tested was off the
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.860]  charts better but the the screen resolution was a little bit lower and the screen wasn't as nice.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.860]  It's a little bit thicker too. But the biggest pain point for me was that these other really
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:54.660]  super thin, like very stylish. Windows laptops have real keyboards, real keys that press down.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:36:00.500]  So it's like they can do it. Yeah. I know. Like they could do it. But like they they really,
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:07.220]  they love this. They love this butterfly mechanism. Yeah. And I've typed on like a Microsoft surface,
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:12.020]  you know, just to type on it. It's a better keyboard. I would prefer their keyboard over apples
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:17.140]  in a heartbeat surface laptop keyboard is this is basically the same keyboard and I love it. Yeah.
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:24.500]  And even the Google thing. Yeah, the Google pixel the new pixel book. Yeah. Or the pixel book has
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:30.740]  a nice keyboard but the new pixel slate. Yeah. With the round keys with the round keys is fun.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:35.060]  I don't know I haven't I haven't used it for extended period but I think the round keys is
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:41.380]  a gimmick but any but but the feel of the keys is better and it's a super thin it's a you know,
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:46.500]  it's a tablet cover. It's super thin. So clearly Apple could do it. So I'm really fingers crossed
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:53.140]  hoping that they somehow go back to admit defeat and go back to not go back to the old keyboard
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:37:00.420]  but go back to a keyboard that has a better feel. And I used I used a MacBook Pro a 15 inch MacBook
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:05.780]  Pro for six weeks over the summer while reviewing it six weeks and it was the only Mac I used period
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:10.260]  in the whole period in the whole time. So I did get used to it. It's not like yeah, you get used
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.820]  to it. And that's like people saying like, Oh, you said it was terrible. I've been fine with it.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:19.620]  I'm like, Yeah, okay, you get used to it. And it's fine. But when I go back to the old one,
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:25.780]  just feels like home. Yeah, just feels so right. And usually in the you know, when you when when
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:31.220]  Apple makes a big change like that, when you go back to the old thing, it feels gross or weird or
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.700]  Oh my god, I can't believe it should always feel bad to go back to the old one. Whereas the keyboard
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:42.180]  feels good back to the home button on the iPhone eight or something. Yeah, it's like, yeah, that's
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:47.540]  like, yeah, felt like it feels longer. And like, I'm like, I have to move. And yeah, it just feels
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:52.180]  ridiculous. I honestly, I've been hearing from people about because of this 10. R piece that I
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.700]  wrote about how there didn't go to the 10. R. And they bought the iPhone seven or eight because of
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:01.220]  the home button because x, y and z reasons. And I just think that's, I mean, I don't write back all
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.020]  these people. But I think it's short sighted. That's why companies most companies don't change
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:09.460]  when they have a hit product, right? They because they don't want to hear from the people who,
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:15.060]  you know, the anti early adopters and want what they're familiar with, you know, and don't really
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:21.620]  have an open mind about trying the new thing. I wrote about this, I speculate that I think that
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:26.100]  maybe that might be one of the reasons the 10. R is a little bit less popular than Apple anticipated
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:31.620]  is that people who maybe were like thinking, maybe I'll get a new iPhone this year, and they don't
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.780]  want to get one because none of them have the home button or the headphone jack, and they're,
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:40.340]  they're not I, I have heard from those readers, because I think they read the Wall Street Journal,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:45.700]  and they definitely read the Wall Street Journal. And there's there's something to that. Yeah. I
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:51.620]  mean, there's also the the entry level price point of the iPhone seven. They're like, I don't have to
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.900]  deal with this whole new thing. And it's cheaper. Okay, I'm fine. On the flip side, I'll tell you
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:03.380]  this, and I'll bet you'll agree. I love the new MacBook trackpads. I love it. I think that the
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:10.180]  fake haptic click that they give you is the it's the most uncanny thing I've experienced. Like,
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:15.540]  it's hard to believe that it's not a real click. It really is. And then when I went back to my
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.820]  this 2014 has the actual what did they call it the seesaw click board, you know, trackpad that
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:25.860]  actually moves, you know, and has like less clickiness at the top because it's a lever.
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:33.620]  It does feel gross. It's absolutely a huge step back. The current trackpads are just amazing.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:40.420]  Yeah, I mean, I just, I had also gone from that 13 inch, which we had a smaller surface area. And
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:46.180]  I'm just like, this is, I love this. I love this laptop. Yeah. Like for me for like, this past
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:52.820]  year, like Apple gave me like, you know, you could look at can look at what what's been going on with
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:57.220]  their stock price and everything that's, you know, been around it, but they made some really great
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:02.420]  updates this past year. Yeah, I think that the people hemming and hawing over the tech specs
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:07.700]  of the MacBook Air are missing the point. It's, you know, it's a I mean, around the
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:13.540]  town and that you can benchmark it and you for you know, $100 more you can get the MacBook Pro
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:20.420]  that doesn't have the touch bar and it's you know, faster and it's only slightly heavier and
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:28.660]  the same thickness in the back, etc, etc. I think that the MacBook Airs appeal though is large,
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.100]  I feel like that teardrop shape is part of the appeal and it doesn't matter how
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:39.540]  if it's actually not by volume that much less volume than the one that doesn't teardrop I it's
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:42.660]  just a nicer shape because when you take it out, you never orient it wrong.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:48.020]  Yeah, I mean, the form like I just prefer the smaller size of this air. For me, the biggest
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:53.140]  question is like, why is that MacBook still around? And I get the arguments about it sort of
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:41:00.740]  like, you know, smaller stat, more stylish, like sleeker looking, maybe I don't actually feel that
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:07.220]  way. But on the pro, I think there's a lot of reasons to go up. But I don't like the size is
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:12.740]  not does not bother me. Yeah. And I don't think it's I mean, that is where I do see the gap
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:18.900]  between the two like I would far rather have this air for both battery life and for the size of it.
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:26.260]  Yeah. And the combination of no touch bar, but does have the touch ID is really is sort of one
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:32.420]  of those. Hey, this is what everybody was asking for. Yeah. And when I mean, I, I'd say I was
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:36.660]  thinking about this, when I have my Apple Watch on, I really do prefer the unlock with the Apple
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:42.260]  Watch. Right? Like it just is faster. But yeah, it's handy to have that there. Yeah, the touch
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:48.660]  bars of what's real. I don't know. I've just always see that thing on people's like their
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:54.500]  laptops and meetings and just like, Have you ever touched that? It looks cool. I know. Yeah. But I
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:58.340]  have to say that's something I didn't. I don't hate it. And I don't hate it like some people do.
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:03.540]  But like I said, using it for six weeks nonstop. I didn't hate it. And there's some things I like
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:09.380]  about it. I like dragging the sliders around for the brightness and volume. But when I went back
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:15.060]  to not having it, I didn't miss it. I did not miss the touch bar. Or Yeah, I didn't miss it at all.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:20.340]  I don't hate it, but I didn't miss it. And I feel like this laptop. I don't there's there's very
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:25.540]  little about it that I would change. And there's very, I mean, the keyboards, one of them, and they
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:30.180]  probably won't change that. And the ports are one of them. But I've lived I've learned to live with
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:34.820]  that far more than I thought I would. And isn't the most baffling one the mag safe?
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:41.220]  Yeah, I miss mag safe. I really do. It feels like such a step backwards. And I don't know what the
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:47.220]  solution is. And I get that USB C power delivery has all sorts of actual technical advantages
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:55.540]  and charging performance. And it's a standard plug. But man, the say that mag safe has saved
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.500]  my MacBook, you know, and this is something Yeah, and this is something me and you had talked about
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:07.220]  on some other podcasts. One thing that bothers me is that there's no USB C port on the right
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:12.020]  hand side. Yeah, yeah. Because when I'm in bed, we had this conversation, I think around the
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:18.420]  MacBooks last year. Yeah. Or two years ago, I wanted on the other side. Yep. Yep. I agree
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:24.260]  to that. That is. It's nice that you can charge from both sides on the MacBooks that do have them
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:28.980]  on both sides. And they're not having it on both sides. Just it. It's a small thing. But I've got
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:37.700]  something USB. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like the cord is going behind the thing to go in to charge.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:44.420]  Yeah. But I'm fine with it. I mean, yeah, I've gone over the time that you have. But I sure I
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:50.980]  have three things I need to review in my inbox. It is always a pleasure having you on the show.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.340]  Everybody can read your excellent work in the Wall Street Journal. And on Twitter,
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:01.060]  you are at Joanna Stern, right? No funny punctuation.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:08.020]  No. What you got? What are you working on this week? Can you say or is it to see? Yeah, I mean,
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:13.060]  I'm doing? Well, I don't know when it's gonna come out. So I'm going on vacation. I'm trying
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:20.820]  to finish this piece about webcams. Which was prompted by me, like getting this new laptop
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.860]  and being like, Do I need a webcam cover? And I started to dig into it. And I don't know. What's
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.940]  your answer where it's fully going? Yeah, I'm gonna get a webcam cover. Are you really? I don't
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:33.540]  I don't I don't I don't worry about it. I don't think that I think that's not an issue.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.780]  Yeah, well, you'll see in the piece why I now feel like Yeah.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:51.380]  Did you know this? What is the rule? It's Oh, the Apple's latest security guide
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:58.820]  says that I think it starts with the MacBook Air when the cover is closed. The microphone
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:05.780]  is physically detached. It's there's a physical disconnection. And and it's only the microphone
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:09.220]  because you know, if it's closed, you don't need to worry about the camera because the camera's,
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:15.140]  you know, in the dark already close, close, right? It's a really clever, clever idea. But it
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:20.740]  did raise the notion to me that if Apple thinks enough about it to do that, is it just to give
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:25.540]  people peace of mind? Or is there something to worry about when it's open? So this is the piece
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:31.700]  that I'm basically after, because, you know, for me, I also have cameras all over my house now. And
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:36.340]  so I'm like, well, people are covering their webcams at work and on your laptops, but they're
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:42.500]  got an S cameras, cameras everywhere and all this. So, yeah, I'm not sure where it's all leading.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:47.220]  But that's I've sort of been digging into it. I'm not positive. Don't be this piece that next week,
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:50.660]  but at some point, someone will read that piece. I thought it was interesting. You know, last year,
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:57.300]  when they invited a handful of us to have that Mac Pro roundtable, me and Panzerino and, you know,
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:06.420]  Fried and John Petchkowski, I think, and Lance Ulanoff was the other, the fifth. Phil Schiller
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:12.980]  was reading, had a keynote prepared. And I'm certain that it was his personal MacBook that
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:16.660]  he was using. Does not have a, and I remember thinking like, I wonder if he covers it. No,
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:21.780]  doesn't cover it. Yeah, I'd be one of the things I'm doing is trying to reach out to Mark Zuckerberg
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:25.540]  to find out, but I'm sure there'll be no comment on that. I'll bet they will have no comment. But
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:29.860]  here's I want to say something about that. I've been meaning to get this off my chest forever.
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:34.660]  So there's a picture of Mark Zuckerberg from a handful of years ago inside Facebook
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:41.780]  doing something and he's at a MacBook and the camera is covered. I don't think there's any
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:46.260]  reason to believe that that's his MacBook. I think he was there. I think he was posing for a picture.
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:52.500]  It might be. But I think that the assumption that that's his personal MacBook is has no validity
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.580]  whatsoever, because it was sort of a staged photo. And you know what it's like when you're staging a
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:02.180]  photo, you just put props up, you know? Well, you know what, I'll ask that question. Yeah,
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:09.700]  I would ask that question. I think that the fact that our collective tech world has assumed as fact
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:17.220]  that that was his MacBook is, but he would be a high value target. Oh, definitely. And given how
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:23.780]  easy it seems to be to hack someone's webcam for what I'm finding in my reporting. Yeah, I don't
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:29.700]  know. All right. All right. I can't wait to read the report. Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciate
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:59.700]  it. Great to be here and speak to you again.
