[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  Yeah, we could get right into it.
[00:01.480 --> 00:02.000]  So how long?
[00:02.000 --> 00:02.640]  When did you?
[00:02.640 --> 00:05.880]  You had the dev kit for Apple TV?
[00:05.880 --> 00:08.180]  Yes.
[00:08.180 --> 00:09.640]  And what's the story?
[00:09.640 --> 00:11.600]  I mean, I guess it doesn't matter.
[00:11.600 --> 00:13.320]  I'm curious, I did not get the dev kit.
[00:13.320 --> 00:15.080]  And I guess I should have signed up for it.
[00:15.080 --> 00:19.280]  I just assumed that I would get a review unit.
[00:19.280 --> 00:20.880]  But they didn't.
[00:20.880 --> 00:22.320]  I didn't get one until yesterday.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.040]  So we're recording here on Friday, October 30.
[00:25.040 --> 00:28.560]  I got mine from Apple yesterday on the 29th.
[00:28.560 --> 00:30.080]  And I don't think I've touched one.
[00:30.080 --> 00:33.200]  Yeah, no, I haven't since the event last month.
[00:33.200 --> 00:35.280]  Yeah, you got kind of hosed a bit on that.
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.200]  Because a lot of press outlets just signed up and got one.
[00:40.200 --> 00:40.720]  Yeah.
[00:40.720 --> 00:42.320]  Well, is that what happened?
[00:42.320 --> 00:44.480]  But I think a lot of them did get review units too.
[00:44.480 --> 00:47.520]  And I just, you know, it seems haphazard.
[00:47.520 --> 00:49.760]  Doesn't seem like there was any rhyme or reason to it.
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.800]  Like who got one and who didn't?
[00:51.800 --> 00:55.240]  Like TechCrunch didn't get it until yesterday either.
[00:55.240 --> 00:55.920]  Oh, yeah?
[00:55.920 --> 00:57.200]  Yeah.
[00:57.200 --> 00:59.920]  Oh, I don't think I don't know if Renee got one.
[00:59.920 --> 01:01.120]  No, he didn't.
[01:01.120 --> 01:02.480]  Serenity did.
[01:02.480 --> 01:03.440]  Oh, really?
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.880]  Well, she had access to one.
[01:04.880 --> 01:06.760]  I know that.
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.000]  Yeah, it's such a weird thing.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.320]  Like it's meta.
[01:09.320 --> 01:10.600]  It's so inside baseball.
[01:10.600 --> 01:12.960]  But I guess that's what the point of podcasts is.
[01:12.960 --> 01:14.080]  Yeah.
[01:14.080 --> 01:20.280]  Is that it was the least secretive device
[01:20.280 --> 01:21.520]  once it was unveiled.
[01:21.520 --> 01:24.040]  You know, so it was unveiled on stage in September.
[01:24.040 --> 01:26.440]  I think they did a pretty good job keeping it under wraps.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.960]  Everybody knew that a new Apple TV was coming,
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.800]  but nobody had screenshots or anything.
[01:31.800 --> 01:35.160]  Nobody knew what the remote was exactly like.
[01:35.160 --> 01:38.440]  No, I'd heard stuff, but nothing.
[01:38.440 --> 01:40.200]  I mean, I know people who'd seen them,
[01:40.200 --> 01:42.160]  but nobody even told me what they look like.
[01:42.160 --> 01:42.480]  Right.
[01:42.480 --> 01:47.400]  But then they started taking the developer requests
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.960]  like the next day.
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.840]  And some people started getting them like a week later.
[01:51.840 --> 01:54.200]  And I guess you were under an NDA,
[01:54.200 --> 01:56.640]  based on your ADC account, and that you weren't
[01:56.640 --> 01:57.760]  supposed to write about it.
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.000]  But it certainly wasn't a well-kept secret.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.360]  There was an additional NDA that came with the dev kit.
[02:03.360 --> 02:05.240]  Like a new NDA.
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.360]  Yeah, they told you not to.
[02:06.360 --> 02:08.360]  You're not allowed to do anything with this dev kit.
[02:08.360 --> 02:08.840]  Right.
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.480]  You're not allowed to talk about it.
[02:10.480 --> 02:12.280]  My favorite is never works.
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.920]  Well, the best example of that would
[02:14.920 --> 02:19.080]  be the iFixit guys, who signed up for the dev kit,
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.560]  agreed to an NDA.
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.080]  And then as soon as it came, they took it apart
[02:23.080 --> 02:28.360]  and published their take apart.
[02:28.360 --> 02:31.000]  I was pretty frustrated, actually.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.560]  Because dev kits are a very rare thing for Apple to do.
[02:35.560 --> 02:36.040]  Right.
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.440]  And it's like, we don't want to piss them off and make
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.120]  them not do it.
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.080]  Like, I think it's great that they did this.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.480]  Yeah, I think it's great, too.
[02:43.480 --> 02:47.280]  I think it was a mistake to sell them for a buck.
[02:47.280 --> 02:49.280]  They should have been like double, triple the price
[02:49.280 --> 02:51.920]  of what the actual shipping unit was going to be.
[02:51.920 --> 02:54.120]  Yeah, why do you think they did it that way?
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.160]  Well, I think they wanted everybody to get as frictionless
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.240]  as possible and encourage people to work
[03:01.240 --> 03:02.440]  on their awesome platform.
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.240]  They'd probably have to charge a dollar for some reason.
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.440]  Yeah, like maybe in the way that Steve Jobs
[03:09.440 --> 03:12.400]  had to take a $1 salary, I think there
[03:12.400 --> 03:14.760]  was some kind of legal requirement.
[03:14.760 --> 03:15.880]  Yeah, accounting.
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.920]  Like, you have to pay your CEO or something like that.
[03:18.920 --> 03:20.960]  I swear that it was something like that.
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.320]  And maybe it was something like that, too,
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.840]  where they have to sell it for some amount of money.
[03:24.840 --> 03:27.360]  Just to account for it in some way, other than.
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.520]  Yeah.
[03:28.520 --> 03:30.160]  Anyway, so.
[03:30.160 --> 03:33.360]  Welcome to the talk show, America's favorite accounting.
[03:33.360 --> 03:34.200]  Accountant show.
[03:37.640 --> 03:40.160]  Talk show.
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.040]  Sponsored this week by Salesforce.
[03:42.040 --> 03:44.280]  No, so anyway, though, they had these out there.
[03:44.280 --> 03:46.800]  Lots of journalists and writers bought them,
[03:46.800 --> 03:49.000]  even though they weren't going to develop apps on them.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.880]  And I guess they mostly stuck to the NDA,
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.480]  but it wasn't like it was tough to get.
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.200]  But then the reviews all, there was clearly
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.240]  some number of people, just like with every other Apple
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.000]  device, iPhones and iPads, that they got pre-release access
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.520]  to them probably about a week before.
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.200]  And then the embargo was clearly,
[04:11.200 --> 04:14.200]  I think it was 6 o'clock Eastern on Wednesday,
[04:14.200 --> 04:15.920]  because all of a sudden.
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.240]  And when you had a review up.
[04:17.240 --> 04:17.760]  Right.
[04:17.760 --> 04:22.560]  And I was actually out having dinner with our friend
[04:22.560 --> 04:29.320]  Whiskus and Brady Harron, the guy from Hello Internet.
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.640]  He's over here in the States.
[04:31.640 --> 04:33.640]  And we were out, and it was like all of a sudden,
[04:33.640 --> 04:34.800]  we were talking about the fact that there were
[04:34.800 --> 04:36.400]  no reviews of the Apple TV.
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.480]  And then we were at dinner, and then all of a sudden,
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.520]  it was like all of a sudden there were like 15 reviews
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.480]  of Apple TV.
[04:43.480 --> 04:45.640]  But it was weird.
[04:45.640 --> 04:46.880]  iMore wasn't on that list.
[04:46.880 --> 04:48.800]  TechCrunch wasn't on the list.
[04:48.800 --> 04:51.120]  It's very strange.
[04:51.120 --> 04:54.560]  I guess the actual was, which makes sense, I think.
[04:54.560 --> 04:55.080]  Yeah.
[04:55.080 --> 04:57.160]  There's like a lot of media stuff that they cover.
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.760]  And Christina is pretty, she's been kicking ass recently.
[05:00.760 --> 05:03.120]  Yeah, actually just before we started recording,
[05:03.120 --> 05:04.760]  I actually just linked to her review.
[05:04.760 --> 05:07.080]  It's the only one I've read completely
[05:07.080 --> 05:09.600]  and just linked to it, because I thought she nailed it.
[05:09.600 --> 05:12.720]  I was like, boy, that's every single thing there is about it.
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:13.600 --> 05:15.800]  And she's been getting good interviews and stuff
[05:15.800 --> 05:18.520]  recently too, so good for her.
[05:18.520 --> 05:21.240]  Yeah, because who'd she disinterview, Johnny Ive?
[05:21.240 --> 05:24.560]  Johnny Ive, and I'm going to blank on it now.
[05:24.560 --> 05:25.120]  I don't know.
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.120]  Should have been a note.
[05:26.120 --> 05:28.480]  Right, well, and she did, and she's
[05:28.480 --> 05:33.120]  the one who got access to when Tim Cook did the meet
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.360]  and greet with the teenagers at WWDC.
[05:37.360 --> 05:39.520]  Yeah, she went and covered that.
[05:39.520 --> 05:45.280]  And I think that was like an impromptu conversation really.
[05:45.280 --> 05:48.880]  I think it might have been, but I think it was clear,
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.440]  right place, right time.
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.840]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.400]  That's good reporting.
[05:53.400 --> 05:53.900]  Yeah.
[05:56.600 --> 05:58.800]  So I know you've only had it a day.
[05:58.800 --> 06:02.920]  I've had mine longer.
[06:02.920 --> 06:05.640]  I guess I can talk about that, but whatever, I have.
[06:08.720 --> 06:11.600]  Well, I am actually mad, because if they don't do another Dev
[06:11.600 --> 06:12.840]  Kit, I'm going to be sad.
[06:12.840 --> 06:13.840]  Oh, here's my question for you.
[06:13.840 --> 06:14.800]  This is my question for you.
[06:14.800 --> 06:16.800]  My question, before we go on to it,
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.520]  is what was your experience like?
[06:18.520 --> 06:22.560]  Have you been able to upgrade from the betas of the OS
[06:22.560 --> 06:23.800]  to the GM?
[06:23.800 --> 06:26.120]  Yeah, yeah, it's that easy.
[06:26.120 --> 06:30.800]  But it didn't require using the diagnostic port, or it did?
[06:30.800 --> 06:32.040]  It does.
[06:32.040 --> 06:33.600]  Whereby diagnostic port, I mean.
[06:33.600 --> 06:34.520]  USB port, right.
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.360]  But they even tell you in the instructions,
[06:36.360 --> 06:38.920]  they're like USB-C port, and then they're like,
[06:38.920 --> 06:41.640]  this is only used for diagnostics.
[06:41.640 --> 06:44.720]  Yeah, well, flashing an OS onto your thing
[06:44.720 --> 06:47.160]  is count, I guess.
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.600]  You just go to the website, you download the package,
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.840]  like the OS package, and then you connect iTunes to it,
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.720]  and it shows up in iTunes.
[06:57.720 --> 07:01.160]  And then you just, what is this, like, option, click, restore,
[07:01.160 --> 07:03.240]  and use the package you've got.
[07:03.240 --> 07:06.000]  Right, so it's exactly like doing it with a phone.
[07:06.000 --> 07:06.920]  Yeah, it's identical.
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.960]  So you connect it to your Mac with USB,
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.720]  like when you connect a phone, and then you
[07:13.720 --> 07:15.280]  can just do it from the iTunes app.
[07:15.280 --> 07:19.040]  Yeah, and it's a USB-C, which is like one of the first times
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.720]  I've been super thankful that I've owned a MacBook,
[07:21.720 --> 07:23.800]  because I'm like, oh, it just works.
[07:23.800 --> 07:26.560]  I don't have to worry about anything.
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.080]  Yeah, so I guess if your computer was a MacBook,
[07:30.080 --> 07:33.320]  the new MacBook One port thing, you
[07:33.320 --> 07:36.680]  would have to have a USB-C to USB-C cable.
[07:36.680 --> 07:37.800]  Yeah, that's what I did.
[07:37.800 --> 07:38.800]  Right, oh, really?
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.160]  Yeah, so I've got to.
[07:43.160 --> 07:44.360]  I mean, when I bought the MacBook,
[07:44.360 --> 07:47.080]  I bought like two little adapter things, like one for USB-C
[07:47.080 --> 07:53.560]  and one that turns USB-C into an HDMI out and has a USB port.
[07:53.560 --> 07:56.520]  So when did the App Store go live?
[07:56.520 --> 07:57.560]  Like how?
[07:57.560 --> 07:58.400]  Yesterday.
[07:58.400 --> 07:59.480]  OK.
[07:59.480 --> 08:01.800]  I couldn't tell you what time, but I think around noon.
[08:01.800 --> 08:06.120]  Because what we had to do was, so we had a GM candidate
[08:06.120 --> 08:09.120]  for the past few days.
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.520]  Then to get the App Store, and this was kind of confusing,
[08:11.520 --> 08:15.640]  we needed to re-download the OS and flash that back
[08:15.640 --> 08:20.360]  onto the device for the app to sort of show up.
[08:20.360 --> 08:25.240]  But if I'm not mistaken, I think the version numbers are identical.
[08:25.240 --> 08:28.680]  So they flipped one switch, or I don't know exactly what they did,
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.720]  but whatever.
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.920]  Right now, mine is if I just got it out of a box from a store.
[08:35.920 --> 08:38.080]  Huh.
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.240]  So it's exactly the same.
[08:40.240 --> 08:41.560]  As mind-setting is, yeah.
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.040]  All right, so first run experience.
[08:48.040 --> 08:54.320]  Pretty cool the way that they do the, if you want to, just unlock your iPhone
[08:54.320 --> 08:57.680]  and get it near the Apple TV.
[08:57.680 --> 09:03.560]  That is the way computers should work, like all of them.
[09:03.560 --> 09:05.200]  If you can do it with Macs, do it with Macs.
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.640]  Just do it.
[09:06.640 --> 09:10.880]  And it doesn't transfer everything, but it certainly
[09:10.880 --> 09:13.720]  gets you most of the way there.
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.120]  And just getting it so that it's on your Wi-Fi is huge.
[09:17.120 --> 09:18.800]  It's a godsend, yeah.
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.680]  Like you just wave your, it's basically magic.
[09:21.680 --> 09:24.120]  And I know that's way overused when you talk about Apple stuff,
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.840]  but you take your phone, you put it close to your box.
[09:26.840 --> 09:31.880]  And the older ones did this too, but it's just cool to have a new thing.
[09:31.880 --> 09:34.680]  And it would just say, yeah, connecting to the network,
[09:34.680 --> 09:37.240]  and it logs you in, it's got all the passwords.
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.960]  It's got your iCloud information.
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.520]  So you're, what are we calling it now?
[09:44.520 --> 09:45.600]  Apple ID.
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.200]  Your Apple ID, thank you, yeah.
[09:47.200 --> 09:49.480]  All your Apple ID stuff is over.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.720]  So you've got all the Game Center stuff set up.
[09:51.720 --> 09:54.080]  You've got your photos.
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.520]  All of that is just done.
[09:56.520 --> 10:01.120]  And it's amazing, because passwords are a pain in the ass to type.
[10:01.120 --> 10:04.400]  Anyway, but let alone on a crazy keyboard thing.
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.320]  Yeah.
[10:06.320 --> 10:15.600]  I did have to enter my Apple ID password though one time to enable purchases.
[10:15.600 --> 10:17.280]  Yeah, I think I did that too.
[10:17.280 --> 10:19.680]  And I can see why.
[10:19.680 --> 10:23.520]  It's sort of like, I think the same logic, the way that,
[10:23.520 --> 10:26.840]  like when you restart your iPhone, you have to enter the password once
[10:26.840 --> 10:29.920]  before you can go back to just using touch ID.
[10:29.920 --> 10:33.640]  Yeah, I think the notion is that you can unlock the device,
[10:33.640 --> 10:37.200]  but if you're going to do any real monetary damage,
[10:37.200 --> 10:39.440]  it wants to make sure that you are who you say you are.
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.640]  Yeah, I kind of wish that, and I wonder, and I, yeah, it's like they,
[10:44.640 --> 10:49.760]  before you can do, yeah, exactly what you said, monetary damage,
[10:49.760 --> 10:51.280]  you've really got to enter your password.
[10:51.280 --> 10:52.960]  I guess I can see the logic behind that.
[10:52.960 --> 10:55.880]  But entering a password on the goddamn TV is so,
[10:55.880 --> 10:57.600]  it's still such a pain in the ass.
[10:57.600 --> 11:00.080]  I still am tempted to suggest that maybe you
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.200]  should be able to use touch ID on your phone.
[11:03.200 --> 11:08.080]  But there's, I guess, you know what I mean?
[11:08.080 --> 11:13.360]  Like if somehow it would send you an alert,
[11:13.360 --> 11:15.880]  like the way that like with our family sharing,
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.400]  if Jonas wants to get an app, me and Amy get these alerts that say,
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.200]  hey, Jonas, who's a member of, a kid in your family sharing plan
[11:25.200 --> 11:28.800]  wants to get this app, whatever the name of the app is, is this OK?
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.960]  And actually, I guess, I think they actually stopped letting you use touch
[11:33.960 --> 11:35.880]  ID for that, though, now that I think about it.
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.480]  I think now you have to enter your password on the phone.
[11:40.480 --> 11:42.840]  I guess maybe what I wish you could do with the Apple TV,
[11:42.840 --> 11:45.120]  and maybe you can, is maybe somehow use the,
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.720]  maybe you can, can you still use the old remote app to enter passwords?
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.440]  I think the old remote app is bust.
[11:52.440 --> 11:55.520]  The old remote, physical remote, works, which is interesting.
[11:55.520 --> 11:56.080]  Oh, does it?
[11:56.080 --> 11:57.080]  The IR one?
[11:57.080 --> 11:57.640]  Yeah.
[11:57.640 --> 11:58.800]  No, I didn't know that.
[11:58.800 --> 12:01.080]  Yeah, I did it by accident and it totally worked.
[12:01.080 --> 12:01.920]  Look at that.
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.680]  Until you start tapping and clicking and dragging your finger around.
[12:04.680 --> 12:05.760]  Exactly.
[12:05.760 --> 12:08.400]  That's actually funny.
[12:08.400 --> 12:09.640]  Yeah, I don't know about that.
[12:09.640 --> 12:13.680]  So after you enter that password, then they ask you,
[12:13.680 --> 12:16.520]  do you want to use this password?
[12:16.520 --> 12:17.960]  Do you want me to prompt you for the password?
[12:17.960 --> 12:19.840]  Never?
[12:19.840 --> 12:21.400]  I don't know what it is.
[12:21.400 --> 12:26.320]  I think it's, yeah, it's like, it's like your three options are
[12:26.320 --> 12:28.080]  don't ever ask me for my password again.
[12:28.080 --> 12:30.560]  Just let me buy stuff.
[12:30.560 --> 12:33.680]  Which I don't know about you, but that's what I do.
[12:33.680 --> 12:34.960]  Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
[12:34.960 --> 12:35.640]  And I'm lucky.
[12:35.640 --> 12:38.360]  I can, I definitely understand why some parents wouldn't be able to do that,
[12:38.360 --> 12:41.960]  but Jonas is super trustworthy with stuff like that.
[12:41.960 --> 12:45.960]  And even if he decided to risk it, he's only going to get away with it once.
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.040]  Exactly.
[12:49.040 --> 12:52.440]  But it's so much more convenient and I'm not worried, you know what I mean?
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.560]  Like, unlike a device that's in your pocket that you might leave in a cab
[12:55.560 --> 12:57.800]  or something like that, your Apple TV is not leaving your home.
[12:57.800 --> 12:58.560]  It's in your living room.
[12:58.560 --> 13:01.000]  Like, you know, it's a safe place.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.320]  All right, if somebody who I don't trust is operating my Apple TV,
[13:04.320 --> 13:06.320]  I've got bigger problems
[13:06.320 --> 13:09.800]  than if they're going to like buy movies that I don't want.
[13:09.800 --> 13:12.120]  Wouldn't that be like the ultimate dick move for like a burglar?
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.960]  Like before he before he disconnects your Apple TV
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.800]  to rip it off and steal your TV set before he takes it.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.400]  He just quick logs in and buys some shitty movies like subscribes
[13:24.400 --> 13:27.600]  you to like all the Adam Sandler movies or something like that
[13:27.600 --> 13:28.920]  and then leaves the house.
[13:28.920 --> 13:31.160]  So not only did you get burgled,
[13:31.160 --> 13:33.880]  you got stuck putting a bill for a bunch of movies you didn't like.
[13:33.880 --> 13:40.120]  That actually sounds like a scene out of an Adam Sandler movie.
[13:40.120 --> 13:45.520]  I think we're on to something here.
[13:45.520 --> 13:51.640]  He buys you a bunch of albums on Apple or Apple Music that you don't want to.
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.200]  Sounds you up to Apple Music. Yeah.
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.440]  So anyway, first run experience.
[13:58.440 --> 14:03.440]  I don't want to I feel like I've already I've already complained too much.
[14:03.440 --> 14:06.440]  Like, I still want it to be better, but it's so good.
[14:06.440 --> 14:11.720]  It is such a better experience than any other first run experience I've ever seen.
[14:11.720 --> 14:18.800]  So I've done it manually quite a bit because it really just didn't have.
[14:18.800 --> 14:21.360]  Well, I think they had it, but they told you it was pretty flaky.
[14:21.360 --> 14:22.640]  So I didn't use it.
[14:22.640 --> 14:25.920]  And man, it's a pain in the ass when you.
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.200]  So I shouldn't say it's a pain in the ass.
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.440]  Comparatively, it's night and day
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.080]  between laboriously entering in all your email addresses and like.
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.840]  Yeah. And you got to do it for a few different things.
[14:36.840 --> 14:38.520]  It's a huge pain in the ass.
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.440]  Wi-Fi network. That sucks.
[14:41.440 --> 14:42.840]  This was amazing.
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.200]  It was the first time I tried it yesterday.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.960]  It was the first time I tried the Bluetooth magic and it was great.
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.080]  And I know, you know,
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.000]  we know some of the people who work on Apple TV and have for a while.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  And I know that a couple of them have been, you know,
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.920]  personally take it personally that they want this experience to be better
[15:00.920 --> 15:03.880]  for years, because I know one of the features the old Apple TV had.
[15:03.880 --> 15:05.680]  I actually don't know if the new one still supports it.
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.280]  But remember how the old Apple TV would let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard?
[15:10.280 --> 15:13.960]  Yeah. And then you could use that to enter passwords
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.560]  and stuff like that the first time just if you wanted to.
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.000]  And I thought that's a great idea and I'm so glad that they did it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.680]  But I never I've never once actually done it, because it always seems to me
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.040]  like if I'm already at the couch and I've got the stupid remote in my hand
[15:29.960 --> 15:32.920]  where by stupid remote, I mean the old remote and
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.680]  in my mind, the pain of just sitting there
[15:37.680 --> 15:40.520]  and pecking away at the onscreen keyboard to enter my password.
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.240]  As much as it annoys me, it doesn't annoy me enough to go up to my office,
[15:44.240 --> 15:47.840]  get a Bluetooth keyboard, come downstairs, pair it and go.
[15:47.840 --> 15:50.400]  Yeah. Even if you had one lying around in your living room,
[15:50.840 --> 15:51.920]  I'd find it annoying.
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.400]  All right. Half the time when I watch TV, it's because I want to stop doing
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.600]  my work, which involves typing on a keyboard.
[15:59.640 --> 16:02.120]  You know what I mean? Like, I just don't want a keyboard anywhere near me.
[16:02.200 --> 16:05.400]  I will hunt and peck with that stupid controller if I have to.
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.600]  But I just never really wanted to pair any Bluetooth stuff up to it.
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.200]  It's cool. You could do it.
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.400]  Yeah. Some of the stuff that works automatically really impressed me.
[16:16.960 --> 16:20.480]  Like without me having to configure it at all, the volume up,
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.440]  volume down buttons automatically controlled the volume on my TV.
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.240]  Yeah. Interestingly, it does it on your TV, too.
[16:29.720 --> 16:30.200]  You know what I mean?
[16:30.200 --> 16:32.760]  Rather than increasing and decreasing the volume
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.680]  coming out of the back of your set top box and the Apple TV,
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.080]  it's doing it like you see your TV UI come up when it does it.
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.080]  Exactly. Right.
[16:42.320 --> 16:47.080]  And I think that those IR things have like a standard set of actions that.
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.880]  The most equipment takes.
[16:49.880 --> 16:52.280]  Yeah, so I think that that's how it figured it out.
[16:54.360 --> 16:57.080]  But it was a pleasant surprise is, man, I used to hate.
[16:58.080 --> 17:00.200]  I mean, we're complaining about very first world problems here,
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.320]  but I used to hate having to find the other remote control just to lower the volume.
[17:03.360 --> 17:07.040]  Yeah. So for me, it actually I was very impressed that it worked.
[17:07.040 --> 17:08.280]  And it does exactly what you said.
[17:08.280 --> 17:15.360]  It shows my pioneer UI, you know, and so you get this.
[17:15.480 --> 17:17.000]  All of a sudden you have this. It is ugly.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.920]  And that's exactly at the event.
[17:18.920 --> 17:22.240]  It was so funny at the Apple event in September when they were showing this,
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.440]  whenever anybody would I forget what brand of TVs they were using.
[17:26.360 --> 17:27.920]  They were, of course, all identical.
[17:27.920 --> 17:30.840]  But whatever brand it was, maybe it was Panasonic, but doesn't matter.
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.440]  Somebody like Panasonic.
[17:32.440 --> 17:34.200]  When you'd hit volume up and volume down
[17:34.200 --> 17:37.360]  and you'd see the onscreen interface for the volume, the Apple,
[17:37.360 --> 17:40.440]  the product marketing people who was who was ever there supervising
[17:40.440 --> 17:43.840]  the demo would always and every time say, that's not our UI.
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.080]  That's the TV set.
[17:46.080 --> 17:47.440]  So they try to spin it.
[17:47.440 --> 17:48.280]  It was like this.
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.400]  And of course, it's just like always with the Apple product marketing people.
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.480]  It was a rehearsed line.
[17:53.480 --> 17:55.520]  So I'm not quoting it exactly right.
[17:55.520 --> 18:00.280]  But it amused me because it was perfectly calibrated to do two things.
[18:00.920 --> 18:03.960]  One, it was setting it up as, hey, this is a cool feature.
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.480]  Our remote will talk to your TV.
[18:07.760 --> 18:12.440]  And then two, it was excusing the jankiness of the onscreen graphics.
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.880]  Do not think that we designed this little
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.120]  crazy blue bar that shows you what the volume is at right now.
[18:20.280 --> 18:21.840]  Yeah, that's cool.
[18:21.840 --> 18:22.520]  That's a good feature.
[18:22.520 --> 18:25.000]  Also, it makes a lot of sense to do it that way, because
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.880]  there's no synchronization problem
[18:28.880 --> 18:31.960]  then between what people are expecting from their television remote control
[18:31.960 --> 18:34.720]  and what the volume of the Apple TV device is.
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.280]  Like if you hit mute on your old TV remote, it's going to mute.
[18:42.040 --> 18:44.720]  I think it's just good to have one
[18:44.720 --> 18:49.000]  less level of confusion about what the output is actually going to be.
[18:49.200 --> 18:52.560]  So for me, I was impressed that that worked.
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.920]  But it actually is useless because I don't use the volume from my TV.
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.760]  I have this little box from Bose that powers the speakers on our TV.
[19:01.760 --> 19:03.920]  And so we have to use this Bose remote control.
[19:03.920 --> 19:06.960]  And the Bose thing is a little it's like a receiver.
[19:06.960 --> 19:10.320]  I guess you call it a receiver, but it's it's even smaller than the Apple TV.
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.960]  It's just this tiny little black box that's like a little puck
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.240]  that the speakers are plugged into.
[19:19.480 --> 19:22.960]  And so you can you make the TV to learn the remote? Yeah.
[19:23.320 --> 19:24.960]  OK, no. Yeah.
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.760]  So you go to Apple in the Apple TV, you say it's you go to remote
[19:28.760 --> 19:30.920]  and it's like, do you want to control a different device?
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.200]  And the setup for this was I was like, oh, I figured that they wouldn't do
[19:36.200 --> 19:37.080]  remember the old way.
[19:37.080 --> 19:38.680]  It would be like, what brand do you have?
[19:38.680 --> 19:42.440]  And if it's like Bose, they're like, try these codes 857,
[19:43.800 --> 19:49.160]  863 and 877, because those are the ones that Bose typically uses.
[19:49.160 --> 19:53.080]  And if those don't work, well, maybe try, you know, this one.
[19:53.720 --> 19:55.880]  I knew it wouldn't be like that, but it was so easy.
[19:55.880 --> 19:57.640]  So that what they said is they say,
[19:57.640 --> 20:01.160]  they say if you want to control the volume on a different device
[20:01.160 --> 20:06.000]  using your Apple TV, OK, go get your it says like, go get your other remote
[20:06.360 --> 20:11.000]  from the manufacturer of your other device and press down
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.400]  and hold volume up until this line is filled.
[20:14.560 --> 20:17.560]  And so you just press and hold the volume up on our other remote
[20:17.560 --> 20:19.400]  and takes about two or three seconds.
[20:19.400 --> 20:22.680]  And they're like a progress car bar fills up sort of like like the
[20:23.800 --> 20:26.400]  it's similar to the equivalent of when you're training touch
[20:26.400 --> 20:28.640]  I.D. with a new fingerprint.
[20:28.640 --> 20:30.080]  And then they're like, OK, got it.
[20:30.080 --> 20:33.240]  Now do volume down and just keep holding volume down
[20:33.240 --> 20:34.440]  until we tell you to stop.
[20:34.440 --> 20:38.400]  And, you know, it takes about two or three seconds and then you're done.
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.360]  That's it. And then all of a sudden, your Apple TV, my Apple TV remote,
[20:41.360 --> 20:45.360]  instead of controlling my TV's remote, controls my receiver's volume.
[20:45.920 --> 20:48.000]  It's great. Yeah, it really is great.
[20:49.360 --> 20:52.120]  Piece of cake, because these things are such a hassle usually.
[20:52.640 --> 20:55.320]  Yeah, and that's one of those things that I really do.
[20:55.320 --> 20:57.720]  I'd love to hear the war stories from the team that did it,
[20:57.720 --> 21:00.520]  because you just know that getting that to work on,
[21:01.600 --> 21:05.200]  you know, 30 or 40 different brands of consumer electronic devices,
[21:05.200 --> 21:09.480]  you just know that it's as screwy as like when you talk to people
[21:09.480 --> 21:12.800]  who work on email clients about, you know, the different IMAP servers out there
[21:12.800 --> 21:15.680]  and stuff like that, you just know it's probably even worse. Yeah.
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.040]  It's a good way of doing it. It's cool. Anyway, so that's awesome.
[21:20.040 --> 21:23.560]  So within minutes, you had your whole setup working. Yeah.
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.920]  Yeah. The other thing I had to do, and it makes sense,
[21:27.480 --> 21:30.320]  and I only noticed it when I first started playing a couple of games.
[21:31.520 --> 21:34.480]  You remember the game Cannibal? Yeah. The endless runner.
[21:34.480 --> 21:38.560]  So that's there. And it it plays really good on TV.
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.800]  That's great. But the one thing I noticed was it was the first game
[21:43.800 --> 21:47.640]  and the only one so far that I noticed that it it goes corner to corner.
[21:47.640 --> 21:51.280]  So like the score was cut off by overscan. Hmm.
[21:51.280 --> 21:57.040]  And I Jonas was with me and it was so I it's like and so I went into settings.
[21:57.040 --> 21:58.800]  I thought maybe I could fix it on Apple TV.
[21:58.800 --> 22:01.320]  And then I realized, like the settings, there is a section
[22:01.320 --> 22:03.160]  where it talks about like something with overscan.
[22:03.640 --> 22:06.320]  But then the settings explains you've got to change it on your TV.
[22:06.920 --> 22:09.800]  Yeah, it's a TV setting that they crop around the edges. Right.
[22:09.800 --> 22:10.920]  And that made all the sense.
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.360]  And of course, the Apple TV isn't sending.
[22:14.360 --> 22:16.760]  Oh, cropped image, right? A cropped image to the TV.
[22:16.760 --> 22:17.920]  It's the TV that's doing it.
[22:17.920 --> 22:23.720]  And then it's like, oh, God, now I'm stuck going into the goofy pioneer image
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.280]  or, you know, the goofy little computer that's built into my TV set from Pioneer.
[22:29.280 --> 22:31.360]  And it's horrible. It's so confusing.
[22:31.360 --> 22:35.000]  It and but then Jonas was with me and thankfully reminded me
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.960]  that we had solved the exact same problem with the PS4
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.120]  when we got it for Christmas last year.
[22:41.120 --> 22:43.240]  Oh, cool. It wasn't until the PC mode or something.
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.400]  Exactly. That's exactly it.
[22:44.400 --> 22:46.960]  You put it in PC mode, which is sort of I
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.240]  sort of I understand it, but there's no way a normal person would understand it.
[22:51.240 --> 22:52.880]  I understand what they're saying that they're saying.
[22:52.880 --> 22:56.280]  This is this is not an analog video device.
[22:56.280 --> 23:00.160]  This is a computer that is sending a pixel per pixel precise image
[23:00.920 --> 23:06.160]  to what it considers more like a PC monitor than the TV.
[23:06.520 --> 23:09.400]  Yeah. So once we did that, then it was it was perfect.
[23:10.880 --> 23:14.040]  That's cool. Did the colors change at all?
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.760]  No, not by doing that.
[23:15.760 --> 23:18.760]  Yeah, no, it really just changed TVs, man.
[23:19.360 --> 23:20.960]  So crazy. Yeah.
[23:20.960 --> 23:23.280]  So much old stuff built in there is so much.
[23:23.280 --> 23:25.200]  What would you call it? Technical debt.
[23:25.200 --> 23:28.120]  Yeah, like because the whole reason for over over scanning.
[23:28.600 --> 23:31.080]  It made all the sense in the world in the CRT era.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.320]  Yeah. Yeah. But it makes no sense at all.
[23:34.320 --> 23:37.960]  And when everything's digital and it's crazy that everything
[23:38.240 --> 23:42.920]  always defaults to the under scan over scan, I guess over scan. Yeah.
[23:42.920 --> 23:45.480]  Yeah. Did that make sense?
[23:47.240 --> 23:48.320]  Yeah. Did you do the same thing?
[23:48.320 --> 23:50.720]  Did you have to change yours to PC mode?
[23:50.720 --> 23:51.920]  I didn't have to.
[23:51.920 --> 23:54.200]  But maybe you just haven't noticed because I didn't notice.
[23:54.200 --> 23:56.320]  But I did play Kennebult.
[23:57.600 --> 23:59.800]  So but maybe I didn't look at the thing.
[23:59.800 --> 24:01.080]  I'll have to go look. Yeah, you could.
[24:01.080 --> 24:03.160]  It's very obvious you could just I mean,
[24:03.160 --> 24:06.400]  Kennebult really puts the score literally in the top right corner.
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.360]  I mean, there's it's they're way outside the safe zone.
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.720]  Yeah. Well, that's the other thing.
[24:11.720 --> 24:14.200]  When designing for a TV to tell you to.
[24:14.200 --> 24:16.320]  There's like a like the overscan border.
[24:16.320 --> 24:18.320]  They tell you where it is and you shouldn't go there.
[24:19.240 --> 24:23.320]  And even when filming, they take it into account when they're filming. Right.
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.240]  Which is kind of bananas in that like that's how entrenched this thing is.
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.760]  Right. And like even the production side is basically just adapting,
[24:32.760 --> 24:36.280]  throwing its hands up and being like, OK, well, let's just avoid the edges.
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.560]  Even though. Right.
[24:38.560 --> 24:41.520]  It's like even though now there's no more technical reason for it,
[24:41.520 --> 24:44.760]  that we're digital, it's a digital image of shooting on video
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.600]  or and it's going to be digital all the way through until it gets on the display.
[24:50.040 --> 24:53.120]  But because everybody shoots within the safe zone,
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.080]  you still have to shoot within the safe zone.
[24:55.080 --> 24:58.040]  Yeah. And the devices still default sometimes to well,
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.960]  maybe they didn't shoot with the safe zone.
[24:59.960 --> 25:01.520]  So we're going to overscan.
[25:01.520 --> 25:04.120]  Yeah. Too weird. Yeah.
[25:04.120 --> 25:10.680]  Byzantine little crazy technological nightmare.
[25:12.800 --> 25:13.960]  All right. Let me take a break.
[25:13.960 --> 25:16.480]  Take a first break here and thank our first sponsor.
[25:16.480 --> 25:19.280]  And it is our friends at Hello.
[25:19.320 --> 25:21.960]  H U L L O.
[25:23.720 --> 25:24.760]  Here's what these guys sell you.
[25:24.760 --> 25:27.960]  They sell you a buckwheat hole pillow.
[25:28.320 --> 25:29.440]  What the hell is that?
[25:29.440 --> 25:32.960]  Here's the thing. It's it's been popular for centuries in Asia.
[25:32.960 --> 25:35.960]  This is how they've made pillows for literally hundreds of years.
[25:37.480 --> 25:41.200]  You take these buckwheat holes, they feel I haven't actually opened it up,
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.400]  but they feel like coffee beans and they fill a pillow with these holes.
[25:46.560 --> 25:49.760]  Feels like almost like more like a beanbag than like a feather pillow.
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.040]  Air flows freely through these things, so it's like it it keeps your head.
[25:56.040 --> 25:58.080]  Your head doesn't get sweaty when you're sleeping on this thing.
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.080]  And then you can adjust the thickness to your personal preference.
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.280]  You just open it up, unzip it, and you could just take some of the holes out
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.080]  any time you want.
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.600]  If if if the one you get out of the box feels like it's too full.
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.960]  Made in the USA with quality construction, really good materials.
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.840]  So it's pretty shrunken, durable twill cotton for the case.
[26:22.760 --> 26:27.040]  It's even a good zipper and it's sort of hidden like it's it tucks away.
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.600]  If you know, sometimes with like a jacket or something like that,
[26:29.600 --> 26:32.160]  you can have a zipper that's easy to get to.
[26:32.160 --> 26:33.960]  But then when it's all closed up, you don't see it.
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.040]  And even the buckwheat, even the actual the the holes that are stuffed
[26:40.040 --> 26:45.400]  in the pillow, they're grown and milled in North Dakota right here in the U.S.
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.760]  Very environmentally friendly and organic product.
[26:51.600 --> 26:54.000]  Everything's 100 percent unbleached cotton.
[26:55.680 --> 26:58.280]  No chemical foams inside, just natural hole.
[26:58.280 --> 27:00.360]  Really, really good. Sounds crazy.
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.120]  Here's the thing. I know that this sounds crazy.
[27:02.120 --> 27:04.520]  It is nothing like any pillow I've ever had before.
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.080]  They sent us two of them
[27:07.080 --> 27:09.880]  months ago, maybe a year ago when they first started sponsoring the show.
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.800]  And Amy and I still have them both on our bed.
[27:12.800 --> 27:13.800]  We both like it a lot.
[27:13.800 --> 27:16.320]  It's really, really nice. Definitely different.
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.720]  It's if it sounds different to you to idea of sleeping on more of like
[27:19.720 --> 27:21.280]  a beanbag than a feather pillow.
[27:21.280 --> 27:24.040]  It definitely is. But it's really, really nice.
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.640]  So here's the deal.
[27:26.640 --> 27:28.520]  Sixty nights for free.
[27:28.520 --> 27:30.000]  Just go there, buy it.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.920]  And any point in the first 60 nights, if it's not for you,
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.520]  they give you a full refund, no questions asked, no hassle that you don't have
[27:36.520 --> 27:39.600]  to like call them up and somebody is going to try to argue with you
[27:39.600 --> 27:41.720]  that you want to keep this pillow or talking into it.
[27:41.720 --> 27:44.720]  Just send it back 60 nights for free.
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.600]  They have four sizes, small standard king.
[27:48.600 --> 27:49.800]  I guess that's three sizes.
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.280]  I guess I can't count.
[27:52.280 --> 27:55.080]  Forty nine, seventy nine, one hundred twenty nine bucks.
[27:55.080 --> 27:56.440]  Here is where you go.
[27:56.440 --> 28:02.720]  Go to hello, H-U-L-L-O, pillow dot com slash talk show.
[28:02.720 --> 28:04.960]  No, the just slash talk show.
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.000]  And they'll know you came from the show.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.680]  They'll help help with that.
[28:09.680 --> 28:13.800]  And last but not least, one percent of all of their profits
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.040]  are contributed to the nature conservancy.
[28:17.680 --> 28:20.120]  So you're doing good things.
[28:20.120 --> 28:22.080]  So my thanks to them.
[28:22.880 --> 28:23.640]  So what else?
[28:23.640 --> 28:26.400]  So I when I got it, when I got my in home yesterday.
[28:29.400 --> 28:31.840]  The app store, like you said, it must have gone live during the day,
[28:31.840 --> 28:34.680]  probably when they started giving them out to people like,
[28:34.680 --> 28:37.840]  you know, monkeys like me in the media.
[28:37.840 --> 28:39.320]  So you had a briefing, right?
[28:39.320 --> 28:39.960]  Yeah.
[28:39.960 --> 28:40.840]  Can we say you had a briefing?
[28:40.840 --> 28:41.080]  Yeah.
[28:41.080 --> 28:42.760]  I guess we just did.
[28:42.760 --> 28:44.040]  Yeah.
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.960]  What are the talking points?
[28:47.960 --> 28:49.960]  What do they run you through?
[28:49.960 --> 28:56.080]  Well, officially, the briefings are off the record, so I won't quote.
[28:56.080 --> 28:56.680]  OK, OK, OK.
[28:56.680 --> 28:57.920]  But I don't think it's a secret either.
[28:57.920 --> 28:58.760]  It wasn't really.
[28:58.760 --> 29:04.560]  It's you know, it was in my personal experience, I've said this before.
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.040]  It's I'm not quite sure where to draw the line with what's NDA and what's not.
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.320]  But the basic just I have never, ever gotten a review unit of an Apple product
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.120]  that didn't include a briefing and not like with a roomful of people.
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.040]  You get like one on one time with somebody from product marketing,
[29:21.040 --> 29:23.680]  you know, and it's always it's, you know, people who are, you know,
[29:23.880 --> 29:26.960]  what people are like people, you know, the product marketing team
[29:26.960 --> 29:29.520]  for Apple TV is intimately familiar with the product.
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.200]  They really know it.
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.480]  So the big parts that they emphasize, you know, the universal search and Siri.
[29:36.640 --> 29:37.400]  Absolutely.
[29:37.400 --> 29:38.760]  You know, they went through a couple of demos.
[29:38.760 --> 29:40.360]  Let me play with it.
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.720]  But it's clear that that is central to their vision for what what the
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.960]  why are they even in the business of making Apple TV?
[29:47.960 --> 29:50.520]  It's this universal search is absolutely huge.
[29:54.960 --> 29:57.720]  Yeah, so I've phrased that the wrong way, because I know it's
[29:57.720 --> 30:00.800]  a champion to saying it and just know what they want to push.
[30:00.800 --> 30:04.440]  Like, yeah, I think that's a good question, I think, because usually
[30:04.840 --> 30:08.560]  what they want to push really is the most interesting things, right?
[30:08.560 --> 30:11.400]  It's not like like it's so easy to overthink it.
[30:11.400 --> 30:14.640]  And if they're talking about A, B and C, then you can overthink it and think,
[30:14.640 --> 30:17.240]  well, then D must be the part that's really interesting
[30:17.240 --> 30:18.600]  because they don't want to talk about it.
[30:18.600 --> 30:20.760]  And maybe that's a problem or whatever.
[30:20.760 --> 30:23.480]  Now, universal search,
[30:23.840 --> 30:26.520]  you know, the basic gist of using the trackpad,
[30:28.160 --> 30:30.720]  which I you know, we can talk about this more.
[30:30.720 --> 30:32.840]  I think we should. It's to me, it's interesting.
[30:32.840 --> 30:34.880]  They didn't know this is the sort of thing they don't talk about.
[30:34.880 --> 30:38.920]  But the feel of it, the way that you can kind of feel the UI
[30:38.920 --> 30:42.640]  as you slide your thumb around is really interesting because usually
[30:42.640 --> 30:45.760]  usually a touch pad is
[30:45.760 --> 30:49.360]  has always been a thing where you have a cursor on screen that you move around.
[30:49.560 --> 30:53.400]  Right. Just think about like a MacBook, like when you or the new magic trackpad
[30:53.400 --> 30:58.960]  for desktops, you slide your finger around and there's a thing on screen.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.240]  You know, the arrow usually,
[31:00.240 --> 31:03.120]  but it turns into an I-beam when you're editing text or whatever.
[31:03.480 --> 31:05.240]  It moves around in response.
[31:05.240 --> 31:07.560]  Well, there is nothing on screen on Apple TV.
[31:07.560 --> 31:12.080]  It's you're just sort of implicitly moving a selection around
[31:12.320 --> 31:14.840]  and different things pop up and move.
[31:15.320 --> 31:17.600]  I think they did a great job of that.
[31:17.600 --> 31:19.760]  They did an amazing job of that.
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.920]  I agree. We could talk about that for ages.
[31:21.920 --> 31:22.800]  Yeah, we can hold it.
[31:22.800 --> 31:24.720]  They call it focus. But yeah.
[31:24.720 --> 31:26.840]  What else did they want us to show?
[31:26.840 --> 31:29.760]  I did, you know. Oh, they definitely wanted to show.
[31:29.760 --> 31:30.880]  And I think rightly so.
[31:30.880 --> 31:34.600]  And if anything to me has been underplayed so far in the reviews of it
[31:34.600 --> 31:39.160]  that I've seen is the the video scrubbing.
[31:41.320 --> 31:48.320]  Meaning that when you fast forward video, you you get a fantastic to me,
[31:48.320 --> 31:52.320]  the best it's even better than TiVo and TiVo to me, you know,
[31:52.320 --> 31:57.240]  I know John Syracuse is, you know, holds the same opinion on it is really today.
[31:57.280 --> 32:01.520]  Until now, the only fast forward and video for anything I've ever connected
[32:01.520 --> 32:04.920]  to my my TV that actually is decent.
[32:05.560 --> 32:08.960]  You know, the old Apple TV was complete shit for fast forward and rewind,
[32:08.960 --> 32:11.080]  especially for streaming content,
[32:12.920 --> 32:15.040]  because you'd have no visual indication of it.
[32:15.040 --> 32:18.240]  You just have this timeline thing that moves and every once in a while,
[32:18.680 --> 32:20.760]  it just goes back to the beginning of the whole stream.
[32:21.160 --> 32:23.320]  And the new one, it's so good.
[32:23.320 --> 32:27.640]  It's so fast that the little thumbnail that shows you what you will get
[32:27.640 --> 32:32.800]  if you stop, you know, as you fast forward, it updates perfectly.
[32:32.840 --> 32:36.240]  Like it almost it's almost like I wonder if they had to dial it back
[32:36.240 --> 32:39.480]  and slow it down so it doesn't change too much. Right.
[32:39.480 --> 32:43.120]  It's like it updates exactly as frequently as you want it to.
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.960]  And whatever it is that you're looking at on that thumbnail,
[32:44.960 --> 32:48.040]  when you hit, click it again to say, all right, start playing from here.
[32:48.440 --> 32:52.000]  It just starts playing exactly what it showed in the thumbnail
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.680]  is exactly what you will see blown up to the full size of the screen.
[32:54.680 --> 32:59.720]  And it sounds I think it's it's obviously anything you fast forward
[32:59.720 --> 33:03.320]  should work the way I just said, but nothing has worked that way until now.
[33:04.160 --> 33:09.880]  And they definitely wanted to show that off and then mostly just games, I guess.
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.800]  Oh, interesting. OK.
[33:14.200 --> 33:16.680]  Yeah, that fast forward thing is amazing.
[33:17.480 --> 33:19.480]  Have you tried telling Siri to go back 30 seconds?
[33:19.480 --> 33:21.880]  Yeah, yeah, it worked and it works great.
[33:22.080 --> 33:23.080]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[33:23.080 --> 33:25.040]  It's awesome. Yeah.
[33:27.480 --> 33:29.800]  I find the only thing I find so far is I
[33:30.880 --> 33:33.000]  it's almost like I forget to use Siri.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.880]  I've only had it for literally 20 to 30 hours.
[33:37.920 --> 33:40.600]  You know, so exactly where it's going to go. Right. I
[33:41.760 --> 33:44.000]  I find myself going to the store, navigating around
[33:44.320 --> 33:47.920]  like top shows to find a show that I know what I'm looking for.
[33:47.920 --> 33:50.440]  I could just say it, you know,
[33:50.440 --> 33:52.880]  I forget when I want to trick my old habits, you know. Right.
[33:52.880 --> 33:56.600]  I started doing the type ahead to type something and I was annoyed
[33:56.600 --> 34:00.760]  and I was just like, oh, wait, I'm not supposed to type to find it.
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.080]  They even I think they even offer you reminders and it's like they even show you.
[34:06.080 --> 34:09.040]  They're like, you know, you could, you know, just hit the Siri button.
[34:11.400 --> 34:14.640]  That's cool. I know some people have been frustrated with it, but whatever.
[34:14.640 --> 34:17.240]  It's Siri. So.
[34:17.240 --> 34:18.960]  I think you can have.
[34:18.960 --> 34:22.360]  Good and bad experiences with it at times.
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.760]  Yeah, it's always like that.
[34:24.760 --> 34:28.080]  It's definitely but it's getting better across all devices.
[34:28.080 --> 34:31.760]  You know, the watch, the phone and with everything.
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.680]  It is getting better at a very, very soon way faster to you.
[34:35.760 --> 34:39.080]  I think so. And it
[34:39.080 --> 34:41.240]  like the words just appear as I say them.
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.040]  Yeah, I don't I almost don't even know how it could be faster.
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.760]  Like why why unless it's just that it's, you know, the the.
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.040]  Team working on Apple TV are such engineering badasses
[34:54.040 --> 34:56.520]  that they're actually better than the
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.880]  people on the watch and phone teams or something.
[34:59.880 --> 35:02.480]  I don't I really it almost seems inexplicable
[35:02.480 --> 35:05.560]  how much faster it is than than Siri on the phone.
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.200]  The only thing I could come up with was that it's a smaller problem set.
[35:09.200 --> 35:11.640]  So they've got a lot more stuff cashed locally for.
[35:12.960 --> 35:14.360]  Like you often say, show me.
[35:14.360 --> 35:16.520]  Yeah. And then you've the name of a TV show
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.360]  and I've already got like a list about the TV show.
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.600]  So they're they have a pretty confident guest before maybe.
[35:22.040 --> 35:26.200]  Yeah, I, I don't know, though, it was like
[35:29.320 --> 35:30.160]  I was interested.
[35:30.160 --> 35:33.160]  So, for example, we were watching
[35:33.160 --> 35:34.920]  a movie as a family last night.
[35:34.920 --> 35:37.720]  Jonas, you know, had like an in-service day today,
[35:37.920 --> 35:39.880]  you know, where the teachers are, I don't know,
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.560]  grading papers or something.
[35:42.560 --> 35:45.280]  So he did, you know, yesterday was his the beginning of his weekend.
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.400]  So he could stay up late and we watched a movie.
[35:48.400 --> 35:49.600]  But I was interested.
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.880]  And oddly enough, Amy was, too, in the Thursday night football game,
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.240]  which was the Miami Dolphins against the New England Patriots,
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.280]  because Daniel Tosh, you ever see that Tosh?
[36:02.640 --> 36:05.120]  That guy. I bet you hate him. You hate him.
[36:05.120 --> 36:12.000]  He's not a good person, which which is he's a very
[36:12.680 --> 36:13.880]  he's a very funny guy.
[36:13.880 --> 36:14.680]  I think he's hilarious.
[36:14.680 --> 36:17.240]  But Amy really likes the show. She likes him.
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.400]  So I watch with her and I get grossed out by some of this stuff.
[36:22.400 --> 36:24.000]  I really I'm a little squeamish.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.720]  And so if you don't know, Daniel Tosh has a show on a weekly show
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.520]  on Comedy Central where they show clips from YouTube and wherever else
[36:31.520 --> 36:34.280]  they can find them on the Internet of people doing stupid things.
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.040]  And often getting hurt.
[36:36.040 --> 36:37.520]  And then he makes fun of them.
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.880]  But anyway, he raised twenty five thousand dollars.
[36:41.880 --> 36:47.400]  And he had a he did this before, too.
[36:47.400 --> 36:49.360]  He raised like twenty five thousand dollars for charity
[36:50.640 --> 36:52.280]  with the with the idea.
[36:52.280 --> 36:56.040]  Yeah, but well, just I don't know with the idea, though,
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.480]  that once he raised the twenty five grand for charity, he would go to Vegas
[36:59.480 --> 37:01.680]  and bet it all on one hand, a blackjack.
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.040]  And then if you won, it would all go to the charity.
[37:04.040 --> 37:05.480]  And if he lost, they would get nothing.
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.520]  And he went and played one in a blackjack and lost.
[37:10.400 --> 37:11.200]  And it was true.
[37:11.200 --> 37:14.760]  I mean, he was there at the Mirage and he had a stack of twenty five
[37:14.760 --> 37:17.480]  thousand dollars in front of him.
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.480]  And so this year he raised twenty five thousand dollars.
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.680]  And it's like it's actually for a pal of his who some other comedian.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.680]  I hadn't heard him, but the poor guy's got like a brain tumor or something.
[37:31.360 --> 37:33.560]  And, you know, it's a typical U.S. thing.
[37:33.560 --> 37:34.680]  You know, even with Obamacare,
[37:34.680 --> 37:37.560]  it's like his insurance is going to like bankrupt them or something.
[37:37.560 --> 37:40.240]  So the money is going to go to help this this comedian friend of his,
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.480]  you know, pay off his medical bills from brain tumor.
[37:44.160 --> 37:45.320]  So great cause.
[37:45.320 --> 37:50.320]  But what he did is he bet he bet the whole thing on the first half.
[37:51.040 --> 37:53.120]  This is like the longest tangent in history of the show.
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.680]  You've met the whole thing on the first half of the Miami Dolphins
[37:57.680 --> 37:59.080]  New England Patriots game.
[37:59.080 --> 38:04.080]  Now, the the the back story here is that Tosh is a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan.
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.120]  Loves the Miami Dolphins.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.520]  The Miami Dolphins are terrible.
[38:09.520 --> 38:10.120]  They're so bad.
[38:10.120 --> 38:12.560]  They've already fired, you know, like three games into the season.
[38:12.560 --> 38:14.560]  They fired their coach and that, you know, that's
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.320]  if you can't even wait till the end of the season to fire your coach,
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.840]  you know, your your team is in bad shape.
[38:21.840 --> 38:23.280]  So the Miami Dolphins are terrible.
[38:23.280 --> 38:25.800]  And the New England Patriots are quite possibly
[38:25.800 --> 38:29.880]  probably the best team in football this year. Yeah. Don't talk about this.
[38:31.560 --> 38:33.960]  So what he did is he bet
[38:34.760 --> 38:40.160]  on the Patriots for the first half only so that he could, you know,
[38:40.480 --> 38:43.960]  by all by all accounts, they're almost certainly going to be ahead at halftime.
[38:43.960 --> 38:46.840]  They had to be ahead by at least three and a half points and he'd win.
[38:47.400 --> 38:50.760]  And but then he could go back and root for the Miami Dolphins
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.120]  to win the game by coming back in the second half.
[38:53.120 --> 38:55.680]  So anyway, long story short, we were interested in the score.
[38:55.680 --> 38:57.920]  The game. And so I did the Siri thing in the middle of a movie.
[38:57.920 --> 39:00.000]  Hey, Siri, what's the score of the Dolphins game?
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.320]  And it the score was already up.
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.280]  Like it felt like I was going to wait for like a little spinner,
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.280]  you know, while she processes it.
[39:08.280 --> 39:11.360]  And in the meantime, it was like the, you know, New England Patriots
[39:11.360 --> 39:14.520]  are up 17 nothing in the first half or whatever it was.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.960]  Anyway, long story short, Tosh did win the bet.
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.800]  The Dolphins got killed.
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.760]  OK, cool. So I mean, good that he's helping out his brain, buddy.
[39:23.760 --> 39:26.440]  I think he's such a dick.
[39:26.440 --> 39:29.200]  I'm sure that he'd, you know, behind the scenes
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.320]  and probably gave the money, but at least publicly.
[39:32.320 --> 39:34.760]  And he did have a picture of the ticket you get from the sports book.
[39:34.760 --> 39:37.840]  He did. He did bet twenty five thousand dollars on the Patriots.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.040]  But anyway, long story short, shortmanship.
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.160]  Anyway, just long story short, you got your sports cards.
[39:43.640 --> 39:45.920]  Pretty right. It's like instantaneously.
[39:45.920 --> 39:48.920]  And and that to me is not the sort of question.
[39:49.960 --> 39:51.480]  I guess you can't.
[39:51.480 --> 39:54.720]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, I guess people ask about weather
[39:54.720 --> 39:57.880]  and they ask about sports scores and I don't know.
[39:57.880 --> 40:00.800]  It seems to me like it's more than just local caching.
[40:00.800 --> 40:01.960]  It's really, really good.
[40:01.960 --> 40:05.160]  And I just feel like it has to become habit forming
[40:05.160 --> 40:08.200]  because it is such a useful way to navigate the Apple TV.
[40:09.680 --> 40:11.200]  Yeah, I just still haven't got there yet.
[40:11.200 --> 40:14.120]  I still do the left, right, up, down thing way too often.
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.640]  Yeah, I'll get there.
[40:16.640 --> 40:21.120]  The other little thing and I wonder maybe I haven't actually tried this,
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.480]  but I know at the event when I played with it, I kept I pressed the button
[40:25.480 --> 40:28.360]  and I would say, what's the temperature outside?
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.800]  And that screwed it all up.
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.440]  And they're like, oh, no, no, you don't have to say it.
[40:32.440 --> 40:35.080]  Don't say just ask what the weather is.
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.680]  But it's weird because I've sort of gotten grooved on saying
[40:39.440 --> 40:41.720]  because. Hmm.
[40:41.720 --> 40:43.640]  I guess I should have prefaced that because I know famous.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.480]  That's probably me doing that probably set off
[40:46.480 --> 40:51.080]  a bunch of serious, although strangely, it didn't set off mine
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.600]  on my phone right here.
[40:52.600 --> 40:54.640]  Yeah, mine's OK, too.
[40:54.640 --> 40:56.480]  Maybe we'll beep it out.
[40:56.480 --> 40:57.720]  If you heard beeps, I don't know.
[40:57.720 --> 40:59.760]  You may or not have heard beeps 30 seconds ago.
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.560]  It was because I said a G.
[41:02.560 --> 41:05.160]  Why, Siri?
[41:07.320 --> 41:10.360]  It's the only thing loving it.
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.960]  The only the only thing that ever gets beeped on on my talk show.
[41:13.960 --> 41:16.680]  Yes, pretty much.
[41:17.360 --> 41:21.320]  Anyway, you would think that shouldn't screw it up, though.
[41:21.840 --> 41:22.920]  Like, why would that screw it up?
[41:22.920 --> 41:26.720]  Yeah, I wonder if maybe they've maybe they could just maybe in
[41:26.840 --> 41:29.960]  I wouldn't be surprised if in the interim, maybe they've made it
[41:29.960 --> 41:33.800]  so Siri will just ignore it, recognize it and ignore it.
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.840]  You don't need to say it, but if you do out of habit, it won't.
[41:36.880 --> 41:38.120]  It shouldn't hurt you.
[41:38.120 --> 41:39.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:39.280 --> 41:41.520]  Yeah, it seems like you holding the button, which is effectively
[41:41.520 --> 41:44.600]  the same thing as summoning.
[41:44.600 --> 41:47.760]  It seems like the sort of thing that when before it goes out
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.000]  to a wider audience, you can see why they didn't do that,
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.200]  because the only people who were using it were on the team
[41:53.200 --> 41:54.800]  and they knew exactly how it worked.
[41:54.800 --> 41:57.760]  And so they, of course, never said beep because they knew not to say
[41:58.640 --> 42:01.280]  but then I'm doing it beep.
[42:03.360 --> 42:06.960]  They knew not to say the thing.
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.040]  But then once it got out into a wider release, it maybe it was like, oh, yeah,
[42:11.040 --> 42:14.400]  obviously we should we should just listen for that and just discard it.
[42:14.760 --> 42:19.280]  Yeah, sort of like with the live photos, the way that in the
[42:19.480 --> 42:23.120]  you know, for the first month with the iPhone six, if you drop your camera,
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.320]  you know, drop it, meaning lower it after you snap the picture.
[42:26.920 --> 42:30.840]  Your live photo ends up with this blurry picture of somebody's feet
[42:30.840 --> 42:31.800]  every single time.
[42:31.800 --> 42:35.120]  And then starting an iOS nine point one, they detect that
[42:35.120 --> 42:37.640]  and just crop it at the point where you lower the camera.
[42:37.880 --> 42:39.600]  Yeah, I love life photos.
[42:39.600 --> 42:41.360]  And that's a good idea.
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.520]  It's so great.
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.320]  But it's so you can totally see how this seemingly obvious
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.480]  feature of detecting the lowering of the camera, how it slipped through,
[42:50.760 --> 42:54.720]  because the only people using it knew they were they had gotten in the habit
[42:54.720 --> 42:58.520]  of holding the camera for for one and a half seconds after they take the photo.
[42:58.680 --> 43:01.880]  Yeah. And it's really like when you're not thinking about it
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.320]  and you're not really you because that's part of the beauty of the live photos.
[43:05.320 --> 43:07.360]  You don't have to think about it.
[43:07.360 --> 43:10.080]  You just do it, but then you end up with these weird things.
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.840]  So I wouldn't be surprised if the.
[43:14.520 --> 43:18.880]  You know, yeah, something slips, but don't do it again.
[43:24.520 --> 43:26.680]  What's the Amazon one?
[43:27.800 --> 43:30.200]  Alexa tricked you into saying it.
[43:30.480 --> 43:32.280]  But what do you have to say, though?
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.240]  I don't know. I don't know.
[43:35.240 --> 43:39.240]  I don't know what. Anyway, whatever this we can't.
[43:41.120 --> 43:42.800]  I find it a little bit disconcerting
[43:42.800 --> 43:45.680]  that we're worried about saying the wrong thing to it because it's going to upset
[43:45.680 --> 43:50.240]  robots. It's not really a future of one living.
[43:51.080 --> 43:56.440]  It does. Don't want to know it.
[43:56.440 --> 43:58.760]  Don't wake up the robot.
[44:02.440 --> 44:03.480]  Let me take another break here,
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.040]  and I thank our next sponsor and what are you going to do
[44:07.040 --> 44:08.880]  if you're sleeping on one of these hello pillows?
[44:08.880 --> 44:10.240]  Well, what are you laying on?
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.080]  Well, you need a mattress.
[44:12.520 --> 44:14.600]  So here we go. Serendipity.
[44:14.600 --> 44:18.880]  Our next sponsor on the show is Casper, the company that makes
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.680]  the mattresses, and you buy them online and they ship them to your house.
[44:25.200 --> 44:28.920]  And it's amazing is this is like the the this is like.
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.360]  The future, none of the shit where you go to a mattress store
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.400]  and what a mess that is.
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.640]  Casper makes they make buying a mattress so much easier.
[44:41.640 --> 44:43.920]  It's not just about skipping the store.
[44:43.920 --> 44:46.800]  They don't they don't you don't go there and like pick
[44:46.800 --> 44:50.320]  between eight different types of foam or styles of mattress.
[44:50.640 --> 44:53.400]  All they do, they just make you pick a size.
[44:53.480 --> 44:55.480]  They're like the apple of mattresses.
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.760]  You don't have to go in there and figure out what type of spring
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.120]  technology is in there.
[45:01.120 --> 45:03.520]  They make one type of foam.
[45:03.600 --> 45:07.120]  They use two different technologies, latex, foam and memory foam,
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.000]  and they've blended.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.440]  They've got like their own custom blend that they think these are guys
[45:11.440 --> 45:14.360]  are mattress experts. That's all they do.
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.800]  They've taken care of how much bounce, how much sink should be there,
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.080]  how much of the memory, how much of the latex.
[45:22.080 --> 45:23.520]  They just they do it.
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.880]  That's it. And it's really, really nice.
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.120]  So. You go there,
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.120]  you pick what size you want, twin size mattress, king size, queen size, whatever.
[45:34.480 --> 45:36.080]  That's the only decision you have to make.
[45:36.080 --> 45:39.120]  Then next thing you know, the mattress shows up at your house
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.400]  packed into an unbelievably small box.
[45:42.440 --> 45:45.520]  It's probably the biggest box if you've got when you buy one of these things,
[45:45.520 --> 45:48.400]  it's probably the biggest box you'll get this year.
[45:48.560 --> 45:51.680]  But it is way smaller than a mattress.
[45:51.680 --> 45:54.200]  It is ridiculously small.
[45:54.200 --> 45:58.280]  Half the fun of the thing is opening it up and hearing like the air suck into it.
[45:58.280 --> 46:01.240]  Like the whole reason they can ship it so small is that they like vacuum
[46:01.240 --> 46:02.960]  seal these things.
[46:02.960 --> 46:06.360]  You put it in your bedroom, you open up the box, you follow the instructions,
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.760]  and it makes this cool noise, which I will not attempt to replicate.
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.280]  And next thing you know, there's a full sized mattress with all this back
[46:13.280 --> 46:16.720]  to the future talk, you know, because of the back to the future day was last week.
[46:17.080 --> 46:20.480]  It reminds me of the pizza they make back to the future where it's like tiny.
[46:20.480 --> 46:23.600]  And then the mom hits a button and two seconds later,
[46:23.600 --> 46:24.720]  there's a full sized pizza.
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.280]  That's exactly what it's like, except it's a mattress and not a pizza.
[46:28.920 --> 46:29.600]  Does that make sense?
[46:30.800 --> 46:32.560]  Great prices. Here's the other thing, too.
[46:32.560 --> 46:35.760]  So much easier. No hard decisions on what type of technology.
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.520]  No crazy price comparisons.
[46:38.520 --> 46:41.440]  And you don't have to worry about shipping it or anything like that.
[46:41.840 --> 46:44.160]  You just go there, pick it out.
[46:44.640 --> 46:46.840]  The mattresses are made in America.
[46:46.840 --> 46:50.800]  And if you don't like it, you have 100 days
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.760]  where up to 100 days later, you can just say, you know what?
[46:53.760 --> 46:56.800]  I don't like it. Ship it back free delivery, you know.
[46:57.040 --> 47:00.040]  So if you have any reservations about buying a mattress
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.240]  without actually having tried it in a store, which quite frankly is kind of gross
[47:04.240 --> 47:05.440]  because guess what?
[47:05.440 --> 47:08.160]  Other people have been laying on those things, too.
[47:08.160 --> 47:09.600]  You give 100 days, no risk.
[47:09.600 --> 47:11.240]  Money back guarantee. Here's what you do.
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.120]  Go to. Casper sleep,
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.240]  what the hell's the URL, Casper sleep.
[47:20.640 --> 47:22.920]  That's it. Here we go. Casper sleep dot com.
[47:22.920 --> 47:26.760]  And the code is the talk show with the the.
[47:27.200 --> 47:30.360]  And if you use that code, you'll save an extra 50 bucks.
[47:31.200 --> 47:33.160]  So my thanks to Casper. Go get a mattress.
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.200]  All right, what else is going on with the TV?
[47:37.200 --> 47:38.280]  I like the theme, though.
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.880]  Yeah, it's all sleepy stuff.
[47:39.880 --> 47:42.920]  Yeah, cozy. The winter's coming in. Yeah. Yeah.
[47:44.360 --> 47:48.320]  What else? So let's talk about as far as turning the actual thing on.
[47:48.360 --> 47:52.120]  Yeah, let's talk about the input with the you're sliding around this trackpad.
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.000]  And what do you say is called focus?
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.160]  Yeah, it's called internally the class that takes care of all that is called the UI focus engine.
[48:00.840 --> 48:07.440]  So. I mean, I know we don't have a selection rectangle, but it.
[48:09.080 --> 48:10.760]  You think of it like that, right?
[48:10.760 --> 48:13.040]  Like as you move down, you get the selection rectangle.
[48:13.640 --> 48:16.360]  What actually happens for those who haven't seen it is
[48:17.480 --> 48:20.720]  you move from one icon button to the other.
[48:20.720 --> 48:28.400]  And as you move on to one, it gets bigger and gets a parallax effect on it, too.
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.240]  So that as you slightly move your finger around the tap, the trackpad,
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.040]  the angle of the icon changes.
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.880]  Giving it a nice 3D feel like you feel like you're manipulating an object.
[48:41.840 --> 48:45.040]  I and I it is it definitely has a 3D feel.
[48:45.640 --> 48:49.560]  I feel like for a 1.0 product, it's remarkably polished.
[48:49.560 --> 48:53.520]  And this might just be a factor of how long they've been working on it internally.
[48:54.080 --> 49:00.840]  But it's like to me that the 3D ness, the way that the selected item pops towards you a little
[49:00.840 --> 49:03.160]  and the way that there is this parallax.
[49:03.160 --> 49:08.120]  And there's also, like you said, like if you're if you're going to the left
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.720]  and you're selecting items from the left to the right and you're still kind of pressing your thumb,
[49:13.720 --> 49:18.920]  you've stopped, you're hovering on one, but you're still kind of got your thumb going a little to the right.
[49:18.920 --> 49:21.480]  That's the way it tilts a little bit.
[49:21.480 --> 49:24.560]  Right. It's as though you're sort of pressing it to the right.
[49:24.560 --> 49:27.000]  You can idly play with them.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.720]  I do, just because, well, I'm like, oh, yeah, do I want to watch this?
[49:29.720 --> 49:35.240]  And I'm like looking at the parallax effect like often the text will pop from the front of the background.
[49:35.240 --> 49:43.200]  It's such a cool thing, but it would be so easy to do too much to have it too strong.
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.720]  And it's not.
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.960]  I feel like it is delightfully understated.
[49:48.960 --> 49:55.200]  Yeah. If anything, I think that the the white shine that they put on is a little bit too much, but whatever.
[49:55.200 --> 50:00.160]  It is funny, though, because it is absolutely, positively not flat.
[50:00.160 --> 50:06.560]  Right. To use that overused term, it is a very, very visually 3D effect.
[50:06.560 --> 50:10.480]  It is it. Yeah. Things really pop.
[50:10.480 --> 50:17.840]  Yeah. While preserving some of the, I guess it's difficult to explain it, but I mean, the elements are flat,
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.680]  but they're stacked in a way such that it's like clearly 3D.
[50:21.680 --> 50:29.920]  You know what I mean? Like the settings icon looks almost identical to the iOS icon,
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.120]  but it is stacked in a way such that the gears are like descend into space so you can see them move a bit.
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.240]  Yeah. And buttons are definitely buttons.
[50:40.240 --> 50:46.160]  There's it's it. And, you know, you go back and forth on this.
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.520]  I've kind of gotten used to it with iOS seven, starting with iOS seven, the new look of iOS,
[50:51.520 --> 50:54.960]  where a lot of buttons don't have an actual outline.
[50:54.960 --> 51:03.440]  They're just text. And it's almost like clicking more like clicking, tapping a hyperlink than tapping a button.
[51:03.440 --> 51:09.960]  And I can kind of see why they did that. It's never quite sat right with me, but I kind of have come to peace with it.
[51:09.960 --> 51:15.200]  But I really like that on Apple, on this new Apple TV, that buttons are buttons again.
[51:15.200 --> 51:19.960]  Yeah, they have like a pretty distinctive outline. And when you move on to one, it makes a different sound.
[51:19.960 --> 51:25.600]  Yeah. As you navigate around the UI, you get sounds for what you're selecting, too, which is nice.
[51:25.600 --> 51:29.200]  Yeah. And it's really, in my opinion, well done again.
[51:29.200 --> 51:36.760]  I think the old Apple TV sounds were pretty good, too. But I think that the tweaks that they've done are all for the better.
[51:36.760 --> 51:41.560]  And it just kind of, again, it's almost not like it's not over the top.
[51:41.560 --> 51:50.040]  It's not like a lot of beeping and buzzing. It's just subtle little feedback that it almost is like it helps you feel it.
[51:50.040 --> 51:55.360]  It makes it feel like your finger can feel these buttons because you're getting some kind of,
[51:55.360 --> 52:03.760]  even though it's not like a force feedback on the remote, you're getting some kind of sensual input.
[52:03.760 --> 52:09.960]  Yeah, I would love to see some kind of haptic feedback in the remote eventually.
[52:09.960 --> 52:16.760]  Yeah, I think that's got to come eventually, especially it just seems like they're doing so much so quickly.
[52:16.760 --> 52:24.120]  You know, the haptic stuff that they're doing is, if you think about it, it's like we're just early days on it, really.
[52:24.120 --> 52:30.520]  I mean, we're still in the first year of having a Force Touch trackpad.
[52:30.520 --> 52:38.840]  They just came out with the first phones with the 3D Touch a month ago, six weeks ago.
[52:38.840 --> 52:44.120]  The watch only came out in April and watch, you know, so the watch was one of the first ones they came out with.
[52:44.120 --> 52:49.600]  But the watch has really sort of the simplest implementation where it's really just, you know, is it a Force Touch or not?
[52:49.600 --> 52:53.520]  It's not like a degree of force. So I think that's inevitable.
[52:53.520 --> 53:01.160]  I think it's got to be, you know, whether it's next year or two years from now, that there will be an Apple TV remote that has some kind of haptics.
[53:01.160 --> 53:12.000]  Yeah, they don't need it super robust either. It's a smaller device, so you don't need to move it that, you know, I mean, like the weight of the device is going to matter for the oscillator.
[53:12.000 --> 53:23.480]  Right, right. And in a way that, the way that you're, like the big, the only real, to me, the only real downside to the Force Touch on the new iPhone 6s is,
[53:23.480 --> 53:39.440]  6s sounds so weird. I'll just say 6s or I'll say it like I write it, iPhone's 6s, is that it made them way more, like noticeably more, like about 20 grams more.
[53:39.440 --> 53:47.440]  And that's, you know, the Apple doesn't really make things typically that get heavier. I think it's worth it.
[53:47.440 --> 53:57.440]  But on the remote, a little bit more might actually make it even feel better. The remote is so lightweight that adding, if it, if they have to add 20 grams to it to get Force Touch in there, so what?
[53:57.440 --> 54:04.440]  Yeah, well also the engine won't have to be as forceful, right? Because it's got less to wiggle.
[54:04.440 --> 54:15.440]  Right. So anyway, I mean, that's a minor, that's how excited I am. Now I'm like, oh, wouldn't it be cool if X, you know what I mean? Like, it's not even a complaint, it's just like.
[54:15.440 --> 54:39.440]  I would just say this, I would just go zoom back, big picture, of the three, I won't count the watch, because the watch to me is not really an OS, it's sort of, you know, it's a watch. Maybe I should, but of iOS, OS X, and Apple TV.
[54:39.440 --> 54:53.440]  And they all have these new, if we start with iOS 7, these new user interfaces, they're all using the San Francisco system font. I think that the Apple TV is the best, the best designed one.
[54:53.440 --> 55:21.440]  Just in little things like what do the buttons look like, what do the icons look like, to me it's the best, it's my favorite of them. Now, maybe I'm judging that a little early, maybe if I, you know, a month from now after I've really gotten used to it, maybe I'll start to see more things to complain about, but I feel like there are the least things in there that I would really wish that they would do differently.
[55:21.440 --> 55:25.440]  I don't really have any complaints like that, I just think it's gorgeous and it has such a great feel.
[55:25.440 --> 55:36.440]  It could also be because there's less to it, right? There's less to it, but there's less UI, you know, like there's, you don't have a complicated app necessarily.
[55:36.440 --> 55:53.440]  Yeah, so the way this focus engine thing works is that in code, it moves the focus the way that the viewer is seeing the screen.
[55:53.440 --> 56:07.440]  If you were to move like right and there's like a list to the right, it would jump to where you would expect it to go as viewer, not programmatically per se.
[56:07.440 --> 56:15.440]  What's a good way of putting this? So you can imagine having a button like a view button that was covered up by something else.
[56:15.440 --> 56:23.440]  And if you press down and it would have selected the button logically in the code, but something is covering it, it will instead pick the thing that's covering it.
[56:23.440 --> 56:42.440]  Because that's the foremost on the screen. Like it doesn't, man, sorry, I'm trying to explain to you in a non-technical way, but there's a way that you'd structure the code and all of these views relate to each other and there's a hierarchy of views of what gets embedded in what.
[56:42.440 --> 56:50.440]  But that isn't necessarily what gets presented on the screen because you can have stuff like popups showing up or things coming in from the side.
[56:50.440 --> 56:59.440]  Or a view element is either hidden or its alpha value has gone to zero, like it's completely, it's become completely transparent.
[56:59.440 --> 57:04.440]  And this focus engine will take all of that into account.
[57:04.440 --> 57:10.440]  So it'll look at what, it'll consider what the user is seeing rather than what the developer has written.
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.440]  Yeah, I think that makes sense from a laborer. I think people can kind of know what they mean by that.
[57:15.440 --> 57:23.440]  Like in the code, or in, do they still call it Interface Builder? What would you call it?
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.440]  Yeah, they still call it IB. It's Interface Builder, but it's inside Xcode now.
[57:27.440 --> 57:49.440]  A lot of times the UI is almost, it's like an outline, where there are views that are sub-views and that you can effectively, at a higher level, you can just collapse the whole thing like a section of an outline and just know that if you move this thing around, all of its sub-views go with it.
[57:49.440 --> 57:58.440]  And when you think of it that way, you can think of what would the outline consider to be next. Isn't that sort of what you're talking about?
[57:58.440 --> 58:08.440]  Like it would be like a logical thing, like you know that this is beneath it because it's the next thing in this outline, which has a linear view, but it isn't related to this.
[58:08.440 --> 58:10.440]  But the visual layout may be totally different.
[58:10.440 --> 58:21.440]  It would be like a picture of a webpage with like a three-column webpage. There's a left-hand column, there's the content, and then there's whatever, the ads and stuff on the right.
[58:21.440 --> 58:33.440]  Now imagine navigating with the focus. Like if you pressed the down button, you'd be going down the left-hand side, the source list, and then if you pressed right, you would jump over to the main content view.
[58:33.440 --> 58:45.440]  Now if a dialogue box popped up and you were in the left and you pressed right, you would jump into the dialogue box instead because foremost it's more prominent.
[58:45.440 --> 59:05.440]  In the bottom line, and I feel like again to overuse the word magic, they have taken an input paradigm, the trackpad, that is so much easier to conceptualize if you're just moving a pointer on screen.
[59:05.440 --> 59:23.440]  Just think of the arrow from Mac, that Mac arrow cursor. Conceptually, that's super simple. You move a thing and it moves exactly along with your finger, and then it solves everything because whatever you tap on is what's underneath the arrow.
[59:23.440 --> 59:36.440]  So getting rid of the idea of a pointer is conceptually, I would think to implement it, very, very difficult because they've done it in a way that normal people are never going to think about this.
[59:36.440 --> 59:56.440]  Yeah, no, and you shouldn't. And there's a fair amount of new stuff that they've added to UIKit to support this notion of focus. And it's unique to the platform. It doesn't exist, doesn't even make sense on a phone or an iPad.
[59:56.440 --> 01:00:07.440]  So I don't know, it's really cool. Yeah, I really feel like they've knocked themselves out on it. And I don't think they're going to get the recognition, and they know that too.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:17.440]  It's like some of the stuff that works, it really requires amazing engineering. Everybody's just going to take it for granted very, very soon.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:31.440]  Yeah, I mean that's kind of the... So we crapped all over the on-screen keyboard, just the idea of it. And it still is less than optimal, but when you have to enter a password or something like that.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:48.440]  Or if you turn on Netflix, I had to enter our Netflix credentials. There's no way around that. The app's better too, by the way. The Netflix app?
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:56.440]  Actually, I guess there is a way around it. We can talk about it. Did you see that there's a net news wire for Apple TV? I did, I have not tried it out yet.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:08.440]  So it's, in a sense, so BlackPixel, people who have net news wire now, did an Apple TV app. I was surprised. I was like, it doesn't seem like... RSS does not seem like something I want to do on my TV.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:16.440]  Having played with it, I think I'm right that it's probably not something I want to do on my TV, but it may not have been that much work for them. I don't know.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:30.440]  But it's interesting. But the thing that was the most interesting to me was they have their own sync engine. So you can enter your email and password in the Apple TV the old-fashioned way.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:43.440]  Or you can just launch iOS net news wire on your iPhone if you're on the same Wi-Fi network. And they tell you this. Or the easier way would be to just launch net news wire for iOS.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  So I launched it on my iPhone. And there on my iPhone, I got a dialog box with the option to grant the Apple TV app on the name of my Apple TV, my net news wire sync.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.440]  And I hit a button and it was there.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.440]  Oh, that's great.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:18.440]  So whether I'm actually going to read RSS on my Apple TV, to get sync credentials across, that was great. I wish Netflix would have had the same option. Hopefully more and more apps will start doing stuff like that so that you don't have to do it.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  But anyway, when you do type on the new Apple TV, I do think they've made the keyboard better than the old one.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:37.440]  Like the old one that was arranged in a two-dimensional grid. It was like A, B, C, D, E, F, and then next line, you know, whatever letter comes after F.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.440]  G.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  Is it? I forget. I often don't remember mid-alphabet. I have to start from the beginning.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440]  I do it every time.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440]  I have to start from the beginning. And I didn't feel like doing it.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.440]  I don't want to admit that, but I do.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:07.440]  And sometimes, I can always do it from the beginning, but sometimes I'm amazed by things. I'm like, wow, S and T are really far back in the alphabet. I never thought of them as being so far back.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.440]  Yeah, yeah, they were pretty far back. Yeah, they really are.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:22.440]  To me, those are big boy consonants. S is the most frequently used consonant. T is super up there in frequency. You just think that they'd have better seats.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440]  Better position. Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:34.440]  I heard, man, this show is just called The Weeds at this point. I was watching TV the other night, and they had somebody do a sobriety test.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:44.440]  And I was like, say the alphabet backwards. And I'm like, are you kidding me? I couldn't do that anyway.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:52.440]  As we speak right now, I am stone cold sober. I could not do that.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:04:06.440]  I would have to do it as a programming code. It would be like you would flunk the student, because the algorithm I would have to use, I can do Z and Y.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.440]  All right, X. I was going to say W.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440]  X, Y, Z, so you get it.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:17.440]  I would more or less, once I got past X to W, I would have to redo the entire alphabet.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.440]  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440]  You would scan the entire thing.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.440]  And then I can go V. I would not be able to pass that field sobriety test.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.440]  But the actress rattled it off. And I was like, well, OK, well.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.440]  I guess I've drank too much. This is just not.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:50.440]  In my head, too, honestly, I'm not going to sing here on the show, but in my head, when I do the alphabet in my head, I do it in the singsong voice.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.440]  Of course, you have to.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  It's just one of those things that I stopped caring about, like doing.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.440]  I know, I feel like I got to a functional enough level with it.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440]  And I'm like, OK, putting that aside.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.440]  I can naturally do. My brain, I do.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:14.440]  I can naturally, without having to stress, I can do pretty significant arithmetic in my head.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.440]  But I only do it because it is easy for me.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:23.440]  And I've been talking to Jonas about it. Jonas isn't so good at arithmetic.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.440]  And I was like, you got to do what you got to do to pass these tests.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440]  You got to study and you got to work on this.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.440]  But in the long run in life, this is a problem that computers have solved.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.440]  You have to understand the concepts to know what to do.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.440]  But if you can't do 647 minus 87 in your head, don't worry about it.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  You're going to have a calculator with you everywhere you go in your life.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.440]  Yeah. Good advice.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.440]  What you don't have is a sign with the alphabet on it.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.440]  Right. But alphabetization, for me, does not come naturally.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.440]  I don't do it. But it's a solved problem.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.440]  My computer alphabetizes everything for me that I want to alphabetize.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440]  Why would I have to worry about it?
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.440]  Well, if you go down and find a list view, you must know.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.440]  You instinctively know if you're too low or too high.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.440]  Yeah.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.440]  If you're looking at the W and you're like, do you go down to find that H?
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440]  No, you'll go back up.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.440]  Yeah.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:26.440]  As I'm looking at the list, I'm not like...
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440]  I'm not...
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.440]  Good therapy for alphabet.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:34.440]  I'm not like...
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.440]  I'm not bad at alphabetizing.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.440]  I just can't do it all in my head automatically.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.440]  I can't quite remember with...
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440]  Is it K before L or L after K?
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.440]  Unless I look at it in the list.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440]  But I kind of know basically where they are.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.440]  Yeah. Neighborhoods.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.440]  Let's go back to talking about accounting.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.440]  Yeah.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.440]  No, the UI. UI for Apple TV.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.440]  It's really, really well done.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.440]  I think they've done a good job.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440]  And I think it's got legs, too.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.440]  I don't think it's going to run out of possibilities.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440]  So the difference... I was talking about the keyboard.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.440]  And the old one was a grid.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.440]  And you'd have to go up, down, left, and right to select letters.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440]  And it wouldn't go...
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440]  You couldn't go right to go down to the next row.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.440]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440]  Yeah, it would bump you out into the next few.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.440]  Right. If you were at the top right of the grid,
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.440]  I would think going right would move you down,
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440]  move the selection to the next letter in the alphabet.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.440]  But it wouldn't. It would just sort of beep at you or something.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:47.440]  So the new one is just a straight list across the screen from A to Z.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.440]  And so all you do is go left, right.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.440]  But one of the things I noticed is, and I think it's really cool,
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.440]  is as you move the selection for which letter it is,
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.440]  it's not just one...
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.440]  Like the rectangle highlighting the selection moves a little bit
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.440]  as you move your finger on the trackpad.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440]  You know what I mean? Does that make sense?
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440]  Yeah, it's leading a bit.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440]  It's ready to go to the next one.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440]  And then when you let go, it'll come back to rest.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.440]  Right. So if you're pressing a little bit to the left on the trackpad,
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.440]  the selection range will be a little bit more like
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440]  leaning towards the next letter of the left.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440]  But you still haven't moved your thumb far enough
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440]  to actually move it to the next letter.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.440]  Yeah, it feels very visceral.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.440]  Yes, exactly. It has a real visceral feel to it
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440]  that it makes it...
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.440]  So for all the crapping I've done about on-screen keyboards in general,
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440]  I feel like the one that they've built for this
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  is about as good as it could get.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm not...
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440]  I don't know what more you could have done.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.440]  Like you've got basically a D-pad or like a trackpad
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.440]  and like 24 letters plus all of the 26 letters, however many letters.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.440]  People are gonna...
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.440]  This is like the episode where we reveal ourselves
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  as the dumbest that we actually are.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440]  The dumbest people ever.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.440]  The point I wanted to make was
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.440]  so if you long press or if you hold a letter,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.440]  you get the capital letters and the letters with accents.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440]  Oh, man, I didn't know that.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440]  Yeah. Is there another way of doing it?
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.440]  Yeah, they even go down to the bottom
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440]  and it's like more or less switching to all caps.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.440]  Okay, yeah.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.440]  There's like a capital A, capital B, capital C
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.440]  and then there's the next one over is lowercase A, lowercase B, lowercase C.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.440]  Oh, okay, got it, yeah. I just tried the long press first and it worked.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.440]  I should have tried that. See, that's my failing, not theirs
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.440]  because that seems like if I had to guess...
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.440]  This is like the problem of talking about it with only one day of using it
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.440]  but it exactly makes sense. Brilliant.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.440]  Yeah, so it works way better and it's nice.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  And you're still going back and forth through the alphabet
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440]  but it's not that big a deal.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.440]  I got actually pretty quick at doing that grid.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.440]  Like, remember when we were kids and you'd have to type in codes?
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440]  And you'd get really good at it?
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  I got pretty good at like navigating that grid on the Apple TV.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.440]  You mean like codes like to...
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440]  Oh, yeah, sorry, like a code for like an arcade game, like a Nintendo game,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  like putting your code, your save code.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.440]  And they would have like a similar grid of letters and numbers.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.440]  Yeah, or remember when you used to get to enter three initials for a high score?
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  Right.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.440]  Man, those are the days.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.440]  What were your three initials? GTE?
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440]  I think I would just put guy.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440]  That's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.440]  I've mentioned this before. Mine was GRU.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.440]  That's a good one.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.440]  I don't know. It came to me early on and I thought it's better than the initials.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.440]  I have to admit, I don't think I got on the high scores that much.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440]  I did on Star Wars.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440]  Oh, of course you did.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.440]  Although on Star Wars, the coin op Star Wars, the first three,
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.440]  every time you reset the machine, the first three were built in,
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.440]  like they're like in the ROM and they're incredibly high.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.440]  So if you just like bought a, you know,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.440]  had like a brand new Star Wars coin op game and you played it the first time,
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.440]  the best you could probably do is to be fourth.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.440]  Like the top three were it was like one of them was like they were like,
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.440]  like in jokes, like one of them was OBI.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.440]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.440]  Yeah, but I thought that they were so high that they were impossible.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.440]  And then one time I was in an arcade and I saw, it was like the first time,
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.440]  like I thought I was the baddest ass at Star Wars who ever lived
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440]  because there was no internet.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.440]  So you couldn't, you never found out about the people who were really good at games.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.440]  And I was just waiting for the machine and I was like,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440]  Christ, how many games is this guy going to play?
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.440]  And I like, look, and he had like this score that boggled my mind.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.440]  And he was at a level that I didn't think you'd ever be able to get to.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:03.440]  And it was, I was just like, oh, I'm actually not very good at this game at all.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440]  That was a great game.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  It was a good game. Vector graphics.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.440]  All right. The keyboard's good. The focus section.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.440]  Video playback. So this is a part I mentioned this before.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.440]  So when you fast forward and rewind and scrub the video, it is so good.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.440]  It is, to me, everything that they promised on stage.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.440]  It works great in Apple's app.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.440]  You know, like when you play the movies and TV shows that you get from iTunes.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.440]  It's available. This is what they, this is what I've been told.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.440]  It is available to developers and they encourage all developers to do it,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.440]  but they can't, it's not like every app will do it right automatically.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.440]  Like somebody could make like a streaming app that doesn't use the best
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.440]  APIs for this or that maybe the server that's sending the streaming video
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.440]  doesn't do something that they need to have happen.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.440]  So there might be, I haven't seen any yet,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.440]  but I haven't played with a lot of the third-party video apps yet.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.440]  But it seemed as though they were sort of bracing me for the fact that maybe
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440]  in some third-party apps video,
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.440]  the scrubbing of the video isn't going to be as awesome as it is in Apple's.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.440]  But it could be.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.440]  They're not using APIs that aren't available to third-party apps,
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.440]  but developers might have to do some work on that.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.440]  Yeah, I would imagine that that's a collaboration between the backend server
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440]  stuff and the app itself.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.440]  Because you do have to, at some point when you start doing the scrubbing,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.440]  you need to see where, like the thumbnail.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440]  Right.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440]  So it's got to come from somewhere.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.440]  So, you know, it's probably kind of difficult to coordinate.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440]  And some apps may just do raw streaming.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440]  I think the Apple TV app reads ahead.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]  Right.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.440]  Like as much as it can, basically.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440]  Right.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.440]  But I will say this, because we watched a movie last night on Netflix.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:01.440]  It was exactly, it was right out of a commercial for Apple TV,
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.440]  where we wanted, because it's Halloween season,
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.440]  so we wanted to watch a scary movie.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.440]  So we were going to watch Scream.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.440]  And, you know, ask Siri for, you know, show me the movie Scream.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.440]  And we'd already entered our Netflix password.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.440]  And the first thing that came up was Netflix had the movie.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  And they prioritize free.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.440]  So if there's a way in one of the apps you've configured on Apple TV
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  to watch what you're looking for for free, that will be the first option.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.440]  So it's not just that they show third-party options.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  They will show them before Apple's own option,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.440]  just because they prioritize free.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.440]  That's good. That's really good.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.440]  I mentioned things I like about Apple is that they do, actually.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.440]  I mentioned it last night when it worked like that.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  I was like, they told me that it would prioritize free.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  And Amy gave me like, you're actually going to praise them
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.440]  for doing the obvious, for not trying to charge you four dollars
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.440]  for a movie you should be able to watch for free because you have Netflix.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.440]  And I was like...
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.440]  Well, she has a point.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:17.440]  I guess, yeah, we are so jaded and accustomed to companies.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.440]  I would not have been surprised at all if they had prioritized iTunes.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440]  Or at least not prioritized.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.440]  But yeah, well, I guess whoever's first is prioritized, if iTunes was always first.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440]  I would not have been shocked at all.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.440]  In fact, I remember having a similar thing years ago.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440]  I invented a movie, I forget which one.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440]  And then months later I went to go and watch it again.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440]  So I invented it again.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  And the TV came back and told me, you invented this before.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  Are you sure you want to do it?
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440]  I'm like, oh, that's super nice of you. Yes, I do.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.440]  But thank you for not just taking me my money.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440]  They could have easily just taken the money and been like,
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440]  well, I guess you want to watch it again.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  Right. And you know that somewhere inside Apple
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.440]  there's somebody who works for iTunes who probably was
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.440]  somebody had to at least advocate for it a little.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.440]  You know it was probably a debate inside.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.440]  Well, I mean, that doesn't just happen either.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.440]  They have to go check, have I ever rented this movie before?
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.440]  That's cool.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:24.440]  Somebody took active measures to make that a feature.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440]  Right. Because every single alert along the way,
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.440]  it's a terrible experience if it's too easy to accidentally rent something.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.440]  Terrible. And even Apple, no company is so greedy
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  that they want people to be angry at them.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.440]  So I don't know that there's ever been a video on demand platform
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.440]  that makes it too easy to rent something by accident.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.440]  But yeah, that's an extra nice step.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.440]  And I feel like on the new Apple TV by being willing to say,
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:57.440]  hey, you know, you've got HBO Go and this movie is, you know, in HBO's
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.440]  current selection of movies, you could just watch it there for free.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.440]  By making that the first option.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.440]  You know, again, there was probably somebody there on the iTunes team
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  who was like, oh, come on now, let's put iTunes first.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.440]  And it's, you know, I'm glad they didn't do it.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.440]  It comes back to the old, the thing we often come back to
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.440]  when talking about Apple, that of the three people that Apple
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.440]  generally has to think about, Apple themselves
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.440]  and what's in the best interest of the company.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.440]  Their users, the people who buy the products and then last, developers.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  That that's, you know, that they do want to do well by all three,
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.440]  but the order tends to be Apple first, user second, developers third.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]  Here's a case where...
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  This is not, yeah, go ahead.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.440]  Well, it's a case where I think they're putting the user first.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.440]  Yeah.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440]  I guess...
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  Well, yeah, I guess.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440]  I mean, they're putting the happiness of the users ahead
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440]  because they think that that's a longer term.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.440]  And art for their own success, right?
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440]  And arguably developers too, right?
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.440]  So like, you know, Netflix is a developer
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.440]  and the fact that Netflix can get their thing listed
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.440]  before iTunes's version of the same movie is good for them.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  I think it's, you know, I'm not surprised.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440]  You know, it seems obvious.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440]  You know, it made my wife roll her eyes because it seems so obvious
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.440]  that this is the way it should be.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.440]  But you just know that there's a lot of little decisions
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.440]  that Apple sometimes makes that don't show that sort of priority.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440]  Right.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440]  So yeah, that was cool.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440]  How do you like the Netflix app?
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440]  I thought it was great.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:37.440]  I always thought that the old Apple TV, Netflix app was sort of crap.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440]  What else do we have?
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.440]  Like Netflix, because Netflix is so device agnostic, right?
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.440]  They've got no box of their own.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.440]  There's no Netflix box.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440]  So they just want to be everywhere, right?
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.440]  They're built into TVs.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:56.440]  I was at a family member's house for a kid's birthday party
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.440]  or something a couple months ago
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.440]  and somebody had Netflix built into their TV.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.440]  Like it wasn't like a box connected to their TV.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440]  Like their TV...
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.440]  I have that.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440]  I have that.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.440]  I could do Netflix on my TV, which is bananas.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.440]  It doesn't make any sense to me because I'm just out of touch
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.440]  on how computerized TVs are out of the box.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.440]  So Netflix is everywhere and with varying degrees of quality.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.440]  But I've always thought Apple TV was actually one of the worst ones.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.440]  It just seemed a little, I don't know, half-assed.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.440]  So I'm not sure how much it could have done
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.440]  because all of the old Apple stuff was basically this...
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  It's like a markdown language.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.440]  Sort of like HTML, but specifically just for doing those kind of Apple TV apps,
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.440]  which is why they all kind of look the same and were kind of bland.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.440]  Well, I always thought that their streaming wasn't that great either.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.440]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.440]  I mean, if you just hit play and you wait a couple seconds
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.440]  and then just play it right through, it goes.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.440]  But you couldn't fast-forward or rewind.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.440]  Worth a shit.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:04.440]  Yeah, I think I just gave up trying, to be honest.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.440]  I'm trying to remember the last time I was frustrated by that
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.440]  and then I'm actually thinking, you know what?
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.440]  I just don't think I bother.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.440]  Well, and who wonders how long Netflix has been working with Apple
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440]  on the new Apple TV?
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.440]  Because we know that this Apple TV, the new one, the good one,
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.440]  has been in the works for a while.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.440]  And it seems like Apple and Netflix have a pretty good relationship
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:31.440]  for companies that more or less could be seen as competitors.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.440]  I'm not aware of any weird animosity stuff.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.440]  Netflix was there day one.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  They were on the phone. They were on everywhere.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.440]  Right, and Netflix was on the old Apple TV very early on
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.440]  as one of the very first third-party partners that got that sort of relationship.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.440]  Yeah, I have a feeling that Netflix thinks its fight is with HBO.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.440]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.440]  And it doesn't want it. You can't fight a two-front war, right?
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.440]  You can't take on all of the technology players and people like HBO or AMC and that.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.440]  Yeah. Well, I think it's partly with HBO, but then there's a bunch of HBOs now.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:14.440]  And I also think that what Netflix sees is that one of their biggest competitors
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.440]  is the fact that there's only so much time in a day.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.440]  And it's really that they've got a fight to make it worth your time,
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.440]  that for a couple of hours every month you're going to find something good to watch on Netflix.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.440]  Yeah, that's huge. And that way of looking at media is super interesting, too,
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.440]  because that means video games can gobble up your TV.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.440]  Right. Just the amount of time.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.440]  There's only so much. Everybody's got to go to sleep at some point.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.440]  Right. Find that amount of time, and what are they going to do?
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.440]  Well, if it's messing around on Twitter, then guess what?
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.440]  They're not watching whatever it is your friends read on this or something.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  So I don't know. I think that the video playback is great,
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.440]  and I know that it's going to be... I'll take it for granted soon enough,
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:03.440]  but at this point I'm thrilled every time I fast-forward and rewind.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:07.440]  Yeah, it is really good. They've done an amazing job with this little device.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.440]  Oh, did you... This is a weird one that you probably didn't notice.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:19.440]  Go to the main menu, the home screen. Just put the remote down for a bit.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.440]  Everything will dim except for the icon that you've got focused.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.440]  It'll have a spotlight on it. And then as soon as you move the remote,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  move it, just nudge it, the screen will go back to normal.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.440]  And they're using the accelerometer inside the remote.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.440]  Right. And when you put it down on a coffee table or a couch, it is perfectly still.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  So even the difference between being perfectly still because it's resting on your coffee table
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.440]  versus it's in your hand but you're not moving your hand,
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.440]  it knows that it's in your hand.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.440]  Exactly. It's just really nice. It's a weird little touch, but it's just really cool.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.440]  Also, I love that they put an accelerometer in that thing.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:09.440]  For no apparent reason that we can see from the UI, right?
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.440]  Yeah, well, not in their UI, but it's obviously...
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.440]  We can get into games later as we work towards the end of this.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.440]  I wonder, though, if they would have put an accelerometer in the remote
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.440]  if they hadn't been thinking about games.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.440]  I don't know. I mean, why do they use it?
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.440]  They don't use it, except for that nice little touch.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440]  Right.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.440]  I don't know. I'm super happy that they put it in there.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.440]  Yeah. What do you think about the screensavers?
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.440]  I love them.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.440]  I think they're so gorgeous. They're like hypnotic.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.440]  Yeah, I can't get enough of them.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:55.440]  My old screensaver is a shared thing, but it's just photos of Indy, like Vicky's dog, basically.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.440]  And he's so cute, so I love watching that.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:04.440]  But I feel kind of bad, because now I just leave the standard city screensavers.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.440]  And they are gorgeous.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.440]  I don't know how they shot those, but it's amazing.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.440]  Yeah, there's something. It would be a great...
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.440]  Well, they're Apple, so maybe they won't.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.440]  But with new Apple, you never know.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:21.440]  It would be interesting if they did one of those little behind-the-scenes things that they sometimes do
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.440]  and just showed how they made them.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.440]  And Jonas, it really caught Jonas' eye, too.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.440]  He even asked the question, how did they do this?
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:35.440]  Because it somehow looks different than the footage that you typically see shot out of a helicopter.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.440]  Yeah, I don't know if it's drones or if it's a helicopter, but shot at a super high frame rate.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.440]  But it's not, actually, because you can see cars driving down the street at some point.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:54.440]  Yeah, there's definitely some kind of high frame rate, but it definitely is not a static image.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.440]  I guess it's drones?
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:04.440]  The New York Times had a piece this week on the way that Greenland is melting at an alarming rate.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:12.440]  And the team of researchers from, I think it was the University of Wisconsin, whoever it was doing this,
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  it was an amazing story just to hear about what they're doing and the danger,
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.440]  just the danger of going up there and having this water rush by.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.440]  If the ice you're standing on to measure the temperature of the water cracked and went in,
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  they said the chance of death is 100%.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.440]  There's nothing that anybody would be able to do to save you.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440]  Kind of terrifying.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.440]  It certainly has a sense of being at the end of the world.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:39.440]  You're up here and all you see is ice and stuff like that.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  So it's a great story in general, really interesting, fascinating.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  But the thing that really captivated me was the video footage they had from these drones.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.440]  And it just occurred to me, and they were talking about the budget concerns that these scientists have,
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.440]  that they're using taxpayer money, and it's just really, really tight budget.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:04.440]  Every single dollar had to be accounted for just to get, and some of the stuff is so expensive.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.440]  It was like $5,000 an hour for the helicopter that drove them or flew them to where they were going.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.440]  It just occurred to me that even just like 10 years ago,
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.440]  there's no way they would have gotten any kind of aerial video footage.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  Because drones have absolutely fundamentally changed the type of footage we get.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:33.440]  It's like video footage that would have been in the budget of a $20 million documentary film.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.440]  Now a team of university researchers can get just as good at footage.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.440]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  There is a certain smoothness to drone footage that I guess that's what Apple used, but I don't know.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440]  These screensavers are...
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  They look great, yeah.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:56.440]  Just because we're in the weeds here, researchers were using drones to check out bears hibernating,
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  but the drones would wake them up.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  So we screwed up a bunch of bears.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:12.440]  It's like some kind of Heisenberg joke insert there.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.440]  It's funny, too, to think about, because I'll bet the bears were annoyed.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440]  Yeah, it's this buzzing thing hanging around here.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440]  Of course you're going to be like, what is this?
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]  This is not natural.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  Bears just seem like the type of animal you just don't want to annoy.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.440]  Please send a robot to do it for you.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.440]  Imagine if you were on a hike and you had nothing to do with the drones or the researchers.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440]  You're just in bear country.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:44.440]  And now there's a bunch of angry bears that got woken up in the middle of their hibernation.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  I've always been a little jealous of bears.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  Why? Because the...
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.440]  Hibernating sounds like the best thing.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.440]  Doesn't that just seem great?
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.440]  Just skip winter.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.440]  You just skip it.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.440]  Sounds pretty luxurious.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.440]  I'm sure the realities of it are not great, but...
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  Oh, man.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440]  They've got all that fat in the fur.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  I think it's getting to be late November, starting to get cold.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.440]  You make one good kill, have a good meal.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  And then you're like, you know what?
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440]  That was it.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  That was a good rabbit I just ate.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.440]  And then you just go and next thing you know, you just sleep for four months.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  That'd be awesome.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.440]  That does sound pretty good.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.440]  I do remember reading ones because I'm fascinated by hibernation.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.440]  I wish I could. I would do it.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  That'd be great.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440]  Just shut the daring fireball down for four months.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  Hibernating.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.440]  I'll just put up a thing.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.440]  Sleeping.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.440]  And then just wake up and it's spring.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.440]  You just skip all the...
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.440]  No sunshine.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.440]  Skip the sun going down at five at night.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.440]  Skip the cold temperature.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.440]  It is weird.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.440]  Do they wake up ever?
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.440]  Yeah, they do.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.440]  They wake up and I think like take a piss every once in a while.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440]  Oh, so they even move?
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.440]  Yeah.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.440]  So it means...
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.440]  Well, that makes sense.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.440]  I think it's like the equivalent of waking up in the middle of the night though and going to the bathroom.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.440]  Yeah, and then just come back.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.440]  Just on a four month schedule.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.440]  You just wake up and maybe get it.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.440]  Man, that sounds like the lap of luxury.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.440]  Get a drink of water.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440]  That does sound pretty good.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.440]  Sounds like sleeping.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.440]  Speaking of going to sleep...
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.440]  Our next sponsor
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.440]  has nothing to do with sleep whatsoever.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.440]  It's MailRoute.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  These are the guys.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  These are email nerds and the company
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440]  does nothing but
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  email.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440]  Kind of almost maniacal,
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440]  single-minded focus.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.440]  They do services, cloud-based
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.440]  filtering solution for email.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.440]  And that's all that they do.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440]  Long story short,
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.440]  if you have a domain
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440]  that you get your own email from,
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440]  you have an email server running somewhere like a web host
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440]  or maybe it's a company and you have
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.440]  your own servers in the building or something like that,
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.440]  it doesn't matter what
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.440]  your backend is. It doesn't matter whether
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440]  you're running Linux or Unix or if you've got
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440]  a Microsoft system
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.440]  or something like that.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.440]  You can use MailRoute because
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.440]  it's not software that you install
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.440]  on your server.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.440]  It's a DNS type thing.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.440]  So you go into your domain and you set
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.440]  your DNS records for mail
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.440]  to point your domain
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.440]  at MailRoute first.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.440]  And in your MailRoute account, you tell
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.440]  your MailRoute account where your actual email server
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440]  is. So then, it's just
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440]  simple. MailRoute
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440]  doesn't host your email. They don't run email servers.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.440]  They're just a little DNS filtering service.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.440]  The mail comes in.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440]  MailRoute takes all the crap out.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440]  All the spam, all the junk,
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.440]  anything that has viruses
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.440]  or fishy attachments and stuff
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.440]  like that. They filter
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440]  all that out. And then,
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440]  the email immediately goes just right
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.440]  to your server.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.440]  So now, you haven't done anything to your server.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440]  You haven't changed a damn thing. All you've done is changed
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.440]  your DNS records. But then, all of a
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.440]  sudden, the inbox
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440]  is for all of your users.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.440]  It's like me and you've got one
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.440]  person at
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.440]  Fireball.net, one email,
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.440]  where it's a big company and you've got thousands of
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.440]  people. All of a sudden, the inbox is
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.440]  for every account on your system. Have all the
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.440]  crap just filtered out.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.440]  It's amazing.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.440]  It's super, super accurate. Really,
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.440]  really good. This is all this company does.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.440]  They've got great stuff
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.440]  on our website. You can read about some of the stuff
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.440]  they do to
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.440]  have this incredibly highly
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.440]  tuned spam filtering engine.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]  It's just amazing.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.440]  And they have really cool features, too.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.440]  They have stuff that can send you
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.440]  you can configure it. So, if you want to
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.440]  get it once a day, you get it once a day.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.440]  You can get it like every week. But you can get a report
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.440]  from them that would list
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440]  all of the
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.440]  maybes. Like, here's ten emails
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.440]  that we filtered out today that we're pretty sure
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.440]  are spam, but maybe these aren't. Take a look at them.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.440]  And then, if you see one every once in a while,
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.440]  like when you buy something online, like for me,
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.440]  sometimes the receipt for whatever
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440]  you bought often gets hit by a spam filter
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.440]  or something like that. I think mail routes
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.440]  filtering is amazingly accurate.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.440]  Nothing's perfect. But then you get this report,
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.440]  you've got this peace of mind where you've got this real nice
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440]  easy thing to scan just to
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.440]  make sure that nothing's getting filtered
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.440]  that you didn't want to get filtered. And if they do make a mistake,
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.440]  it's like two clicks and, okay,
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.440]  we know that's not spam and it won't happen again.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.440]  Really, really good.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.440]  They've got
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.440]  as a typical user, their default, you
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440]  can just hook it up, let it go, forget it, don't worry about it.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.440]  You're done. If you are
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.440]  like an IT professional, if you're the sort of
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.440]  person out there who runs the
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.440]  email for your company, they've got all
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.440]  sorts of APIs, anything you want.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.440]  If you really do want to get down and dirty
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.440]  and deal with the code and hook it up
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440]  and connect it to things, they've got all
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.440]  sorts of stuff.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.440]  Go check them out. Here's where you go. Go to
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.440]  mailroute, m-a-i-l-r-o-u-t-e
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.440]  dot net
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.440]  slash t-t-s
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.440]  like the talk show, just t-t-s.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.440]  And you will get a
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.440]  free trial and if you use that code
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.440]  slash t-t-s on the
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440]  domain, when you do sign up, you save
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.440]  10% for the lifetime
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.440]  of your account. So you could use this
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.440]  and 10, 15 years from now, you'll still
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.440]  be saving money thanks to the talk show.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.440]  So my thanks to them. Go check them out.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.440]  Really, really great service. I personally recommend it.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:41.440]  What else we got on Apple TV?
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.440]  Oh, here's one I noticed. And speaking
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.440]  of games,
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440]  here's one I noticed.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.440]  And I can't believe, this one is
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  maybe the first thing that I encountered
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440]  that surprised me. So
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.440]  we did the thing like I
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.440]  talked about where we, okay, you have a new
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.440]  Apple TV. Use your
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.440]  iPhone and it'll send your
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.440]  Wi-Fi password and your
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.440]  Apple ID and stuff like that.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.440]  All work great. But
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.440]  for Game Center, that means that our
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.440]  Apple TV is me.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.440]  And when we launch a game that is
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.440]  Game Center integration, it says, hello, Gruber.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.440]  And
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.440]  it doesn't seem like there's any easy way to switch.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.440]  It seems to me like it ought to be
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.440]  like
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  PS4 and Xbox
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.440]  where you can set up multiple profiles so that
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.440]  Jonas can easily,
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.440]  when he's playing a game, easily switch
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.440]  to his Apple ID and
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440]  not have to log out and log in and type
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.440]  his password, which is ridiculous.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.440]  It seems like you should be able to have multiple Game
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.440]  Center profiles. Like I understand why you don't
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  on an iOS device because they're designed to be
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.440]  personal. And I know that
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.440]  a lot of people wish that like the
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  iPad in particular could have multiple
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.440]  user accounts.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440]  But that's just not how they're designed. But Apple TV
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.440]  by definition is designed
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.440]  to be used by everybody who lives in the same household.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.440]  I agree. I think it's a big oversight.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.440]  I'm really surprised. I mean,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.440]  I can't help but think that they know about it. And
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.440]  even given all the time that they've spent working
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  on it, I just can't help but
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.440]  hope that this is just, well, we didn't get to that yet.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440]  Yeah. Oh, I have to assume
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.440]  that we didn't get to that yet. But I'm not
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.440]  entirely sure how closely tied
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.440]  the Game Center
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.440]  account is to your Apple ID.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.440]  Like, if you switch
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.440]  the Game Center account, it should be totally separate, right?
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.440]  It is, yeah. And you can
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.440]  also do the same thing
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.440]  like with the iPhone.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.440]  You can have a different iTunes store account
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  from your iCloud account.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.440]  So if you, like I do,
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.440]  like a dummy, I have
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.440]  an Apple ID that I use for
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.440]  iCloud. This is the thing I get email from.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.440]  It's the address where you can send me
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:49.440]  iMessages.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.440]  But I have a different account for my store
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440]  purchases. I think there's a lot of, like, people
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.440]  who've been using iTunes since the early days of
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.440]  the store, a lot of people might have that type
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  of setup. That's weird. And
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.440]  I started with, like, an iTunes account.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  Yeah, iTunes. I remember iTunes.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.440]  Was the domain iTunes back then?
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440]  Or did they not even have email?
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.440]  I can't remember.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  For me, it was...
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.440]  I do know that I give, like, my
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  Mac.com is what I give everybody,
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  despite the fact that it's...
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.440]  Here's one thing that bugs me.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440]  Apple merges Mac and me and iCloud
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  and all of their
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440]  experimental stuff
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  down into one account.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.440]  They just count it all as the same.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  But other services don't.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  So I'll get a Google invite
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  from the Google group, and it'll be like
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  my at-me account.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440]  I can't log in because it's
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  not Mac, or I used iCloud.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440]  It's frustrating.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440]  Yeah.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  It's the
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  penalty of not having the foresight
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  to pick the right domain
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440]  off the start.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440]  Compare and contrast with Google,
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440]  who nailed it.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.440]  It used to be that Google didn't have
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.440]  any way that you could get email from them.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  And then low one
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  April Fool's Day, they said, okay, now we
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440]  have a thing called Gmail.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440]  And you can sign up for whatever you want at
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440]  gmail.com.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  Ten years later, it's
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440]  exactly the same. And you've never had to worry about it.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  They didn't change it to Google Mail.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  They didn't change it to At Google.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.440]  Last month, they didn't change it to Alphabet
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440]  or A-mail.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440]  That's what Amy gets.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.440]  Amy gets A-mail.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  They just got it right
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  the first time, and nobody ever
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440]  has to worry about it.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.440]  I still use the Mac.com, too,
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  but every once in a while, for whatever reason,
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440]  it's like something will come in
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  to me.com.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  Yeah, it gets annoying.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.440]  And like you said, other services don't see that as
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440]  being the synonyms for the same email
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440]  account.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440]  So they rebranded them.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.440]  Because they were like, okay, that
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.440]  last one sucked. I've done that like three
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440]  times now.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  But I mean, that's just collateral damage
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440]  for long-term users. Every time they
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  change it up, it's like, ah, man.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440]  I like sticking with the Mac.com one
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.440]  just out of nostalgia, but that was the
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.440]  name that was the most
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440]  short-sighted. They should have known
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  that they were going to use this for more than just the Mac.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.440]  Yeah.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  Oops.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.440]  Well, anyway, you can have
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  a different ID for the store
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  than for
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  your iCloud. So to get your photos
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  and stuff in through the photosyncing,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  you can have a different account for that. And you can have a different
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440]  account for Game Center. It defaults
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440]  to whichever one you used
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  when you first set it up. Because for most people,
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440]  that's the right thing, is they're going to use the same
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.440]  ID for all of those things. But
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440]  it doesn't seem like there's any way, unless I've missed
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  something, it doesn't seem like there's any way to switch
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.440]  Game Center accounts. It does fuel it.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.440]  Not in a point of
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440]  release, but eventually a multi-user
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440]  system would make a lot of sense for the TV,
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440]  right? Yeah, it seems like it.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440]  And Netflix
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  has a pretty good thing for that, where you can
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  tell Netflix how many people are in your family
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.440]  and right when you launch the app,
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  who's watching?
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440]  Yeah, it even asks me, it says, are you a kid?
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440]  And I don't even have any kids.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440]  Still me.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440]  I think I use
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.440]  kids when I'm babysitting, like my
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440]  friend's kid or something. Right, and keep
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440]  them out of the...
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.440]  Well, it's not like there's anything crazy on there.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440]  Well, I wasn't even thinking crazy.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440]  But with kids,
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440]  depending on how young they are, even PG-13
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  stuff is... Yeah, there can be some pretty
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440]  scary stuff. Right.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440]  You don't want to have kids watching
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440]  Indiana Jones eat the monkey brains.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.440]  Yeah, exactly. Well, especially when I'm
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440]  babysitting.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440]  Yeah.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.440]  Just don't screw this one up.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.440]  It was great. It made me watch a man
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440]  eat a monkey's brain.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.440]  And then all of a sudden you're in trouble.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.440]  Like it's Indiana Jones.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440]  Yeah, so that needs to change at some point.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  Because that would...
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440]  That affects a lot of stuff, right? Because if you
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440]  can change users, then
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.440]  suggestions can change.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440]  Right.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440]  Basically system-wide, you can start
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.440]  doing more interesting stuff. Like the apps on the
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  home screen can change. Yeah.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  Totally. You don't
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  necessarily want Minecraft
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.440]  or whatever, I can't even think of anything.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.440]  Like a pile of stuff that Jonas
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440]  wants, you don't necessarily want, right?
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  Right. I think
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  in the long run, almost
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440]  any and all games that we end up with this
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440]  thing are going to be for Jonas, not for me.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  So in some sense... I mean, he doesn't want to see
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.440]  like Wall Street Journal video
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  thing.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  Like the All Things D conference is
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  not necessarily going to be tuning into
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  that all the time.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  Uh...
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  I don't know why.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  It's just me and you, so I'll brag. But I was
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.440]  happy when I installed Cannibalt
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.440]  and I got Cannibalt from the list
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.440]  of... I guess they've made it...
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440]  What are they calling it? A universal... It's not a universal
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.440]  binary, but like a universal download.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.440]  So like if you already own it, you can just download it
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.440]  for free. So it was like, here's all the apps I've
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.440]  already purchased that have Apple TV apps today.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  And I went to Cannibalt. And the app
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.440]  description for Cannibalt starts
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440]  with a quote from me
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.440]  about how nice a game it is.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440]  That's awesome.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440]  And I look at Jonas and I was like, yeah!
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.440]  And Jonas, he just looked at me
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.440]  and he was like, it doesn't even mention you
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.440]  by name, it just says Daring Fireball.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  I was like,
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  I was trying to impress you!
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  Well, that's not...
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  He's got a good head on his shoulders, though.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440]  I know you're proud
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.440]  and that's awesome, but it's good that he's not like...
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440]  No, he is not wowed at all.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440]  He is not impressed.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440]  I thought it was pretty cool, though.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  But I also think it's cool because I am obviously
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.440]  not very well known for my game reviews.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  I don't play many games.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440]  So I think
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440]  that's what made it so surprising to me.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.440]  I think if you
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440]  added up all of the games I've even
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440]  mentioned in
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440]  13 years
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  of writing Daring Fireball,
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440]  you probably still might have some fingers to spare.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  Certainly wouldn't use up
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440]  all your fingers and toes. It's got to be less than 20.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  Yeah, you don't talk about games
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440]  much at all. So I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440]  So Cannonball is cool.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.440]  Adam put in
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  quite a bit of work to get that working.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  Not quite a bit of work.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440]  He spent like a week to get it working, but he had to do
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.440]  this UI focus thing.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  Yeah,
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440]  it's actually...
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440]  It's become a
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  bigger game in some ways than it used to be.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  I haven't played in a long time.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  Maybe the iPhone game has it too, but at the beginning
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440]  you can select a level or something.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  I didn't even know. I only played the default
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.440]  again, but
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440]  it was excellent. So he did have to do work. You know him?
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  Yeah.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.440]  I've worked with him before.
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.440]  It translates very well.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440]  It does.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.440]  Alto's Adventure is good.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440]  I haven't heard of it.
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440]  I've never heard of this game.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440]  It's, again, similar kind of idea
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440]  in that it's an infinite runner.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440]  Except you're on a snowboard.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.440]  Is this the one that Siracusa is always
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  talking about on ATP?
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.440]  I don't know.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440]  I think it is.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  And he talks about it in a way
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  where I can hear him sighing
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  at my ignorance of Alto's Adventure.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  And I can hear him
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440]  calling me an old man right now.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  It could be Desert Golfing.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  I know they talk about that.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  Son of a bitch, that game is addictive.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  I don't think that one would work
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  on the TV, though, would it?
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  I guess it could.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  I don't know. Guess what? I haven't tried it.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  Interestingly,
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.440]  our pal
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440]  Matt Colby
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440]  and Nevin
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440]  have got Space Age.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440]  I saw that.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440]  It's one of the ones
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.440]  that I definitely know of.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.440]  And it was in my list of
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440]  hey, you already
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  own this thing.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440]  So I tried it for about two minutes last night.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440]  It was getting late by the time.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.440]  It was way too late. It wasn't making any sense.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.440]  But it's interesting
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  in that they do with the
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  trackpad what you're suggesting.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440]  In that there is
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440]  a cursor on the screen
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  that you move and then you click.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  Space Age works more like
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.440]  a standard RTS game.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.440]  You've got units that you select and move them around.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440]  So they've had to make
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  affordances to get that on the TV.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  So you can scroll a view by holding
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.440]  down the play pause button
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.440]  and then the trackpad
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  will move the window around.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440]  And then if you're just
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440]  not holding down the play pause button, then you're
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  moving effectively the mouse cursor around.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  Do they have a little
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.440]  first run tutorial where they tell you what to do?
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.440]  Yeah, they do.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.440]  That makes sense. And I think for games,
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.440]  there's nothing wrong with a cursor.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.440]  And I think for certain games, obviously
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.440]  for some of the strategy type games like that
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440]  where it makes all the sense in the world.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.440]  What else was an interesting game?
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  I was thinking about something else.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.440]  Oh, forget it.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.440]  I guess one thing I'm surprised
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.440]  there are a lot of games available
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.440]  already day one.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440]  I think that's pretty impressive. And I think it's surprising
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  how much some of them, this is where I was going.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.440]  I'm surprised at how many of them
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  that were designed for
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  a touchscreen device like
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.440]  iPhone or iPad
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.440]  actually seem to translate pretty well
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.440]  to the trackpad device.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  Yeah,
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.440]  seems that way so far. Again, I've spent
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.440]  a day with it, so it's kind of hard to tell.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.440]  But, uh...
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  I mean, so like
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.440]  an infinite runner is a little bit easy, right?
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.440]  Because you hit a jump button.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440]  So, problem solved.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440]  But yeah,
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.440]  a lot of games
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.440]  seem that they came over
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.440]  pretty well.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.440]  I do have a
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.440]  my working theory is that
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  games will
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.440]  it's like water.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.440]  They will take the form
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.440]  of whatever the platform best supports.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.440]  So I think we'll start seeing some pretty interesting
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:18.440]  games in a while.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.440]  But they will be tailored to this
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.440]  iPad and the motion controller
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.440]  and the interaction that the TV
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440]  has rather than being
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.440]  a port from something else.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  One of the games we got, I don't know if it must be a port
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.440]  because anything that's out already had to have
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440]  been a port, but we had this game called
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.440]  MantaCore?
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.440]  M-A-N-T-I-C-O-R-E
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440]  It's a 3D space shooter.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440]  You're like
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.440]  the last surviving pilot
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.440]  of the good guys.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.440]  And you're flying a spaceship
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440]  in outer space and
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  killing bad guys.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440]  Graphically,
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440]  it seems pretty good.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.440]  Jonas gave it a thumbs up.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.440]  But this is more of a
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.440]  serious game.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.440]  This is like a game game.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440]  Real 3D. And the controls
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  I had to let Jonas play because I was so bad.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  I was like here you
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  play and I'll watch.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.440]  But the controls are accelerometer based.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.440]  And so you steer
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440]  the ship in 3D
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  by the motion of
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  the device.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440]  And Jonas got the hang of it pretty quickly.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  He was doing pretty good.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  He clearly had control over the ship.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.440]  And then you flick up to
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.440]  do a speed boost and you flick
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.440]  down on the trackpad to slow.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  And
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  it shoots automatically.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.440]  So you don't have to fire
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.440]  a trigger. If there's
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.440]  bad guys in the sights of your gun
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  it just fires.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  Which is
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.440]  to me all told
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440]  to me what is a complicated idea
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  a 3D space shooter.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.440]  A pretty good
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  simplification for a simple remote.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  Accelerometer to move.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  Flick up for fast.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  Down for slow.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.440]  You don't have to worry about a trigger. It just shoots.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  Yeah, it seems to make sense.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  I'm going to check that one out tonight.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  And it's cool to
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.440]  just a cool
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.440]  little thing to me.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  I know it's not the
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.440]  only game, but it's obviously a trend.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  The
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.440]  protagonist is a woman.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.440]  Oh, cool.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  They don't really make a big deal out of it.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  You're the woman
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  who's the last star pilot
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  of whatever the good guys are called.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  Yeah, that's good. Awesome.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440]  I mean, it's arbitrary anyway.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.440]  Why not? You know what I mean?
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.440]  Right.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  Whatever. It doesn't sound like there's enough
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  story there that any kind of gender
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440]  is going to make any kind of difference.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  Me having said that, just the
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  last 40 seconds of the show,
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  I'm not part of gamergate now,
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.440]  am I?
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.440]  Don't get me started on gamergate.
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  I don't know.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  I don't understand it.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  I just worry that
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  somebody says something like that
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  like, hey, that's pretty cool that the cool pilot
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  is a woman, and then all of a sudden you're
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440]  part of a controversy that shouldn't be
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  controversial. Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440]  Yeah. Oh, Adam went back and added
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440]  a female
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  runner to Time Vault.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440]  Oh, yeah, I saw that. We got that. You just get it
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440]  randomly. Yeah.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440]  We got that.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  Yeah, that's cool.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.440]  Yeah, and just like a ninja, too.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.440]  Yeah, he had a few of them.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440]  Yeah, and very nice touch.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440]  We got
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440]  the Beat Sports
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  game, which
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440]  is pretty fun.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440]  I guess my biggest complaint about it
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440]  is that it's
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440]  so derivative of
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  Wii Sports in ways,
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  in certain ways that I feel like
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  okay,
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  the basic concept of you having an
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  accelerometer type control in your hand that
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  you actually swing to make the
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.440]  player on screen swing at a ball.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  Okay, that's
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.440]  obviously the same idea, but I feel
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440]  like you're
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  allowed to do that without being called a rip-off.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  But they do little things that
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  to me are like, it's like
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  the crowd noise and the way that the levels
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  start, it
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  really feels like a little
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  too close to Wii and
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.440]  style. The basic idea of the
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  concept, okay, of course the comparisons
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  are inevitable.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.440]  But some of the details, some of the sound effects
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.440]  are so Nintendo-like, it
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.440]  just seems a little, makes me
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.440]  kind of grip my teeth.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  Yeah, it's one thing to
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  do something in the spirit of
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  another game, it's another thing to kind of just rip it off.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]  Right, and even the name, when you say it
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.440]  out loud, Beat Sports sounds so much
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.440]  like Wii Sports that it's
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  I don't know. But it's a cool game,
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.440]  I have to say.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  I mean, just based on
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.440]  the name and the thing, you know what the
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  pitch was in the room, right?
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  The pitch
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.440]  was Wii Sports without
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.440]  any Nintendo intellectual
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  property.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.440]  But that's another one too, and it
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  popped into my head here, I have it written down, but it
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  popped into my head because it's
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.440]  what do they
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440]  call it, it's like instead of a Wii,
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  it's your beat
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  or something, but anyway, your avatar.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  And it's, you know,
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.440]  total range of skin tones
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.440]  and gender and outfits and
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  you know, another thing to me that's
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  the way games ought to be.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  That's cool,
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.440]  yeah, it's good to think so.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.440]  And your default though, the default character is
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.440]  a girl.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  If you don't, just like out of the box, it's like
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.440]  she's, I don't know what her name is, but she
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.440]  probably has some kind of name.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  She's like
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  their Mario, I guess.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.440]  That's cool.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.440]  The problem with that game,
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.440]  I'll just say the problem with the Beat Sports
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.440]  is that you
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.440]  can only have one Apple TV remote
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.440]  or Siri remote, I guess they call it.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.440]  Right. So for one player,
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.440]  you know, it doesn't matter, but when you
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.440]  play two player,
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.440]  the way that you play two player
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.440]  is you have to download their free app for the phone
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  and when you play two player,
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  it no longer becomes accelerometer-based.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.440]  It's all
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.440]  swipe-based.
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.440]  So one person plays on their phone,
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.440]  the other person plays on the remote. Because I was
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.440]  wondering about it. I was like, I don't know,
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440]  accelerometer with the
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.440]  iPhones seems like a disastrous idea.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440]  Like as much as they're worried and
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440]  Nintendo, you remember Nintendo had to
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.440]  send out those
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440]  bracelets that you connect to the
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.440]  Wiimote.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.440]  Apple has one too. Apple has one for the,
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.440]  it doesn't come with it. You have to
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  pay extra for it, but you can get a
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.440]  bracelet with it.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440]  And it connects to the lightning
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  port and has
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  like a little lock, so you have to squeeze it
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.440]  to get it out.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.440]  Well, it just seemed to me like a terrible
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.440]  idea to be swinging your iPhone around
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.440]  like a paddle. And in fact, they don't
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.440]  let you do that. It's all swipe-based.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.440]  But in other words, but then unlike
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.440]  Wii Sports, you're playing like a totally different
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.440]  game. It feels like
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.440]  when you're playing two player instead of one player.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.440]  That's weird.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.440]  I'm gonna have to give that a try.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.440]  Because I mean, changing the game mechanic is
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.440]  weird. Like, those are just different games.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.440]  Yeah, it's very different. But you know,
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.440]  like you said, it's just you, so
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440]  you don't have to worry about it. It's just one player mode.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.440]  The other thing, and Jonas picked up on this.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.440]  It's been a lot
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440]  of fun for me as a dad because Jonas
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.440]  is really, really into video games.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  Video games are his thing.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.440]  And so it was
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.440]  really, it's been really fun for me playing with
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440]  Apple TV with him and playing with the games because
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.440]  he's
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440]  better at, not just better at playing games,
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.440]  but he's a more astute
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.440]  observer of
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.440]  the cleverness that's going on.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440]  He picked up on what Beat Sports is.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.440]  So the thing about Beat Sports that is completely
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.440]  original, and I think
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.440]  that's how they justify
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.440]  the name Beat Sports, is
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.440]  that it's music based.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.440]  Christina Warren wrote about it too in her review
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.440]  of it. She called it like a
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.440]  mashup of Wii Sports and
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.440]  Guitar Hero.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.440]  So it's the timing.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.440]  And the timing is tied to the music
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.440]  of the game. And so the moment
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.440]  when you're supposed to, like if you're playing their
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440]  version of tennis, the moment you're supposed to hit
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.440]  the ball coincides
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440]  to like a
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.440]  moment in the music where there's
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:28.440]  going to be like a sound, the sound that it
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440]  makes as you hit the ball is part of the
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440]  music. And so that's
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440]  how you get your timing down. Your timing isn't so
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.440]  much about what you see. Your timing is
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440]  more like what you hear.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.440]  Yeah, I love
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  those kind of games. Like I wouldn't
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.440]  go so far as to say you could play with your eyes
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.440]  closed, but it's the same way though that you
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.440]  definitely can't play with the sound off.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.440]  Like if you turn the sound off, you're not
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440]  going to get it. Your timing is
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.440]  never going to be right. Which is pretty interesting.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  Yeah, there's been a few
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  cool games like that.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.440]  Rez comes to mind from like 20 years ago.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  But
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  yeah, it's like you, if
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  you're getting in the groove of the music, you start
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  doing way better.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.440]  John August actually had
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  worked on
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.440]  the new Karateka for iOS.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  It is also musically rhythm
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  based as you fight.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  John August
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  of screenwriting
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  fame. Screenwriting fame, yeah.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  With Jordan Meckner
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  who wrote the original Karateka.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.440]  Right, which was awesome.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.440]  Adam Lassigord did the ad.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  Yeah, it was terrific. He's got a great podcast too.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.440]  Script Notes?
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.440]  Script Notes is... I can't
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.440]  say enough good things about it.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  You know, it's funny because
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  Marco was on the other week and we talked about Hello
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  Internet and what a great podcast it was.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  I don't know. Maybe I should do
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.440]  more recommendations like that. I don't listen to a ton of
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  podcasts. But I got so
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  much email from people who are like, wow, I've never heard
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  of this Hello Internet. No offense
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  to you, this might be my new favorite podcast.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  And it's like, no offense taken.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  It's a great podcast. They're really cool.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  If you want another one, Script Notes.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  Look it up with John August
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  talking about the
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  screenwriting process, which is fascinating by itself.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  But if you're in a creative
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  line of work,
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.440]  it's good anyway.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.440]  Even if you're not in a movie business, even if you're
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.440]  not a writer, it's
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.440]  fascinating if you're just into... if there's
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.440]  any kind of creativity in your work,
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.440]  it's
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440]  applicable. A great, great podcast.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  He's
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  co-hosted with Craig Mazin.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  I promise to
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.440]  get to put it in the show notes.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.440]  Perfect.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  So...
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  Script Notes.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  Do you have anything else specific?
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  I'm trying to think.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.440]  You know, I guess
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.440]  the thing that I kind of...
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:52.440]  the review unit that I have now
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  is... I ordered mine, but
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.440]  since I knew I was getting one from Apple
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.440]  Thursday, I didn't pay the extra
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.440]  $17 for the...
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  to get another one delivered today because
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.440]  it seemed pointless. So the one I
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.440]  ordered, I guess won't come until next week
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.440]  sometime. And I guess what I'm regretting
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  is that I didn't order the game controller.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:12.440]  There was this one game controller that Apple
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:14.440]  was, I guess, sort of suggesting that you buy.
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:16.440]  I forget what it was called.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.440]  That's interesting.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.440]  And Jonas...
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  this is the thing, talking with Jonas about it, is...
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.440]  are we going to want a game controller for this
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  or not? Because we have a PS4, so for anything
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  the games like Destiny
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.440]  and when Star Wars Battlefront
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  comes out, you know,
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  it's going to play
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.440]  games like that on the PS4.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.440]  And so, do we... you know, the question
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  of whether we, or
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  we in particular, the Gruber household,
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  want a game controller or more than one game
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:46.440]  controller, and whether
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.440]  lots of people are going to want a game controller,
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  I don't know. Because it seems to me like most
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.440]  of the games I've tried so far really seem
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.440]  meant for the Apple TV remote.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.440]  So there was a bit of a kerfuffle
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.440]  about that, because originally they
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.440]  released the
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.440]  TV design doc
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.440]  saying that you could use
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.440]  third-party game controllers.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.440]  Then they changed it to say
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.440]  that your game must support
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  the Apple remote.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.440]  Right. In other words, what they
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.440]  took out was... it
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.440]  definitely said it, and they changed it
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:20.440]  180 degrees.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  I think what you're trying to say is, it did
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.440]  say you can make a game that
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:26.440]  has to have a game controller.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.440]  And maybe, I guess it would be like
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.440]  there'd be a warning in the store.
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.440]  Actually, I guess
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.440]  your Apple TV could know whether you have
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.440]  a controller paired or not,
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.440]  and it could just say, hey, this game requires
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.440]  a controller, and you don't even have one paired
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.440]  with the game yet. Are you sure you want to buy this?
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440]  And then, like, a day
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.440]  later, the language changed
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  to the exact opposite and said,
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.440]  your game
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.440]  must be fully playable with the
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.440]  default remote.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:56.440]  Which just destroys
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.440]  so many classes of games.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.440]  Yeah.
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.440]  Oops. Oh well.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.440]  I still think you'll get a lot of cool games
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:06.440]  based on the remote, but until they fix
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.440]  that
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.440]  game controller issue,
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.440]  I think you're going to be stymied.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:14.440]  Yeah. Like, you may have a chicken and egg.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.440]  Like, what you're saying is, like,
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  I think if Jonas did see a lot of cool games that needed
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.440]  the controller, you'd be like, well, fine.
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.440]  Let's get a controller.
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.440]  I think it'll chicken and egg it
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440]  in a weird way that nobody will make them
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.440]  because they can't. Right.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.440]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.440]  I just wonder, I don't know. Do you have one?
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.440]  A controller? No.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:36.440]  Yeah. I don't even understand.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.440]  I'll probably buy one. I might buy one.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.440]  I'm trying to see where the hell it is.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.440]  Now that they don't have the Apple store anymore, I don't even know
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.440]  where you go to
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.440]  find it. I just remember that when I went to buy
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.440]  it, it had, like, an option. Here, I'll just
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:50.440]  buy a new one.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.440]  You know what I did find a bit confusing
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.440]  is it's hard to tell when you're in the
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:56.440]  iTunes store or when you're just looking at
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.440]  a show that you own. Right.
[01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.440]  Here, the SteelSeries
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.440]  Nimbus wireless game controller
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.440]  is the one that Apple has
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.440]  as, like, a suggested
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440]  add-on.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440]  Where was that?
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.440]  It was, uh...
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.440]  From here. Is that Logitech?
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.440]  Logitech.
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.440]  I don't know.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:22.440]  It's weird. It doesn't seem...
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.440]  SteelSeries...
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440]  No, it'd be great if they could just support
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440]  Xbox and PS4 controllers.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  That's what I was wondering about.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  Out of the box. It'll just detect them and...
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.440]  Yeah. And it seems like
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.440]  if they just supported those out of the box
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  it would solve a lot of the problem
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.440]  of, you know, X, Y, and Z.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  They're known commodities.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.440]  Um...
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  Yeah, SteelSeries...
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  Uh...
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  Well, I don't even know
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  how you know which ones work with it, but
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.440]  Apple had one that they were selling and it was, like, 50 bucks.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  Well, I mean, check it out after
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440]  some more software comes out, I guess.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.440]  Yeah, so I don't know. I feel like
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  this is one of the things that one day in
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  it's too early to tell whether
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  everybody wants to get one or not.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  I don't know what made me get cheap
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.440]  and not get one.
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  It doesn't...
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.440]  Not your usual play.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:20.440]  As I stare
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  around the office here, my office,
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.440]  and it's just filled with things
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.440]  that I've spent 50 dollars on
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.440]  on the notion of,
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:30.440]  well, why the hell not?
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  And yet, somehow,
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  in this one particular instance, I didn't do it
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.440]  and now I regret it.
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.440]  Did you get the 64-meg one?
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  Now, you know what?
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.440]  I still am not entirely
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.440]  clear on what the benefit is.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.440]  I just feel like for 50 bucks
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:48.440]  I might as well... I don't want to run out of space.
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.440]  Yeah, but they're selling them as
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  two different units, right?
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.440]  Is that so that, like, the lesser one
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440]  leads you to buy the bigger one?
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.440]  Is that it?
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.440]  Like, they didn't want to come out with a $200 thing?
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  I guess.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:04.440]  I do wonder, though, why not
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.440]  just have one?
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  I guess
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440]  that the margins are better enough.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  We talk about this with everything.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  Obviously, endlessly
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.440]  over the last year or two about these
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.440]  16-gigabyte iPhones, and
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.440]  how much does it cost Apple to
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.440]  get the 32 instead of 16?
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.440]  What are their costs?
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.440]  I mean, most people seem to think it only
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.440]  costs like a buck or two bucks or something
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440]  at their scale to
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440]  do it. The $50 difference
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.440]  between these two Apple TVs,
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440]  it can't possibly be anywhere
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440]  even close to $50 in difference
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  for the memory.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.440]  I mean, I say that without
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.440]  actually knowing, but it just seems
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.440]  almost impossible.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  $50 for any one component seems
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.440]  not likely.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  Right, or even give them, you know,
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.440]  their usual 30 or 40% profit margins
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.440]  and so assume that the cost is
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  $35 or something. It just doesn't seem right.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.440]  Not when you can go and buy 32 gigs
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  of really good flash memory
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  from Amazon just as a card, and it
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.440]  doesn't cost that much.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  So, I don't
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  know. And it just seems like it would be so
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.440]  much simpler. It would take out this
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.440]  whole decision. And the fact
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  that there are people writing articles, which
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  size Apple TV should you get,
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  that shouldn't even be an
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  issue.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.440]  I don't know. I just looked at it.
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.440]  I just pretend as though
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  there's one new Apple TV and it
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  costs $200 and 64 gigs of RAM.
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.440]  Yeah.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.440]  I'm curious to know which one
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  is their primary.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.440]  Not that they don't love all their kids equally,
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.440]  but you know what I mean? Like, did they set out to make
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  the 32 gigabyte we wanted and throw in
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.440]  extra memory? I
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.440]  guess, or maybe
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  maybe it was like
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  they really wanted to hit $150
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.440]  and
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.440]  whatever the difference in the component cost is,
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.440]  at $150,
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  the 64 gig just
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.440]  doesn't make Tim Cook happy
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:06.440]  financially.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.440]  So they did it. I don't know. But it just
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.440]  seems like it could have been an easier win.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.440]  Yeah. And I
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.440]  do kind of understand why they still sell the old
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.440]  Apple TV
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.440]  for $69.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.440]  Because
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  I know that there are institutions
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  like schools and stuff like that that use Apple TV
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.440]  just as a brain
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.440]  dead thing to do AirPlay to.
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.440]  So you may
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  not want to spend an
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.440]  extra $100 to get an awesome
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:36.440]  new computer that does all these things.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.440]  Because all you're doing is using it as like an
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:40.440]  AirPlay terminal.
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  And
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:44.440]  the difference is so, it's
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.440]  massive, right? The difference between the
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  old third gen Apple TV and this
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.440]  new one is obvious to anybody
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  who might have any interest in buying one
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:54.440]  instantly. Whereas the difference between
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.440]  a 32 and 64 gig version
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:58.440]  of the same thing is
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:00.440]  not so obvious.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:02.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.440]  I'm also curious, I'm curious to see how
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.440]  it'll work. Maybe, because one thing that's
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.440]  definitely true, and maybe that's the limit, you might
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.440]  know this, that your initial download
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:12.440]  I think has to be under 200 gigs,
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:14.440]  or 200 megs. It's 200 meg.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.440]  And you get up to 2 gigs with
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:18.440]  what they call on-demand resources.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:20.440]  App slices, right?
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:22.440]  Well, so app slicing is something different.
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.440]  App slicing will get you...
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.440]  App slicing means that you're not going to be
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:28.440]  downloading assets from your iPhone
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.440]  onto your TV.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:32.440]  Basically.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.440]  On-demand resources means that
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:36.440]  let's say in a game you can
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.440]  tag levels
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:40.440]  and it'll only download the
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:42.440]  resources for that level.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:44.440]  Or you've got four levels on
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.440]  Hoth, so all of the ice textures come down.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.440]  And then three levels
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:50.440]  on Tatooine. So you can
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:52.440]  get rid of the ice textures
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:54.440]  and load the sand textures, you know?
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.440]  You have
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:58.440]  up to 2 gigs of those
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:00.440]  available for your app.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.440]  Yeah.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:04.440]  And obviously they're enforcing
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.440]  it. I guess if you submit a binary
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.440]  that's over 200 megs, it
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.440]  probably doesn't even go through.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:12.440]  Yeah.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.440]  They've been
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.440]  good about that since day one at the app store
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.440]  where you couldn't
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:20.440]  download stuff over cell
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:22.440]  that was over, I think, 10 megs
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:24.440]  originally? Something like that? Yeah.
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:26.440]  I just sent you a link to something about that Manticore
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  game I was talking about. You don't have to click it now.
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:30.440]  For all I know it's going to start some kind of
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:32.440]  autoplay video.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.440]  There we go.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:36.440]  Oh, it looks nice.
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:38.440]  And if you go to
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:40.440]  Apple TV
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:42.440]  or Apple.com slash TV
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.440]  and then go to games and more
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.440]  it's like the
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.440]  games and more section of the Apple TV site.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:50.440]  They have a big picture of
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.440]  SteelSeries Nimbus wireless controller.
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.440]  I mean, it's not, you know, obviously
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.440]  they're not putting one in the box. They're not giving
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.440]  you one, but they're also not
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.440]  shying away from showing it
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.440]  off. I feel like
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.440]  this is the one thing that I just
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.440]  do not see how this is going to play out.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.440]  Either game controllers are going to be a big deal for
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.440]  Apple TV or they're going to be non-existent.
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.440]  I don't know. I think they probably just
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:14.440]  didn't get their act together yet
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.440]  on it.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.440]  I do think that the language that they
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.440]  originally had that they want
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.440]  to allow you to have a game controller is
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:24.440]  what they wanted.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.440]  And then somebody panicked
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.440]  and was like, wow, can we do this? We can't
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.440]  get the store to check for the
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.440]  presence of a controller. We're going to get a bunch
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.440]  of people getting mad at us.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  Yeah.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:38.440]  Or maybe just sort of the product
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:40.440]  marketing thing that they don't want to make it seem as
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:42.440]  though you need this thing that they're
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.440]  not even giving you.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.440]  Yeah, sure. Even that.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.440]  Something changed at the last minute.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.440]  And
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.440]  as progressive as
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.440]  Apple is in a lot of ways, in some
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.440]  ways they can be a pretty conservative company.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.440]  In terms of promising
[02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:00.440]  something like that or distracting you
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:02.440]  with a message like that, they don't want to
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.440]  do it.
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.440]  So I guess the thing would be like, take the lumps
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.440]  from the developers for changing the thing at the last
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.440]  minute.
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.440]  But at least we're not holding
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.440]  a time bomb here.
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.440]  I have one more sponsor to thank
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:20.440]  now that we're near the end of the show and I want to do
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.440]  this right now and then we'll wrap up.
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:24.440]  It's our good friends
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.440]  at Harry's. You guys know Harry's.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:28.440]  Harry's makes awesome
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.440]  shaving products. They make razors,
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.440]  they make the blades, they make
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.440]  shaving lotion that you can use
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.440]  aftershave. Anything related
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:38.440]  to shaving, Harry's does it.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:40.440]  They
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.440]  do it and they have great prices.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.440]  I mean, you can compare their prices to
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.440]  Amazon's for like Gillette blades and it
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:48.440]  really is half the price. And the way
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:50.440]  that they can do it is
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.440]  it's like as direct as it can
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.440]  get. They make their own blades
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  in their own factory over in Germany.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.440]  Like
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440]  they bought an old like 100 year old
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:02.440]  blade factory. They make their own.
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.440]  They sell them right to you. There's no middleman
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  involved. And
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  right now they want me to tell
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.440]  you that they are
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.440]  an official partner of
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.440]  the Movember Foundation.
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:16.440]  Movember is a thing where
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.440]  it's like a charity thing to remind people
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:20.440]  and raise funds for men's health.
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.440]  You know,
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:24.440]  I guess types of cancer and disease
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.440]  that affect men. And so
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  it's the Movember
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.440]  is for the month of November
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.440]  and guys grow mustaches
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  to raise awareness for men's
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.440]  health issues. So makes sense
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440]  for Harry's to partner with
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  that.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.440]  Really cool stuff.
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.440]  They have got stuff at their website. You can check out more
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  about that.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.440]  So I really do recommend you check out
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.440]  their site. Check out the stuff about Movember
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.440]  and it, you know, everybody wants
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:54.440]  to cure these diseases.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:56.440]  So they're going to give 1% of their sales
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:58.440]  and 1% of their time
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.440]  back to Movember
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:02.440]  for the whole month. So if you've been putting it off
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.440]  if you want to, and this is another one of the things
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:06.440]  that is a terrific, terrific gift.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.440]  So if, you know, your father, your son
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  any of the men in your life
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  you want to buy shaving stuff
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:14.440]  to get a gift for Christmas, go do it
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.440]  now. Do it in the month of November,
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.440]  Movember, whatever you want to call it.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.440]  And some of the money is going to go to a really good
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440]  cause in addition to the fact that you're going to get
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  a super great quality
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:26.440]  product. Go to
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.440]  here's where you go to do this. Go to
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440]  harrys.com.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:32.440]  Spell it the way you think it's spelled.
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.440]  And enter the code, the talk show.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:36.440]  That'll let them know you came from
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:38.440]  this show. It'll also save five bucks
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:40.440]  off your first order.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.440]  They've just
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:44.440]  crossed their million
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.440]  customer mark.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.440]  So that's amazing. There's already a million people
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.440]  who have tried Harry's.
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.440]  And I'll bet most of them have stuck with it because
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.440]  it's really a great way to do it.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.440]  It's just a high quality
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:58.440]  product at half the price
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.440]  and you don't have to leave
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  your house. Can't beat it.
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.440]  So my thanks to Harry's. Go there, check
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:06.440]  it out. Remember the code there is the talk
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:08.440]  show and you can get their starter
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.440]  kit for just ten bucks with that code. Ten
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.440]  bucks and you get everything you need.
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  Three blades, your choice
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.440]  of shaving cream or shave gel
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.440]  and razor handle
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  right to your door. Shipping is free
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:22.440]  by the way. So my thanks to
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  Harry's.
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  Anything else? Any other apps that you've seen?
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:28.440]  How about our friend James Thompson
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.440]  has built the first calculator. I think
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:32.440]  the slogan is the best calculator
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:34.440]  for your TV.
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:36.440]  True!
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.440]  And you know James is a great
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  guy.
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  As long term
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.440]  as just about anybody could be.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.440]  Peacock started in the mid
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:48.440]  90s, maybe even the early 90s for the Mac.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.440]  It has been
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.440]  around forever. I love
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.440]  that Peacock is there on day one
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.440]  on the Apple TV app store.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.440]  He kills it with that.
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.440]  He was on the watch day
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:02.440]  one too.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  Just ways that I would have never foreseen
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  the indie develop community
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.440]  evolving is the
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.440]  idea that 20 years ago
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.440]  James Thompson would be writing for the TV.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  This was the first
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.440]  third party one I fired up to. I got a test
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  flight for it and I was like
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:20.440]  let's do this.
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.440]  I love it.
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.440]  Do I foresee the need to do
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:26.440]  math on my television?
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  No. But of course I
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.440]  bought it and I'm glad it's there.
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.440]  It's actually really well done.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.440]  Of course.
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.440]  He did a great job. I told him I can't believe
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.440]  he got all those features in it.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.440]  It was a rough first start.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.440]  It's a rough stab at it.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.440]  Are you kidding?
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.440]  That is the world's most advanced
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:48.440]  television computer.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  When we were talking
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.440]  about typing and you said that you can long press
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  on a lower case letter to have it pop up
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  and be upper case temporarily.
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:58.440]  And that you could guess that. So I made a guess
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.440]  with PCALC that you could use
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  the play button to be the
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.440]  equals key. Worked.
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.440]  Of course he thought of that.
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.440]  Of course it works.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.440]  That's awesome.
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  Super smart. What else?
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  He's charging for it because he was debating on Twitter.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  It was $1.99.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  What do you think it should cost?
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.440]  I told him $9.99.
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.440]  $9.99.
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  Wait. $999?
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.440]  Yeah. Just go for it.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.440]  I am wretched. Just why not?
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  But no.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.440]  $9.99 is good.
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:34.440]  I just
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  want a higher price to apps, basically.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.440]  It's easier. I mean, not easier.
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.440]  It takes a lot of work to put
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.440]  these in. I don't know how many people are going to be
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.440]  buying apps.
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.440]  Yeah. I'm curious to see.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.440]  That's a big question.
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.440]  Because
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.440]  TV, game consoles
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.440]  have, really it's one of the most
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  well monetized
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.440]  maybe the best monetized form
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  of media. Whether it's going to stay, who knows.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.440]  But flagship games
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  cost $50 or $60.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]  I mean, that's pretty standard.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.440]  That's the most expensive
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.440]  media that most people buy.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.440]  Books don't cost $60.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  Movies are $15
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.440]  or $20 at the most.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  Games are the only thing that is monetized
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.440]  at levels of like
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  $50 or $60.
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.440]  Is that going to translate to Apple TV?
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.440]  I don't know about $50 or $60.
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  A lot of them are around $10, though.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  Beat Sports is $10.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  That's good.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.440]  That's what they started out on
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  iOS, too, though.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.440]  That's exactly what I thought.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.440]  There were a lot of apps that were
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  $9.99 on iOS.
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.440]  So we'll see.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.440]  I'm
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  super excited about this platform.
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  More so than I was for the watch.
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.440]  Now, that could just be a sign that
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  I don't
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  have the imagination enough to figure out what I want
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  to do with the watch, but as soon as they announced this
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.440]  TV, I had like eight different ideas
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:02.440]  that I wanted to write for it.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  Do
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.440]  you share that?
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  I do, too.
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  I've
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.440]  never been super excited about the watch.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  I've been intrigued.
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.440]  I do wear mine, but I don't wear it every day.
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  I foresee
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:22.440]  a bright future for it, but I just don't think
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.440]  that Apple Watch was ever
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.440]  really squarely in the market
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:28.440]  for it. It's just
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  not the sort of thing that
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.440]  speaks to me overall.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.440]  Fitness, really.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  Right.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.440]  Ultimately,
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  once I stop wearing it every day,
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.440]  and there is this weird motivating thing
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  where you want to keep filling these circles every day,
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  and you get the street going, and you keep going,
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  and I'm sure people are more fit, but then once you stop wearing it every day,
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.440]  and so because you didn't wear it every day,
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.440]  you definitely, by definition,
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:54.440]  have days where you don't fill the circles.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  It just means you don't care anymore.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.440]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:00.440]  I don't know. It doesn't excite me that much.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.440]  A bigger screen, to me,
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:04.440]  is more exciting.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.440]  So yeah, I'm super excited about this, because
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.440]  it's like a little
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:10.440]  iOS computer
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  hooked up to a giant shared experience.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.440]  Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you could do with this.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:16.440]  Yeah, and I'm really
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.440]  interested to see,
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:20.440]  like with the
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:22.440]  iPhone, and to me, it's the most exciting
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.440]  since the iPhone, because
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:26.440]  with the iPhone, starting
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:28.440]  in 2008, the next year when the App Store
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:30.440]  opened, and all of a sudden, anybody
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:32.440]  could write apps.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.440]  You got apps that
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:36.440]  Apple never would have thought of,
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.440]  and it took the platform
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:40.440]  in ways that nobody could
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.440]  have foreseen, and I think
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.440]  that's got to be inevitable with Apple TV,
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.440]  and that, you know,
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:48.440]  and yes, I know that there's ways that you can
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:50.440]  develop, and you can,
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.440]  there's other devices
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:54.440]  that you can hook up to a TV, you can
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:56.440]  just have a gaming PC hooked up to a TV,
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:58.440]  and it's even easier
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:00.440]  or more open
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:02.440]  than an App Store, because anybody can,
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  you know, you don't even need an App Store to get
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:06.440]  apps running on anything, but people don't do it,
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:08.440]  and so it's not a big enough
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:10.440]  audience to make it worthwhile.
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.440]  Like, I've never really heard of an app that somebody
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:14.440]  made, the only thing I've ever heard that's worthwhile with
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:16.440]  a gaming PC hooked up to a TV is playing games,
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:18.440]  PC games. I've never heard
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:20.440]  of anybody who did something truly
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:22.440]  original, whereas I feel like with Apple TV,
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.440]  now there's this platform
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:26.440]  where there's going to be millions of people who have them,
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:28.440]  and who already know what
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.440]  apps are, and already have an App Store account,
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:32.440]  and I'm really curious to see what people do with it.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:34.440]  Yeah, me too. Storehouse,
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:36.440]  we didn't mention. Oh, yeah, I have that.
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:38.440]  That looks great. Yeah, so
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:40.440]  Storehouse,
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:42.440]  to me,
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:44.440]  it's,
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:46.440]  I didn't spend a lot of time with it,
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:48.440]  but it really, like, breathes
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.440]  on TV in a way that
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:52.440]  I,
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:54.440]  it's a
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.440]  great example of what makes Storehouse Storehouse.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:58.440]  Storehouse is, you
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:00.440]  upload images and
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:02.440]  movies, and you can add text
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.440]  too, and make, like, an article, but it's not really
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:06.440]  like you're formatting a document. It's
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:08.440]  more like a way to build, like,
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:10.440]  a
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.440]  photo and video-based
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.440]  slideshow. Sort of?
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.440]  It's hard to describe. Yeah, it's a story.
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:18.440]  It's a visual storytelling
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:20.440]  medium, basically.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.440]  But I feel like on Apple TV,
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:24.440]  it really, it's
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:26.440]  sort of more like,
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.440]  okay, so you're not making a video.
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:30.440]  It's not like you're just making one video that plays.
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:32.440]  But it is sort of a way to turn
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:34.440]  your TV into, like,
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:36.440]  it's like a presentation.
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:38.440]  And, you know,
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.440]  if the pictures are good and the video is high quality,
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:42.440]  it's really, really gorgeous.
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:44.440]  Yeah, and Storehouse is popular
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:46.440]  with a lot of professional photographers, too. Yeah.
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:48.440]  Yeah, so that's another one. If you're out there,
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:50.440]  if you're just jotting down a list of
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:52.440]  apps to try on your new Apple TV
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.440]  as you listen to it, definitely try out Storehouse.
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.440]  Don't miss it. And it's
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:58.440]  a really great example
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:00.440]  to me. I'm so glad you mentioned it.
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:02.440]  It's somewhere written here in my notes for the show.
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.440]  But I'm glad you mentioned it.
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:06.440]  Because to me, it just sort of exemplifies
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:08.440]  the way that Apple TV is more than just a video
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:10.440]  box. It is
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:12.440]  something different and new
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.440]  and more interactive.
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:16.440]  It isn't just about
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:18.440]  video that you hit play
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:20.440]  and pause. It can be something else.
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:22.440]  Yeah, and I'm really
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.440]  excited to see what that something else
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:26.440]  is.
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:30.440]  Man, you could put these in stores.
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.440]  I guess,
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:34.440]  you know, like when you've got a little sign
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:36.440]  and you're saying
[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:38.440]  what the
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:40.440]  like a kiosk kind of
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:42.440]  situation? This is awesome
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.440]  for that.
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:46.440]  There's so many different ways to use
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.440]  this little computer that it's
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:50.440]  pretty crazy.
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:52.440]  It's cheap too. It's like the cheapest
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:54.440]  iOS device. Yeah, it totally
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.440]  is. I don't know.
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:58.440]  I'm looking at my notes. Here's the other thing.
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:00.440]  I asked Jonas what he thought of the graphics.
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.440]  And we didn't look at all the games.
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:04.440]  But we looked at enough. Jonas's estimation
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:06.440]  was that to him it looked
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:08.440]  it's clearly not as good as PS4.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:10.440]  But he thought it was better than
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:12.440]  PS3. So he pegged it.
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:14.440]  He pegged the graphic fidelity of the
[02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:16.440]  games as in between PS4 and
[02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:18.440]  PS3.
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:20.440]  That's why I wanted to ask you
[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:22.440]  because that's just Jonas
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.440]  eyeballing it and looking at frame
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:26.440]  rates and
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:28.440]  how much texture and how rich it is.
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.440]  What do you think about that as being
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.440]  someone who's sort of actually
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.440]  I think that that's probably a
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:36.440]  fair estimation. I'd say that they're about equal
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:38.440]  with the previous generation of
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:40.440]  consoles. Now,
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:44.440]  I can't remember all of the exact specs.
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.440]  I don't know. Maybe they get
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:48.440]  performed in some way. But I mean,
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.440]  what you see on the screen is what counts, right?
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:52.440]  He feels good about it.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.440]  More interesting, next year
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:56.440]  this is going to get faster.
[02:20:56.440 --> 02:20:58.440]  There's going to be a better one.
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:00.440]  And the year after that there's going to be an even better one.
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:02.440]  And the year after that
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:04.440]  things are going to start looking bad for
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.440]  consoles. Because they have like
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:08.440]  a five to seven year life cycle.
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:10.440]  Do you think that they will
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.440]  at this point Apple TV gets on
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.440]  the annual upgrade
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:16.440]  cycle? I'd probably guess
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:18.440]  every two years if I had to guess.
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:20.440]  I do wonder.
[02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:22.440]  It's almost because it's like
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.440]  right now it's on
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:26.440]  the A8 or A8X
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:28.440]  but it's definitely the A8.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:30.440]  So it's last year's top
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:32.440]  of the line Apple system on a chip.
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.440]  It seems as though
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:36.440]  one year later
[02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:38.440]  they can make those chips
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:40.440]  they're just like cooking popcorn.
[02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:42.440]  I wouldn't
[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:44.440]  be surprised that they just pop in
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:46.440]  a year old
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:48.440]  A series system on a chip
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:50.440]  every year.
[02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:52.440]  It's so
[02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:54.440]  little work for Apple that
[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:56.440]  it would be foolish
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:58.440]  not to.
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:00.440]  Maybe.
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:02.440]  To me it would only just come down to
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.440]  what's the disposition of the team and
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:06.440]  what are they spending their time on.
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.440]  I might be
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:10.440]  overlooking the
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:12.440]  financial gains to be had by selling
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.440]  it for two years.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:16.440]  However profitable this thing is
[02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:18.440]  at $149 right now
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:20.440]  a year from now the exact same device with a
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.440]  two year old A8 is even more.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:24.440]  But I don't know.
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:26.440]  I just feel like the nerd
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:28.440]  in me just screams
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:30.440]  I want the A9 that's in my iPhone
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:32.440]  6s. I want it on my Apple TV next year.
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.440]  Yeah I think it's a gimme.
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:36.440]  Not necessarily next year but
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:38.440]  obviously
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:40.440]  once you've got this baseline architecture
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:42.440]  now they can start
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:44.440]  iterating it pretty quickly.
[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:46.440]  How quickly they iterate I think is going to depend on
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:48.440]  business stuff. Because they may also
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:50.440]  not want to
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:54.440]  have a new TV every year.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:56.440]  It starts to become negative implications
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:58.440]  of every year I've got to go out and buy
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.440]  all my new Apple kit again.
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.440]  The
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:06.440]  iPad I think they kind of got
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:08.440]  trapped into doing it yearly
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:10.440]  when I think that they could have maybe stretched
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:12.440]  that out a little bit.
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:14.440]  Well they haven't really
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:16.440]  but they've done it
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:18.440]  sometimes. Like for example they didn't come out with a new
[02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:20.440]  iPad Air 2 this year.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:22.440]  Whether that's just
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.440]  because they're going to wait until early next year
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.440]  or whether we have to wait a full year
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:28.440]  remains to be seen.
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:30.440]  I've heard both ways.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:32.440]  Maybe there will be an
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:34.440]  iPad Air 3 early
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.440]  next year.
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:38.440]  Like on the old iPad schedule with a keyboard case
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:40.440]  sort of like the iPad Pro.
[02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.440]  I don't know, maybe not.
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:44.440]  But anyway it's clearly a little
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:46.440]  different there.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:48.440]  But I mean, yeah.
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:50.440]  But on the other hand it would
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:52.440]  emphasize the differences that Apple
[02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:54.440]  has versus the traditional consoles.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:56.440]  And I know they're not going head to head against
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.440]  PS4 and Xbox and people who are really
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.440]  serious about games. Like as intrigued
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:02.440]  as Jonas is by the new
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:04.440]  Apple TV and I think he's downstairs playing
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:06.440]  games on it right now. If I told him we're
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:08.440]  getting rid of our PS4 he'd
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:10.440]  call a lawyer.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:12.440]  Call a lawyer.
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:14.440]  I need to get a divorce from
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:16.440]  my dad. Ouch.
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:18.440]  Like that would not fly.
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:20.440]  Yeah.
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.440]  But you know I have
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.440]  a lot of
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:26.440]  excitement for the platform and where
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:28.440]  it's going to end up going.
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.440]  This is a super capable
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.440]  little computer.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:34.440]  Well and the other thing too, you alluded
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.440]  to this a couple minutes ago, where if you project
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:38.440]  forward three or four years
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:40.440]  they are going to surpass. They're going to make
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:42.440]  a little Apple TV puck that is more
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.440]  powerful than a Sony Playstation.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:46.440]  You know, whether it's still the PS4.
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:48.440]  They're going to catch the consoles.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:50.440]  They're going to catch it up. Have you seen the graph?
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:52.440]  I mean, I know you have, but
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:54.440]  the performance graph is bananas.
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:56.440]  They're going to catch them pretty soon.
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:58.440]  So it's bad news for the console
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.440]  guys. Right. And there's only one
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:02.440]  step forward on pixels.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:04.440]  And that's going to 4K.
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:06.440]  And after that, the
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:08.440]  pixels don't change. And so the graphics
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.440]  capabilities that they can do every year
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:12.440]  after year, they don't have to worry about driving
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:14.440]  bigger displays. It's, you know,
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:16.440]  it's all just raw speed.
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:18.440]  It's just raw speed.
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.440]  I guess that's the last thing. If there's anything else
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:22.440]  do you think it's a mistake that this
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:24.440]  Apple TV doesn't support 4K?
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:26.440]  No.
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.440]  I don't think 4K is a gimmick. I think
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.440]  at this point it is.
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:32.440]  Yeah. Unpack that. I mean, no, it's not a
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:34.440]  gimmick, obviously. But right now, I think it's
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:36.440]  I think it's one of those high-end features that
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:38.440]  like some people
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:40.440]  want and clamor for and say that they demand.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:42.440]  But the actual market doesn't
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.440]  doesn't require it yet.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:46.440]  Yeah. Too few
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.440]  actual 4K TVs in use.
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:50.440]  Way too little video
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:52.440]  that's encoded in 4K
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:54.440]  out there.
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.440]  Obviously, it's going to happen eventually.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.440]  At some point between now and ten years
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:00.440]  from now, we're all going to have 4K TVs
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:02.440]  and everything we stream will be 4K.
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:04.440]  But I don't think there's any reason for it now. My only
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:06.440]  thought, though, is that it kind of
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:08.440]  makes me think that they might be on an annual schedule
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.440]  than a
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.440]  biannual schedule, just because at some point
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:14.440]  there's going to be one of these that does 4K.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  But then again, that could just be two years
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:18.440]  from now.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:20.440]  Right? I don't know.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:22.440]  Because then it would be a big leap.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.440]  Two years worth of
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:26.440]  development on the chips
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:28.440]  plus 4K.
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.440]  That's worth another
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:32.440]  150, 200 bucks, right?
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:34.440]  Right.
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.440]  And maybe a
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:38.440]  Taptic Engine remote.
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.440]  That's our
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:42.440]  Apple TV from 2017.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.440]  Now I'm already
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:46.440]  I'm already bored with this Apple TV.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:48.440]  Terrible. Well, we should say
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:50.440]  I think it's because we're excited about it.
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:52.440]  We're already looking forward to what the future
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:54.440]  holds. Usually I just let these
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:56.440]  we'd go on for another hour.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.440]  But I'm so excited by it.
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.440]  I know that there's people
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:02.440]  out there laughing at me and you
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:04.440]  with our personalities
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.440]  and our voices talking about how
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:08.440]  excited we are.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:10.440]  Because one thing that you and I
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:12.440]  are very similar with is that when we
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:14.440]  get excited about something, we don't really
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.440]  we don't really show
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:18.440]  excitement in the way that
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:20.440]  normal human beings show excitement.
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:22.440]  Unless I'm on
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:24.440]  a heater at a blackjack table or something.
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.440]  I really don't get too
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:28.440]  exuberant.
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:30.440]  But I really am
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:32.440]  I'm actually sitting here
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:34.440]  thinking I really want to wrap this up and
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:36.440]  go downstairs and go back to playing with my Apple TV.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:38.440]  Which is actually pretty
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:40.440]  it's a really cool feeling.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:42.440]  Anything else going on, Guy?
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.440]  Anything you want to promote before we wrap it up?
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:46.440]  Well,
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:48.440]  there's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.440]  But they talk to other people about that.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:52.440]  The Apple earnings came in.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:54.440]  There's bananas.
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.440]  Chrome and Android are getting merged together.
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:58.440]  It's kind of interesting.
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  Is that new? I didn't see that.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.440]  Yeah, as of yesterday.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.440]  You're too busy playing your Apple TV to figure that out.
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:06.440]  Yeah, they're getting smacked into one thing.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.440]  But it's whatever. Deal with that some other time.
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  Other than that, no.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:12.440]  Go buy my
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:14.440]  napkin in the Mac app store.
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:16.440]  Napkin.
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.440]  And what's the domain for that?
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:20.440]  nap.kn
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:22.440]  Oh man, that's smart.
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:24.440]  nap.kn
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:26.440]  Great app, napkin.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:28.440]  And your Twitter is
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.440]  at GTE, right?
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:32.440]  Do you get a lot of spam in your ads
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:34.440]  just because you have a three-letter code?
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.440]  A fair amount, but not that
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.440]  much.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:40.440]  It seems like the one people have trouble with
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.440]  is people who have a name.
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:44.440]  I don't know. I don't know who it is,
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:46.440]  but if you had, like, Sam,
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.440]  like you end up with a lot of junk in there.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:50.440]  But GTE is sort of random
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:52.440]  that it wouldn't happen by accident.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.440]  Not that, not as
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:56.440]  often here. Alright, well, thank you, guy.
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:58.440]  I appreciate the time.
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:12.440]  Alright, I'm going to go play with my Apple TV.
