[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  Yeah, we can get right into it. So how long when did you have that you had the dev kit for Apple TV?
[00:05.680 --> 00:07.680]  Yes, and
[00:08.080 --> 00:13.440]  What's the story? I mean, I guess it doesn't matter. I'm curious. I did not get the dev kit
[00:13.440 --> 00:14.880]  I guess I should have signed up for it
[00:14.880 --> 00:18.000]  I just assumed that I would get a review unit
[00:19.040 --> 00:24.800]  But they didn't I didn't get one till yesterday. So we were recording here on Friday, October 30
[00:24.880 --> 00:27.280]  I got mine from Apple yesterday on the 29th
[00:27.280 --> 00:32.000]  And I I don't think I've touched one. Yeah, no, I haven't since the event last month
[00:32.880 --> 00:35.440]  Yeah, you go coming host bit on that because
[00:37.360 --> 00:40.960]  A lot of press outlets just signed up and got one. Yeah. Well, I
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.440]  Is that what happened? But I think a lot of them did get review units, too, and I just you know
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.880]  It seems haphazard doesn't seem like there was any rhyme or reason to it like who got one and who didn't
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.000]  Like tech crunched didn't get it until yesterday either. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.640]  Oh, I don't think I don't know if we're going to go on. No, he didn't
[01:02.480 --> 01:05.600]  Really? Well, she had access to one. I know that. Ah
[01:06.720 --> 01:12.480]  Yeah, it's such a weird thing like it's meta. It's so inside baseball, but I guess that's what the point of podcast is
[01:13.040 --> 01:13.760]  Yeah
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.240]  Is that it was the least secretive device
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.320]  Give once it was unveiled, you know, so there's it was unveiled on stage in September
[01:24.320 --> 01:30.560]  I think they did a pretty good job keeping it under wraps everybody knew that a new Apple TV was coming with nobody had screen shots or anything
[01:31.760 --> 01:33.760]  Nobody knew what the remote was exactly like
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.960]  No, I'd heard stuff, but nothing
[01:38.400 --> 01:45.440]  I mean, I know people who'd seen them, but nobody told me what they look like right, but then they started taking the the developer
[01:46.560 --> 01:51.520]  Requests like the next day and some people started getting them like a week later
[01:51.520 --> 01:57.760]  And I guess you were under an NDA, you know, based on your ADC account and that you weren't supposed to write about it
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.760]  But it certainly wasn't a well-kept secret
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.400]  There's an additional NDA that came with the dev kit like a new NDA
[02:05.120 --> 02:08.640]  Yeah, they told you not to you not allowed to do anything with his dev kit. Right
[02:10.320 --> 02:18.480]  My favorite is never works. Well, the best the best example of that would be the iFixit guys who signed up for the dev kit
[02:18.480 --> 02:24.400]  I agreed to an NDA and then as soon as it came they took it apart and published there
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.960]  They're taking part
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.080]  I was pretty frustrated
[02:30.080 --> 02:32.080]  actually because
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.960]  A def kit's a very very thing for Apple TV. Right, and it's like we don't want to
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.960]  We don't want to piss them off and make them not do it like I think it's great that they did this. Yeah, I think it's great
[02:42.960 --> 02:50.480]  I think it was a mistake to sell them for a buck. It should have been like double triple the price of what the actual
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.840]  Shipping unit was going to be. Yeah, why do you think they did it that way? Well, I think they wanted everybody to get it
[02:56.640 --> 02:58.640]  You know the frictionless is possible
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.760]  And encourage people to work on their awesome platform. They'd probably have to charge a dollar for some reason, you know
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.120]  Yeah, like like maybe in the way that like Steve Jobs had to take a one-dollar salary
[03:11.120 --> 03:13.120]  and there was some kind of
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.560]  Legal requirement. Yeah counting or like you have to pay your CEO or something like that
[03:18.560 --> 03:20.560]  I swear that it was something like that
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.240]  And maybe it was something like that too where they have to sell it for some amount of money
[03:24.800 --> 03:26.800]  Just to account for it in some way other than
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.240]  Yeah
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.040]  Anyway, so welcome to the talk show America's favorite accounting
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.760]  Talk show
[03:39.760 --> 03:46.080]  Response with this week by Salesforce. No, so anyway though, they had these out there lots of journalists and writers
[03:46.480 --> 03:48.880]  Bought them even though they weren't going to develop apps on them
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.640]  And I guess they mostly stuck to the NDA, but it wasn't like it was tough to get but then
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.520]  The reviews all there was clearly like some some number of people just like without every other Apple device
[03:59.520 --> 04:07.200]  iPhones and iPads, you know that that they were they got pre-release access to them probably about a week before and then the
[04:07.200 --> 04:10.080]  The embargo was was clearly
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.040]  I think it was six six o'clock Eastern on Wednesday because all of a sudden
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.280]  How did you do it right and I was actually out at having dinner with our friend Whiskus and
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.120]  Brady Harren, you know the guy from
[04:27.840 --> 04:30.640]  Okay, hello internet. He was he's over here in the States
[04:30.640 --> 04:36.760]  And we were out and it was like all of a sudden we were talking about the fact that there were no reviews of the Apple TV and then
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.200]  We were at dinner and then all of a sudden it was like all of a sudden there were like 15 reviews of Apple TV
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.600]  But it was weird like like, you know, I'm more wasn't on that list tech crunch wasn't on the list. It's very strange
[04:51.280 --> 04:57.760]  Every actual was which makes sense. I think yeah, there's like a lot of media stuff that they cover on Christina's pretty
[04:57.760 --> 05:03.120]  She said I've been kicking ass. Yeah, I just actually just before we started recording
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.400]  I actually just linked to her review. It's the only one I've I've read completely and and just linked to it
[05:08.400 --> 05:12.360]  Because I thought she nailed it. I was like boy. That's every single thing there is about it
[05:12.560 --> 05:16.800]  Yeah, yeah, and she's been getting good interviews and so for some things. Yeah
[05:17.760 --> 05:20.160]  For her. Yeah, cuz well, who she does interview Johnny. I've
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.440]  Johnny I've and I'm gonna blank on it now
[05:23.440 --> 05:30.000]  Yeah, I don't know should have been in note right well, and she did and she got to she she's the one who got access to
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.560]  When Tim Cook did the meet and greet with the the teenagers at WWDC
[05:37.120 --> 05:41.440]  Yeah, she went in covered that and I think that was like an impromptu
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.160]  Conversation really yeah, I think it might have been but I think it was you know, it was clear
[05:48.160 --> 05:51.440]  You know right place right time, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly
[05:51.440 --> 05:53.600]  That's good reporting. Yeah
[05:56.320 --> 05:59.280]  So I know you've only had it a day I've had mine
[06:01.200 --> 06:02.560]  longer
[06:02.560 --> 06:04.560]  I guess I can talk about that
[06:04.560 --> 06:06.560]  whatever have
[06:08.480 --> 06:13.840]  Well, I am actually mad because if they don't do another deaf kid, I'm gonna be sad. Oh, here's my question for you
[06:13.840 --> 06:15.280]  This is my question for you my question
[06:15.280 --> 06:23.200]  I want before we go on to it is what was your experience like have you been able to upgrade from the the betas of the OS to the GM
[06:25.600 --> 06:28.640]  Did you but it didn't require using the diagnostic port or it did
[06:31.680 --> 06:36.400]  We're by diagnostic port. I mean USB port, but they even tell you in the instructions. They're like
[06:37.040 --> 06:40.480]  USB C port, and then they're like this is only who's for diagnostics
[06:40.480 --> 06:45.840]  Yeah, well, you know flashing in no way. It's not your thing is counts. I guess
[06:46.640 --> 06:51.120]  You just go to the website you download the package like the OS package and then you
[06:53.280 --> 06:56.080]  Connect iTunes to it and it shows up in iTunes
[06:57.440 --> 06:59.440]  And then you just
[06:59.440 --> 07:05.200]  It's like option click restore and use the package you've got right so it's exactly like doing it with the phone
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.080]  It's yeah, it's identical. So you connect it to your Mac with
[07:11.040 --> 07:17.120]  USB like you connect the phone and then you can just do it from the iTunes. Yeah, and it's USB C which is like
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.360]  One of the first times that being super thankful that if I want to MacBook
[07:22.400 --> 07:24.960]  It just works. I don't have to worry about anything
[07:26.480 --> 07:32.640]  Yeah, so I guess if your computer was a MacBook the new the new MacBook one port thing
[07:32.640 --> 07:39.440]  You would have to have a USB C the USB C cable. Yeah, that's what I did. All right. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah
[07:40.960 --> 07:42.960]  Yeah, so I've got a
[07:42.960 --> 07:49.280]  I mean when I bought the MacBook and bought like two little adapter things like one for USB C and one that does a terms USB C into
[07:50.240 --> 07:51.840]  HDMI out
[07:51.840 --> 07:53.280]  as a USB port
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.720]  So when did the app store go live like tele-appster yesterday? Okay
[07:58.720 --> 08:05.040]  I couldn't tell you what time but I think around noon because what we had to do was so we had a GM
[08:05.360 --> 08:07.360]  Handed it for the past few days
[08:09.040 --> 08:11.360]  Then to get the app store, and this was kind of confusing
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.600]  We needed to read download
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.840]  EOS and flash that back on to the
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.960]  Antipede device for the app sort of show up
[08:20.320 --> 08:23.760]  But if I'm not mistaken, I think the version numbers are identical
[08:23.760 --> 08:29.440]  Huh, I wonder whether they flipped one switch or I don't know exactly what they did but whatever
[08:30.560 --> 08:33.760]  Right now minus is it if I just got out of a box for my store
[08:35.920 --> 08:37.920]  Huh
[08:37.920 --> 08:39.920]  So it's exactly the same
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.920]  as mind-standing as yeah
[08:45.760 --> 08:50.320]  All right, so first run experience pretty cool the way that they do the
[08:50.320 --> 08:56.960]  If you want to just unlock your iPhone and get it near the Apple TV
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.040]  That is the way computers should work like all of them
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.320]  It's if you can do with max do it with max just do it and it doesn't transfer
[09:09.520 --> 09:11.520]  Everything but it certainly gets you
[09:11.520 --> 09:19.680]  Most of the way there and just getting it so that it's on your Wi-Fi is huge. It's a godsend. Yeah, like you just wave your
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.080]  It's basically magic and I know that's way overused when you talk about Apple stuff
[09:24.080 --> 09:25.920]  But you take your phone you put it close to your box
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.400]  And they will do once did this too, but it is just cool and have a new thing
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.760]  And it would just say yeah
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.360]  Connecting to the network and it logs you in. It's quite all the passwords. It's got your iCloud information
[09:39.360 --> 09:41.360]  So you're
[09:42.720 --> 09:44.720]  What are you calling it now?
[09:44.720 --> 09:48.880]  Apple ID yeah, yeah, yeah Apple ID stuff is over
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.360]  So you've got all the game center stuff set up. You've got your the photos
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.560]  All of that is just done. Yeah, and it's amazing because passwords are
[09:59.200 --> 10:01.200]  Pinned the astatype
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.560]  Anyway, but let alone on like a crazy keyboard thing. Yeah
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.720]  I did have to enter my
[10:09.600 --> 10:13.280]  Apple ID password though one time to enable purchases
[10:15.040 --> 10:17.040]  Oh, yeah
[10:17.040 --> 10:21.760]  And I can see why it's sort of like I think the same logic
[10:22.640 --> 10:28.960]  The way that like when you restart your iPhone you have to enter the password once before you can go back to just using touch ID
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.280]  Yeah, I think the notion is that you can unlock the device
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.320]  But if you're gonna do any bill like monetary damage
[10:36.880 --> 10:44.000]  We've wants to make sure that you are you say you're yeah, I kind of wish that and I wonder it, you know, and I yeah, it's like they
[10:44.560 --> 10:46.560]  Before you can do
[10:46.640 --> 10:48.640]  Yeah, exactly what you said monetary damage
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.960]  You've really got to enter your password. I guess I can see the logic beyond that
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.040]  But entering a password on the goddamn TV is so it's still such a pain in the ass
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.240]  I still am tempted to suggest that maybe you should be able to use touch ID on your phone
[11:02.240 --> 11:05.200]  But there's you know, I guess
[11:06.880 --> 11:12.720]  Yeah, you know what I mean like if it's somehow if somehow it would it would send you an alert
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.440]  Like the way that like with our family sharing if Jonas wants to get an app
[11:17.760 --> 11:19.760]  I mean Amy get
[11:19.760 --> 11:26.400]  These alerts that say hey Jonas who's a member of you know the kid in your family sharing plan wants to get this app
[11:26.640 --> 11:28.960]  whatever the name of the app is is this okay and
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.960]  um
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.680]  Actually, I guess I think they actually stopped letting you use touch ID for that though now that I think about it
[11:35.680 --> 11:37.680]  I think now you have to enter your password on the phone
[11:38.800 --> 11:40.160]  Hmm, hmm
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.520]  I guess maybe what I wish you could do with the Apple TV and maybe you can is maybe somehow use the maybe you can
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.840]  Can you still use the old remote app to enter passwords?
[11:48.560 --> 11:50.560]  I think the old remote app is
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.080]  Yeah
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.400]  The old remote physically mode works, which is interesting. Oh does it the IR one? Yeah. No, I didn't know that
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.400]  Yeah, I did a accident and it's all the work
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.480]  To start tapping and clicking and dragging or finger up. Yeah, that's actually funny
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.960]  Um, yeah, it's I don't know about that so this after you enter that password then they ask you
[12:13.520 --> 12:15.520]  You want to use his password
[12:16.240 --> 12:18.240]  Do you want me to prompt you for the password never?
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.520]  I don't know what it is. I think it's no yeah, it's like it's like you you know three options are
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.120]  Don't ever ask me for my password again. Just let me buy stuff
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.240]  Which I don't know about you, but
[12:32.480 --> 12:35.600]  That's what I did. Yeah, well, that's what I do too, and I'm lucky
[12:35.600 --> 12:40.720]  I can I definitely understand why some parents wouldn't be able to do that, but Jonas is super trustworthy with stuff like that
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.520]  And even if he decided to risk it easily, I think it was at once
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.520]  But it's so much more convenient and I'm not worried
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.240]  You know, I mean like unlike a device that's in your pocket that you might leave in a cab or something like that
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.200]  Your Apple TV is not leaving your home. It's a safe place. All right
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.360]  If somebody who I don't trust is operating my Apple TV, I've got bigger problems
[13:06.240 --> 13:08.800]  Then if they're gonna like buy movies that I don't want
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.280]  Wouldn't that be like the ultimate dick move for like a burglar like before he came
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.560]  Before he disconnects your Apple TV to rip it off and steal your TV set before he takes it
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.800]  He just quick logs in and buys some shitty movies like subscribe to like all the Adam Sandler movies or something like that
[13:27.520 --> 13:33.520]  And then leaves the house. So not only did you get burgled you you got stuck foot in the bill for a bunch of movies
[13:33.520 --> 13:36.480]  You didn't that actually sounds like a scene out of an Adam Sandler movie
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.080]  I think we're not something here
[13:42.080 --> 13:49.920]  You can buy you a bunch of albums on Apple or Apple music that you don't want to
[13:51.520 --> 13:53.520]  Sounds you have to Apple music. Yeah
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.640]  So anyway first run experience. I don't want it. I feel like I've already I've already
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.400]  Complained too much like I still want it to be better, but it's so good
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.040]  It is such a better experience than any other first run experience. I've ever seen
[14:11.040 --> 14:13.040]  So I I've done it
[14:14.240 --> 14:17.120]  manually quite a bit because it really it does didn't have
[14:18.640 --> 14:24.160]  Well, I think they had it, but they told you it was pretty flaky so I didn't use it and man it's a pity asked when you
[14:25.760 --> 14:28.640]  So I shouldn't say it's a pity asked comparatively. It's night and day
[14:29.360 --> 14:36.640]  Between like labor laborishly like entering in all your email addresses and like yeah, and you got to do it for a few different things
[14:36.640 --> 14:44.160]  It is a huge being asked your Wi-Fi network. That sucks. This was amazing. It was the first time I tried it yesterday
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.000]  It was the first time I tried the Bluetooth magic and it was great and I know you know
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.960]  We know some of the people who work on Apple TV don't have for a while
[14:54.960 --> 14:57.200]  And I know that a couple of them have been you know
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.880]  Personally take it personally that they want this experience to be better from for years because I know one of the features
[15:02.880 --> 15:09.680]  The old Apple TV had I actually don't know if the new one still supports it, but remember how the old Apple TV would let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.560]  Yeah, and then you could use that to enter passwords and stuff like that the first time just to if you want to do
[15:16.560 --> 15:18.560]  And I I thought that's a great idea
[15:19.280 --> 15:26.240]  And I'm so glad that they did it, but I never I've never once actually done it because it always seems to me like if I'm already at the
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.960]  Couch and I've got the stupid remote in my hand
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.720]  where by stupid remote, I mean the old remote and
[15:34.560 --> 15:42.000]  In my mind the pain of just sitting there and pecking away at the on-screen keyboard to enter my password as much as it annoys me
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.960]  It doesn't annoy me enough to go up to my office get a Bluetooth keyboard come downstairs pair it and
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.760]  Yeah, even if you had one lying around, you're living there. I had fun. Didn't I?
[15:52.320 --> 15:55.360]  Half the time, but I watch TV. It's because I want to stop doing
[15:56.320 --> 15:57.680]  my work
[15:57.680 --> 15:59.680]  Which involves typing on a keyboard
[15:59.680 --> 16:02.160]  You know what I mean, like I just don't want to keyboard anywhere near me
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.760]  I will hunt and pack with that stupid control if I have to get that
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.480]  Just yeah, I never really wanted to pair any Bluetooth stuff up to it. It's cool. You could do it though. Yeah
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.320]  Some of the stuff that works automatically really impressed me
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.520]  Like without me having to configure it at all the volume up volume down buttons
[16:22.080 --> 16:25.280]  Automatically controlled the volume on my TV. Yeah
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.480]  Interestingly, it does it on your TV, too. Not
[16:29.440 --> 16:31.440]  You know, it means rather than
[16:31.440 --> 16:35.200]  Increasing and decrease in the volume coming out of the back of your set top box out of the
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.040]  Apple TV, it's doing it like you see your TV UI column when it does it exactly right
[16:41.680 --> 16:47.120]  And I think that that was IR things have like a standard set of actions that
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.240]  Most equipment takes. Yeah, so I think that that's how it figured it out
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.280]  But it was a pleasant surprise man. I used to hate I
[16:58.080 --> 17:00.320]  Mean we're complaining but very first-world problems here
[17:00.320 --> 17:03.760]  But I used to hate having to find the other more control just to lower the volume. Yeah
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.360]  So for me it actually yeah, I was very impressed that it worked and it does exactly what you said it shows my
[17:11.360 --> 17:13.120]  Pioneer
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.440]  The UI, you know, and so you get this all of a sudden you have this it is ugly and at the
[17:17.440 --> 17:23.440]  At the event it was so funny at the Apple event in September when they were showing this whenever anybody would
[17:23.440 --> 17:25.440]  I forget what brand of TVs they were using
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.160]  They were of course all identical, but whatever brand it was that maybe it was Panasonic
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.160]  But it doesn't matter there's somebody like Panasonic
[17:32.400 --> 17:36.240]  When you'd hit volume up and volume down and you'd see the on-screen interface for the volume
[17:36.560 --> 17:42.880]  The Apple the product marketing people who is whoever they're supervising the demo would always in every time say
[17:42.880 --> 17:44.880]  That's not our UI
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.800]  That's the TV set so they'd try to spin it it was like this they and of course
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.400]  It's just like always with the Apple product marketing marketing people
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.360]  It was a rehearsal line
[17:53.360 --> 18:00.080]  So I'm not quoting it exactly right, but it it amused me because it was perfectly calibrated to do two things
[18:00.960 --> 18:07.280]  One it was setting it up as hey, this is a cool feature. It it talks the our remote will talk to your TV
[18:07.760 --> 18:09.760]  And then two it was
[18:09.760 --> 18:16.800]  Using the jankiness of the on-screen graphics like this is not don't do not do not think that we designed this little
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.400]  Crazy blue bar that shows you what the volume is that right now. Yeah, that's cool. It's a good feature
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.880]  Also, it makes a lot of sense to do it that way because
[18:27.440 --> 18:32.880]  There's no synchronization problem in between what people are expecting from their television remote control and what the volume of the
[18:33.520 --> 18:35.520]  Apple TV devices
[18:35.520 --> 18:40.160]  Um, like if you hit mute on your old TV remote. It's gonna mute
[18:41.840 --> 18:47.760]  Like it's it's I think it's just good to have one less level of confusion about what the output it actually
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.160]  Yeah, so so for me
[18:50.880 --> 18:52.560]  It actually I was impressed that that work
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.760]  But it actually is useless because I don't use the volume from my TV
[18:56.320 --> 18:58.320]  I have the this little
[18:59.040 --> 19:01.680]  Box from bows that powers the speakers on our TV
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.440]  And so we have to use this bows remote control and if the bows thing is a little
[19:06.080 --> 19:08.000]  It's like a receipt. I guess you call it a receiver
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.840]  But it's it's even smaller than the Apple TV. It's just this tiny little black box. That's like a little puck
[19:14.480 --> 19:17.120]  Um, that the speakers are plugged into
[19:18.080 --> 19:19.280]  Uh
[19:19.440 --> 19:22.720]  And so you can you make the TV learn the remote. Yeah
[19:23.520 --> 19:25.840]  Okay, no, I yeah, so you go to Apple
[19:26.320 --> 19:30.800]  Any Apple TV you say it's you go to remote and it's like you want to control a different device
[19:30.800 --> 19:32.320]  and
[19:32.320 --> 19:37.520]  The setup for this was I was like oh what I I figured that they wouldn't do remember the old way
[19:37.520 --> 19:42.880]  It would be like what brand you have and if it's like bows they're like try these codes 857
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.640]  863 and 877 because those are the ones that bows typically uses and if those don't work
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.600]  Well, maybe try you know this one
[19:54.240 --> 19:58.000]  I knew it wouldn't be like that, but it was so easy. So that what they said is they say
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.160]  Um, if you want to control the volume on a different device using your Apple TV
[20:02.720 --> 20:09.120]  Okay, go get your it says like go get your other remote from the manufacturer of your other device and
[20:10.320 --> 20:17.840]  Press down and hold volume up until this line is filled and so you just press and hold volume up on our other remote and
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.480]  Takes about two or three seconds and they're like a progress car bar fills up. It's sort of like like the
[20:22.480 --> 20:26.640]  It's similar to the equivalent of when you're training touch ID
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.440]  with a new fingerprint and then they're like okay got it now do volume down and just keep holding volume down until
[20:33.440 --> 20:36.560]  We tell you to stop and you know takes about two or three seconds and
[20:37.680 --> 20:42.960]  Then you're done. That's it and then all of a sudden your Apple TV my Apple TV remote instead of controlling my TV's remote
[20:43.440 --> 20:48.000]  Controls my receivers volume. It's great. Yeah, it's really is great
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.960]  What's a piece of cake? Because these things are such a hassle usually. Yeah, and that's one of those things that I really do
[20:55.440 --> 21:00.320]  I'd love to hear the war stories from the team that did it because you just know that getting that to work on
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.120]  You know 30 or 40 different brands of consumer electronic devices
[21:05.200 --> 21:07.200]  You just know that it's
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.200]  Screwy as like when you talk to people who work on email clients about you know
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.680]  The different IMAP servers out there and stuff like that. You just know it's probably even worse. Yeah
[21:15.680 --> 21:23.040]  It's a good way doing it. It's cool. Anyway, so that's awesome. So within minutes. You had your whole set of working
[21:23.200 --> 21:26.640]  Yeah, the other thing I had to do and it makes sense
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.000]  And I only noticed it when I first started playing a couple of games
[21:31.440 --> 21:33.440]  You remember the game cannibal
[21:33.440 --> 21:38.400]  Yeah, endless runner, so that's there and it it plays really good on TV
[21:38.400 --> 21:47.440]  But the one thing I noticed was it was the first game and I only won so far that I noticed that it it goes cornered a corner
[21:47.520 --> 21:49.920]  So like the score was cut off by overscan
[21:50.720 --> 21:53.360]  Hmm, and I
[21:53.360 --> 21:55.360]  Jonas was with me and it was so I
[21:55.920 --> 21:57.840]  It's like it and so I went into settings
[21:57.840 --> 22:01.200]  I thought maybe I could fix on Apple TV and then I realized like the settings
[22:01.440 --> 22:04.000]  There is a section where it talks about like something with overscan
[22:04.400 --> 22:07.040]  But then the settings explains you've got to change it on your TV
[22:07.040 --> 22:14.080]  Yeah, it's a TV setting that they crop around the edges, right and that made all the sense of well of course the Apple TV isn't sending
[22:15.280 --> 22:21.600]  Cropped image right a cropped image to the TV. It's the TV that's doing it and then it's like god now I'm stuck going into
[22:22.640 --> 22:24.640]  The goofy pioneer image
[22:25.760 --> 22:31.040]  Or you know the goofy little computer that's built into my TV set from pioneer and it's horrible
[22:31.040 --> 22:38.240]  It's so confusing it and and but then Jonas was with me and thankfully reminded me that we had solved the exact same problem with
[22:38.800 --> 22:40.400]  the ps4
[22:40.400 --> 22:45.280]  When we got it for Christmas last year. Oh cool. It isn't a PC mode or something exactly that's exactly it
[22:45.280 --> 22:51.200]  You put it in PC mode, which is sort of I understand it, but it's like it does no way a normal person would understand it
[22:51.200 --> 22:56.160]  I understand what they're saying. They're saying this is this is not an analog video device
[22:56.160 --> 23:01.840]  This is a computer that is sending a pixel per pixel per precise image to what it
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.080]  considers more like a PC monitor than the TV
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.360]  So once we did that then it was it was perfect
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.720]  That's cool. Did the colors change it all?
[23:13.120 --> 23:13.840]  Uh
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.840]  No, not by doing that
[23:16.320 --> 23:20.160]  No, it really just changed the TV's man. So crazy
[23:20.880 --> 23:24.560]  So much old stuff built in there. There's so much. What would you call it technical debt?
[23:24.560 --> 23:30.880]  Yeah, like because the whole reason for over over scanning it made all the sense in the world in the CRT era
[23:31.680 --> 23:39.200]  Yeah, but it makes no sense at all and when everything's digital and it's crazy that it everything always defaults to
[23:39.760 --> 23:41.760]  The underscan over scan. I guess
[23:44.400 --> 23:46.400]  Did that make sense
[23:47.120 --> 23:50.240]  Yeah, did you do the same thing? Did you have to change yours to PC mode?
[23:50.640 --> 23:54.160]  I didn't have to but maybe you just haven't noticed because I do notice
[23:54.160 --> 23:56.160]  But I did play Cannibal
[23:57.600 --> 24:01.840]  So but maybe I didn't look at the thing. I'll have to go look. Yeah, you could it's very obvious
[24:01.840 --> 24:02.560]  You could just I mean
[24:03.120 --> 24:09.360]  Cannibal really puts the score literally in the top right corner. I mean there's it's their way outside the safe zone
[24:10.480 --> 24:13.360]  Yeah, well, that's the other thing when designing for a TV to tell you to
[24:14.160 --> 24:18.240]  There's like a like the over scan border. They tell you where it is and you shouldn't go there
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.200]  And even when filming they
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.920]  Take it into account with a filming right which is kind of bananas in it
[24:26.320 --> 24:28.320]  Like that's how entrenched this thing is
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.400]  Right and like even the production side is basically just adapting doing its hands up and being like okay
[24:34.400 --> 24:36.400]  Well, it's just to void the edges
[24:36.560 --> 24:37.200]  All right
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.400]  Even though right it's like even though now there's no more technical reason for it that we're digital
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.400]  It's a digital image of shooting on video or and it's gonna be digital all the way through until it gets on the display
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.880]  But because everybody shoots within the safe zone
[24:53.040 --> 24:55.040]  You still have to shoot within the safe zone
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.800]  Yeah, and the device is still default sometimes to well, maybe they didn't shoot with the safe zone. So we're gonna over scan
[25:01.520 --> 25:03.520]  Yeah
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.640]  It isn't even a logical nightmare
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.480]  All right, let me take a break but take a first break here and thank our first sponsor
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.320]  And it is our friends at Hello H U
[25:20.960 --> 25:22.960]  L L O
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.920]  Here's what these guys tell you they sell you a buckwheat hole pillow
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.880]  What the hell is that here's the thing? It's it's been popular for centuries in Asia
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.160]  This is how they've made pillows for literally hundreds of years
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.280]  You take the these buckwheat holes. They feel I don't I haven't actually opened it up
[25:41.280 --> 25:48.560]  But it they feel like coffee beans and they fill a pillow with these holes feels like a almost like more like a bean bag
[25:48.720 --> 25:50.720]  Then like a feather pillow
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.160]  Air flows freely through these things
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.400]  So it's like it it keeps your head your head doesn't get sweaty when you're sleeping on this thing
[25:58.720 --> 26:01.280]  And then you can adjust the thickness to your personal preference
[26:01.280 --> 26:08.800]  You just open it up unzip it and you can just take some of the holes out anytime you want if if if the one you get out of the box feels like it's too full
[26:08.800 --> 26:11.600]  Made in the USA
[26:12.480 --> 26:20.960]  With quality construction really good materials. So it's pretty strong and durable twill cotton for the case
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.200]  It's even a good zipper and it's sort of hidden like it's it tucks away
[26:27.200 --> 26:30.240]  If you know sometimes with like a jacket or something like that you can have a
[26:31.040 --> 26:34.160]  A zipper that's easy to get to but then when it's all closed up. You don't see it
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.840]  And even the buckwheat even the actual
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.040]  The the holes that are stuffed in the pillow
[26:41.920 --> 26:45.520]  They're grown and milled in North Dakota right here in the US
[26:46.640 --> 26:48.640]  very environmentally friendly and
[26:49.600 --> 26:51.600]  organic product
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.160]  Everything's a hundred percent unbleached cotton
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.720]  No chemical foams inside just natural hole really really good sounds crazy
[27:00.720 --> 27:06.320]  Here's the thing. I know that this sounds crazy. It is nothing like any pillow. I've ever had before they sent us two of them
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.240]  A months ago maybe a year ago when they first started sponsoring a show
[27:10.880 --> 27:15.280]  An Amy and I still have them both on our bed. We both like it a lot. It's really really nice
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.680]  Definitely different. It's if it sounds different to you to idea of sleeping on more of like a bean bag than a feather pillow
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.320]  It definitely is but it's really really nice
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.120]  So here's the deal
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.800]  60 nights for free just go there by it and any point in the first 60 nights if it's not for you
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.360]  They give you a full refund. No questions asked no hassle that you don't have to like call them up
[27:37.360 --> 27:43.040]  And and somebody's going to try to argue with you that you want to keep this pillow or talking into it just send it back 60 nights
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.040]  For free. They have four sizes small standard king. I guess that's three sizes. I guess I can't count
[27:52.320 --> 27:54.960]  4979 129 bucks
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.000]  Here is where you go go to halo hu-l-l-o pillow
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.520]  dot com slash talk show no, the just slash talk show and
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.800]  They'll know you came from the show. They'll help help with that and last but not least one percent of all of their profits are
[28:15.040 --> 28:17.760]  contributed to the nature conservancy
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.320]  So you're doing good things
[28:20.800 --> 28:22.800]  So my thanks to them
[28:22.800 --> 28:30.160]  So what else I so I when I got it when I got my home yesterday the
[28:30.160 --> 28:37.000]  App store like you said it must have gone live during the day probably when they've started giving them out to people like you know monkeys like me and the media
[28:38.080 --> 28:43.520]  So you you had a briefing right yeah, can we say you had a briefing? Yeah, I guess yes, we just did yeah
[28:46.560 --> 28:49.360]  Like what they're talking points like what do they have on you through?
[28:49.360 --> 28:57.760]  Well officially the briefings are off the record so I won't quote okay, okay, okay, but I don't think it's a secret either
[28:57.760 --> 28:59.760]  It wasn't really it's you know it was
[29:02.160 --> 29:08.000]  In my personal experience. I've said this before. It's I'm not quite sure where to draw the line with what's NDA and what's not
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.640]  But the basic just I have never ever gotten a review unit of an Apple product that didn't include a briefing and
[29:14.640 --> 29:19.680]  And not like a group with a room full of people you get like one on one time with somebody from product marketing
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.680]  You know, and it's always it's some you know people who are you know
[29:23.920 --> 29:30.320]  People are like people you know the product marketing team for Apple TV is intimately familiar with the product. They really know it
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.600]  So the big parts that they emphasize you know the universal search and Siri absolutely, you know
[29:37.600 --> 29:39.600]  They went through a couple of demos let me play with it
[29:39.600 --> 29:48.360]  But it's clear that that is central to their vision for what what the why are they even in the business of making Apple TV
[29:48.360 --> 29:50.840]  It's this universal search is absolutely huge
[29:55.200 --> 29:59.880]  Yeah, sorry freeze that the wrong way because it's all trapped into saying it and just no
[29:59.880 --> 30:03.240]  And that's what they want to push like what yeah, I think that's a good question
[30:03.240 --> 30:08.960]  I think because usually what they want to push really is the most interesting things, right?
[30:08.960 --> 30:13.520]  It's not like like it's so easy to overthink it and if they're talking about a B and C
[30:13.520 --> 30:19.040]  Then you can overthink it and think well then D must be the part that's really interesting because they don't want to talk about it
[30:19.040 --> 30:22.160]  And maybe that's a problem or whatever now universal search
[30:23.520 --> 30:26.840]  Yeah, you know the basic gist of using the trackpad
[30:28.320 --> 30:31.120]  Which I you know we can talk about this more
[30:31.120 --> 30:33.720]  I think we should it's to me. It's interesting. They didn't now
[30:33.720 --> 30:40.880]  This is the sort of thing they don't talk about but I the feel of it the way that you can kind of feel the UI as you slide your thumb around is
[30:41.440 --> 30:49.280]  Really interesting because usually a touchpad is is always been a thing where you have a cursor on screen that you move around
[30:49.480 --> 30:54.480]  Right just think about like a MacBook like when you're or the new magic trackpad for you know desktops
[30:55.200 --> 30:58.760]  You slide your finger around and there's a thing on screen
[30:58.760 --> 31:05.040]  You know the arrow usually, but it you know turns into an I beam when you're editing text or whatever it moves around in response
[31:05.040 --> 31:07.440]  Well, there is nothing on screen on Apple TV
[31:07.920 --> 31:15.400]  It's you're just sort of implicitly moving a selection around and different things pop up and move
[31:15.400 --> 31:17.400]  I think they did a great job of that
[31:17.960 --> 31:24.120]  It did an amazing job of that that we could talk about that for ages. Yeah, we can hold it call it focus
[31:24.120 --> 31:25.080]  But yeah
[31:25.080 --> 31:36.080]  What else did they want us to show I did you know? Oh, they definitely wanted to show and I think rightly so and I if anything to me has been underplayed so far in the reviews of it that I've seen is
[31:36.480 --> 31:38.480]  the
[31:38.480 --> 31:40.480]  The video is scrubbing
[31:41.760 --> 31:47.840]  Meaning that when you fast forward video you you get a fantastic
[31:48.280 --> 31:52.960]  To me the best it's even better than Tivo and Tivo to me. You know
[31:52.960 --> 31:55.120]  I know John Syracuse is you know holds the same
[31:55.840 --> 32:01.480]  Opinion on it is really to until now the only fast-forwarding video for any thing
[32:01.480 --> 32:05.520]  I've ever connected to my my TV that actually is decent
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.760]  You know the old Apple TV was complete shit for fast-forward and rewind especially for streaming content
[32:13.320 --> 32:15.680]  Because you'd have no visual indication of it
[32:15.680 --> 32:18.720]  You just have this timeline thing that moves and every once in a while
[32:18.720 --> 32:23.920]  It just goes back to the beginning of the whole stream and yeah, the new one. It's so good
[32:23.920 --> 32:30.760]  It's so fast that the the little thumbnail that shows you what you will get if you stop, you know as you fast forward
[32:31.080 --> 32:32.760]  It updates
[32:32.760 --> 32:37.640]  Perfectly like it almost it's almost like I wonder if they had to dial it back and slow it down
[32:37.640 --> 32:44.600]  So it doesn't change too much right? It's like it updates exactly as frequently as you want it to and whatever it is that
[32:44.600 --> 32:48.600]  You're looking at on that thumbnail when you hit click it again to say all right start playing from here
[32:48.600 --> 32:55.520]  It just starts playing exactly what it showed in the thumbnail is exactly what you will see blown up to the full size of the screen and
[32:55.880 --> 32:57.880]  it's sound I think it's it's
[32:58.240 --> 33:04.080]  Obviously anything you fast forward should work the way I just said but nothing has worked that way until now and
[33:04.800 --> 33:10.360]  They definitely wanted to show that off and then mostly just games, I guess
[33:11.920 --> 33:13.920]  Oh interesting, okay
[33:14.600 --> 33:16.600]  Yeah, that fast forward thing is
[33:16.600 --> 33:23.560]  Amazing have you tried telling Siri to go back 30 seconds. Yeah. Yeah, it worked and it works great. We had it's awesome
[33:25.240 --> 33:27.240]  Um
[33:27.240 --> 33:32.600]  I find the only thing I find so far is I I've it's almost like I forget to use Siri
[33:32.600 --> 33:36.080]  I've only had it for literally what 20
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.400]  30 hours, you know, so exactly where it's gonna go right I
[33:40.400 --> 33:41.400]  I
[33:41.400 --> 33:47.800]  Find myself going to the store navigating around like I'll show is to find a show that I know what I'm looking for
[33:47.800 --> 33:49.800]  I could just say it I
[33:50.280 --> 33:52.280]  Forget when I want to make me all happy
[33:52.280 --> 33:56.520]  You know, right? I started doing the type ahead to type something and I was annoyed
[33:56.520 --> 33:58.280]  I know it's just like oh, wait
[33:58.840 --> 34:00.840]  I'm not supposed to type to find it
[34:02.480 --> 34:07.720]  They even I think they even offer you reminders. It's like they even show you they're like, you know, you could you you know
[34:07.720 --> 34:15.280]  Just hit the Siri button. It's cool. I know some people have been frustrated with it, but whatever. It's Siri
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.960]  I think you can have
[34:19.720 --> 34:22.320]  Good and bad experiences with it at times
[34:23.120 --> 34:28.920]  Yeah, it's always like that. It's definitely but it's getting better across all devices, you know the watch
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.360]  Oh, yeah, yeah, and the phone and with everything it is getting better at a very
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.400]  Does that one seem way faster to you? I think so and it
[34:38.760 --> 34:46.640]  Like the words used to appear as I say them. Yeah, I don't I almost don't even know how it could be faster like what why in
[34:47.200 --> 34:49.760]  Unless it's just that it's you know the the
[34:50.480 --> 34:56.320]  Team working on Apple TV is or such engineering badasses that they're actually better than the
[34:56.320 --> 35:04.120]  People on the watch and phone teams or something. I don't I really it almost seems inexplicable how much faster it is then then
[35:04.520 --> 35:09.200]  Siri on the phone. The only thing I could come up with was that it's a smaller problem set
[35:09.200 --> 35:11.600]  So they've got a lot more stuff. Hash locally for
[35:12.600 --> 35:18.720]  Like you often say show me. Yeah, and then you've the name of a TV show and I've already got like a list about the TV show so they
[35:19.360 --> 35:22.920]  They have a pretty confident guess before maybe yeah, I
[35:22.920 --> 35:24.720]  I
[35:24.720 --> 35:26.720]  Don't it was like
[35:28.800 --> 35:31.840]  I was interested so for example, we were watching a
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.640]  Movie as a family last night Jonas, you know, I had like an in-service day today
[35:37.640 --> 35:39.840]  You know where the teachers are I don't know
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.880]  Great and papers or something so he did you know yesterday was his the beginning of his weekend so he could stay up late and we watched a movie
[35:46.880 --> 35:53.720]  But I was interested and oddly enough Amy was too in the Thursday night football game
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.680]  Which was the Miami dolphins against the New England Patriots because
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.040]  Daniel Tosh you ever see that Tosh
[36:03.280 --> 36:05.280]  I'm about you hate him you hate
[36:08.160 --> 36:13.720]  He's not a good person, which which is he's a very he's a very funny guy
[36:13.720 --> 36:20.480]  I think he's hilarious, but Amy really likes the show. She likes them. So I watch with her and and I
[36:20.480 --> 36:23.880]  Get grossed out by some of this stuff. I really I'm a little squeamish
[36:23.880 --> 36:30.360]  And so if you don't know Daniel Tosh has a show on count a weekly show on Comedy Central where they show clips from YouTube
[36:30.360 --> 36:37.120]  And wherever else they can find them on the internet of people doing stupid things and often getting hurt and then he makes fun of them
[36:37.240 --> 36:39.240]  but anyway
[36:39.240 --> 36:40.400]  he raised
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.280]  $25,000 and he had a
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.320]  He did this before too. He raised like $25,000 for charity
[36:50.360 --> 36:53.760]  With the it's awesome with the idea yeah, but well just
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.240]  With the idea though that once he raised the 25 grand for charity
[36:58.240 --> 37:02.560]  He would go to Vegas and bet it all on one hand a blackjack and then if you won
[37:02.560 --> 37:05.920]  It would all go to the charity and if he lost they would get nothing and he
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.120]  He went and played one end of blackjack and lost and it was true
[37:11.120 --> 37:16.080]  I mean he was there at the mirage and he had a stack of $25,000 in front of him
[37:16.720 --> 37:18.560]  and
[37:18.560 --> 37:25.680]  So this year he raised $25,000 and it's like it's actually for a pal of his who some other comedian
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.680]  I hadn't heard of him, but he got poor guys got like a brain tumor or something
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.480]  And you know, it's typical us thing
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.560]  You know even with Obamacare. It's like his insurance is going to like bankrupt him or something
[37:37.560 --> 37:43.440]  So the money is going to go to help this this comedian friend of his you know pay off his medical bills from brain tumor
[37:43.880 --> 37:50.080]  So great cause, but what he did is he bet he bet the whole thing on the first half
[37:50.720 --> 37:53.080]  This is like the longest tangent history of the show
[37:53.080 --> 38:01.320]  He bet the whole thing on the first half of the Miami Dolphins New England Patriots game now that the the back story here is that
[38:01.320 --> 38:04.000]  Tosh is a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan
[38:04.840 --> 38:06.840]  Love's a Miami Dolphins
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.160]  The Miami Dolphins are terrible. They're so bad. They've already fired there
[38:11.160 --> 38:14.120]  You know like three games into the season. They fired their coach and that you know
[38:14.120 --> 38:15.560]  That's
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.240]  If you can't even wait till the end of the season to fire your coach
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.240]  You know your your team is in bad shape
[38:21.600 --> 38:28.160]  So the Miami Dolphins are terrible and the New England Patriots are quite possibly probably the best team in and football this year
[38:28.160 --> 38:33.840]  Yeah, don't talk it for us. So what he did is he bet
[38:34.800 --> 38:37.920]  On the Patriots for the first half only
[38:38.720 --> 38:41.680]  So that he could you know by all by all accounts
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.920]  They're almost certainly going to be ahead at half time
[38:43.920 --> 38:46.800]  They had to be ahead by at least three and a half points and he'd win
[38:47.520 --> 38:52.640]  And but then he could go back and root for the Miami Dolphins to win the game by coming back in a second half
[38:53.120 --> 38:54.480]  So anyway long story short
[38:54.480 --> 38:58.400]  We were interested in the score of the game and so I did the Siri thing in the middle of a movie. Hey Siri
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.400]  What's the score of the dolphins game and
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.080]  The score was already up. I get felt like I was gonna wait for like a little spinner
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.000]  You know while she processes it and in me time it was like the you know
[39:10.480 --> 39:14.400]  Doing on Patriots are up 17 nothing in the first half or whatever it was
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.680]  Anyway long story short Tosh did win the bet the dolphins got killed. Okay. Cool. So
[39:21.280 --> 39:23.280]  Good that he's helping out his
[39:23.280 --> 39:25.280]  brain buddy
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.200]  He's such a dick. I'm sure that he'd you know behind the scenes
[39:29.760 --> 39:32.320]  Problem and probably gave him money, but at least publicly
[39:32.320 --> 39:34.800]  And he did have a picture of the ticket you get from the sports book
[39:34.800 --> 39:41.600]  He did he did bet $25,000 on the Patriots. But anyway long story short showmanship anyway. Yeah, just long story short
[39:42.080 --> 39:48.720]  You got your sports girls. Right. Right. It's against instantaneously and and and that to me is not the sort of question
[39:48.720 --> 39:55.840]  I guess that you can't yeah, I mean, you know, I mean how many I guess people ask about whether and ask about sports scores
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.760]  And I don't know it seems to me like it's more than just local caching
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.160]  It's really really good and I just feel like it it has to become habit-forming because it is such a useful way to navigate the Apple TV
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.800]  Yeah, I just still haven't got there yet. I still do the left right up down thing way too often. Yeah
[40:14.800 --> 40:21.080]  I'll get there the other little thing and I wonder maybe I haven't actually tried this
[40:21.080 --> 40:23.560]  But I know at the event when I played with it
[40:23.560 --> 40:26.160]  I kept I pressed the button and I would say
[40:26.800 --> 40:31.600]  What's the temperature outside and that screwed it all up and they're like, oh, no, no
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.040]  You don't have to say don't say just ask what the weather is
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.640]  But it's weird because I've sort of gotten grooved on saying
[40:39.440 --> 40:41.440]  Because I
[40:41.440 --> 40:46.280]  Guess I should have preface that cuz I know famous that's probably me doing that probably set off
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.920]  A lot of people see her although strangely it didn't set off mine on my phone right here
[40:52.560 --> 40:55.440]  Yeah, mine's okay to you. Yeah, maybe we'll beat it out
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.320]  If you heard beeps, I don't know you may or not have heard beeps 30 seconds ago. It was because
[41:00.800 --> 41:02.800]  I said a G Y
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.440]  Siri
[41:07.280 --> 41:09.280]  The only thing loving it
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.920]  The only thing that ever gets beeped on on my talk show
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.280]  Anyway, um, you would think that that shouldn't screw it up though
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.840]  Like why would that screw it up? Yeah, I wonder if maybe they've maybe they could just maybe in the I wouldn't be surprised
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  If in the interim maybe they've made it so it sure he will just ignore it
[41:32.560 --> 41:34.960]  Recognize it and ignore it. Yeah, you don't need to say it
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.480]  But if you do out of habit, it won't it shouldn't hurt you. Yeah
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.200]  It was exactly it seems and you holding the button, which is effectively the same thing is summoning
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.800]  It seems like the sort of thing that went before it goes out to a wider audience
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.120]  You can see why they didn't do that because the only people who were using it were on the team
[41:53.120 --> 41:57.760]  And they knew exactly how it worked and so they of course never said be because they knew not to say
[41:58.560 --> 42:00.560]  But then
[42:00.720 --> 42:02.720]  Beep
[42:03.280 --> 42:05.280]  They knew not to say the thing
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.960]  But then once it got out into a wider release it maybe it was like oh, yeah
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.320]  Obviously, we should we should just listen for that and just discard it
[42:14.880 --> 42:21.280]  Yeah, sort of like with the live photos the way that in the you know for the first month with the iPhone 6
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.080]  If you drop your camera, you know drop it meaning lower it after you snap the picture
[42:26.880 --> 42:33.760]  Your live photo ends up with this blurry picture of somebody's feet every single time and then starting an iOS 9.1
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.600]  They detect that and just crop it at the point where you lower the camera
[42:38.240 --> 42:40.880]  I love live photo client. That's a good idea
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.240]  It's so great
[42:42.480 --> 42:50.240]  But it's so you can totally see how this seemingly obvious feature of detecting the lowering of the camera how it slipped through
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.320]  Because the only people using it knew they were they had gotten in the habit of holding the camera for
[42:56.320 --> 42:58.480]  For one and a half seconds after right they take the photo
[42:58.480 --> 43:05.280]  Yeah, and it's really like when you're not thinking about it and you're not really you just because that's part of the beauty of the live photos
[43:05.280 --> 43:07.280]  You don't have to think about it
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.800]  You just do it, but then you end up with these weird things. So I wouldn't be surprised if the
[43:14.480 --> 43:16.480]  You know
[43:24.160 --> 43:26.160]  What's the Amazon one
[43:26.160 --> 43:32.720]  Alexa huh not tricking to saying it but what do you have to say though? I don't know
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.200]  I don't know what that anyway, whatever this we can't
[43:41.120 --> 43:46.080]  I find it a little bit disconcerting that we're worried about saying the wrong thing to because it's gonna upset robots
[43:48.640 --> 43:50.640]  Not really a future of my living
[43:50.640 --> 43:52.640]  It does
[43:55.440 --> 43:57.440]  Don't wake up the robot
[44:02.240 --> 44:08.240]  Let me take another break here, and I think our next sponsor and it's what are you gonna do if you're sleeping on one of these
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.120]  Hello pillows well, what are you laying on well? You need a mattress?
[44:11.120 --> 44:18.720]  So here we go serendipity our next sponsor on the show is Casper the company that makes
[44:20.560 --> 44:28.880]  The mattresses and you buy them online and they ship them to your house, and it's amazing is this is like the the this is like
[44:29.760 --> 44:31.280]  The future
[44:31.280 --> 44:35.280]  None of the shit where you go to a mattress store. What what a mess that is
[44:37.680 --> 44:39.680]  Casper makes
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.040]  They make buy a mattress so much easier. It's not just about skipping the store
[44:43.680 --> 44:50.240]  They don't they don't you don't go there and like pick between eight different types of foam or styles of mattress
[44:50.480 --> 44:55.240]  All they do you they just make you pick a size. They're like the apple of mattresses
[44:55.320 --> 44:58.560]  You don't have to go in there and and figure out what type of
[44:59.280 --> 45:00.880]  spring technology is in there
[45:00.880 --> 45:05.040]  They make one type of foam. They use two different technologies
[45:05.040 --> 45:12.440]  Latex foam and memory foam and they've blended. They've got like their own custom blend that they think these are guys are mattress experts
[45:12.440 --> 45:14.040]  It's all they do
[45:14.040 --> 45:20.640]  They've taken care of how much bounce how much sink should be there how much did the memory how much of the latex?
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.320]  They just they do it. That's it, and it's really really nice
[45:26.480 --> 45:28.480]  so
[45:28.840 --> 45:34.080]  You go there you pick what size you want twin size mattress king size queen size whatever
[45:34.080 --> 45:37.120]  That's the only decision you have to make then next thing you know
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.240]  The mattress shows up at your house packed into an unbelievably small box
[45:42.240 --> 45:46.960]  It's probably the biggest box if you've got when you buy one of these things is probably the biggest box you'll get
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.080]  This year, but it is way way smaller than a mattress. It is ridiculously small
[45:53.960 --> 45:59.520]  Half the fun of the thing is opening it up and hearing like the air suck into it like the whole reason they can ship it
[45:59.520 --> 46:02.000]  So small is that they like vacuum seal these things
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.920]  You put it in your bedroom
[46:03.920 --> 46:07.960]  You open up the box you follow the instructions and it makes this cool noise
[46:07.960 --> 46:10.760]  Which I will not attempt to replicate and next thing you know
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.000]  There's a full-size mattress might with all this back to the future talk
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.680]  You know because of the back to the future day was last week
[46:16.760 --> 46:23.440]  It reminds me of the pizza they make him back to the future where it's like tiny and then the mom hits a button and two seconds later
[46:23.440 --> 46:28.180]  There's a full-size pizza. That's exactly what it's like except it's a mattress and not a pizza
[46:28.680 --> 46:30.680]  Does that make sense?
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.960]  Great prices. Here's the other thing too. So much easier. No hard decisions on what type of technology. No
[46:36.760 --> 46:43.000]  crazy price comparisons and you don't have to worry about shipping it or anything like that. You just go there pick it out
[46:44.320 --> 46:50.440]  The mattresses are made in America and if you don't like it you have a hundred days
[46:50.960 --> 46:53.760]  Where up to a hundred days later? You can just say you know what?
[46:53.760 --> 46:55.760]  I don't like it ship it back free delivery
[46:55.760 --> 47:02.600]  You know, so if you have any reservations about buying a mattress without actually having tried it in a store
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.080]  Which quite frankly is kind of gross because guess what other people have been laying on those things too?
[47:07.840 --> 47:11.160]  You have a hundred days no risk money back guarantee. Here's what you do
[47:12.360 --> 47:14.360]  go to
[47:14.360 --> 47:26.920]  Casper sleep that's it here. We got Casper sleep calm and the code is the talk show with the the and
[47:27.560 --> 47:30.240]  If you use that code, you'll save an extra 50 bucks
[47:30.960 --> 47:32.960]  So my thanks to Casper go get a mattress
[47:32.960 --> 47:42.160]  All right, what else is going on with that? I like the theme though. Yeah, it's all sleepy stuff. Yeah, cozy the winters coming in. Yeah
[47:44.240 --> 47:50.280]  What else so let's talk about as far as turning the actual thing on. Yeah, let's talk about the input with the
[47:50.280 --> 47:53.840]  You're sliding around this track pad and and what do you say? It's called focus?
[47:53.840 --> 48:01.560]  Yeah, it's called internally the class that takes care of all that is called the UI focus engine so I
[48:03.280 --> 48:07.440]  Mean, I know we don't have a selection rectangle, but it
[48:08.840 --> 48:13.000]  You know you think of it like that right like as you move down you get the selection rectangle
[48:13.000 --> 48:22.880]  what actually happens for some students who haven't seen it is you move from one icon button to the other and as
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.960]  You move on to want it gets bigger and gets a parallax effect on it too
[48:28.960 --> 48:32.720]  So that as you slightly move your finger around the tap the track pad
[48:33.640 --> 48:35.640]  the angle of the icon changes
[48:36.880 --> 48:38.680]  giving it a nice
[48:38.680 --> 48:41.640]  3d feel like you feel like you're manipulating an object I
[48:41.640 --> 48:48.600]  And I it is it definitely has a 3d feel I feel like for a 1.0 product
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.040]  It's remarkably polished and this might just be a factor of how long they've been working on it internally
[48:54.400 --> 49:02.800]  But it's like to me that the 3dness the way that the selected item pops towards you a little and the way that there is this
[49:03.040 --> 49:05.040]  Parallax and there's also
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.760]  Like you said like if you're if you're going to the left and you're selecting items
[49:09.760 --> 49:14.160]  From the left to the right and you're still kind of pressing your thumb
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.320]  You've stopped you're hovering on one, but you're still kind of got your thumb going a little to the right
[49:19.320 --> 49:24.400]  It that's the way it tilts a little bit. Right. It's as though you're sort of pressing it to the right
[49:24.400 --> 49:28.360]  Yeah, you can idly play with them. I do which is because of all I'm like
[49:28.360 --> 49:30.640]  Oh, yeah, do I want to watch this and I'm like looking at the
[49:31.320 --> 49:36.960]  Parallax effect like often the the text will pop from front of the background or the way it clears and it's it's
[49:36.960 --> 49:43.000]  It's such a cool thing, but it would be so easy to do too much to have it too strong
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.400]  Mm-hmm, and it's not I feel like it is delightfully
[49:47.480 --> 49:48.680]  Understated
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.080]  Yeah, it's anything. I think that the white shine that they put on it's a little bit too much
[49:54.880 --> 50:01.480]  It is funny though because it is absolutely positively not flat right to use that overused
[50:02.120 --> 50:05.840]  It is a very very visually 3d effect
[50:05.840 --> 50:08.840]  It is it yeah things really pop
[50:10.240 --> 50:12.240]  Yeah, while preserving some of the
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.160]  I guess it's it's difficult to explain it
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.800]  But I mean the elements are flat, but they're stacked in a ways search that it's like clearly 3d
[50:21.360 --> 50:23.360]  You're gonna mean like the settings icon
[50:25.080 --> 50:29.200]  Looks almost identical to the OS the iOS icon
[50:29.560 --> 50:34.920]  But it is stacked in a way since the gears are like descend into space so you can see them move a bit
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.920]  Yeah, and
[50:37.320 --> 50:39.320]  Buttons are definitely buttons
[50:39.960 --> 50:43.000]  There's it's it in it, you know
[50:44.400 --> 50:51.400]  Go back and forth on this. I have kind of gotten used to it with iOS 7 starting with iOS 7 the new look of iOS
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.120]  Where a lot of buttons don't have an actual outline. They're just text and
[50:57.040 --> 50:59.480]  It's almost like clicking more like clicking tapping
[51:00.080 --> 51:02.080]  hyperlink and then tapping a button
[51:02.080 --> 51:06.720]  And I can kind of see why they did that. It's never quite sat right with me
[51:06.720 --> 51:09.680]  But I kind of have come to peace with it
[51:09.720 --> 51:13.960]  But I really like that on Apple on this new Apple TV that buttons are buttons again
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.400]  Yeah, they have a pretty distinctive outline and when you move on to one makes a different sound
[51:19.720 --> 51:25.120]  Yeah, as you navigate about the UI you get sounds for what you're selecting to which is nice
[51:25.400 --> 51:29.080]  Yeah, and it's really in my opinion well done again
[51:29.080 --> 51:36.280]  I'd I'd think the old Apple TV sounds were pretty good to but I think that the tweaks that they've done are all for the better
[51:36.280 --> 51:41.360]  And it's just kind of again, it's almost not like you're it's not over the top
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.600]  It's not like a lot of beeping and
[51:44.240 --> 51:49.960]  Buzzin it just subtle little feedback that it almost is like it helps you feel it
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.120]  It makes it feel like your finger can feel these buttons because you're getting some kind of
[51:54.120 --> 52:01.240]  Even though it's not like a force feedback on the remote, you're getting some kind of
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.520]  sensual input
[52:03.520 --> 52:09.880]  Yeah, I would I would love to see it with some kind of haptic feedback in an even moment eventually
[52:09.880 --> 52:13.400]  Yeah, I think that's gotta come eventually especially it just seems like
[52:14.040 --> 52:20.560]  They're doing so much so quickly, you know the haptic stuff that they're doing is if you think about it
[52:20.560 --> 52:23.000]  It's like we're just early days on it really
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.820]  I mean that we're still in the first year of having a
[52:27.920 --> 52:29.920]  Force touch trackpad
[52:29.920 --> 52:37.320]  They just came out with the first phones with the 3D touch a month ago, right six weeks ago
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.120]  The watch only came out in April and watch you know
[52:42.120 --> 52:47.920]  So the watch was one of the first ones they came out with but the watch has really sort of the simplest implementation where it's really just
[52:47.920 --> 52:50.920]  You know, is it a force touch or not? It's not like a degree of force
[52:50.920 --> 52:57.280]  So I think that's inevitable. I think it's got to be you know, whether it's next year or two years from now that there will be an Apple TV
[52:57.280 --> 52:59.480]  Remote that that has some kind of
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.280]  haptic
[53:01.280 --> 53:04.720]  Yeah, not just that they don't need it super robust either it's a smaller device
[53:04.720 --> 53:08.620]  So you don't need to move it that you don't rain like the weight of the device is going to
[53:09.560 --> 53:14.760]  Matter right for the oscillator. So right right and in a way that
[53:14.760 --> 53:20.600]  the way that you're like the big the only real to me the only real downside to the
[53:21.040 --> 53:23.280]  Force touch on the new iPhone successes
[53:26.440 --> 53:32.060]  Six s's sounds so weird. I'll just say success or I'll say it like I write it iPhones success
[53:34.400 --> 53:42.360]  Is that it made him way more like noticeably more like about 20 grams more and that's you know the Apple doesn't really make things
[53:42.360 --> 53:45.240]  Typically that you can get heavier
[53:46.240 --> 53:50.680]  I think it's worth it, but under a moat a little bit more half might actually make it even feel better
[53:50.680 --> 53:56.640]  The remote is so lightweight that adding if it if it if they have to add 20 grams to it to get force touch in there
[53:56.640 --> 53:59.880]  Wow, so what yeah, I will also the engine won't have to be is
[54:00.320 --> 54:04.600]  Force full right because it's good. That's the wiggle right
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.760]  So anyway, I mean, that's a minor
[54:07.760 --> 54:12.640]  The that's how excited I am now. I'm like, oh wouldn't it be cool if X?
[54:12.640 --> 54:20.400]  You know, like I'm even a complaint is just like eyes. I would just say this. I would just go zoom back big picture of
[54:20.840 --> 54:22.840]  the three I
[54:24.520 --> 54:29.480]  Won't count the watch because the watch to me is not really an OS. It's it's sort of all you know
[54:29.840 --> 54:31.840]  It's a watch
[54:32.160 --> 54:34.880]  Maybe I should but of of iOS
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.880]  OS 10 and
[54:38.520 --> 54:45.760]  Apple TV and they all have these new if we start with iOS 7 these new user interfaces
[54:46.360 --> 54:53.000]  They're all using the San Francisco system fun. I think that the Apple TV is the best the best designed one I
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.760]  Just in little things like what do the buttons look like? What do the icons look like?
[55:00.760 --> 55:09.760]  To me, it's the the best is my favorite of them now. Yeah, I think I'm trying to maybe I'm judging that a little early
[55:09.760 --> 55:15.840]  Maybe if I you know a month from now after I've really gotten used to it. Maybe I'll I'll start to see more things to complain about
[55:15.840 --> 55:19.560]  But I feel like there are the least things in there that I would
[55:19.960 --> 55:23.200]  Really wish that they would do differently. I don't really have any complaints like that
[55:23.200 --> 55:25.400]  I just think it's gorgeous and it has such a great feel
[55:25.400 --> 55:32.480]  It could also be because there's less to it, right? Yeah, there's less to it, but there's less UI, you know like there's
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.000]  Right, you don't have a complicated app necessarily, right?
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.960]  Yeah, so the way this focus engine thing works is that in code I get moves
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.640]  The focus the way that the viewer is seeing the screen so
[55:49.640 --> 55:56.720]  If you were to move like right, and there's a
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.400]  Like a list to the right it would jump to where you would expect it to go as viewer not
[56:04.280 --> 56:05.280]  programmatically
[56:05.280 --> 56:07.120]  per se
[56:07.120 --> 56:14.280]  What's a good way of putting this so you could imagine having a button like a view button that was covered up by something else and
[56:14.280 --> 56:19.920]  And if you press down and it would have selected the button logically in the code
[56:20.440 --> 56:26.120]  But something is covering it. It will instead pick the thing that's covering it. I guess that's that's the foremost on the screen
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.160]  Like it doesn't
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.920]  At that man, sorry, I'm trying to explain to you in a not technical way
[56:33.920 --> 56:36.760]  But there's a way that you'd structure the code in the
[56:37.680 --> 56:42.120]  All of these views relate to each other and there's a hierarchy of views of what gets embedded and what
[56:42.120 --> 56:49.760]  But that isn't necessarily what gets presented on the screen because you can have stuff like pop-up showing up or things coming in from the side
[56:50.080 --> 56:58.600]  Or a view element is either hidden or it's alpha value has gone to zero like it's it's completely it's become completely transparent
[56:59.560 --> 57:02.240]  And this focus engine will take all of that into account
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.880]  So we'd look at what it'll consider what the user is seeing rather than what the developer has written
[57:09.880 --> 57:17.080]  Yeah, I think that makes sense from a labor. I think people can kind of know what they mean by that like in the code or or
[57:17.400 --> 57:19.400]  you know in
[57:20.400 --> 57:27.120]  Do they still call it interface builder? What would you call? Yeah, they still call that be it's in the Facebook, but it's inside Xcode now, right?
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.200]  That a lot of times these the the UI is almost
[57:33.760 --> 57:35.760]  It's like an outline
[57:35.760 --> 57:42.600]  where there are you know views that are sub views and that you can effectively at a higher level
[57:42.600 --> 57:48.720]  You can just collapse the whole thing like a section of an outline and just know that if you move this thing around all of it
[57:48.720 --> 57:50.720]  Subviews go with it
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.920]  And when you think of it that way you can think of what would the outline consider to be next?
[57:56.640 --> 58:01.120]  You know it isn't that sort of what you're talking about like it would be like a logical thing like you know that
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.960]  This is beneath it because it's the next thing in this outline which has a linear view, but it isn't related to
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.400]  This but the visual layout right totally if right and it does be like a picture of web page with like a three-column web page
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.880]  There's a left-hand column. There's them the content and then there's whatever the ads of stuff on the right
[58:21.640 --> 58:26.760]  Now imagine navigating with the focus like if you press the down button you'd be going down the left-hand side
[58:26.760 --> 58:31.720]  Right the source list and then if you press right you would jump over to the main content view, right?
[58:33.320 --> 58:36.400]  Now if a dialogue box popped up and
[58:37.160 --> 58:44.080]  You were in the left and you first write you would jump into the dialogue box instead because it's foremost it's great more prominent
[58:45.640 --> 58:47.640]  Yeah, it's it in the
[58:48.720 --> 58:52.320]  Bottom line and I feel like it again to overuse the word magic
[58:52.520 --> 58:54.520]  they have taken a
[58:54.520 --> 58:57.640]  An input paradigm the trackpad
[58:58.840 --> 59:05.480]  That is so much easier to conceptualize if you're just moving a pointer on screen
[59:06.040 --> 59:09.960]  Right just think of the arrow from Mac that Mac arrow cursor
[59:10.520 --> 59:16.440]  Conceptually that's super simple you move a thing and it moves core exactly, you know
[59:17.320 --> 59:19.320]  along with your finger and then
[59:19.320 --> 59:26.120]  It solves everything because whatever you tap on is what's underneath the arrow. So getting rid of the idea of a pointer is
[59:27.040 --> 59:33.840]  Conceptually I would think to implement it very very difficult because they've done it in a way that it has to
[59:34.360 --> 59:36.360]  Normal people are never gonna think about this
[59:36.880 --> 59:42.280]  Yeah, no one you shouldn't and there's a there's a fair amount of new stuff that they've added to you I kid
[59:43.480 --> 59:46.060]  To support this notion of focus
[59:47.080 --> 59:49.080]  and
[59:49.080 --> 59:56.040]  It's unique to the platform like it doesn't it doesn't exist doesn't even make sense on a phone or an iPad
[59:56.720 --> 59:59.360]  So I don't know. It's it's really cool
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:02.560]  Yeah, I really feel like they've knocked themselves out on it
[1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:08.720]  And I don't think they're gonna get the recognition. They you know, and they know that too that it's like some of the stuff that works
[1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:16.520]  It really requires amazing engineering it everybody's just gonna take it for granted very very soon
[1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:23.160]  Yeah, I mean that's kind of the so we crapped all over on-screen keep the on-screen keyboard
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:32.120]  Just the idea of it and it still is less than optimal, but like when you have to enter a password or you know something like that or like
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:34.920]  or if you
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:43.000]  You know like Netflix like to turn on Netflix. I had to enter our Netflix credentials. There's no way around that
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.960]  Yeah, it apps better to by the way
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:50.520]  The Netflix app. Yeah, I actually I guess there is a way around it
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:56.760]  You know we can talk about it. You know, did you see that there's a net newswire for Apple TV? I did have not tried it over yet
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.800]  So it's in a sense so black pixel people who have net newswire now did a
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:08.040]  Apple TV app. I was surprised as I it doesn't seem our assess does not seem like something. I want to do on my TV
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:13.240]  Having played with it. I think I'm right that it's probably not something I want to do on my TV
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:18.320]  But it may not have been that much work for them. I don't know, but it's interesting
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.480]  But the thing that was the most interesting to me was
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:24.280]  they
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:32.120]  To they have their own sync engine and so you can enter your email and password in the Apple TV the old-fashioned way or you can just launch
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:38.280]  iOS net newswire on your iPhone if you're on the same Wi-Fi network and
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:40.360]  They tell you this they're like, or you can just you know
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:43.160]  These your way would be to just launch net newswire for iOS
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:48.600]  So I launched it on my iPhone and there on my iPhone. I got a dialogue box with
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.320]  the option to grant
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:56.120]  the Apple TV app on this you know the name of my Apple TV
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:59.960]  My net newswire sync and I hit a button and
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  It was there
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:04.360]  Oh, that's great. So that's you know, I mean like that's
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.680]  Whether I'm actually going to read our assess on my Apple TV to get sync credentials a lot across that was great
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:13.080]  I wish Netflix would have had the same option hopefully
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:18.200]  Yeah, hopefully more and more apps will start doing stuff like that so that you don't have to do it
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:20.920]  But anyway when you do type on the new Apple TV
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:24.120]  I do think they've made the keyboard better than the old one
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:27.400]  like the old one that was arranged in a
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:34.200]  two-dimensional grid. It was like ABCD EF and then next line
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.320]  You know whatever letter comes after F
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:43.160]  Is it I forget
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:48.280]  I can't I can't I often don't remember mid alphabet. I have to start from the beginning
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.440]  I do it every time you see it. Yeah, I have to start from the beginning and I didn't feel like doing it
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:54.440]  I don't want to admit that
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:03:01.000]  And sometimes I can always do it for the beginning, but sometimes I'm amazed by things. I'm like
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:06.840]  Wow, as in tea are really far back in the alphabet. I never thought of them as being so far back
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:11.480]  Yeah, yeah, they were pretty far back. Yeah, they really are
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:16.040]  Like those are bit to me those are big boy consonants like you you know
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:20.360]  Asses the most frequently used consonant tea is you know super up there in frequency
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:24.920]  You just think that they'd have you know better seats better position. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I heard the
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:28.920]  Man's got this show. She's called the weeds at this point
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:34.680]  I was watching TV the other night and they had somebody do a sobriety test. It was uh
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.800]  Like say the alphabet backwards
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:40.600]  And I'm like are you kidding me? I think
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:43.480]  Couldn't do that anyway
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:48.520]  I would at that I'm as we speak right now. I am stone called Zober
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.520]  Uh, I could not do that
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:53.240]  Z-Y
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:58.680]  I'd have to I would have to do it like and think about as like a programming code
[1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:06.440]  It would be like you would you would flunk the student because the algorithm I would have to use I can do Z and Y
[1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:14.840]  All right X I was gonna say W X Y Z. So you get it. I would I would more or less once I got past X to W
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:20.360]  I would have to redo the entire alphabet A B C D E F G H I J K L I'm on a P Q R S T
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:24.360]  You would scan the entire thing. All right, and then I can go be
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:32.680]  I would I would not be able to to pass that field sobriety test. Yeah, but the actress rattled it off and I was like well, okay
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:34.760]  well
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:35.160]  I
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.840]  Guess I've drank too much or this is just not
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:45.000]  Realistic at all in my head to honestly I'm not gonna sing here on the show
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  But in my head when I do the alphabet in my head I I do it in the the sing song sing song boys. Yeah, of course
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  You have to yeah
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.640]  It's just one of those things that I stopped caring about like doing I could do I know
[1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:05.920]  I feel like I got to a functional enough level with it and like okay putting that aside. I can naturally do my brain
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:10.280]  I do I can naturally without having to stress. I can do
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.720]  pretty significant
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:14.720]  arithmetic in my head
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:21.240]  But I I only do it because it is easy for me like and I've been talking to Jonas about it Jonas isn't so good at
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:24.240]  arithmetic and
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:26.240]  I you know, I was like, you know, you got to do it
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.200]  You got to do to pass these tests. You got to study and you got to work on this
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:34.360]  I was like but in the long run in life, you know, this is a problem that computers have solved like you have to understand the
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:37.200]  Concepts to know what to do, but if you can't do
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:41.000]  647 minus 87 in your head don't worry about it
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.320]  You're gonna have a calculator with you everywhere you go in your life. Yeah
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:46.960]  but
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.960]  So you don't have is a sign with the alphabet on it
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:55.240]  Right, but so alphabetization for me does not come naturally
[1:05:55.240 --> 1:06:01.000]  I don't do it and but it's a solved problem. All right my computer alphabetizes everything for me that I want alphabetized
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.520]  Why don't we arrive to worry about it?
[1:06:02.520 --> 1:06:04.800]  Well, if you go down to find a list here, do you?
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:10.440]  You must know you instinctively know if you're too low or too high. Yeah
[1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:13.280]  You know looking if you're looking at the W
[1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:17.520]  Yeah, yeah, would you go down to find that a H? No, you go you'll go back up. Yeah
[1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:23.000]  Yeah, I have yeah, like as I'm looking at the list like I'm not like
[1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:28.280]  I'm not
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:31.960]  I'm not like it's not like I
[1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:38.600]  I'm not bad at alphabetizing. I'm just I just can't do it all in my head automatically
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.600]  I can't quite remember
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:41.800]  with
[1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:47.600]  Is a K before L or L after K unless I look at it in the list, but I kind of know basically where they are. Yeah
[1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:50.400]  neighborhood
[1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.600]  Let's go back to talking about accounting
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:55.600]  Yeah
[1:06:57.160 --> 1:07:01.480]  No, the UI UI for for Apple TV. Yeah, it's really really well done
[1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:06.600]  Think they've done a good job, and I think it's got legs to think this is gonna
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:10.040]  Yeah, oh, I don't think it's gonna burn out of possible
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:14.680]  So the difference I was talking about the keyboard and the old one was it was a grid and you'd have to go
[1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:19.480]  Up down left and right to select letters and it wouldn't go
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:23.360]  You couldn't go right to go down to the next row
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:30.040]  You know what I mean if you're into the next view of right if you're at the top right of the grid
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:34.720]  I would think going right would move you down move the selection to the next letter in the alphabet
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:38.440]  But it wouldn't they would just sort of like beep it you or something so the new one is
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:45.240]  Just a straight list across the screen from A to Z
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:51.280]  And so all you do is go left right, but one of the things I noticed is
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.600]  And I think it's really cool is as you move the selection for which letter it is
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:04.760]  It's not just one like the rectangle highlighting the selection moves a little bit as you move your finger on that the
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:11.680]  Trackpad, you know what I mean does that make sense? Yeah, it's leading a bit. Yeah, it's it's they did to go to the next one
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:17.760]  When you let go it'll come back to rest like on the right. So if you're pressing a little bit to the left on the trackpad
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:22.720]  The selection range will be a little bit more like leaning towards the next letter of the left
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:26.360]  But you still haven't moved your thumb far enough to actually move it to the next letter
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.920]  Yeah, it feels very visual. Yeah, it's exactly it has a real visceral feel to it that I've it makes it
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:36.440]  You know, so for all the crapping I've done about onscreen keyboards in general
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:40.360]  I feel like the one that they've built for this is a nice is about as good as it could get
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:46.480]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm not I don't know what more you could have done like you've got basically a d-pad or
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  like a trackpad and
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:55.640]  Like 24 letters plus all of the 26 letters. How have I got it?
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:01.760]  This is like the episode Wow, the episode where we reveal ourselves is the the domain so
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:06.760]  The point I wanted to make was
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:10.520]  So if you long press or if you hold a
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:15.520]  Letter you get the capital letters and the letters with accents. Oh, man. I didn't know that
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:21.880]  Yeah, is there another way of doing it? Yeah, they even go down to the bottom and you can it's like more or less switching to all caps
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:28.120]  Okay, yeah, there's like a capital A capital B capital C and then there's the next one over as lowercase a lowercase
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:33.440]  Be low okay. Yeah, I just tried the long press first and it worked. I should have tried that see that better
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:37.400]  Yeah, that's my failing not there is because that seems like if I had to guess
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:45.240]  This is like the problem of talking about it with only one day of using it, but it exactly makes sense
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:48.200]  But yeah, so it works way better and it's
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.720]  Later, it's nice and it is you still going back and forth with the alphabet, but it's not that big deal
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:56.320]  I got actually pretty quick at doing that grid
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.080]  Like remember when we were kids and you'd have to type in codes. Yeah
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:05.680]  Yeah, yeah, and you'd get really good at it. I got pretty good at like navigating that
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:08.400]  At good on Apple TV
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:11.200]  You mean like codes like to
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.120]  Yeah, sorry like a code for like a arcade game like an Nintendo game like putting your code you save code
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:22.200]  And you'd have to they would have like a similar good of letters and numbers
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:27.560]  Yeah, or remember when you used to get to enter three initials for a high score right
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:32.120]  Right, right. What were your three initials? GT. I
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.400]  Think I would just put guy
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:40.920]  That's pretty good. Yeah. That's pretty good. I've mentioned this before mine was GRU
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.960]  That's a good one. Yeah, I don't know. I just it came to me early on and I thought that better than the initials
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:52.360]  Yeah, I have to admit like I don't think I got on the high score as that much. So I
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Did on Star Wars
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.800]  Of course he did although on Star Wars
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:05.000]  The coin-op Star Wars the first three every time you reset the machine the first three were built in like they're like in the ROM
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.720]  And they're incredibly high so if you just like bought a you know
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:14.680]  Had like a brand new Star Wars coin-op game and you played it the first time the best
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:21.120]  You could probably do is to be fourth like the top three were it was like one of them was like they were like in jokes
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  Like one of them was OBI
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  Oh, that's cool
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:30.440]  Yeah, but I thought that they were so high that they were impossible and then one time I was in an arcade and I saw it
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:35.880]  It was like the first time like I thought I was the baddest ass at Star Wars who'd ever lived because there was no internet
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:42.280]  So you couldn't you never you never found out about the people who were really good at games and I was just waiting for the
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:46.600]  Machine and I was like Christ how many games is this guy gonna play and I like look and he
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:49.480]  He is like
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:57.720]  This score that boggled my mind and he was at a level that I didn't think you'd ever be able to get to and it was I was just like oh
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:01.600]  I'm actually not very good at this game at all
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:07.040]  I was a great game. It was a good game vector graphics
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:14.640]  All right the keyboard's good the focus section
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:22.720]  The video playback so this is a part I mentioned this before so when you fast forward and rewind and scrub the video
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:26.960]  It is so good. It is to me everything that they promised on stage
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:31.160]  It works great in
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:33.160]  Apple's app
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.160]  You know like when you play the movies and TV shows that you get from iTunes
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:40.520]  It's available. This is what they this is what I've been told
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:47.040]  It is available to developers and they encourage all developers to do it, but they can't it's not like every app will do it
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:54.640]  Right automatically like somebody could make like a streaming app that doesn't use the the best API's for this or that
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.720]  Maybe the server that sending the streaming video doesn't do something that they need to have happened
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:05.560]  So there might be I haven't seen any yet, but I haven't played with a lot of the third-party video apps yet, but it seemed as though they were sort of bracing
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:13.440]  me for the fact that maybe in some third-party apps video the scrubbing of the video isn't going to be as awesome as it is in
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:17.640]  Apples, but it could be they're they're not using APIs that aren't available to third-party apps
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:19.640]  But developers might have to do some work on that
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:21.920]  Yeah, I would imagine and that's
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:26.360]  collaboration between the back-end service stuff and the app itself
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:29.360]  because you do have to
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.600]  At some point when you start doing the scrubbing you need to see where like
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:38.360]  The thumbnail right, so it's got to come from somewhere so
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:44.720]  You know, it's probably kind of difficult to you to coordinate and some apps may just do raw streaming
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:51.080]  Yeah, I think the Apple TV app reads ahead right like as much as I can basically right
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:57.840]  But I will say this because that we watched a movie last night on Netflix. It was exactly it was like a we're right out of a
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:01.640]  You know commercial for Apple TV
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:07.680]  where we wanted because it's Halloween season, so we wanted to watch a scary movie, so we were going to watch a scream and
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.640]  You know ask Siri for you know show me the movie scream and
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:19.200]  We'd already entered our Netflix password and the first thing that came up was
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  Netflix had the movie and
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:31.120]  They prioritize free so if if there's a way in one of the apps you've you've configured on Apple TV to watch what you're looking for for free
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:35.400]  That will be the first option, so it's not just that they show third-party options
[1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:39.840]  They will show them before Apple's own option
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:45.820]  Just because they'll they prioritize free like that's good. That's really good. I
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:49.520]  mentioned things are like about Apple is that they do actually I
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  mentioned it last night when it worked like that
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  I was like they told me that it would prioritize free and a
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:00.960]  Amy that gave me like you're actually going to praise them for doing the obvious
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:07.160]  For not trying to charge you $4 for a movie you could watch for you should be able to watch for free because you have Netflix
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:10.040]  I was like well, she has a point, but I mean
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.080]  It's I
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:16.560]  Guess yeah, we are so jaded and accustomed to company
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.440]  But would not have been surprised at all if they if
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:25.680]  If they had prioritized iTunes, you know, or at least you know, not prioritize but yeah
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.440]  Well, I guess whoever's first is prioritized if iTunes was always first. I would not have been shocked at all
[1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:32.840]  In fact, I remember having a similar thing years ago
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:40.080]  I'd rented a movie I forget which one and then like months later. I went to go and watch it again, so I went to the again and
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:43.040]  I
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:47.320]  Tunes your TV came back and tell me like you've invented this before do you show you want to do it?
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:52.720]  I oh, that's a super nice of you. Yes, I do, but thank you for
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:59.320]  Reminding just taking me my money like they could easily just take in the money and be like well
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:00.800]  I guess you want to watch it again, right?
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:06.440]  And you know that somewhere inside Apple there's somebody who probably somebody who works for iTunes who probably was
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.280]  Somebody had to at least advocate for it a little like you know, it was probably a debate inside
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:17.040]  Yeah, well, I mean that doesn't just happen either like they have to go check have I ever rented this movie before like that
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:23.480]  That's cool that you know like somebody took active measures to make that a feature
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.880]  Right cuz every single alert along the way, you know, they definitely you know
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:34.240]  It's a terrible experience if you if it's too easy to accidentally rent something terrible and even Apple nobody's
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:37.880]  No company is so greedy that they want people to be angry at them
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:44.920]  So they're you know, I don't know that any there's ever been a video on demand platform that makes it too easy to rent something by accident
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.280]  But yeah, that's an extra nice stuff
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:51.880]  And I feel like on this on the new Apple TV by by by being willing to say hey, you know
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:59.320]  You've got HBO go and this movie is you know in HBO's current selection of movies you could just watch it there for free
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:02.800]  By making that the first option you know again
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:06.240]  There was probably somebody there on the iTunes team who was like oh come on now
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:09.880]  Let's put iTunes first and it's you know, I'm glad they didn't do it
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:15.720]  It comes back to the old the thing we often come back to when talking about Apple that of the three people
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:21.440]  The Apple generally has to think about Apple itself and that what's in the best interest of the company
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:30.120]  They're users the people who buy the products and then last developers that that's you know that they do want to do well by all three
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:33.840]  But the order tends to be Apple first user second developers third
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:41.480]  Um, here's a case where it doesn't just this is not. Yeah. It's a good. Well, it's a case where I think they're putting a user first
[1:17:41.480 --> 1:17:43.480]  Yeah
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:45.480]  I guess
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:50.720]  Well, yeah, I guess I mean they're putting the happiness of the user's ads
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:54.440]  They think that that's a longer term and art for their own success, right?
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:56.720]  And arguably developers too, right?
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:03.560]  So like you know Netflix is a developer and the fact that Netflix can get their their thing listed
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:07.640]  Before iTunes is version of the same movie is good for them
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:12.480]  I think it's yeah, I'm not surprised. You know, it's it seems obvious
[1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:17.040]  You know, it made my wife roll her eyes because it seems so obvious that this is the way it should be
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:24.080]  But you just know that there's a lot of little decisions that Apple sometimes makes that don't don't don't show that sort of priority
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:31.480]  So yeah, that was cool. How'd you like the Netflix app? I thought it was great
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:37.760]  And I always thought that the old Apple TV Netflix app was sort of crap and I
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:42.960]  Well, so we have like Netflix because Netflix is so device
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:47.760]  Agnostic, right? They they've got no box of their own. You there's no Netflix box
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.920]  So they just want to be everywhere, right? They're built into TVs. I was at somebody a family members house
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:19:01.040]  For kids birthday party or something a couple months ago, and somebody had Netflix built into their TV
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:04.680]  Like it wasn't like a box connected to their TV like their TV
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:07.160]  I have that I could do Netflix on my TV
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:16.000]  Which is an analyst it doesn't make any sense to me because I don't I'm just out of touch on how computerized TVs are out of the box
[1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:21.480]  So Netflix is everywhere and you know with varying degrees of quality
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:26.840]  But I've always thought Apple TV was actually one of the worst ones like it just it just seemed a little
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:30.680]  I don't know half-assed. I'm so I'm not sure how much
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.840]  They could have done because all of the old Apple stuff was basically this
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:40.440]  It's like a markdown language right sort of like HTML, but
[1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:46.640]  Specifically just for doing those kind of Apple TV apps, which is why they all kind of look the same and we're kind of bland
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.920]  Well, and I always thought that their streaming wasn't that great either. Yeah
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:57.360]  I mean if you just hit play and you wait a couple seconds and then just play it right through it goes
[1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:03.040]  But you know you couldn't fast forward or rewind worth it shit. Yeah, I think it just gave up trying to be honest
[1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:08.240]  Well, and I'm trying to remember the last time I was frustrated by that and then I'm actually thinking like you know
[1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:09.440]  I just don't think I bother
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:15.080]  Okay, well, and who wonders how long Netflix has been working with Apple on the new Apple TV
[1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:21.520]  Right because we know that the Apple TV this Apple TV the new one the good one has been in the works for a while
[1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:26.840]  Yeah, and it seems like Apple and Netflix have a pretty good relationship for companies that
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:29.480]  More or less could be seen as competitors
[1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:38.480]  I just know that we're if any weird animosity stuff like it clicks was there day one right and on the phone
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:44.800]  They want everywhere right and Netflix was on the old Apple TV very early on as one of the very first third party
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:51.400]  Partners that that got that sort of relationship. Yeah, I have a feeling that Netflix thinks it's fight is with HBO
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:54.000]  Yeah, definitely and it doesn't want it
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:56.920]  You can't fight a two fight a two-front war, right?
[1:20:56.920 --> 1:21:01.800]  Like you can't take on all of the technology players and like people at HBO or AMC and that yeah
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:11.200]  Well, I think it's partly with HBO, but then you know, there's a bunch of HBO's now and I also think that they all what would Netflix sees is that they're
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:18.120]  One of their biggest competitors is the fact that there's only so much time in a day
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:22.840]  And it's really that they've they've got a fight to make it worth your time
[1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:27.520]  You know that for a couple of hours every month you're gonna find something good to watch on Netflix
[1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:35.320]  Yeah, that's huge and that way of looking at media is super interesting to you because that means video games couldn't go whole up your TV
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:37.600]  Right
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:42.240]  Just the amount of time. Yeah, just the amount of it. There's only so much everybody's got a good sleep at some point
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:48.120]  Right finite amount of time and what are they gonna do? Well, if it's messing around on Twitter then guess what they're not watching
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:51.960]  Right whatever it is your friends for you on this or something here. Yeah
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:57.000]  So I don't know I think that the video playback is great, and I know that it's gonna be
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:22:02.880]  But we'll I'll take it for granted soon enough, but at this point. I'm just I'm thrilled every time I fast forward. I don't know why
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:08.120]  Yeah, it is really good. They've done an amazing job at this little device. Oh, did you?
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:10.480]  This is a weird one that you probably didn't notice
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:15.840]  Got the main menu, okay, I'm seeing
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:22.920]  Just put the remote down for a way to a bit. Everything will dim except for the icon that you've got focused
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:30.080]  It'll be have like a spotlight on it and then as soon as you move the remote move it just nudge it
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:32.080]  The screen will go back to normal
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:35.380]  Hmm, and they're using the accelerometer inside the
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:40.880]  Memo right and when you put it down like on a coffee table or a couch it is perfectly still
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:45.080]  Yeah, exactly so even like like the difference between
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:51.240]  Being perfectly still because it's resting on your coffee table versus it's in your hand, but you're not moving your hand
[1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:56.360]  It knows that it's in your hand exactly. It's just it's really nice
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:23:02.760]  It's a weird little touch, but it's just really cool. Yeah. Also. I love that they put an accelerometer in that thing
[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.480]  For no apparent reason
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:08.840]  That we can see from the UI, right?
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:15.400]  Yeah, well not in there UI, but it's obviously, you know, we can get into games, you know later and as we
[1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:17.880]  Work towards the end of this, but
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:23.840]  I wonder though I wonder though if they would have put an accelerometer in the remote if they hadn't been thinking about games
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:28.240]  I don't know. I mean, what do they use it? They don't use it
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:31.040]  Except for that nice little touch. So
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:38.960]  I don't know I'm super happy that they put it in there because it yeah, what do you think about the screen savers?
[1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:45.520]  I love them. I think they're so gorgeous. They're like hypnotic. Yeah, I can't get enough of them have a
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:51.560]  My old screensaver is like a shared thing, but it's just photos of
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:53.080]  uh
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:55.080]  Indi like Vicki's dog
[1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:57.080]  And he's so cute. So I love watching that
[1:23:57.640 --> 1:24:05.960]  But I feel kind of bad because now I just leave the standard city screen viewers of screens savers and they are gorgeous
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:10.760]  Like I don't know how they shot those, but it's amazing. Yeah, there's something
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:16.520]  It would be a great I'm maybe they'll know their apples or maybe they won't but with new apple
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:22.600]  You never know it'd be interesting if they did like a one of those a little behind-the-scenes things that they sometimes do and just showed how
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:27.640]  They've made them because and like Jonas it really caught Jonas's eye too like he was like he even asked the question
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:34.840]  Like how did they do this because it somehow looks different than the footage that you typically see shot out of like a helicopter
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:42.120]  Yeah, I don't know if it's drones or if it's a helicopter bit a shot of the super high frame rate
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:45.800]  Right, but it's not actually because you can see cars driving down the street at some point
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:48.200]  Yeah, there's definitely some some kind of
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:51.400]  High frame rate
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:55.480]  But it definitely is not like a static image. I guess it's drones
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:03.720]  And there were some the New York Times had a piece this week on the way that Greenland is melting at an alarming rate. Yeah
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:05.720]  and
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:11.240]  The the team of researchers from I think it was like the University of Wisconsin whoever it was doing this
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:16.840]  It was an amazing story just to just to hear about what they're doing and the danger just the danger of
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:24.040]  Going up there and having this water rush by like if you if the the ice you're standing on to measure the temperature of the water
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:27.960]  Cracked and went in you like they said like the death, you know, it's chance of death. It's a hundred percent
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:31.720]  There's nothing that anybody would be able to do to save you kind of terrifying
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.400]  Certainly has a sense of being at the end of the world
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:38.920]  Right like you're up here and all you see is ice and stuff like that
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:42.360]  But they it so it's a great story in general really the interesting
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:46.280]  Fascinating but the thing that really captivate to me was the the footage that they video footage
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:51.800]  They had from these drones and it just occurred to me like and they were talking about the budget concerns that these scientists have
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  You know that they're you know using taxpayer money
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:56.200]  and
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:02.160]  It's it's just really really tight budget like every single dollar had to be accounted for just to get you know
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:04.520]  And it's some of the stuff is so expensive
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:10.040]  You know, it was like $5,000 an hour for the helicopter that drove them to or flew them to where they were going
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:16.760]  It just occurred to me that even just like 10 years ago. There's no way they would have gotten any kind of aerial video footage
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:19.640]  because of you know
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:27.480]  Like drones have like absolutely fundamentally changed the type of footage we get like it's like video footage that would have cost
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:32.680]  Would have been like in the budget of like a 20 million dollar documentary film
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.840]  Now a team of university researchers can get just as good a footage
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:43.560]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing. There is a certain smoothness to drone footage that I guess I guess that's what Apple use
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.560]  But I don't know. It's these screensavers are
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:50.520]  Did you hear just because we're in the weeds here?
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:57.560]  Researchers were using drones to check out bears hibernating, but the drones would wake them up. Oh
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  Oh, it's good
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.480]  Up a bunch of bears. It's like a
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:07.960]  Some kind of Heisenberg joke. Yeah insert there
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:18.360]  It's funny to think about because I bet the bears were annoying. Yeah, this is buzzing thing hanging around here
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:24.200]  Of course you're gonna be like what is this? This is not natural. All right, bears just seem like the type of animal
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:26.200]  You just don't want to annoy
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.400]  Please send a go button to do it for you, right?
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.720]  Like imagine if you were on a hike and you just you had nothing to do with the drones or the research
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:41.320]  You're just in bear country, and now there's like a bunch of angry bears. I got woken up in the middle of their hibernation
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.240]  I've always you know, I've always been a little jealous of bears
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:50.600]  Why because the
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:58.520]  Hibernating sounds like the best thing like does that just seem a great like just skip winner
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:05.800]  Yeah, you just skip it sounds pretty luxurious. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure like the realities of it are not great, but oh
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:13.240]  Man, I bet you know, they've got all that fat in the further. Yeah, I think you know, it's like it's like getting to be like
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:19.320]  You know late November starting to get cold you make one one good kill have a good meal
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.920]  And then you're like, you know what you know what that was it
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:25.000]  You're like that that was it. That was a good rabbit
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.360]  I just ate and then you just go and next you know, man, you just sleep for four months. That'd be awesome
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:36.120]  I read I read I do remember reading ones because I've
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:43.720]  Fascinated by it by hibernation. I wish I could I would do it. That'd be great to shut the daring fireball down for four months
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:45.720]  Just you know
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:51.320]  I'll just put up a thing, you know, sleeping and then just wake up and explain right what you wait
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:54.760]  You just skip all the the the the no sunshine
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:59.480]  They skip the sun going down at five and at five at night. Just skip the cold temperature
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:06.920]  Just weird like do they wake up ever? Yeah, they do. I that's like if I was gonna say is that they don't actually sleep continuously for four months
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.120]  They do wake up and you know, I didn't like take a piss every once in a while
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:15.400]  But they don't oh so they even move. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So it it means
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:17.400]  Well
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:22.440]  Doesn't that make sense. I think it's it's like the equivalent of waking up in a moment of night though and going to the bathroom
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:26.040]  Yeah, then he's going back just on a four-month schedule. You just wake up and
[1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:30.280]  You know maybe get it. That sounds like the lap of luxury get a drink of water
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:35.800]  Yeah, that doesn't pretty good. You know the same. I love I just like sleeping
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:40.360]  I don't know. It's speaking of going to sleep
[1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.520]  Our next sponsor
[1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:47.400]  Has nothing to do asleep whatsoever. It's mail route
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:53.400]  These are the guys. These are email nerds and the company does nothing but
[1:29:54.040 --> 1:29:56.040]  email kind of
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:30:05.000]  Almost maniacals single-minded focus. They do services cloud-based filtering solution for email and that's all that they do
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:12.280]  So long story short if you have a domain that you get your own email from you have an email server running somewhere
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:17.400]  Like a web host or maybe it's a company and you have your own servers in the building or something like that
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:23.480]  Doesn't matter what your back end is doesn't matter. You know whether you're running Linux or Unix or if you've got like a
[1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:26.040]  Microsoft system or something like that
[1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:32.440]  You can use mail route because you don't really it's not software that you install on your server
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:34.680]  It's a DNS type thing
[1:30:34.680 --> 1:30:42.680]  So you go into your domain and you set your your DNS records for mail to point your domain at mail route first
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:49.800]  And then you in your mail route account you tell your mail route account where your actual email server is so then it's just simple
[1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:56.200]  Email comes in mail route doesn't host your email. They don't run mail servers. They're just a little DNS filtering service. The mail comes in
[1:30:57.160 --> 1:31:03.560]  Mail route takes all the crap out all the spam all the junk anything that has like viruses or
[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:05.800]  You know fishy attachments and stuff like that
[1:31:06.280 --> 1:31:08.280]  they filter all that out and
[1:31:08.680 --> 1:31:12.520]  Then the email immediately goes just right to your server
[1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:18.440]  So now your server you haven't done anything to your server. You haven't changed the damn thing all you've done has changed your DNS records
[1:31:18.440 --> 1:31:20.440]  But then all of a sudden
[1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:25.720]  The inboxes for all of your users whether you you know, it's like me and you've got one person
[1:31:26.280 --> 1:31:28.600]  at daringfireball.net one email
[1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:34.840]  Or it's a big company and you've got thousands of people all of a sudden the inboxes for every account on your system
[1:31:34.840 --> 1:31:36.840]  Have all the crap just filtered out
[1:31:37.880 --> 1:31:42.840]  It's amazing. It is super super accurate really really good. This is all this company does
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:47.880]  They've got great stuff on our website. You can read about some of the stuff. They do
[1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:53.400]  To have this incredibly highly tuned spam filtering engine
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:57.560]  It's it's just amazing and they have really cool features too
[1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:00.680]  They have stuff that can send you you can you can configure it
[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:04.440]  So if you want to get it once a day you get it once a day you can get it like every week
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:08.760]  But you can get a report from them that would list all of the
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:13.800]  Maybes like here's 10 emails that we filtered out today that we're pretty sure a spam
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:15.640]  But maybe these aren't take a look at them
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:19.400]  And then if you see one in every once in a while like when you buy something online like for me
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:24.200]  Sometimes they're receipt for whatever you bought often gets hit by a spam filter or something like that
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:26.920]  I think mail routes filtering is amazingly accurate
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:28.120]  Nothing's perfect
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:31.720]  But then you get this report. You've got this peace of mind where you've got this real nice easy
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:36.520]  Thing to scan just to make sure that nothing's getting filtered that you didn't want to get filtered
[1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:41.160]  And if they do make a mistake, it's like two clicks and okay, we know that's not spam and it won't happen again
[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:43.880]  Really really good
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:47.240]  They've got all as a typical user their defaults
[1:32:47.240 --> 1:32:50.600]  You can just hook it up. Let it go forget it. Don't worry about it. You're fine done
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:56.360]  If you are like an IT professional if you're the sort of person out there who runs the email for your company
[1:32:56.840 --> 1:32:58.360]  They've got all sorts of APIs
[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:04.760]  Anything you want if you really do want to get down and dirty and deal with the code and hook it up and you know connected to things
[1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:06.760]  They've got all sorts of stuff
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:12.680]  Go check them out. Here's where you go. Go to mail route m a i l r o ut e dot net
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:14.840]  slash
[1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:22.600]  TTS like the talk show just TTS and you will get a free trial and if you use that code slash TTS
[1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:28.040]  On the domain when you do sign up you save 10% for the lifetime of your account
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:33.000]  So you could use this in 10 15 years from now. You'll still be saving money. Thanks to the talk show
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.800]  So my thanks to them go check them out really really great service. I personally recommend it
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:42.120]  What else we got on Apple TV
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:45.160]  Um
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:47.800]  Oh, here's one. I noticed I know and speak in a games
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:50.120]  Um
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:56.920]  There's one I noticed and I can't believe this one is maybe the first thing that I encountered that surprised me so
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:01.880]  We did the thing like I talked about where we okay you have a new Apple TV
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:08.760]  Use your iPhone and it'll send your you know Wi-Fi password and your Apple ID and stuff like that
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.920]  All work great, but for game center that means that our Apple TV is me
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:19.320]  And when we launch a game that is game center integration. It says hello Gruber
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.080]  Um
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:26.120]  And it doesn't seem like there's any easy way to switch like it seems to me like it ought to be like
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:32.520]  Uh, you know PS4 and Xbox where you can set up multiple profiles so that Jonas can easily
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:39.880]  When he's playing a game easily switched to his Apple ID and not have to log out and log in and type its password
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:41.080]  Which is ridiculous
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.960]  Seems like there should you should be able to have multiple game center profiles
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:47.720]  Like I understand why you don't on an iOS device because they're designed to be personal
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:53.880]  And I know that a lot of people wish that like the iPad in particular could have multiple user accounts
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:56.600]  Um, but that's is not how they're designed
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:01.400]  But Apple TV by definition is designed to be used by everybody who lives in the same household
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.000]  I agree. I think it's a big oversight. I'm really surprised
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.720]  I mean, I can't help but think that they know about it and even given all the time that they've spent working on it
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:13.480]  I just can't help but hope that this is just well. We didn't get to that yet
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:19.160]  Yeah, well, I have to assume as we didn't get to it, but like I'm not entirely sure how closely tied
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.840]  The game center account is to your Apple ID
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:31.400]  Like it should switch the game center account. It should be totally separate. It is. Yeah, and you can and you can also do the same thing
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:37.400]  Like with the iPhone you can have a different iTunes store account from your iCloud account
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:40.040]  So if you like I do like a dummy
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:48.160]  I have an I Apple ID that I use for iCloud this thing. I get email from it's the address where you can send me I messages
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:52.040]  But I have a different account for my store purchases
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:57.040]  I think there's a lot of like people who've been using iTunes since the early days of the store a lot of people might have that
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:03.480]  Type of set it weird and I started with it. I can I tools I count. Yeah, I tools. I remember my tools
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:09.240]  Um, dude was the domain I tools back there today not even
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:13.240]  I can't remember
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:19.160]  For me, it was I do know that I give it like my my mac.com is what I give everybody despite the fact that it's
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:25.040]  And here's one thing that bugs me Apple merges Mac and me and iCloud and all of their
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:32.800]  Experimental stuff down into one account like they they just counted all the same but other services don't
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:39.360]  So I'll get like a Google invite like to a Google group and you're like my at me account, right?
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:44.320]  I can't log in because it's the Mac or where I use iCloud or anything. It's
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:46.000]  pressuring
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Yeah, there's it's the
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:50.480]  It's the
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:55.120]  penalty of not having the foresight to pick the right domain off this start
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:03.840]  Comparing contrast with Google who nailed it, right? It was it used to be that the Google didn't have any way that you could get email from them
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:08.080]  And then low one April full-day they said okay now
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:13.440]  We have a thing called gmail and you can sign up for whatever you want at gmail.com and
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:19.520]  Ten years later. It's exactly the same and you've never had to worry about they didn't change it to Google mail
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:24.160]  They didn't change it to add Google last month. They didn't change it to alphabet or
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:26.800]  email
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:28.800]  That's what Amy gets Amy gets email
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:37.440]  You know, they just got it right the first time and nobody ever has to worry about it and you know like I still use the
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:44.000]  Mac.com too, but every once in a while for whatever reason it's like something will come in to me.com and
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:50.800]  Yeah, and yeah, and like you said other services don't see that as being the synonyms for the same email account
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:54.320]  Yeah, and I know that they I mean so they rebranded them
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.880]  Because it like okay, that won't that last one sucked. I don't have done that like three times now
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.880]  Uh, but I mean, that's just collateral damage for like long-term use every time they change it up
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:09.440]  It's like man. Yeah, I like sticking with the mail that Mac.com one just out in nostalgia
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:11.680]  But that was the name that was the
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:16.480]  Most short-sighted like they should have known that they were gonna use this for more than just the Mac
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:18.640]  Yeah
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:20.640]  Oops
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:24.320]  Well anyway, you can have a different ID for the store
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:29.920]  Than the for your iCloud so to get like your photos and stuff in through the photos and king
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:33.280]  You can have a different account for that and you can have a different account for game center
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:35.120]  It defaults to
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:38.400]  The whichever one you use when you first set it up because for most people
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:41.600]  That's the right thing is they're gonna use the same ID for all of those things
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:47.280]  But it doesn't seem like there's any way unless I missed something it doesn't seem like there's any way to switch game center accounts
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  It does feel good
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:56.720]  Not in like a point of the list, but eventually a multi-user system would make a lot of sense for the TV right
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:00.160]  Yeah, it seems like it because it really does see and Netflix
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:04.880]  Netflix has a pretty good thing for that where you can tell Netflix how many people are in your family and
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:07.680]  Right when you launch the app who's watching, you know
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:11.520]  Yeah, it even asks me it says guy or kids and they don't even have any kids
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.360]  Still me
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:17.440]  I think I use kids when I'm babysitting
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:21.360]  I might my fans kid or something so right and keep them out of the you know
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:25.600]  Well, it's not like there's anything crazy on there, but well, I wasn't even thinking crazy
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:31.280]  I'm to I mean, but with kids some you know, I mean even like depending how young they are even like PG-13 stuff is yeah
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:34.960]  Yeah, there can be some pretty scary stuff. Yeah, right. I mean, you don't want to you know
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:39.360]  I have kids watching Indiana Jones eat the monkey brains. Yeah, exactly
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:41.360]  Well, especially when I'm babysitting
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  Yeah
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:49.040]  Don't screw this one. I was guy. It was great. He made me watch a man eat a monkey's brain
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:51.760]  And then all of a sudden you're in trouble
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:53.920]  Yeah, I get to Indiana Jones
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:59.080]  Yeah, so that needs to change at some point because that would
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:04.040]  That affects a lot of stuff, right because if you can change users then
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  Suggestions can change right
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:13.960]  Like basically system-wide you can do you can start doing more interesting stuff like the apps on the home screen can change yeah
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:20.120]  Totally like you're necessarily one minecraft or whatever. I can't even think of anything
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:24.840]  But like a pile of stuff that Jonas once you don't know necessarily wine, right
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:30.600]  Right, I think you know in the long run most almost all the any of in all games that we end up with this thing
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:37.000]  I'm gonna be for Jonas not for me. I mean so yeah, I mean he doesn't want to see you like Wall Street Journal video thing
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:43.040]  You know like like the whole things de-conferences not necessarily going to be tuning into that all the time
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:48.280]  I
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:49.760]  Don't know why I'll
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:56.560]  You know, it's just me and you so I'll brag, but I was happy when when I installed Cannibalt and I got Cannibalt from the list of
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:00.800]  I guess they've made it what are they calling it a universal it's not a universal binary
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:04.720]  But like a universal download so like if you already own it you can just download it for free
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:06.160]  So it was like here's all the apps
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:08.440]  I've already purchased that have Apple TV apps today
[1:41:08.440 --> 1:41:16.040]  And I went to Cannibalt and the app description for Cannibalt starts with a quote from me about how nice a game it is
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:17.560]  Which is really
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:22.800]  And I look at Jonas and I was like yeah, and Jonas it he just looked at me and he was like
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:26.160]  Doesn't even mention you by name. It just says daring fireball
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:31.560]  I was like I was trying to impress you
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:37.560]  It's like well, that's not he's got a he's got a good head on his head, so like I know you're trying
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:42.080]  I know you're proud and that's awesome, but it's good that he's not like no he is not wild at all
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:44.080]  he is not I
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:45.680]  Thought it was pretty cool though
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:50.400]  But I also think it's cool because I am obviously not very well-known for my game reviews
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:56.760]  And I'm playing any games and so I think it that's what made it so surprising to me is there
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:42:01.040]  I think if you add it up all of the games I've even mentioned in
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:08.500]  Well what 13 years of writing during fireball it's you could probably you probably still might have some fingers to spare
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.680]  Certainly wouldn't use up all your fingers and toes. It's got to be less than 20
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:18.200]  Yeah, yeah, you don't talk about games much at all. So I thought that was pretty cool. Yeah, so kind of both cool
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:21.840]  Adam put in quite a bit of work to get that working
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:28.280]  Not quite a bit of work. He spent like a week to get it working, but he had to do this UI focus thing hmm
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:33.200]  Yeah, it's actually there is sort of because it's it's become a
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:38.120]  bigger game in some ways than it used to be like there's some kind of I haven't played in a long time
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:41.240]  Maybe the iPhone game has a two, but like at the beginning that you can select like a
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:45.200]  Level or something. I didn't even know. I only played the default again, but
[1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:50.840]  It was excellent. So he did have to do work. You know him. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:57.040]  Worked with him before yeah, it translates very well and it's you know it does. Yeah, it's great
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:02.200]  Altose adventure is good. You know it's around that one. All right. I didn't I haven't heard it
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:06.280]  I've never heard of this game. This is snowboarding one. It's again similar kind of idea
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:08.880]  And that it's like an infinite runner. This is the honest no board
[1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:11.120]  Is this the one that Syracuse is always?
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:15.200]  Talking about an ATP
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:23.200]  I don't know. I think it is and he talks about it in a way where I can just I can hear him sighing at my ignorance of
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:25.520]  Altose adventure
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:28.080]  And I can hear him calling me an old man right now
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:33.200]  Could be desert golfing there. I know they talked about that. Oh, I know desert golfing son of a bitch
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:35.200]  I came as addictive
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:40.960]  I don't think that one would work on the TV though, would it? I guess I know. I don't know. Guess what? I haven't tried it
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:45.760]  Interestingly
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:48.480]  Our pal
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:57.280]  Matt Combean and and Evan have got a space age. I saw that it was in my I did it's that's one of the ones that I definitely know of
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:00.480]  And it was in my list of
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:06.640]  Hey, you've already own you already own this thing. Yeah, so I tried it for about two minutes last night
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:10.400]  It was getting laid by the time like it was way too lit. It wasn't making any sense
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:17.360]  But it's interesting in that they do with the tap the trackpad what you're suggesting and in that there is
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  There's a cursor on the screen
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:22.600]  That you move using and then you click because it's
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:28.720]  Space age works more like a standard like an RTS game, right?
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:34.320]  We've got units that you select and move them around right, so they've had to make affordances to get that on the TV
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:38.880]  So you can scroll a view by holding down the play pause button and then the tap
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:42.960]  The trackpad will move the window around huh and
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:48.560]  Then if you just not holding down that play pause button then you're moving the effectively the mouse cursor around
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:53.520]  Hmm, do they have like a little first-run tutorial where they tell you what to do. Yeah, yeah
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:56.000]  No, that makes sense and I think for games, you know
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.120]  There's nothing wrong with a cursor, you know, and I think for certain games
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:03.880]  Obviously, you know, like for some of this strategy type games like that where it makes all the sense in the world
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:11.960]  What else was an interesting game? I was thinking about something else
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  I don't forget it
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:21.480]  But so there's I guess one thing I'm surprised there are a lot there's a lot of games available already day one
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:23.200]  I think that's pretty impressive
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:30.880]  And I think it's surprising how much some of them. This is where I was going because I'm surprised at how many of them that were designed for a touch
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:32.960]  Screen device like iPhone or iPad
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:38.400]  Actually, it seemed to translate pretty well to the trackpad device
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:45.040]  Yeah, seems that way so far again. I've spent like a day with it, so it's gonna help tell but
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:52.480]  I mean, so like an infinite runner is a little bit easy, right? Because yeah, like a jump button. So
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.640]  Problem solved. Right. But yeah, like a lot of games
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:01.200]  Seem that they came over pretty pretty well. I
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:06.560]  Do have a like my working theory is that like games will
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:14.240]  It's like water like they will take the form of wherever the platform best supports
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:16.800]  So I think we'll start seeing some pretty interesting games in a while
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:22.640]  But they will be tailored to this trackpad and the motion controller and the
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:29.200]  Interaction that the TV has rather than being a port from something else. Yeah, yeah, one of the games we got
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:32.920]  I don't know if it must be a port. I think because anything that's out already had to have been a port
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:40.520]  But we had this game called man to core ma and ti co re it's a 3d space shooter
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:50.280]  You're this like the last surviving pilot of the you know the good guys and you're flying a spaceship and outer space and you know
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:53.160]  Killing bad guys
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.600]  Graphically seems pretty good Jonas gave it a thumbs up
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:03.080]  You know, but this is more of a serious game. This is like a game game
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:08.600]  Real 3d and the controls. I had to let Jonas play cuz I was so bad
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:14.200]  It's like here you play you play an owl watch, but the controls are accelerometer based
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.640]  And so you steer the ship in 3d
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:20.680]  by the motion of the
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:25.080]  Device and Jonas got the hang of it pretty quickly. He was doing pretty good
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:34.440]  He had or at least it clearly had control over the ship and then you flick up to do like a speed boost and you flick down on the trackpad to slow
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:44.520]  And it shoots automatically so you don't have to fire a trigger if if there's bad guys in the sights of your gun
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:46.680]  It just fires
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:53.800]  Which is to me all told for you know to me what is a complicated idea a 3d space shooter
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:57.800]  A pretty good simplification for a simple remote
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:00.440]  Yeah, accelerometer to move
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:06.040]  Flick up for fast down for slow and you don't have to worry about a trigger. It just shoots
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:09.240]  Yeah, it seems to make sense. I'm gonna check that one out tonight
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:12.040]  Yeah, and it's a cool to you know
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:20.440]  Just a cool little thing to me is that and it's you know, I know it's it's not the only game, but it's obviously a trend
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:24.200]  Um, the the protagonist is a woman
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:28.440]  Oh, cool. It's you know, and it doesn't seem you know, they don't really make a big deal out of it
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:30.440]  It's just you know that this the woman
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:37.160]  It's you're the woman who's the last star pilot of whatever the good guys are called. Yeah, that's good. Awesome. I mean it's arbitrary anyway
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:40.600]  So yeah, why not you know, I mean like right?
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:45.160]  Whatever so it doesn't sound like there's enough story there that
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:52.520]  And you kind of gender is going to make any kind of difference. So me having said that just that the last the last 40 seconds of the show
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:54.760]  I'm not part of gamer game now. Am I
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:01.320]  Okay, I don't know. I just I don't understand
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:07.560]  I just worry that it's like somebody said something like that like hey, that's pretty cool
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:11.560]  That the cool pilot is a woman and then all of a sudden you're you're part of a controversy
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:14.040]  That shouldn't be controversial. Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:16.680]  Yeah, oh, I don't went back and added a
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.880]  Female letter to kind of
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:24.840]  Oh, yeah, I saw that we got that and you just get it randomly. Yeah. Yeah, I got where we got that
[1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:27.640]  Yeah, yeah, that's cool
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:34.440]  Yeah, and it's just like a ninja too. Yeah, yeah, a few of them. Yeah. Yeah, and very nice very very nice touch
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:41.080]  Yeah, we got the beat sports game, which is pretty fun
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:49.400]  Um, I guess my biggest complaint about it is that it's I don't it's so derivative of we sports in
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:52.120]  ways in certain ways that I feel like
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:50:02.520]  Okay, the basic concept of you having an accelerometer type control in your hand that you actually swing to make the the player on screen swing at a ball
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.600]  Okay, that's obviously that's the same idea, but I feel like
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:10.520]  You know, you're allowed to do that without being called a rip-off
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:17.080]  But they do little things that to me are like it's like the crowd noise in a way that the levels start it
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:21.160]  It really feels like a little too close to
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:27.160]  And style not you know like the basic idea of the concept. Okay, of course, there's going to be the comparisons are inevitable
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:33.320]  But some of the details some of the sound effects are so Nintendo like it just seems a little
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:36.200]  Hmm makes me kind of grip my teeth. Yeah
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:40.920]  Yeah, it's one thing to do something in the spirit not another game
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:48.040]  It's another thing to kind of just rip it off right right and even the name when you say it out loud beats sports sounds so much like we sports that it's
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:52.680]  I don't know. Yeah, but it's a cool game. I have to say. Yeah, I mean
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:57.240]  Just yeah, just based on the name and the thing you know what the pitch was in the
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:02.760]  end of it right it's the pitch was we sports without any
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:09.440]  Nintendo intellectual property. Yeah, yeah, but that's another one too and it popped into my head here
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:11.960]  I have it written down but it popped in my head because it's
[1:51:14.040 --> 1:51:16.760]  What do they call it? It's like instead of a we it's
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:22.200]  Your beat or something but anyway if your avatar and it's you know
[1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:30.360]  A total range of skin tones and gender and outfits and you know another thing to me that's the way of games ought to be
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:36.680]  That's cool. Yeah, it's good. Thanks. I mean and your default though the default character is a girl
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:43.400]  If you don't if just like out of the box. It's like she's I don't know what her name is, but she must probably has some kind of name
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:47.640]  She's like there Mario, I guess
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:50.280]  That's cool
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:54.840]  I mean yeah, the problem with that game. I'll just say the problem with the beat sports is
[1:51:56.040 --> 1:52:02.600]  That you can only have one Apple TV remote or Siri remote. I guess they call it right so for one player
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:05.080]  You know, it doesn't matter, but when you play two player
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:12.360]  The way that you play two player is you have to download their free app for the phone and when you play two player
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:17.080]  It no longer becomes accelerometer based it it's all swipe based
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:23.240]  Huh, so one person plays on their phone the other person plays on their remote because I was wondering about it
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:30.720]  I was like, I don't know like accelerometer with the iPhones seems like a disastrous idea like as much as they're worried and Nintendo
[1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:33.200]  You know remember Nintendo had to send out those
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:36.600]  Bracelets that you connect to the we mo
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:41.480]  The TV Apple has one too Apple has one for the it doesn't come with it
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:43.960]  You have to you have to pay extra for it, but you can get a
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:51.320]  Bracelet with it and it it connects to the lightning a port and has like a little lock
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:53.320]  So you have to squeeze it to get it out
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:52:59.160]  It's cool. Well, it's just seemed but it seemed to me like a terrible idea to be swinging your iPhone around like a paddle
[1:52:59.160 --> 1:53:02.760]  And in fact, they don't let you do that they it's all swipe based
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:06.680]  But in other word, but then unlike we sports you're playing like a totally different game
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:11.080]  It feels like when you're playing two player instead of one player. That's weird
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:17.160]  I'm gonna have to give that it to like because I mean changing the game mechanic is weird
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:22.200]  Like it was a just different games. Yeah, it's very different, but you know like you said, it's just you so
[1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:26.560]  I've already bought it. It's just one player mode the other thing and Jonas picked up on this
[1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:33.680]  This is it's been a lot of fun for me as a dad because Jonas is you know really really into video games video games are his thing
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:40.640]  And so it was really it's been really fun for me playing with Apple TV with him and playing with the games because
[1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:46.060]  He's better at not just better at playing games, but he's a more astute
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:54.840]  Observer of the cleverness that's going on. He picked up on what beat sports is so the thing about beat sports that is completely original
[1:53:54.840 --> 1:54:01.800]  And that's and I think that's how they justify the name beat sports is that it's music based
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:07.720]  Christina Warren wrote about it to in her review of it that she called it like a mash-up of we sports and
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:10.680]  Guitar hero
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:17.960]  So it's the timing and the timing is tied to the music of the game and so the moment when you're supposed to like if you're playing
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:20.840]  They're their version of tennis the moment you're supposed to hit the ball
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:23.400]  coincides to like a
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:30.760]  Moment in the music where there's going to be like a sound the sound that it makes as you hit the ball is part of the music
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:38.080]  And so that's how you get your timing down your timing isn't so much about what you see your timing is more like what you hear
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:44.600]  Yeah, I love this kind of games like I wouldn't I wouldn't go so far as to say you could play with your eyes closed
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:48.200]  But it's the same way though that you definitely can't play with the sound off
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:51.360]  Like if you turn the sound off you're not gonna you're not gonna get it
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:57.280]  It's not your timing is never gonna be right. Which is pretty interesting. Yeah, there's been a few cool games like that
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  Res comes to mind from like 20 years ago
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:04.080]  But yeah, it's like you
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:06.960]  If you're getting in the groove for the music you start to it way better
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:10.800]  John August actually had
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:17.280]  Worked on a new car to go for iOS. It is also musically rhythm based as you fight
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:20.560]  uh John August of
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:24.720]  Scream screenwriting scene screenwriting theme. Yeah, and
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:30.080]  The Jordan Meckner who built the original critical right which was awesome. Yeah, and
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:34.800]  Adam was a good to the ad. Yeah, it was terrific. He's got a great podcast too
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:40.400]  Script notes is I can't say enough good things about it. Yeah, I love it
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:45.360]  You know, it's funny because I'm when Marco was on the other week and we talked about hello internet and what a great podcast
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:49.440]  It was it seemed I just I don't know. I maybe I should do more recommendations like that
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:51.440]  I don't listen to a ton of podcasts
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:55.120]  But I got so much email from people who are like wow never heard of this hello internet
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:00.240]  I'd know offense to you this might be my new favorite podcast and it's like you know no offense taken
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:02.240]  It's a great podcast. They're really cool
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:07.760]  If you want another one script notes look it up. Yeah, but with John August talking about the you know
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:12.640]  Screenwriting process, which is fascinating by itself, but if you're in a creative
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:17.680]  Yeah, that's exactly it's good anywhere. It's like even if you're not in the movie business
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:24.320]  Even if you're not a writer it's fascinating if you're just into create if there's any kind of creativity in your work
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:28.400]  It's if it it's applicable on great great podcast
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:35.360]  All right, please go host it with the great Mason. I will I will I promise to forget to put it in the show
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:41.200]  So script notes
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:43.200]  Do you have any else like specific?
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:46.880]  I'm trying to think
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:49.440]  I you know, I guess the thing that I've kind of
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:54.080]  The review unit that I have now is I ordered mine
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:56.960]  But since I knew I was getting one from Apple Thursday
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:03.120]  I didn't pay the extra $17 for the to get another one delivered today because it seemed pointless
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:06.720]  So the one I ordered that I guess won't come until next week sometime
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:10.320]  And I guess what I'm regretting is that I didn't order the game controller
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:14.400]  There was this one game controller that Apple was I guess sort of suggesting that you buy
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:17.040]  Forget what it was called
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:19.040]  That's interesting that
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.400]  And Jonas it's just the thing talking with Jonas about it is you know
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:29.120]  Do we gonna want a game controller for this or not because we have a ps4 so for anything the games like destiny and and when
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:31.280]  Star Wars Battlefront comes out
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:33.120]  uh, you know, I don't know
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.960]  It's gonna play games like that on the ps4 and so do we you know the question of whether
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:44.800]  We or we in particular the Gruber household want a game controller or more than one game controller
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:48.240]  And whether lots of people are gonna want a game controller
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:54.400]  I don't know because it seems to me like most of the games. I've tried so far really seemed meant for the Apple TV remote
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:58.880]  So there's a bit of a kerfuffle about that because originally they released the
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:05.600]  The TV design dog saying that you could use third-party game controllers
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:11.040]  Then they changed it to say that you game must support the Apple remote
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:19.200]  Right in other words what they've what they took out was it was it definitely said it and they changed it like 180 degrees
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:25.840]  Where I think what you're trying to say is it it did say you can make a game that has to have a game controller
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:30.240]  And maybe I guess it would be like there it there'd be a warning in the store
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:37.600]  I actually I guess your Apple TV could know whether you have a controller paired or not and it could just say hey
[1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:42.480]  This game requires a controller and you don't even have one paired with the game yet. Are you sure you want to buy this?
[1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:48.240]  And then like a day later they had the language changed to the exact opposite and said oh yeah
[1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:54.400]  Your game must be fully playable with the the default remote. Yeah, which
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:58.000]  Just destroys so many classes of games
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  Like yeah
[1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:06.560]  Oops, oh well. I still think you'll get a lot of cool games based on the remote, but until they fix that
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:15.840]  Game controller issue. I think you're gonna be stymied. Yeah, like you may have a chicken and egg like what you're saying is like
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:19.600]  I think if you're interested see a lot of cool games that need to the controller you'd be like well
[1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:21.760]  Fine, let's get a controller
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:27.040]  But I think it'll chicken and egg it in a weird way that nobody will make them because I can't right
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:29.040]  Yeah, yeah, I don't know
[1:59:30.160 --> 1:59:32.160]  I just wonder I don't know. Do you have one?
[1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:37.040]  I can show them. Yeah, I don't know if you're not a stand call it by one
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:41.680]  I might buy one trying to see where the hell it's now that they don't have the Apple store anymore
[1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:43.680]  I don't even know where you go to
[1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:48.900]  Find it. I just remember that when I went to buy it. It had like an option here. I'll just buy a new one
[1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:56.760]  You know what I did find a bit confusing is it's hard to tell when you're in the iTunes store or when you're just looking at like a
[1:59:56.760 --> 2:00:05.560]  Show that you right here the steel series nimbus wireless game controller is the one that Apple has as like a suggested
[2:00:08.520 --> 2:00:10.520]  Add-on
[2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:13.080]  Where was that?
[2:00:13.720 --> 2:00:16.680]  It was from here. Is that a legit egg?
[2:00:19.160 --> 2:00:22.600]  I don't know. It's weird. It doesn't seem steel series
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:30.840]  No, it'd be great if they could just support Xbox and PS4 controllers. That's what I was wondering about out of the box
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:36.120]  It'll just detect them and yeah, it seems and it seems like if they just supported those out of the box
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.080]  They it would solve a lot of the problem of you know
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:42.600]  X, Y and Z that they can you know, they're known commodities
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:47.240]  Yeah steel series
[2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:54.520]  Well, I don't even know how you know which ones work with it, but Apple had one that they were selling and it was like 50 bucks
[2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:01.760]  Well, I mean check it out after it some more software coming out. Yeah
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:07.960]  Yeah, so I don't know I feel like that this is one of the things that one day in it's too early to tell whether
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:13.160]  Everybody wants to get one or not. I don't know what made me get cheap and not get one
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:15.160]  I
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:18.040]  It doesn't you use my usual play
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:23.080]  As I stare around the office here my office and it's just
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:29.320]  Filled with things that I've spent $50 on on the on the notion of well, why the hell not
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.920]  And yet somehow in this one particular instance. I didn't do it and now I regret it. Did you get the 64 mic?
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:44.520]  Oh, I got the big one. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't now. You know what I still am not until the clear on what the benefit is
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:48.520]  I just feel like for 50 bucks. I might as well. I don't want to run out of space
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.520]  Yeah, but the song is two different units, right? So that's yeah, is that's a bit like the lesser one
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:01.960]  Well, by the bigger one is that it like they didn't want to come out with a $200 thing so they I guess I
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:06.520]  I do wonder though. Why not just why not just have one? I
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:10.280]  Guess that the margins are better enough
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.400]  If we talk about this with everything we talk obviously
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:19.800]  endlessly over the last year or two about these 16 gigabyte iPhones and you know how much does it cost to Apple to
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.960]  Get the 32 instead of 16. What are their cut? They're you know
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:30.680]  I mean most people seem to think it only costs like a buck or two bucks or something at their scale to to do it
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:34.120]  Like it's you know the $50 difference between these two Apple TVs
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:39.720]  It can't possibly be anywhere even close to $50 in difference for the memory
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:44.680]  I just I mean I say that without actually knowing but it just seems almost
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:48.360]  Impossible 50 bucks for anyone component seems
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:52.200]  Not likely right or even give them you know
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:54.440]  They're usual 30 or 40% profit margins
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:57.320]  And so assume that the cost is $35 or something
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:01.480]  It just doesn't seem right not when you can go and buy 32 gigs of really good
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:06.120]  Flash memory from Amazon just as a card and it's you know doesn't cost that much
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:11.000]  So I don't I don't know and it just seems like it would be so much simpler
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:18.280]  It would take out this whole decision and the fact that there are people writing articles which which size Apple TV should you get
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:22.840]  That shouldn't even be it shouldn't even be an issue. Yeah, I agree
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:30.600]  I don't know. I just looked at it. I just pretend as though they are there's one new Apple TV and it costs $200 and a 64 gigs around
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:35.880]  Yeah, I'm curious to know which one is their primary
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:38.840]  Uh
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:40.520]  That they don't love all of kid equally
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:47.720]  But you don't want to be like did they set out to make the 32 gig about one of them throwing extra extra memory? I guess or maybe they
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:49.720]  um
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:55.480]  Maybe it was like they really wanted to hit 150 dollars and
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:04.120]  Whatever the difference in the component cost is at 150 dollars the 64 gig just doesn't make Tim Cook happy
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:07.160]  You know financially and so they did it
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:10.040]  I don't know, but it seems it just seems like it could have been an easier win
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:15.000]  Yeah, and I kind of I do kind of understand why they still sell the old Apple TV
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:18.520]  Um for 69 bucks, but I you know
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:20.600]  Because there might be you know
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:25.240]  I know that there are peep, you know like institutions like schools and stuff like that that use Apple TV just as like
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:28.040]  Brain dead thing to do airplay to
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:33.400]  Um, so if you know you don't want you may not want the to spend an extra hundred bucks to get a
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:38.600]  Awesome new computer that does all these things because all you're doing is using it as like an airplane
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:41.160]  terminal
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:48.840]  And the difference is so it's massive right the difference between the old third gen Apple TV and this new one is
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:52.280]  Obvious to anybody who might have any interest in buying one
[2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:59.160]  Instantly whereas the difference between a 32 and 64 gig version of the same thing is not so obvious
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:01.800]  Yeah
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:08.040]  Uh, I'm also curious. I'm curious to see how it'll work maybe because one thing that's definitely true and maybe that's the limit
[2:05:08.040 --> 2:05:13.160]  You might know this that that you your initial download. I think has to be under 200 gigs or 200 megs
[2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:16.680]  You get up to two gigs with
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:18.760]  What they call on demand resources?
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:23.800]  App slices right or well, so app slicing is something different app slicing will get you
[2:05:24.840 --> 2:05:29.480]  App slicing means that you're not going to be downloading. Oh, right iPhone right onto your TV
[2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:32.280]  Right basically
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:34.280]  on demand resources means that
[2:05:35.320 --> 2:05:37.320]  Let's say in a game you can tag
[2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:41.400]  Levels and it'll only download the resources for that level
[2:05:42.280 --> 2:05:46.920]  Where you've got four levels on off so all of the ice textures come down right
[2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:50.920]  And then three levels on Tatooine so you can get rid of
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:54.280]  The ice textures and load the sand textures, you know, so
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:05:59.320]  You have up to two gigs of those available for your app
[2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:04.760]  Yeah, and I definitely it's done, you know, obviously they're enforcing it
[2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:09.800]  I mean, I guess if you submit a binary that's over 200 megs you probably don't it probably doesn't even go through
[2:06:10.200 --> 2:06:12.200]  But yeah
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:14.440]  It's been
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:18.040]  Good about that since day one of the app store where you couldn't like yeah
[2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:21.400]  It wouldn't let you download stuff over the cell it was over I think
[2:06:21.960 --> 2:06:23.320]  It makes
[2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:26.680]  Yeah, I just sent you a link to something about that man to core game
[2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:31.800]  I was talking about you don't have to click it now for all. I know it's going to start some kind of auto-play video, but
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:38.280]  And if you go to
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:43.560]  Apple TV or apple.com slash TV and then go to games and more
[2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:48.280]  That's you know, it's like the games and more section of the Apple TV site
[2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:52.440]  They have a big picture of steel series nimbus wireless controller
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:55.640]  I mean, it's not you know, obviously they're not putting one in the box
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:00.600]  You're not giving you one, but they're also not shying away from showing it off
[2:07:00.600 --> 2:07:01.640]  I
[2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:08.360]  Feel like this is the one thing that I just do not see how this is going to play out either game controllers are going to be a big deal for
[2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:14.680]  Apple TV or they're going to be non-existent. I don't know. I think they probably just did get to have to get it yet on it
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:23.160]  Yeah, I wish I I do think that the language that they originally had that they want to allow you to have a game controller is what they wanted
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:24.200]  right
[2:07:24.200 --> 2:07:25.640]  I then
[2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:31.720]  Somebody panicked and say wow can we do this like we can't get the store to check for the presence of a controller
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:39.160]  We're going to get a bunch of people getting mad at us. Yeah, you know, I'd like and they do maybe just sort of the product marketing thing that
[2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:45.480]  They don't want to make it seem as though they're you need this thing that they're not even giving you yeah sure even that yeah
[2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:48.520]  something changed at the last minute and
[2:07:50.680 --> 2:07:54.600]  As progressive as as Apple is in a lot of ways in some ways
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:08:01.240]  They can be a pretty conservative company. Yeah, and you know in terms of promising something like that who are distracting you with a message like that
[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  They don't want to do it
[2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:10.640]  So I guess the thing would be like Kate take the lumps from the developers who change in the thing at the last minute
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:12.640]  Yeah, but
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:19.680]  At least we're not like holding it time bomb here. Yeah, I have one more sponsor to thank now the rare near the end of the show
[2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:22.200]  And I want to do this right now and then we'll wrap up
[2:08:22.200 --> 2:08:27.800]  It's our good friends at Harry's you guys know Harry's Harry's makes awesome
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:31.400]  Shaving products. They make razors. They make the blades. They make
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:37.880]  Shaving lotion that you can use after shave anything anything related to shaving Harry's does it
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:42.600]  They do it and they have great prices
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:46.040]  I mean you can compare their prices to Amazon's for like Gillette blades
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:49.640]  And it really is half the price and the way that they can do it is
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:56.760]  It's like as direct as it can get they make their own blades in their own factory over in Germany
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:02.120]  Like they bought an old like hundred-year-old blade factory. They make their own
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.840]  They sell them right to you. There's no middlemen involved
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:09.880]  And right now they want me to tell you that they are
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:15.960]  an official partner of the mowvember foundation mowvember is a thing where
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:20.520]  It's like a charity thing to remind people and raise funds for men's health
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:26.200]  You know, I guess types of cancer and disease that affect men and so
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:30.520]  it's the mowvember is for the month of November and
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:38.520]  Guys grow mustaches to raise awareness for men's health issues. So make sense for Harry's to partner with that
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:45.160]  Really cool stuff. They have got stuff at their website. You can check out more about that
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:50.920]  So I really do recommend you check out their site check out the stuff about mowvember and it you know
[2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:54.040]  Everybody wants to to cure these diseases
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:57.720]  So they're going to give 1% of their sales and 1% of their time
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.160]  Back to mowvember for the whole month
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:02.440]  So if you've been putting it off

[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:29.720]  Anything else any other apps that you've seen how about our friend James Thompson has built the first calculator
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:32.920]  I think you the slogan is the best calculator for your TV
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.440]  True right and you know James James is a great guy
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:40.920]  has been
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:46.760]  Long-term as long-term as it's just about anybody could be I mean he's been writing I mean Peacock started like in the mid 90s
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:51.400]  Maybe even the early 90s for the back. Back then Peacock. It has been around forever
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:56.680]  I love that Peacock is there on day one on the Apple TV App Store like
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:00.920]  He kills it today. He did he was on the watch day line, too
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:07.160]  Just ways that I would have never foreseen the indie develop community evolving is
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:11.400]  Like the idea that 20 years ago that James Thompson was
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:17.480]  It was the first third party one I fired up to I got a test flight for it. I was like
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:26.760]  I love it. Do I foresee the need to do math on my television? No
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:32.760]  But of course I bought it and I'm glad it's there and it's actually really well done of course
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.640]  Great job. I told him like man. I can't believe he got all those features and he's like
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:43.800]  It's a rough first start like it's a rough standard. It's like you kidding like that is
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:47.720]  That is the world's most advanced television computer. All right
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:52.760]  We were talking when we were when we were talking about typing and you said that you can long press on it
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:57.560]  Lowercase letter to have it pop up and be uppercase temporarily and that you could guess that
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:03.080]  So I made a guess with Peacock that you could use the play button to be the equals key
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:05.880]  worked of course he thought
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.600]  Of course it works. That's awesome
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:13.800]  Super smart. What else is charging for it because he was debating on
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:15.800]  It was about 99
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:17.320]  Okay
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:20.760]  What do you think it should cost? I told him $9.99
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:28.280]  Wait $9.99. Yeah, just go for it. I have rich it. Just why not
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:31.880]  No, they're fucking 99s good
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:38.040]  Oh, I would I just want to hire a place to ask basically just because it's easier. I mean not easier, but it's
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:39.480]  All right
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:43.320]  There's a little work to put these in. I don't know how many people can be buying apps
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:48.280]  Yeah, I'm curious to see that's a big question and you know
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:55.960]  Because TV you know game consoles have you know really it's one of the most well monetized
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:00.840]  Maybe the best monetized form of media whether it's gonna stay who knows but
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:04.040]  flagship games cost 50 or 60 bucks
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:10.600]  I mean that's pretty standard and that's that's the most expensive media that most people buy right books
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:15.480]  Don't cost 60 bucks movies. You never give you know movies or 15 bucks or 20 at the most
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:21.320]  Games are the only thing that is monetized at levels of like 50 or 60 bucks
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:27.880]  Yeah, is that gonna translate to Apple TV? I don't know about 50 or 60. It seems like a lot of them are around 10 now
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  Beat sports is 10
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:32.920]  and also has good that's what
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:39.720]  That's what they started on iOS to you though. Right. I remember that's exactly what I thought is I remember when a lot of there are a lot of apps
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:41.880]  There were 999 on iOS
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:45.080]  Yeah, so we'll see
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:49.560]  I'm super excited about this platform more so than it was for the watch
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:53.000]  Now that could just be a sign that I'm not
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:58.560]  I don't have the imagination enough to figure out what I want to do with the watch, but as soon as they announce this TV
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:01.640]  I had like eight different ideas that I wanted to write for it
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:03.640]  Um
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.760]  Do you do you share that like it? I do too. I you know
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:14.600]  I've never been super excited about the watch. I've been intrigued and I still you know
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:16.600]  I do wear mine, but I don't wear it every day
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.440]  and
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:26.720]  You know, and I I foresee a bright future for it, but I just don't think that Apple watch was ever like I was ever really squarely in the market for it
[2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:30.840]  like it's just not the sort of thing that speaks to me
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:32.840]  overall
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:35.960]  Really
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:39.160]  Right like I you know ultimately
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:45.080]  Like once I stop wearing it every day like and there is this weird motivating thing where you want to keep filling these circles
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:47.160]  Every day and you get to streak going and you keep going
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:48.120]  And I'm sure people are more fit
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.400]  But then once you stop wearing it every day and so you're because you didn't wear it every day
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:57.320]  You're definitely by definition have days where you don't fill the circles. It's just ruined. It just means you don't care anymore
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:04.120]  Yeah, I don't know. It doesn't excite me that much. I don't I a bigger screen to me is more exciting
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.560]  So yeah, I'm super excited about this because it is it's like a little iOS computer
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:17.560]  Hooked up to a giant shared experience. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you can do with this. Yeah, and I'm really interested to see
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:24.120]  Like with the iPhone and to me it's the most exciting since the iPhone because
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:31.160]  With the iPhone starting in 2008 the next year when the app store opened and all of a sudden anybody could write
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:33.720]  apps you got apps that
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440]  Apple never would have thought of
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:41.080]  And it took the platform in ways that nobody could have foreseen
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.760]  And I think that's got to be inevitable with Apple TV and that you know that and yes
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:49.800]  I know that there's ways that you can develop you know and you can
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:53.800]  There's there's other devices that you can hook up to a TV
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:57.320]  You can have it just have a gaming PC hooked up to the TV and you know
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:02.520]  It's even easier or more open than an app store because anybody can you know
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:06.280]  You don't even need an app store to get apps running on anything but people don't do it
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:08.280]  And so it's not a big enough
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:12.840]  Audience to make it worthwhile like I've never really heard of an app that somebody made the only thing
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:17.240]  I've ever heard that's worthwhile with the gaming PC hooked up to a TV is playing games PC games
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.240]  I've never heard of anybody who did something
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:22.680]  Truly original whereas I feel like with Apple TV now
[2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:27.560]  There's this this platform where there's going to be millions of people who have them and who already know
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:32.440]  What apps are and already have an app store account and I'm really curious to see what people do with it
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:38.920]  Yeah, me too storehouse. We didn't mention oh, yeah, I have that and I that looks great. Yeah, so storehouse
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:44.040]  To me it's it's
[2:17:44.040 --> 2:17:50.520]  I didn't spend a lot of time with it, but it really it like breathes on TV in a way that
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:53.320]  I
[2:17:53.320 --> 2:17:59.160]  It's example. It's a great example of what makes storehouse storehouse storehouse is you you upload
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:03.720]  Images and movies and you can add text to and make like an article
[2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:08.760]  But it's not really like you're formatting a document. It's more like a way to build like a
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:12.920]  a photo and video based slideshow
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:19.160]  Sort of it's hard to describe it's a story. It's a yeah, but it's you'll story telling median
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:25.640]  But I feel like on Apple TV it really it it's sort of more like
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:30.280]  Okay, so you're not making a video. It's not like you're just making one video that plays
[2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:35.960]  But it is sort of a way to turn your TV into like a it's like a presentation
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:42.120]  And you know if the pictures are good and the video is high quality. It's really really gorgeous
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.960]  Yeah, and storehouse is popular with a lot of professional photographers. Yeah. Yeah, so that's another one
[2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:53.320]  If you're out there if you're just jotting down a list of apps to try on your new Apple TV as you listen to it
[2:18:53.320 --> 2:18:57.640]  Definitely try out storehouse don't miss it and it's it's a really great example
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:02.600]  To me. I'm so glad you mentioned it. It's it's somewhere written here in my notes for the show, but
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:08.760]  I'm glad you mentioned it because to me it just sort of exemplifies the way that Apple TV is more than just a video box
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:13.720]  It is it's something different new and more interactive and
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:15.960]  isn't just
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:17.560]  About video that you
[2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:20.520]  Hit play and pause. It's it can be something else
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:25.400]  Yeah, and I'm really excited to see what that something else is. Yeah
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:30.760]  Uh, you could put these in stores
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:34.840]  I guess uh, you know like when you've got like a little sign and you've
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:37.880]  You're saying what the
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:43.080]  Like a kiosk kind of situation. Mm-hmm. This is awesome for that. Yeah
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:49.640]  So many different ways to use this little computer that it's it's pretty crazy. Yeah
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:55.080]  I cheat, too. It's like the cheapest iOS device. Yeah. It totally is. I don't know. I
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:57.960]  So we're wrapping up look at my notes. Here's the other thing
[2:19:57.960 --> 2:20:01.080]  So I asked Jonas what he thought of the graphics and we didn't look at all the games
[2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:03.080]  I mean I but we looked at enough
[2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:08.360]  Jonas's estimation was that it to me to him it looked it's clearly not as good as ps4
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:12.040]  But he thought it was better than ps3 so he pegged it
[2:20:12.520 --> 2:20:16.760]  He pegged the graphic fidelity of the games as in between ps4 and ps3
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:22.520]  And but that seems oh, I've that's why I wanted to ask you because that's just Jonas
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:26.120]  eyeballing it right and looking at frame rates and you know
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:28.600]  How much texture and how how rich it is?
[2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:31.800]  What do you think about that as being someone who's sort of actually
[2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:35.080]  You know like I think that that's probably a fair estimation
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:40.360]  I'd say that they're about equal with the previous generation of uh, right consoles now
[2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:44.600]  I can't remember all of the exact specs of this
[2:20:44.600 --> 2:20:47.240]  I don't know maybe they get out performed in some way
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:53.320]  But I mean what you see on the screen is what counts right? So he feels good about it. Yeah more interesting
[2:20:53.960 --> 2:20:55.560]  next year
[2:20:55.640 --> 2:21:00.440]  This is gonna get faster. There's gonna be a better one right and that you're after that. That's gonna be an even better one
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:03.240]  And that you're after that
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:08.200]  Things are gonna start looking bad for consoles. Yeah. Do you think they have like a five to seven year life cycle?
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:13.400]  Do you think that they will at this point Apple TV gets on the annual upgrade?
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:18.120]  Cycle I'd probably guess every two years if that's it. Yes
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:23.720]  I do wonder it's almost because it's it's like and right now it's on
[2:21:24.360 --> 2:21:26.360]  The A8 or a8 X
[2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:32.200]  But it's definitely the eight, you know, so it's it's last year's top of the line Apple system on a chip
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:35.160]  It seems as though
[2:21:35.160 --> 2:21:38.120]  One year later they can make those chips like
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:41.320]  They're just like cook them popcorn. I mean they just you know
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:44.440]  I wouldn't be surprised that they just pop in a
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:50.280]  Year-old a series system on a chip every year and that it's not
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:53.960]  It's almost it's so little work for Apple that it
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:57.160]  It would be foolish not to
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:03.960]  Maybe I mean that it to me we don't just come down to and like what what's the disposition of the team and where do they
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:13.400]  What do they spend the time on you, right? I might be oh, you know, I might be overlooking the the financial gains to be had by selling it for two years
[2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:20.920]  You know like however profitable this thing is at 149 right now a year from now the exact same device with a two-year-old
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:22.440]  A8 is even more
[2:22:22.600 --> 2:22:26.520]  But I don't know because I just feel like the the nerd in me
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:32.760]  Just screams for I want the A9 that's in my iPhone success. I want it on my Apple TV next year
[2:22:32.760 --> 2:22:40.520]  Yeah, I think it's a gimme. I mean not necessarily next year, but I mean obviously it's I mean once you've got this baseline architecture now
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:48.840]  They can start iterating it pretty quickly. How quickly they iterate it. I think it depends on business stuff because they may also not want to
[2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:52.280]  um
[2:22:52.280 --> 2:23:00.360]  Have a new TV every year, you know what I mean? Like it starts to become negative implications if like every year. I've got to go out and buy out all my new Apple kit again, right?
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:02.360]  It
[2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:07.640]  You know the the the I had I think they kind of got trapped into doing it yearly
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:14.600]  When I think that they could have maybe stretched that out a little bit. Yeah, and they kind of well, they don't they haven't really
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:19.280]  But they've done it sometimes like for example, they didn't come out with a new iPad air to this year
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:21.400]  Right
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:28.520]  Whether that's just because they're gonna wait till early next year or whether we have to wait a full year remains to be seen and I've heard
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:34.920]  Both ways, you know when maybe there will be a iPad air three early next year
[2:23:35.880 --> 2:23:39.560]  Like on the old iPad schedule with a keyboard case sort of like the iPad pro
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:44.840]  I don't know maybe not, but anyway, it's you know clearly a little different there
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:48.520]  But I mean
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:54.200]  But on the other hand it would emphasize the differences that Apple has versus the traditional consoles
[2:23:54.200 --> 2:23:59.160]  And I know they're not going head-to-head against ps4 and Xbox and people who are really serious about games
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:05.240]  Like it's intrigued its Jonas's by the new Apple TV and he's I think he's downstairs playing games on it right now
[2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:10.120]  If I told him we're getting rid of our ps4 he'd you know he'd call it lower. Yeah
[2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:15.240]  I need to get a divorce from my dad
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:16.760]  Ouch
[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.920]  Like that would not fly
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:20.360]  Yeah
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:22.520]  But you know I have
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:27.160]  A lot of excitement for the platform and what's gonna end up going
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:31.720]  Because this is a super capable little computer. Yeah
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:33.800]  Well, another thing too
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:37.560]  You alluded to this couple minutes ago where if you project forward three or four years
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:44.120]  They are going to surpass they're gonna make a little Apple TV puck that is more powerful than a Sony PlayStation
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:48.280]  You know whether it's still the ps, you know, they're gonna catch the the consoles
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:55.200]  They're gonna catch up. Have you seen the graph of like I mean? Yeah, but like the performance graph is bananas like they're gonna catch them pretty soon
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:59.480]  All right, so that's bad news for the console guys right and eat
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:03.400]  There's only one step forward on pixels, and that's going to 4k
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:10.840]  And after that the pixels don't change and so the graphics capabilities that they can do every year after year
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:14.040]  They don't have to worry about driving bigger displays. It's you know
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:17.560]  It's it's all just speed. It's just raw speed. I
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:23.880]  Guess that's the last thing if there's anything else is do you think is a mistake that this this Apple TV doesn't support 4k?
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:26.360]  No, I
[2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:31.560]  Don't think it's a gimmick. I think at this point it is. Oh, sorry. Yeah, unpack that
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:36.680]  I mean, no, it's not a gimmick obviously, but right now. I think it's uh, I think it's one of those high-end features that like
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:42.280]  Some people want and clamor for and say that they demand but the actual market doesn't
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:44.280]  Doesn't require it yet
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:51.800]  Yeah, two too few actual 4k TVs and use way too little video that's encoded in 4k
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:54.440]  out there
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:58.840]  Obviously, it's going to happen eventually, you know, but at some point between now and 10 years from now
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:26:03.560]  We're all gonna have 4k TVs and everything we stream will be 4k, but I don't think there's any reason for it now
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:08.920]  My only thought though is that it and it kind of makes me think that they might be on an annual schedule then a
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:14.040]  Bi-annual schedule just because at some point there's going to be one of these that does 4k
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:17.400]  But then again that could just be two years from now. Yeah
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:20.280]  Right, all right
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:24.200]  Because then it would be a big leap like right two years worth of
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.360]  Development under chips plus 4k that would be
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:32.280]  That's worth another item fifty toner boxer, right?
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:37.800]  And maybe a tactic engine remote
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:43.480]  Yeah, right. That's my that's our Apple TV from 2017 now. I'm already now. I'm already
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:49.640]  I'm already bored with this Apple TV. Yeah, terrible. Well, well, we should say I think it's because we're excited about it
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:54.840]  Right that we're already looking forward to like what the future holds. Yeah, usually I just let these you know
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:58.440]  We'd we'd go on for another hour, but I actually I'm so excited by it
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:07.320]  And I know that there's people out there laughing at me and you with the with our personalities on our voices talking about how excited we are
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:14.600]  Because what thing that you and I are very similar with is that when we get excited about something we don't really
[2:27:15.560 --> 2:27:17.800]  We don't really show excitement in the way that
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  Normal humans
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:26.120]  You know, unless unless I'm on like a heater a blackjack table or something. I really don't I don't get too
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:28.120]  exuberant
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:36.520]  But I really am I'm actually sitting here thinking I I really want to wrap this up and go downstairs and go back to play with my Apple TV
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:39.640]  Yeah, it's actually pretty. It's a really cool feeling
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.200]  Anything else going on guy anything you want to promote before we wrap it up
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.440]  Well, there's a lot of stuff going on, but I mean they talked to other people about that
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:52.520]  Like you get the Apple earnings came in
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:58.040]  Bananas chrome and Android are getting merged together. It's kind of interesting. Is that new?
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:27:59.160]  I didn't see that
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:03.480]  Yeah, as of yesterday you have to be playing your Apple TV to figure that all limits that
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:08.160]  Yeah, they get all smacked into one thing, but it's whatever deal with that some other time
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:15.680]  Other than that no go buy my napkin and a Mac App Store napkin
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  That's and what's the domain for that?
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:24.320]  nap.k in oh man. That's that's smart nap.k. And great app napkin
[2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:29.880]  And your Twitter is at gte right yeah
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:35.480]  You get a lot of spam in your ads just because you have a three-letter code or three letters a fair amount
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:37.480]  But not that not that much
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:43.440]  Yeah, it seems like the one people have trouble is people who have like a name like a three-letter name like I don't know
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:48.520]  I don't know who it is, but if you had like Sam at Sam like you end up with a lot of junk in there
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:52.320]  But gte is sort of random that it wouldn't happen by accident
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:57.360]  Not that not as often here. All right. Well. Thank you guys. I appreciate the time
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:21.200]  All right, I'm gonna go play with the Apple TV
