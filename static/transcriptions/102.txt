[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Is this the show? Are we on the show? Is this the show? Could be.
[00:05.000 --> 00:15.000]  Which 2015 mega franchise sequel news are you more excited about this week?
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  We've got Star Wars with a new trailer that came out like the week before Thanksgiving,
[00:19.000 --> 00:26.000]  and we've got as of today the day we're recording a title and cast for the 24th Bond movie.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  It's to me, Star Wars, and only because I've seen some of it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  Getting to see the Millennium Falcon flying over some sand, wherever that was, tattooing or whatever,
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  was that you get chills. It's pretty interesting to me because they're probably my two favorite franchises.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  Yeah, I'd agree with that, drawing a blank on anything else that you would call a franchise that I could put up there with them.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  Well, maybe not up there with them, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe stuff.
[00:56.000 --> 01:06.000]  I like that stuff, but there's no Marvel movie that's ever been announced that's gotten me anywhere near as excited as either of these.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  Maybe it's because it's so new. Do you think maybe in 30 years? Do you think someday Jonas, when they reboot the Marvel stuff,
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  Jonas, would get that excited? I don't know. I know I wouldn't. I just don't think that they're of the caliber.
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  Wait, you've seen Guardians, right? Yeah. I wouldn't say that it's of the caliber of Star Wars,
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  but I'd say that that's the thing that I've seen in theaters lately that gave me anywhere near that same level of feeling.
[01:29.000 --> 01:38.000]  Yeah, but it's still a Guardian knowing that Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is coming out when they announce the trailer or whatever.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  It's just no way that I'm going to be as excited as I am about either of these movies.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Yeah, but that's because you grew up with Star Wars.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  Well, it's in the group of James Bond. Maybe that's it. I'm not even saying it's because the quality I'm just saying.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  Right, right. I mean, in that generation.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  And it's just interesting to me though, because they're the two, my two favorite franchises, and they're coming out in such close proximity to each other.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  So Star Wars is, I don't think there's a date. It's like December 2015.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  Yeah, December, and then was it November 9th for Bond or 6th or something, but it's a specific date.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  Yeah, I'm surprised that the Bond movie, it doesn't even start filming until Monday.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  So it hasn't even started filming it and it's going to be in theaters in November.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  I honestly thought that blockbuster action movies like that took more than a year.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  Well, maybe they knew about the movie. Maybe like the visual effects were all done.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  They just got to go and shoot it real quick.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  I guess all the effects are canned, but I guess it just goes to show how much longer production.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  And clearly, these are two franchises that are known for high production values, you know, Bond and Star Wars.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:45.000 --> 02:56.000]  I think it just goes to show how much more time it takes to make a truly effects-laden film like a Star Wars film than a Bond movie.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  I mean, obviously there's a lot of effects work in a Bond movie, but a lot of the sets and everything are practical.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  And so I guess it doesn't take that much longer to edit, you know, after shooting than Star Wars.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  Well, yeah, the visual thing, not just that there's more visual effects, but I haven't seen the script for the new Bond movie,
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  but I'm guessing that none of the characters are fully CG.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah. I mean, I hope there's no Jar Jar.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  I guess it just is curious to me.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  It just seems, it just seems like the pace of Star Wars seems exactly right to me.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And I know that if I were a kid, like when I was a kid and the Star Wars movies were new and Aaron,
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  the first one, I thought it took impossibly long for each one to come out.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  I could not believe how, you know, they had to wait four years for the Empire Strikes Back and, well,
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  I think it was another two years for Return of the Jedi.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  Yeah.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  I couldn't believe I had to wait that long because I just, I didn't have the patience,
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  but now that I'm an adult, like ever since this new Star Wars movie was announced,
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.000]  the whole thing where Lucas is selling it to Disney and, you know, that they're going to have a new trilogy and it's going to be,
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  you know, basic just, it's going to be the original, you know, cast 30 years later, you know,
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  more or less the same amount of time in the real world that's passed since Star Wars is going to be in their universe, what it is.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  And then they announced J.J. Abrams was going to direct and the writers and etc.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  And the schedule, it just felt to me like, wow, this all seems fair.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  This seems like a reasonable amount of time.
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  This is proceeding at a reasonable pace and 2015 sounds like a reasonable time for the movie to come out.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  This Bond movie that they're not shooting until Monday coming out 11 months from now, that seems crazy.
[04:39.000 --> 04:47.000]  You say that, but episode one Phantom Menace came out in 99 and Attack of the Clones came out in 2001.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  And then Revenge of the Sith came out in 2003.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  So that's two years between movies and you got to figure, they probably took a little bit of time off between.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  So let's say, let's say a year and a half to do each one of those?
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  I guess. I don't know.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  And those are, I mean, they had to make Jar Jar.
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  They had to animate all those clones.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  They had to do the, I mean, there's a lot of not just make an explosion and put it over here and do some green screen stuff.
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.000]  But like fully realized, well, more or less fully realized CG characters that have to be animated in all these little details.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  I, I can see it. I can see how that would take longer. I can, if they can do that in a year and a half, then it's not inconceivable to you.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  I mean, didn't they make one with solace and like a weekend?
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  I think the visual effects and everything just like knocked that one out real quick.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  I'm putting you on the spot here, Dave, because it's, it's, it is, it is, it is dangerous.
[05:40.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's not dangerous, but it's hallowed the talk show ground talking about the bond movies and different about that.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  And it is something that I, you know, purposely and deliberately did not, you know, in the old run with, with Dan Benjamin,
[05:54.000 --> 06:03.000]  we did the thing where we went through one through 22 and, you know, 22 B.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  We included never say never again, which is not in the own production.
[06:06.000 --> 06:17.000]  So we did 23 episodes of the show where one bond movie per show we took, you know, spent like an hour talking about, which was a lot of fun.
[06:17.000 --> 06:26.000]  I think the long time listeners of the show, when people come up to me at WWDC or plays like that, everybody, I'd say half the comments about the show were always about the, the bond series.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  I remember, I listened to those at a time when I hadn't even seen all the movies.
[06:30.000 --> 06:36.000]  And, but that part of the show, you know, has a lot more staying power than the first half of the show.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  Right, exactly.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  Evergreen.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  Right.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  It's, you know, pretty much is relevant now.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  And I didn't, you know, we, Dan and I broke up and these no longer here.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  And then Skyfall came out.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  And so there was no episode where I did that.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  And I don't think there ever will be.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  I don't think it would be right to do it with somebody else and it's not going to happen with Dan Benjamin.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  But we can talk, you know, without going for a whole hour about Skyfall, we can still talk bond.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  But it's tough.
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  You're putting it on the spot here because people are going to, they're going to hold you up against the, the old stuff.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  Well, I just hope I can live up to everybody's expectations.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  So you're more excited about Star Wars than, than, than Spectre, which is the title.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  It's, it's, I don't know.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  It's, I say yes, but because I've seen it,
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  it's like, you ask somebody, somebody with more than one kid who their favorite kid is.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  And it's, it can't really answer that question.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  But if one of the kids hasn't been born yet, we're like, well, I like the first one better because I've seen it.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Yeah. Well, one of the differences, and I've been thinking about it a lot this way.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  I just think it's so interesting that they're coming out at the same time.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  And now big news came out within a week or two of each other.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  And they're two, my two favorite things.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  It just seems so serendipitous.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  And I was thinking about it a lot.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  I'm even thinking maybe I'll do maybe like a Star Wars special episode of this show.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  It's sometime this month, maybe like, you know, in the Star Wars theme,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  call it a holiday Star Wars holiday special.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Star Wars holiday special.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  And go, just go two hours on something, you know, I could, we could,
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  I could easily put together a guest or two and we could do three shows on Star Wars.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  You could start a whole new podcast just talking about Star Wars.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  All right, but comparing it to the bond franchise,
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  well, clearly one of the big differences is that we're up to bond 24 and Star Wars.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  We've only had six movies or seven if you want to count the Clone Wars,
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  which I really don't think it's fair because even though it was released theatrically,
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  they just decided to put into theaters a 90 minute TV pilot.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Yeah, that's a funny way to look at it.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  Well, it was made as a TV pilot.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  And they were like, this is actually pretty good.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  You know, maybe, you know, we'll, we'll, you know, reframe it for cinema, you know,
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  screen size. Maybe they didn't, maybe they didn't even,
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  maybe it was 1.85, which are something like that.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  So which is close to the 69.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  I remember seeing that in the theater than walking out and just thinking,
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  what was that?
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  I think that wasn't, that wasn't anything like I thought it was going to be.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  And watching the cartoon, like the animated series, it was really good.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  And sometimes good.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  Well, it wasn't, it wasn't consistently good.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  It wasn't, I would, I would say with my, my most recent benchmarks
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  for Star Wars quality being the prequel trilogy.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  Clone Wars was pretty good.
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  I don't know.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  I think it was worse than the prequel trilogy.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  Really.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  Yeah, I don't, I think it, it always felt padded out to me.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  It always felt to me like they didn't, you know, they,
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  you know, I think how many episodes did they do for season?
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  Did they do 20?
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  No, I thought it was less than that.
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  I don't know.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Whatever they did, they only had about half as many that were decent.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  And it always felt padded out.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And maybe cliffhanging shows.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  Did you, did you watch it while it was going?
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  Yeah, for the most part, not like we did, but, but.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  Yeah, so maybe that's it, because I watched them all back to back.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  So I'd watched six or seven at a time.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  And so if there's a bad one, it's kind of lost.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  It's padded out by the good ones.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  So even if, even if half of them are bad, you're still kind of remembering more
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  the good stuff.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  I just felt like overall it, it, it, I don't know.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  It was a lost opportunity.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  And I felt like they had a lot of things that were repetitious and that took away from
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  the, the prequel trilogy.
[10:17.000 --> 10:27.000]  Like the fact that Obi-Wan and Anakin had a bunch of encounters with Dooku.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  It changes the way the movies present it.
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  You know, they had the one encounter in the second movie where Anakin lost his arm
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  and Obi-Wan almost got killed and Yoda came in and rescued him with a, you know,
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  quick fight.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  And then in the next movie, they made it seem as though, look, we haven't seen this guy
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  since the last time when he fucked us up real good.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  Let's do this.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  Let's do it right this time.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  But in the meantime, if you've watched the Clone Wars TV show, they've fought against Dooku
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  dozens of times in between.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  Well, in the movies, it always seemed like there's a huge chunk of time that we just didn't
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  get to see. And it felt really awkward. Because in the original trilogy, the time
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  between Empire and Jedi, if you think about it, there's probably some stuff that happened.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  Like the, just getting Lando into Jabba's Palace and like getting everything set up to pull that
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  off must have taken some time.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  But you're not really missing out on much by not seeing those things.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  You can still get a sense of time has passed, but you don't need to know exactly how much time.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  Right. And there was a reference in Empire Strikes Back where, when Han decides to, to leave
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  Hoth to go pay Jabba off. And it's like, he mentions like a, this is where we need live audience.
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  It's like Orndell or something like that. That there was like a bounty that they encountered a bounty hunter recently
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  who tried to kill Han and, you know, just little things like that.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  Yeah, you get hints at it. You get hints at there. There's been some time pass. But the difference between,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  or the gap between episode two and episode three, it just feels like we missed a movie.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  Yeah. It feels watching it sitting down to watch it. Even if you watch them back to back, it feels like there's
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  an entire movie I'm missing, which is one of the big failings of the prequel trilogy. Yeah.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  But so I, in that regard, I didn't mind the Clone Wars going into some more of that backstory stuff.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  Because I felt like I missed it to begin with.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  Yeah, I just feel like it could have been better.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  Yeah. Well, my trouble with it was that it never really felt like Star Wars. Yeah, I agree with that too.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  There's like a style change that it was fine. And once you kind of ease into it, like once you get used to it,
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  it's pretty, it's pretty good. It's entertaining. But it never really felt like canonical Star Wars.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  And the way that the expanded universe stuff always kind of feels like fan fiction. Yeah.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  Yeah. It just didn't quite feel like it. Same thing with seeing it in the movie.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  So I still say there's only six movies. I would've heard that.
[12:45.000 --> 12:53.000]  And that's the big difference is we've only had six movies over, what, 37 years.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  Whereas we've had 24 bond movies in 50 years.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  So it's, you know, clearly a different pace because there was a huge gap between the, the trilogies.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  And we've had another gap since the last trilogy that really helps to soften the blow, I think.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  If this next bond movie isn't very good, that's okay.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  Right. And I think that's actually where Star Wars, especially now that Disney owns it.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  And, you know, this is what Disney does. They're going to, you know, they, they keep franchises going.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  We're going to see, you know, there's, there's going to be more Star Wars trilogies after this one.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Whether it's, you know, a thousand years ago or in the future or whatever.
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  And some might be good and some might be bad, but eventually it will, you know, it'll work itself out.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  And nobody else might be, that you can, you can get by with ebbs and flows. But the fact that there've only been six is what makes people
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  bit so much about the, the, the prequel trilogy because we've only had six and three of them were kind of duds.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  Yeah. To make a comparison in another medium, you look at a TV show like Sherlock.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  And each season is only I think three episodes.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  So it's, if one of them is bad, it stands out way more.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Yeah.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Whereas like a normal TV show if it's 20 episodes in a season.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  It's bad. You don't, you just wait until next week.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  Right. Right.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  And it's like, it's, I think I've always said it by comparing baseball to football.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Yeah. It's really drastic.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  Because baseball plays 100 in, in US plays 162 regular season games a year and football.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then I felt they only play 16 games.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  So like if your favorite team only loses, loses four games in a row.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  It's not good in baseball, but it's, you know, four out of 160.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  It's a long season.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  If you lose four football games in a row, that's a quarter of your season is, you've just lost all in a row.
[14:36.000 --> 14:36.000]  Right.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Baseball, you lose a game.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  You just wait until the game they play later that afternoon.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  Right.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  But I do feel though that the pressure is really on Star Wars at this point though,
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  because everybody was consensus is that they were so disappointed in the last trilogy.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  Consensus, I think is the right word.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  These things are always going to be subjective, but I think that if you polled people,
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  if this were a democracy, if opinions were democracy,
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  they'd just be expunged from the record.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  If we could, if we go back in time and unmake those movies,
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  I bet most people would like to do that.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'm, I'm not of that opinion.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  And I've spoken, it's been a long time.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I think since I've talked Star Wars on this show,
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  I'm nowhere near as down on the prequel trilogy as a lot of my peers are of our generation.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  And maybe it's partly because I have a son who, who, you know, is so young.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I've said this before.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  I was with Molt's a while back.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  But in, in, in Jonas's peers, they don't really see the difference between a trilogy.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  There's just Star Wars movies.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And for a long time, he was even confused about the,
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  the chronology of them.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  And I know some people, you know, like I, I'd, I'd Syracuse a famously.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  I wouldn't even let his kids watch the prequel trilogy.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Good parent.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  Yeah.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  I understand why as a cinema fan, you would do that.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.000]  But you're robbing your kid of, you know, something that is peers now.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  They did, you know, they liked the clone troopers and stuff like that.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  It's, it's, it's different for them.
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  I don't know.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  And I think it's very hard to compare to when you live in a world where you can watch them on demand,
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  whereas I grew up and it wasn't.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  I don't think they came out on home video until like, I don't know, the late 80s.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  So there's plenty of crap that we watch when we were kids that we really liked.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  And we can look back as adults and recognize it was terrible.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  You could only see the Star Wars movies in cinema.
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  And, you know, they, they did re-release them like in between.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  So like you could go see Star Wars two years after it came out again.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  But you know, you were limited by how many times your parents would let you go to the movie there.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  Yeah.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  Yeah.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15, which was like what?
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  Like 10 years ago.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Closer to 2018.
[16:45.000 --> 16:46.000]  Did you watch them?
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  So your, your initial exposure was in home video?
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  Like, I remember, I was in the comics.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  I was, yeah, like 13, like between 11 and 13 when I was really in the comics,
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  I would go to the comic book stores and they would have like Star Wars stuff.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  And it always looked to me.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  Maybe it was the haircuts or the quality of the printing, but it always just looked old.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  It looked like old 70s, like the original Battle Star Galact or Flashboard.
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  Like it had that vibe of like this is stuff that's like, it's going to be old and cheesy.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  I don't want to bother.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  And it wasn't until a friend had got, and I think for his birthday, the VHS set.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  Like one of the VHS, VHS sets that came out before the, the re releases, the re re re releases.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  And he's like, no, you gotta see this.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  And he puts in the tape.
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  And I think the Kim and all of his other friends that were there, everybody fell asleep.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  And so the movie ends.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And I'm still like glued to the edge of my seat.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  My life had been changed.
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  I'd still remember seeing it the first time.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  And I was, I don't know, it must have been, must have been the first run 77.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  So I was only like four years old.
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.000]  And I remember going with my dad to the theaters, see it.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  And my dad, I didn't go to lots of movies in the theaters, but, you know, I went to a fair amount.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  And, you know, my dad would often be the one to take me.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  And my sister's two years younger than me, and a lot of times, you know, she was only two, I guess then.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  So she probably wasn't even going to movies yet.
[18:06.000 --> 18:14.000]  And I remember a general feeling that my dad didn't really give two shits about the movies that, you know, kids movies.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  And I went to see, you know, he went and he has a good sport about it.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  But, you know, it's, you know, most of the movies I went to see when I was four or five years old were pretty crappy and not very interesting to a 36 year old man.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  I remember the opening of Star Wars and that opening shot of the Star Destroyer.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  And it's just on this immense screen.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  So it really looks big.
[18:35.000 --> 18:42.000]  And it's really one of those things, like one of the things the original trilogy I think did so well is take advantage of cinema.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  Meaning that when something looks big on screen, it is big.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  Right.
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  As opposed to like, when you see something that's shot more like a TV show and it's just close ups and it's just, you know, you're just seeing somebody's face you.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  It doesn't give you the sense of enormity.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  The sense of enormity that that Star Destroyer gives you in a theater.
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  I remember my dad like turning to me and he was just like, whoa, like my dad was blown away.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  And I remember thinking that that was even as amazing as the movie.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  Is that my holy cow, my dad is blown away.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  It's just seared in my memory, watching that, the opening of that.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  I wish that my first exposure had been in a theater.
[19:19.000 --> 19:26.000]  Although, you know, maybe looking back, maybe the fact that the first time I saw it was on somebody's crappy CRT television in the 90s,
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  on VHS just makes it that much clearer to me how good the story was or how compelling those characters were.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  I remember too.
[19:34.000 --> 19:41.000]  I do remember the first time I saw Star Wars on home video.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  It was my friend Joe's birthday.
[19:44.000 --> 19:50.000]  Must have been, I don't know what year it would have been, probably around like 84 or 5.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  Maybe we were around 11 or 12.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  So close to Jedi.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  Yeah, I think it was post-Jedi, I think.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000]  But it was a sleepover birthday party with about a dozen of us.
[20:02.000 --> 20:09.000]  And Joe's dad was all cagey and acted like he had this secret, this awesome secret.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  He waited until after we had our pizza and stuff.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  And this is before there were any legit home video versions.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.000]  They weren't released yet.
[20:16.000 --> 20:23.000]  Joe's dad had a bootleg version of the Empire Strikes Back, the best leash it.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  And we complete.
[20:26.000 --> 20:33.000]  Honestly, and I knew Joe's dad and he was a lawyer and he was the dad who drove his car really fast.
[20:33.000 --> 20:43.000]  So like if like a bunch of us were going to the mall and two dads were driving, you wanted to go with Joe's dad because he'd drive he had like a poo-joe and he'd drive it really fast.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  It just seemed too good to be true though.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  I really thought that he was setting a stuff.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  I couldn't believe that I was going to get to watch Star Wars in a house.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  He's shitting us, he's going to put that in and it's going to be Mary Poppins or something.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  He put it in and holy shit it was Star Wars and it was the other thing I remember very distinctively.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  It was because it was bootleg somehow.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  What they did for the aspect ratio was it wasn't pan and scan and it wasn't letter boxed.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  It was squished optically.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Yeah, gross.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  But it was still none of us had ever seen it, there were no legit versions of any Star Wars movies out on the market at the time.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  And it was funny.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  It's just one of those things like you got used to it.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  I'd say within like 10 minutes you got used to it.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  And it was just awesome.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  It was absolutely blow away.
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  Awesome.
[21:34.000 --> 21:41.000]  During the late 90s, just after Napster, did you get into the thing of downloading movies at all?
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  No, I could never be bothered with it.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  I did a little bit but it always seemed like too much work and it was always so hard to find it.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  And then you had to like splotch them all together to get into play on anything I had.
[21:55.000 --> 22:02.000]  You had to post process and all that shit that Don Melton's script does.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  I just could never get into it.
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  It always seemed like too much work and I never ever ever ever want to watch a motion picture on a computer.
[22:10.000 --> 22:17.000]  I was 18 years old and I didn't know anybody but the idea that I could see a movie that was still in theaters was very compelling to me.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  But the problem was that they would always be out of sync halfway through the movie.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  Like there was no way to get the audio in the video to line up the way you would expect them to.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  To this day I have no idea technically what would even cause that problem or why anybody would find that to be acceptable.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  But I remember watching a ton of movies where by the end the audio was out of sync with the video and the aspect ratio was just super squished.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  You get used to the aspect ratio. I don't know how you can get used to the audio being out of sync.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  You got to turn off the part of your brain that gives a shit.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  Because these are movies if you wanted to see this movie done well you would have gone to the theater to see it anyway.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  I guess.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  But I wonder how many movies I thought were terrible. They're actually pretty good.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  I don't know that's a good question.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  So what do you think of the Star Wars trailer?
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Well, or teaser.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  You got to talk about that lightsaber.
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  I didn't think anything. I was surprised that I was mostly offline at the time.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  It was Thanksgiving when we were traveling.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  So I heard that the trailer came out.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  But I didn't want to watch it on a shitty screen.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  So I just put it off and waited until we got home.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  And then like a couple of days after Thanksgiving I watched it.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  I wanted to see it for the first time on my TV.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  I've of course noticed the lightsaber.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  But I didn't really think anything of it.
[23:28.000 --> 23:40.000]  Because I thought that the prequel trilogy established that there's some degree of individuality and lightsaber design.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Especially among the Sith.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  And I'm okay with that.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Yeah, because Dooku had his weird curved thing.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  That was fun.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  And Darth Maul of course with his famous double.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  And that was a scene when the Phantom Menace trailer came out.
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.000]  The very first trailer.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  It was a huge deal.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  And this was right around the time when video on the internet started being a thing.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Like finally we had enough bandwidth to get video.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  And there were like a million parodies of the episode.
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  The Phantom Menace trailer.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  Like there's a South Park version.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  I remember pretty clearly.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  Everybody was doing a thing with the trailer.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  But before the days of YouTube.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  And I remember that moment when you see Darth Maul.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  And the snap hiss and the red blade comes out and you get excited.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  And then the other one comes out.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  And you just kind of like you lose your mind for a second.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Like that's that's so why didn't I ever think of that.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Well that's exactly like what I would have drawn as a kid.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  This had kind of a similar effect where I'm watching the trailer.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  And you hear the snap hiss and the red blade comes out.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  And there's like this weird crackle effect.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  You don't know.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  It's like the rain.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  What's going on?
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  It's like a broken lightsaber.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  And you're like me at least I'm tuned into that for a second.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  I'm excited.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Like I get chills.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And then these little tiny blades come out the side.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  So my reaction went from low to wait.
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  What?
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  I just, you know, I don't know.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  I accept it.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  I didn't think it was.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  I didn't.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  You know, it's obviously a weird design.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  I think if I were a Jedi or a Sith,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  I would not use a lightsaber like that.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  You're just that much more likely to hurt yourself.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  You know, I feel like if you know the force,
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  the force will keep you from hurting yourself with it.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  But what does it do?
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  What does it do?
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  What does it for?
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  If it's a cross guard.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  I mean, the internet has done a pretty good job of showing that
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  that's a terrible design.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  If somebody's blade slides down,
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  it's going to cut the metal part.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  Not the blade.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  It's going to cut right through it.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  Yeah, but maybe it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  I guess it's supposed to be something like a cross guard.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Maybe it's just supposed to look cool.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Maybe it's just, you know, the guy thinks it looks badass.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  I don't know.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  I've always had the impression that you don't really need a
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  cross guard on lightsabers I could do on real swords
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  because it seems to me like when two sabers connect,
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  they kind of stick and there's no way to slide it.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Oh, really?
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  I've never gotten that out of it.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  But it seems like it seems like when they lock up
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  and they make that two sabers locked up sound.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  It doesn't seem like there's any kind of friction between them.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  For a long time watching the Obi-Wan Vader fight
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  at the end of a new hope,
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  I thought that like Obi-Wan's blade was shorting out
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  because the angle at which that scene was filmed,
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  his lightsaber kind of tilts back
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  and it looks like the blade shortens.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  So I thought for a long time that his blade was shorting out
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  and that's where the dramatic tension and that scene came from.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  It wasn't a literary list, it was the angle.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Man, it's funny.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  A lot of that, it's funny because how the saber fights
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  get ever more elaborate, you know.
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  The one in Star Wars, a new hope, is so pedestrian.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  Because it's like just old guys.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  It's a couple old guys.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  Well, and it's an old guy.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  David Prost wasn't old at the time.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  He was actually pretty much in the prime of life,
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  but he had a helmet on.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  I just meant the characters.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  Obi-Wan and Vader were supposed to be a beast.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  Yeah, but that's not why it was like that.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  I think it was, I think partially Alec Guinness
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  was physically a little limited.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  Because he was kind of old.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  And I think David Prost famously couldn't see shit out
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  of the Darth Vader helmet.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  He just couldn't see.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  So there was like, you know, severe limitations
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  as to what, or any stunt man who was in there, you know,
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  could see.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  And it was combined with, I think, the optical needs
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  of the way that they had the saber's made,
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  so that they were made out of the glowy stuff
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  that they could easily rotoscope the colors on.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  Yeah.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  No, maybe.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  You know, and they'd just never done it before.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  I mean, and it's still, because it had never been done before
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  and it just looked so cool.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  And, you know, maybe somebody had had the idea
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  of laser swords, you know, in pulp science fiction, you know,
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  for 100 years, over and over and over again.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  But nobody had ever made one that looked like it was really
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  a real thing, which is, you know, the awesome part
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  about lightsabers and a new hope.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  They looked real.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  But that lightsaber fight was pretty.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  That was pretty weak.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  Let me say this before, before we go on, too.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  I am super, super anti-spoiler.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  Like, I know nothing about this news, episode seven.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Other than the basics of, you know, who's directing it?
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  The cast, the rough time frame, and that's it.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  I don't follow any of the real sites.
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  I don't know anything.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  I'm the same way.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  And I don't even want to watch the trailer.
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.000]  I trusted, I might skip subsequent trailers.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  I trusted the fact that it was immediately built as a teaser.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  Yeah.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  Yeah.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  Like, calling it a teaser made me feel very safe about watching it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  I get, I don't like watching trailers for movies.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  And it kind of comes, it really comes down to the Hunger Games.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  When I went to see the Hunger Games, it was because my friends went
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  to go see a movie and that's what they picked.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  I knew nothing about it other than the poster had a girl with a bow
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  and arrow.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  Like, I didn't know, I didn't even know it was based on a book.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  I went into that movie knowing nothing.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  And knowing nothing, I enjoyed it.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  And I, I was kind of hung up on how much I enjoyed every moment
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  of that movie was a surprise to me.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  And I realized that most of the time if I watch a trailer
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  for something, it's a movie that I want to see.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  And if I want to see the movie, I already know going into the trailer
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  that I want to see the movie.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  I know now.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  I mean, they can, Disney can just have my money today.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  I'll pay for the ticket now.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  There's no way I'm not going to go see the next Star Wars movie.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  So what does watching the trailer get me?
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  It can only show me things that I would get to see later and be surprised by.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  Yeah.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  The modern era of trailer editing, which is evolved very, very clearly
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  into the form of how, how much can we condense the entire plot of this movie?
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  Right.
[29:33.000 --> 29:40.000]  Minus maybe like a, just the ultimate plot twist at the end.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  Everything but the, if you're a movie person,
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  then you like, even while you're watching the movie,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  you'll start to figure things out.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  And if they give you enough plot points in the trailer,
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  your movie go or story follower mind is going to fill in those gaps.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  And you know what the story is going to be before you.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  It always surprises me too when,
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  and I'm not a big believer in like the three act structure.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  I don't think that any, you know, I don't think most good films adhere to it
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  in a, in a very formal sense.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  I just think it's the basic sense that, you know,
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  you know, you want to have a beginning, middle and end.
[30:15.000 --> 30:21.000]  But in loose terms, it always surprises me when a trailer that has my attention.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  And hey, this looks like a good movie.
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  File this way, make a Vesper, you know, note, you know,
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.000]  make a note in Vesper to, you know, put it on my movies to watch list.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  Once the trailer gets to that part where I'm into it,
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  this is a movie I'm making a note now because when it comes out,
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  I want to see it.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  And then it keeps going.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  I've already been there and it keeps going.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  And they're clearly going into act two, right?
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  They're clearly going into the middle of a movie.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  And it's like, why are you showing me this?
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  I don't want it, you already had me.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Why, why are you doing this?
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  Like, say something.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  Let me just experience this.
[30:57.000 --> 31:01.000]  And I do think too though, as somebody who has a rudimentary,
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  you know, dilatants and interest in making movies and has, you know,
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  I made student films in college and I, you know,
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  did a little with video now and think about it.
[31:11.000 --> 31:15.000]  I understand, you know, how, how fun it can be to edit video,
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  but how hard it is to edit video.
[31:17.000 --> 31:25.000]  The way that, that trailer editors can condense a two-hour motion picture
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  into 90 seconds that spoils almost all of it, is incredible
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  artistically, as like the craft of editing cinema,
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  how, how, how they can do, but it's the effect of it is so,
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  it's just so disappointing.
[31:42.000 --> 31:46.000]  Well, ever since Hunger Games and I've established this rule
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  every time I break it, every time I watch a trailer, I regret it.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  The most recent example is I watched the trailer.
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  Did you see a million ways to die in the West?
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  No, that's what's his name, the family.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  Yeah, I haven't seen that.
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.000]  Is it good?
[31:59.000 --> 32:00.000]  It might have been.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  But if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  Right, that's, you know what?
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  I have seen the trailer.
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  Exactly.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  Yeah, that's, every funny thing that happens that movie is in the trailer.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  Yeah.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  No, that's a good example of a movie that I probably would have put on my two,
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  two watch lists, but didn't because I felt like the trailer spoiled and all.
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  Like, I don't understand.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Yeah, I was, I was hoping because family guy as a show, like it or hate it,
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  it's pretty dense with jokes.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  So I, I went in thinking, well, yeah, they put some stuff in the trailer,
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  but there's kind of be a lot of stuff.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  No, no, those are all the jokes.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  Yeah.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  And to the point when, when, when the things happen that happen in the trailer
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  and people in the theater are laughing, I'm kind of wondering why.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  Like, did you not see the trailer?
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  Yeah.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  How is this still funny to you?
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  I remember it very specifically.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  There was a movie and I don't know why.
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  Yeah.
[32:48.000 --> 32:55.000]  It was a movie with Robert DeNiro and he was a, like a bounty hunter,
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  going after Charles Groden.
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  It was an 80s movie.
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.000]  Oh, let me look it up.
[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  DeNiro and Charles Groden.
[33:03.000 --> 33:04.000]  I have no idea what that would be.
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  Midnight Run, 1988.
[33:06.000 --> 33:10.000]  Now, for whatever reason, I saw, that was, now that was like,
[33:10.000 --> 33:14.000]  when I was in like junior high high school, I was going to movies every week.
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  That was just what we did.
[33:15.000 --> 33:17.000]  You know, it was like a group of teenagers.
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.000]  It was, we went to movies.
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  So I saw tons and that was like peak theater,
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  watching movies life for me.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  I saw the trailer for that movie, like a dozen times.
[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  And Charles Groden is like a guy with a bunch of phobias.
[33:31.000 --> 33:35.000]  And Robert DeNiro is like a bounty hunter who's paid to bring him in
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  because he's got like a bail outstanding.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Oh, I do remember this.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  So it's like a buddy, you know, it's like a mismatched, you know,
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  it's the, yeah, in the tropes category.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  It's DeNiro is a tough guy and Groden's at the opposite
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  and he's got all these things.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  And he says like, you know, there's this line where Charles Groden
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  says something like, I've got agrophobia,
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  gorephobia, you know, something else phobia,
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  claustrophobia.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  And DeNiro says, if you don't shut up, you're going to have
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  fistrophobia.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  And it was in the trailer every all the time.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  And then we went to see the movie and he gives the line in the movie
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  and it was, you know, and everybody in the theater laughed.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  And I remember thinking, why is everybody laughing?
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Surely you've seen this because it's in all the trailers.
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  It was in the commercials.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  It was like the signature spoiled joke of the movie,
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  but yet for some reason, the theater still laughed.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  Yeah, I don't get it.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  Oh, that's just, I think it's just something.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  I think I was too cynical at the time, it's a teenager.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  I think it's the way that a crowd, people pay the movie,
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  people want the movie to be good because they took two hours
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  of their lives to see it and they spent the money to get the ticket.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  And they're, you know, in a community, you know, a group.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  Like they wouldn't laugh if they were watching it at home if it was spoiled,
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  but you'd watch when you're in the theater.
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  Like that's the difference.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  Yeah.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  And that, well, even a really funny movie, if I'm watching it by myself at home,
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  I rarely laugh at laugh.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  Right.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  Laughter is like a laughter at a comedy movie is like a group thing.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  Did you see somebody was just, somebody, maybe it was you,
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  somebody posted a link to the original trailer for a new hope.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And rewatching that after watching the episode seven trailer
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  was a real, a really interesting juxtaposition in the editing styles.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  Because then back in the 70s,
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  it was things like Luke Skywalker, a young adventurer.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  And he'd like, you give a little bit about the character and then it talks about
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  and then they're going to have these crazy adventures and they do these things
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  and they encounter these villains.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  And you get excited about the type of story more than any specific thing
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  that's going to happen, but they don't give it anything away.
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.000]  At least in the dialogue, what if you watch the video that's going by?
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  If you've seen that movie, they're like, wow, they kind of give everything away.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  But you don't know that.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  I think, I think I know which version of the trailer you're talking about.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  I think it was one and I didn't even have the music yet.
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Is that the one?
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  Yeah.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  They didn't even have the music.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  And so there's this weird, we'll have to see if we can get a copy of that for the show notes,
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.000]  but there's a weird, it's like you know in your mind that without the John Williams
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  music, Star Wars wouldn't quite be Star Wars.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  That it's as essential, maybe even more essential than any, you know, any cast member more than the logo
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  or, you know, it's that essential to the fabric of what it feels like to be a Star Wars movie.
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  You know that.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's, you know, you don't even have to think too much about like the role that musical scoring
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  can play in cinema.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.000]  But then to see a trailer where there is no actual John Williams Star Wars music, you just think,
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  man, this is just, this is like a saltine without salt.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  This just isn't right.
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.000]  That's that, that opening note just that one is enough to get you excited.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  No clear example then in the new teaser when you see the Millennium Falcon and you hear the score swell up,
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  you get chills.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  Right.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  At least I did.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  Yeah.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  It was like a real like, I could feel like my, I got butterflies.
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  I got really, really excited because it's like everything that everything I need to tell me that this movie
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  is a Star Wars movie is right there on the screen.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  Give me, give me the Millennium Falcon and a John Williams score.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  Just even the first note of the John Williams score.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  And I'm in.
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  I'm hooked.
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.000]  You've got my money.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  Yeah.
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  So kudos to J.J. Abrams and to Disney and everybody else that they, they made it completely,
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  well, not completely spoiler free, but as spoiler free as anything could be a true teaser.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  Well, we were, we're talking with us on Twitter.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  The, the question of the Stormtrooper and whether or not he's really a Stormtrooper.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  I mean, there's a lot of room for speculation.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  So much room for speculation that the speculation, it, it's purely fun.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  I don't feel like we can ruin it.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  I don't feel like seeing that guy in a Stormtrooper outfit ruins anything.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  I don't know who he is.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  I don't know why he's an as, is he a Stormtrooper or is he a guy who was disguised as a Stormtrooper?
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  Right.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  The old on and loop trick.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  Right.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  And so we end up having a conversation like we did on, on Twitter about, you know,
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  what does this mean and what could, but there's no way we can, there's no way any of that discussion would ruin anything.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  I like how this episode is turning into the Star Wars special episode of the talk show.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  Let's take a break and, and thank our first sponsor.
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  It's a good friend George Lucas.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  No, it is our good friends at need and EED.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  Need is a refined retailer and lifestyle magazine for men.
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  I've had people, since they've started sponsoring a show who've, who've, who've mentioned that man,
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  you say lifestyle magazine for men and it's like your eyes start rolling back in your head.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  And, uh, my friend Jim Ray, you know Jim Ray?
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  Yeah, I know Jim Ray.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  Uh, Jim Ray is by far and away the best dressed friend that I have.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  Jim, Jim Ray, I always looks like he's just stepped out of a goddamn magazine ad.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  He is well groomed.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  He is well tailored.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  He, it's, he always looks stylish.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  I always feel like a slob next to him no matter how well addressed him.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  Jim Ray told me, and this is great, that he heard the show and he, he heard me say that need is a lifestyle magazine for me.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it made him his eyes roll.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Even though he clearly reads things like that so he can stay up on fashion, but he checked them out anyway.
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  And then he said to me, you know, they're like the lifestyle magazine for men who roll their eyes at the words lifestyle magazine for them.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  And I was like, you'd mention him because I was, I went to look at the website earlier when I was talking to Matt Alexander, the guy who runs it.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  I went to the website to check it out.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  And my first thought was this, this looks like what Jim Ray would do.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  Yeah, it's, it, but I love Jim's description.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  It's the lifestyle magazine for men who don't like lifestyle magazines for men.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  And it is a source and curate a selection of exclusive products from brands around the world.
[39:30.000 --> 39:38.000]  Things like shirts, slacks, pants, shoes, watches, anything like that.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  And it's curated, meaning there's, you don't go there and have to pick between 40 different styles of pants.
[39:45.000 --> 39:52.000]  They go, they have like three, like a pair of jeans, a pair of khakis and something else.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  And that's it.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  And if you like one of those three, you pick your size and you buy it.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  And if you don't wait till the next edition and maybe they'll have something else that you like.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  But that way you're not sitting there making choices.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  They've made these choices for you.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  And you see something like you get it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  They just launched their holiday collection.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  This is volume 2.1.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  Just came out.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  Perfect timing for this episode of the show.
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  They're offering some exclusive products which are great gift ideas.
[40:18.000 --> 40:25.000]  From brands like Grenson, Happy Socks, men in cities and more.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  They're launching an exclusive stocking stuffers collection on Monday.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  So that's probably, I'm guessing that's, yeah, Monday December 8th.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  So right in the middle of this episode.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  So you know, you might be listening, it's already out.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  And they have an ongoing essentials collection.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  That's at their website neededition.com slash essential.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  And that features items mostly under 50 bucks from studio neat.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Those are the cool guys who make the glyph and a bunch of other cool products.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  I love getting like the ice thing now too.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Yeah, they've got the nice ice.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  Isn't that nice ice that they call it?
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  I forget what they call it.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  It's the thing where you get like the nice clear ice cube.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  Right.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  Get a break in half.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  It's kind of a weird setup.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  But if you're, if you're as hardcore about your ice as I know some people are, this is the way to go.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  Foot cardigan, the manual and more.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  Really great stuff.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  So if you're interested in getting some sharper clothes for yourself or just stuff that you might be interested in.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  They've got other stuff besides clothes.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  And they commissioned, they've got articles and they've got great photography.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  And they do that.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  They hire independent photographers to shoot all their photos.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  So they're putting good photographers to work on original work.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  Really great.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  It's just a cool website to check out.
[41:42.000 --> 41:50.000]  Again, the website is need edition, not edition like math, like edition like the Apple Watch.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Need edition.com.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  Go there and check them out.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  They don't have any kind of URL slug or anything like that.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  But they have a special deal for talk show listeners.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  Place an order by anything you want.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  And then shoot an email over to hello at neededition.com.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  Just send an email and put in the subject line, old fashioned.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  And anyone who does that, anyone who buys anything from them and then emails,
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  hello at neededition.com with the subject line, old fashioned.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  We'll get a bunch of extras in their order.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  You know, magazines, coffee, accessories, anything they have laying around that's really cool.
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  And the first 10 orders that do it will get a free dopp kit.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  What's a dopp kit? Do you know what one is?
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I have no idea what a dopp kit is.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  Well, you're going to get one.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  And it's worth 90 bucks.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  So the first 10 orders that do it will get it.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  So that's great.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.000]  You'll get 90 bucks worth of stuff.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  And you'll find out what a dopp kit is.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  So that's pretty cool.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  And also you'll know before us.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  Wait, I'm looking it up.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  I got to look up what a dopp kit is.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  D-O-P-P-K-I-T. Oh, oh.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  It's like a travel toilet tree bag.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  Oh, well, that's awesome.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  But see, now you spoiled it for everybody.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Well, anyway, first 10 people to do it.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  It pays to use overcast and have the talk show up automatically.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  First 10 people who do it get 90 bucks worth of free, a 90 buck dopp kit.
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.000]  I should probably get that.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  I need a toilet tree's kit.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  I just carry my stuff around and it's a plug bag.
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  Savage.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  No, I don't.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  I have something a little better in this spot, but it's pretty shitty.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  Anyway, anybody who emails them after ordering will receive 25%
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  off for the next three months of stuff that they order.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  So my thanks.
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  That's nuts.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  My thanks to need addition.com.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  Great, great sponsor.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  It's like a, what a great way.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  If you want, if you care about looking good,
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  but you want to put zero effort or thought into it,
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  this is a great way to go.
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  And I don't even mean that a bad way.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  I mean that very complimentary to the service that you,
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  that we could just go to a website and click on something.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  All you have to know is your size.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  And you can look good.
[43:57.000 --> 43:58.000]  I'm credible.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  I've always thought I've said this before in many different contexts,
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  but it is a general rule of thumb.
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.000]  You seldom go wrong by thinking that the most interesting of anything
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  is at the extremes.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  The very biggest, the very smallest.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  The most complicated, the most simple, right?
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  Those are the areas where, to me, anything,
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  whether it's something you're buying a device or whatever,
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  it's just the most interesting.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  And I would say like need is almost like the antithesis of Amazon.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  You go to Amazon and it's like that they even call it
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  the everything store, right?
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  And it's not only to Amazon sell everything.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  They have these partnerships with all these other things.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  So you search for something and you get results from other stores.
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  You go to need and they've got like one pair of jeans right now.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  It carries your jeans this month, right?
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  Done.
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  Right.
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  Do these look good?
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  Yes.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  All right.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  Give us your size.
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  We'll send them to you.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  No.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  I haven't done the pricing yet, but I'm tempted.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  I wonder how much it would be to just every month.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  You just buy everything they offer.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  Yeah.
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  I bet it wouldn't be that much money.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Just have like a stand that you have your size,
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  have your size, you know, your shirt size and your pant size.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  Just done a standing order.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  Yeah.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  Let me subscribe to that.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  Let me just get like here's my size.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  Here's my money.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Charge my card every month, whatever it's going to cost
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  and just send me the new stuff.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  A clothing of them on club.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  Yeah.
[45:20.000 --> 45:21.000]  All right.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  Star Wars trailer.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  Should we dissect it?
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  I say I'm going to save everything else about Star Wars
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  for a future episode, but we could dissect the trailer.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  We can dissect the trailer.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  I think, could you think the narrator is?
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  I know the actor.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  The actor.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  It's Andy circus, right?
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  Right.
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  There was some speculation that it was Benedict Cumberbatch,
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  because I can hear it, but be a weird choice.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Unless Colin shows up in this movie too.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  I am presuming it feels to me, cinematically,
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  like the narrator of the film or of the teaser,
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  is the Sith or Sith like guy we see with the red lights over.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  That's him.
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.000]  I read it as some sage-like character,
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  but I guess there's like an air of darkness
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.000]  in the villainy to the voice.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  Yeah.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  He sounds a little Sith like,
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  sounds a little bit like Darth Maul actually.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  Hmm.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  Jonas thinks, though, Jonas watched it with me.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  He thinks that the character with the red lightsaber
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  is a woman.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  He thinks it's like a witch.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  That would be interesting.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  I think he's thrown off, though, by the sort of
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  kilt-like thing that the guy is wearing.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  Yeah, because that's pretty typically,
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  I mean, even Darth Vader kind of wears a skirt.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  Yeah, but Jonas, but his cape usually hides it.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  Yeah.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  Let's see.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  I don't read it as a woman,
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  but I think it's interesting because the way the figure,
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  the posture of the figure sort of masks a gender.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  Like, if they were just standing up straight,
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  you could kind of read it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  Yeah.
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  You know, it could just be, in honesty,
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  after he said that to me, I re-watched it.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  I won't watch it a dozen times.
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  I did re-watch it.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  And after he, I first thought no way.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  And then I re-watched it.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  And it does seem possible at least.
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  It makes me realize that even as open-minded as I try to be,
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  I have a older, you know,
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  I'm the old dad who just assumes if you have a red light
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  saber, you're a man.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  Even though I've seen the Clone Wars thing with Osage
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  Ventress and, you know,
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  but Jonas, as a much more,
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  he was much more open to the idea that that character
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  could be a man or woman.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  Well, it's nice to see the Sith being more inclusive.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  That's good.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  Do you think,
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  do you think that the lightsaber might have something
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  to do with that?
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  I mean, if that's the case,
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  I don't mean the weird cross-guard thing,
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  but like the weird kind of almost flame-looking blade
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  rather than just the solid...
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  Yeah, there's a John...
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  There's an article.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  I already had it written down.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  John Brownlee, in Fast Company's design blog,
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.000]  has a thing in defense of the new Star Wars lightsaber.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  And his argument is that each Jedi,
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  at least the major characters, you know,
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  like some of the scenes in the prequel trilogy
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  where they had like 100 Jedi running around,
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  you know, and, you know,
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  they were just all copy and paste jobs, you know.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  You get blue, you get green, you get blue, you get green.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  But they only had a year and a half to make those movies.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  But the major characters all had a lightsaber
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  that said something about their character.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  And I think that's true, you know,
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  and, you know, like Obi, like he says,
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  the Obi-Wan's lightsaber is just plain,
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  and he's, you know, and it's simple, and it's elegant.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  It is exactly what he said.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  It's the elegant weapon from a more civilized time.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  Even in the original Darth Vader's lightsaber
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  had a black, you know, more black than Chrome on the handle.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  It just looked a little bit more...
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  And at the time, here's the only one who had a red lightsaber.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  Right.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  Which looks...
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  It just...
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  At least to my eyes, you know,
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  and maybe it's just some trained it,
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  but it just seems more natural
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  that the bad guys would have read.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  Right.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  Reads the color of...
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  Yeah.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  We didn't see green until we're turn to the Jedi.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  And then, I guess, the only reason we saw green
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  is because it showed up better against the blue sky
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  on Tatooine.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  Yeah.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  No, that was actually...
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Yeah, that's the exact story.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  Is that they were...
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  They had...
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  They just...
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  At the time, they just thought,
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  blue guys are blue, bad guys are red,
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  and then they went to do it,
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  and they'd never done one outside before,
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  and they were like,
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  wow, this doesn't look good.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  And so they said, well, we'll make it green.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Yeah, it works.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  And then even episode one,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  we still only see red green blue,
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  wasn't until episode two,
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  that we start to see other colors.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  And I think the first non-redgreen blue we saw
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  was Mason Windows, the purple.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  Right.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  The story goes that Samuel Jackson
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  specifically requested purple.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Yeah, I've heard that story.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  And I heard that...
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  And that Lucas said, no, no, no.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  And then like a day later, Lucas came back
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  and said, you know what I thought about it?
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Sure.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  What do you think is going through Lucas's head?
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  What do you think is thought processes?
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  Like, is there like some canonical,
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  here's how the gems inside the thing work?
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  Or is it just like trying to hold steadfast
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  to some ideology he has about not...
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Well, no, he's totally a good changing thing.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  I don't know, somehow it worked out for me.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  Like, it's one of the things,
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  little things that worked for me
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  in the prequel trilogy where it's somehow in a world
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  where we went from an original trilogy
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  where there were only three Jedi,
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  four if you count Vader.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  Right.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  Oh, I bet that was...
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  I bet it was the scene at the end of clones
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  where you've got, you know, a thousand Jedi
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  on the screen at the same time.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Right.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  How do you...
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  How do you more visually establish that Mason
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Windows is above all of these guys
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  that he's, you know, he's, you know, in a trilogy
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  filled with, at some points in some scenes,
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  hundreds of Jedi.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  How do you have...
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  How do you establish that this guy is a cut above
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  or two cuts above?
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Well, not just that, but the...
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  If I'm Lucas, I go home
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  and I think for myself,
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  well, I've got to do this scene with a thousand Jedi
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  on the screen at once
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  and if all you see is...
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  Oh, you can see where...
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Oh, you can see where Mason Windows was in the movie.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Yeah, it's like, well, not just that,
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  but you could realize, well, if I'm going to give people
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  like yellow and pink and all this other shit,
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  I should just give him the purple lightsaber.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  So this guy at Fast Company, Brownlee,
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  his theory is that because at the end of Return of the Jedi,
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  the only two Sith left, the Emperor and Vader
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  are killed, that anybody, whoever this guy is,
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  if it is a Sith, to restart the Sith,
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  he didn't have a master to teach him how to make a lightsaber, right?
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  And so that's how to do it on his own
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  and that's why it crackles and sizzles
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  and seems a little bit less...
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  a little bit less technically well put together.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  Another assumption of the male pronoun.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  Yeah, well...
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  I don't know if he's she.
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  I don't know what to say there.
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  But yeah, this character...
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  No, oh, not to you, but more too,
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  just like the idea that even this guy.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  All right.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  I think that that would be a really interesting switch.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  It would play against our expectations,
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  but in my mind, story-wise,
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  I would have assumed that whoever the new Sith is,
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  would have been like a student of Luke's or something
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  that has gone to the dark side,
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  rather than somebody who just woke up one day.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  Although, you know, if the good guys can show up as ghosts
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.000]  and help guide other good guys, like Obi-Wan and Yoda did with Luke,
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  maybe there's something to the Emperor
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  was able to do the same thing to restart.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  Well, and the other thing too,
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  the whole thing with there's only two at a time,
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  a dumb rule.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  That's a dumb rule.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  And it was clearly already broken.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  They just didn't call them Sith.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  Like, they were already, you know, there was the video game.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  I mean, again, what's canon and what's not anymore
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  is up to for date.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  But there was the one,
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  I think it was actually called,
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  it wasn't a call like the secret apprentice,
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  or Vader had a secret apprentice.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  You probably played the force unleashed.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  Right.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  So he had a secret apprentice.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  And you know, even if you'd say,
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  well, a video game isn't canon.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  I think the Clone Wars show is,
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  and, you know, there was Osage Ventress,
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  who was like a secret apprentice to Dooku.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  So there were, you know,
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  there's a established idea
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  that there are Sith-like force users
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  who are trained by the Sith,
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  who just aren't called Sith,
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  and use red light sabers.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And, you know, it could just be one of them.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  I would say that,
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  because what we get the always two thing,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  it's from that line of dialogue from Yoda.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  Right.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  This is always two, there are.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  And I think that the more,
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  I don't know, forgiving reading of that line would be,
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  that what he meant was,
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  there's always gonna be more,
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  if we see one,
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  there's gotta be another one.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  Right.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  Because it's always a master an apprentice.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  Not that there are only two exactly two,
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  but there are always at least two.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  There are always common pairs.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  Right.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  Right.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  Like, we've seen this one, dude,
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  there's gonna be another dude.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  We don't know if this is the master of the apprentice,
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  but there's gonna,
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  another dude.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  It just seems,
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  like you said,
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  it's such a stupid role,
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  that if they're,
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  if their goal was to overthrow the Jedi Order,
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  there's hundreds of them.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  All right.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  We're gonna overthrow these guys,
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  and we're only gonna have two of us.
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  Do you think,
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  like, somewhere along the way,
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  as they're passing down the stories?
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  Like, one of the guys,
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  when he's training his new apprentice,
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  maybe just leave out the part
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  where everybody before you,
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  including you,
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  has killed their master,
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  they just leave that out of the history
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  so that you don't plant that idea,
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  or apprentice's end.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  Cause to me,
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  I'd be like, you know what,
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  fuck it, I'm not training an apprentice.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  I'm just, I'll be the last one.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  I'll live forever.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's gonna be great.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  I think it's cause,
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  I think the idea there was that they always,
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  you know,
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  that each one of them is so arrogant
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  and so confident in their,
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  you know, dominance over their apprentice,
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  that they're,
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  they always think that this can't happen to me.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  But when you're like the 300th one,
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  and you know,
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  you know from history
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  that that's always gone the other direction,
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  that's not a reasonable thing to think anymore.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  Right.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  It's like,
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  I know you and I trust you,
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  but if I knew that,
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  if I knew that the last 30 people
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  who hired a,
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  you,
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  you,
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  you,
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  you,
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  I designed her to work with them,
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  got killed by them.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Like,
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  it really,
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  I'm pretty sure that you're,
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  I trust you,
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  you seem like a non psychopath,
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  you seem like a friend.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  But I probably wouldn't,
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  I probably decided
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  not to hire a UI designer.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  Right?
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  It would be a good choice.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  Here they are to go wrong.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Right.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  Like do you think in,
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  in like,
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  sith orientation?
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  Is there like a,
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  okay,
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  well here's,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  here's the story of how literally everyone
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  before you has killed their master,
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  including me,
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  but don't do that.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  Please.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Please.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  What else happens in the trailer?
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  We see some stormtroopers,
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  X wings.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Yeah,
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  the new stormtroopers.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  And that's,
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  I think notable,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  that says a lot about the movie
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  and the time period
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  and the attitude of the movie
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  that we see stormtroopers
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  where at some point
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  in the last 30 years
[56:05.000 --> 56:06.000]  in a galaxy far,
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  far away,
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  not only is the empire still going,
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  they've hired some industrial designers
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  to come in
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  and reduce them shit.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Yeah,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  it seems like a slightly tweaked
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  stormtroopers.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  Like,
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  yeah,
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  it's not,
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  it's not a huge departure,
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  like they feel like stormtroopers.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  But in some way
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  that the clone troopers kind of feel like
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  stormtroopers,
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  but more just on the other side of it.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Like there hasn't been,
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  even though it's been a longer period of time,
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  it seems like there's been less advancement,
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  which is what you would expect
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  from an empire that's lost their emperor.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  But there's still,
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  you know,
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  there's still designers working out
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  costume details
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  and maybe there's some new ships and stuff,
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  but notably the tie fighters we see.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Look,
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  yeah,
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  they look like tie fighters.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  Yeah,
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  they look like tie fighters.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  The X wings we see
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  look pretty much like X wings
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  with a little bit of advancement.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  And so in the same way that
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  original trilogy,
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  the universe felt lived in.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Like everything had carbon scoring on
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  everything was a little broken,
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  a little bit shitty.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  It kind of seems like we're,
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  we're on an upswing.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  Like the economy's getting better,
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  but it hasn't turned around.
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  So what,
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  like there's been a long period
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  where things still kind of sucked
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  and there wasn't a lot of technological advancement,
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  which is what I would expect
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  to have happen there.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  And it feels authentic.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Yeah,
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  my,
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  my read just based on the teaser
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  is that the,
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  the tremendous victory
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  of both blowing up a second Death Star
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  and killing the Emperor and Vader.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  And leaving the entire,
[57:34.000 --> 57:34.000]  you know,
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  which presumably the entire,
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  you know,
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  leadership structure
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  of the Empire was,
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  you know,
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  based on the Emperor's extraordinary,
[57:43.000 --> 57:43.000]  you know,
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  abilities.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  Has crippled the Empire,
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  but like didn't defeat them.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  They were still in it.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  You know,
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  the entire vast imperial army,
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  their military remained loyal
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  to the cause of the Empire.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  And that the rebel is,
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  the rebellion is still,
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  still like the scrappy upstart
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  planets that are fighting against them.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  So like,
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  it may be like knock them,
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  knocked it down,
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  said that they were on even terms,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  and it's been like a 30 year war of attrition.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  Oh, that's interesting.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  That's my read from the,
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  from the teaser.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  Yeah.
[58:16.000 --> 58:16.000]  Yeah.
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  I could get that.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  And maybe,
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  like,
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.000]  not,
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  not necessarily that the Empire's got their back up against a wall,
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  but more that they had to decentralize leadership or something.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Or maybe somebody stepped in and there's a,
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  and lost so many resources that they're no longer,
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.000]  they're no longer advancing at the extreme pace that they were.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  Well, we last saw them, right?
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  Like when we last saw them,
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  they went in just 20 years
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  from the prequel trilogy to the,
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  to the original trilogy.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  They went from those Republic star ships we saw in the clone wars
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  to the star destroyers and tie fighters,
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  you know, that we see,
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  you know,
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  lots of technical advancement in their starship design
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  and armored design in 20 years.
[59:01.000 --> 59:02.000]  But now in 30 years,
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  they've made very little progress at all.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  And the rebellion hasn't really either
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  because they're still, you know, up against it.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  That's my read.
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  But they still had time to redesign the stormtrooper outfits.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  Not really redesign.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  I would say it was more like a,
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  like a dot one, like a, like a point release.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Yeah, like a 1.1 releases of the armor.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  And there could have been like some kind of necessity there.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  Like maybe they just ran out of that armor.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  I'm a little surprised that the tie fighters
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  look exactly the same though
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  because I always thought as a kid
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  based on Return of the Jedi,
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  like when the tie interceptors came out
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  which were much more like,
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  like Vader's prototype from 1977
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  with like the,
[59:44.000 --> 59:49.000]  yeah, with the, you know, the curved wings,
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  like the three panel,
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  almost like octagonal wings.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  The bombers had that too.
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  I thought that the tie interceptors were like the new models
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.000]  that were coming in,
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  but who knows what the explanation is.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Maybe they're more explicit.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Maybe I'm just taking the economics of video games
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  where in the games,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  any of like the,
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  like the X-Wing tie fighter games,
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  the tie fighter has no shields
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  and just kind of sucks.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  But the tie interceptor has shields
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  and I said that one or the advance,
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  one of them it can even go to light speed.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And it just seemed to me that will just stop
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  using the tie fighters.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  They have no shields.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Like you're just sending people to their death with those next.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Yeah, they went for a quantity over quality approach.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  We'd rather have 100 tie fighters than 10,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  even you know, X-Wing's.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Well, it's clearly the mark of a military
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  that doesn't feel like it has much in the way of opposition.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  The tie fighters were there to show off how many they had.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  It to like just be an imposing presence.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Right.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  And they were not designed for real battle.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Right.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And they didn't really even value the lives of their own troops.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  Yeah, because everybody was the empire.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  So we'll just replace him.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Maybe even at the time,
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  maybe they were still using clones for some of the stuff.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  I thought the other one of the other interesting things
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  is that none of the shots of the ships are in space.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  That when you see the X-Wing's, they're flying really low,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  like almost right above the surface of some body of water.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  And when we see the Falcon and the tie fighters coming at it,
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  it's right above the surface of the planet.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  It just now occurs to me.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  You're right.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  So we've got a teaser for a movie called Star Wars
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  that doesn't show a single star.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Right.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I don't think it did.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Well, maybe there's at the end
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  when the credit comes up, it shows a star field
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  when the logo comes up.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  But we don't see any footage of space.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Right.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  We don't see any big space cruisers.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We don't see any star destroyers
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  or whatever the republic has.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Well, I hope nothing happened to space.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Pretty cool.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  What do you think about the idea that they didn't show any of the,
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  that the only face they show is the new character,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  the black guy in the Stormtrooper outfit?
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  What's it, the actor's name?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Oh, I forget.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  I forget.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Somebody that I hadn't heard of before.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  British dude.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I think it's, I want to believe,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I sincerely want to believe that everything about this teaser
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  was a well thought out decision.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  John Boughuega.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  I want to believe that everything we were showing,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  we were showing for a reason.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  I want to believe that not only were we not shown,
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  well, no, the other face we see is the,
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  the girl riding on the, right?
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Right there.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Who, just looking at her,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  she's got like a real,
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Natalie Portman, Carrie Fisher kind of look.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  And so it wouldn't be a big jump.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  I think most people are assuming that she must be like
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Hanan Leia's kid.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  But the characters we see,
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  the faces we do see,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  the, they're new characters.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  These are people we have no idea who they are.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  This isn't Harrison Ford.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  This isn't Mark Hamill.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  It says to me that they,
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  they want our expectation going in to be
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  that we're going to be exposed to new things,
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  not just fan service rehashing of old stuff.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Yeah.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  That said,
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  it ends with a shot of the Millennium Falcon right as we hear
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  the, the John Williams score fanfare swell up.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  So again, it feels a little like,
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  show us the, show us the things that are going to get us
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  interested and give us a sense of what we should expect
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  from the movie,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  which I think is going to be,
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  this is a familiar world,
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  but we're going to be meeting new people.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  We're going to be taking things beyond what you,
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  what you've seen before.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And then ending it on a note of,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  literally on a note of,
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  here's what,
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  here's what we know you came in hoping to say.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  My favorite,
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  you remember this,
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  I don't know if you remember this.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  It was,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  when,
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  when were the original,
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  that when did the special editions come out?
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  It was like,
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  97, 97.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  I remember,
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  when the trailer for that,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  or teaser came out for that,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  it was really good teaser.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  It was,
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  in the theater,
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  and it was like,
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  it showed a TV,
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  and it was like for,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  you know,
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  for a generation kids,
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  you know,
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  people have only seen Star Wars trilogy on,
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  on the,
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  you know,
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  you know,
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  TV set.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And then an X-Wing,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  blew up the TV set.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  It like,
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  it ends up the TV set was an outer space,
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  and an X-Wing flew by
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  and like blew it up.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  It sounds really cheesy
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  when you describe it,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  man,
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  but the time it was powerful.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  No,
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  but like somebody at like,
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  you know,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  ILM did it right.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Like it looked right.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  It didn't.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Well, I mean,
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  just conceptually,
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  just the idea of a X-Wing
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  blowing up a TV,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  it just sounds dumb.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  How did that ever get past the,
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  the first pitch meeting?
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  It sounds like something
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  that you would do like in the
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Terry Gilliam style
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  from,
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  you know,
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  it would just be silly,
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  but the giant foot squishes it.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Yeah,
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  somehow worked,
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  because it was just like,
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  we're not going to show you any of it yet.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  We're just going to let you know,
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  you're going to see it on a big
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  ass screen.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Which is really all you need to know.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Yeah,
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  even for what it was,
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  we can say,
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  there's a lot that could be said
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  about the special editions.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  The,
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  the idea of the things
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  were put into the movie
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  to make it better,
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  to enhance it for,
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  to make it feel
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  more modern,
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  to clean it up.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  That was exciting.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  I think the execution
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  was terrible,
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  but the idea was really,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  that you'd get like a really
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  crisp clean print,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  and they cleaned it up,
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  and the blacks would be blacker,
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  and the lines would be cleaner.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  That sounded great.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  If that meant
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  that we had to sit
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  through a couple of extra
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  do-backs,
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and the tattooing
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Stormtrooper scene,
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  then fine,
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  whatever,
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  some of them are okay.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  I don't want to get into it,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  but I mean,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  it's like my basic feeling,
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  I didn't,
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  I don't have any kind of
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  purity,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  you know,
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  it has to be exactly like what you saw
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  in 1977,
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  or it's,
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  you know,
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  it doesn't count.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  I wasn't opposed to any,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  it's minor tweaks,
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  but some of them are just so stupid.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  I mean,
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  the first thing is right.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Right.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  If you get rid of that
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  awful job of seeing
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  and you get rid of any time,
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  any time you digitally move Han Solo,
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  any time here
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  some Ford is on screen
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  and they digitally alter
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  anything,
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  take those out
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  and put them back the way they were,
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  and the rest of it I'm fine with.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  It should have been,
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  it should have been limited
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  to things that only true
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  obsessives would even notice,
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  that you'd almost
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  have to see it side by side
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  to notice it.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  Like,
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  oh, there was only one
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  due back back
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  and then now there's a couple.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  But anyway,
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  the,
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  what's even called,
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  the monster,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  the big animal thing
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  on,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  in most eyesly,
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  that the job
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  will falls off of.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Like,
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  even that was kind of okay.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  Like, it didn't,
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  it didn't take me out of the movie.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  It was kind of silly,
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  but it didn't offend me.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  I remember liking some,
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  like,
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  I thought like the way
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  that they spruced up
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  cloud city,
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  best been in,
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Empire Strikes Back
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  where there was more stuff
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  going on outside
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  the windows.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  I mean,
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  if you're more alive,
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  unless like
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  I'm at painting.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  And it is in hindsight,
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  you know,
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  outside the windows
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  and the original felt,
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  felt a little cheap.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  I don't know.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  But yeah.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Like,
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  like it felt like
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  you're there on a set.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Right.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  But you know,
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  I don't know.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I still think,
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I think even the
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  jaw wall falling off,
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  though,
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  anything that's like a gag
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  is too much.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  You know,
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  you didn't need it.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  But anyway,
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  that's,
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  that's neither here
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  nor there.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  It was a good,
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  the best thing
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  about the special editions,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  though,
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  is that it let us know
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  that George Lucas
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  had lost his mind
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  and it,
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  I think it's set
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  expectations
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  for the new trilogy
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  accordingly.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  So I know still managed
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  to be disappointed.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  I think the reaction
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  to Phantom Menace
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  would have been even more heartbreaking.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  I think there would have been people
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  jumping on buildings
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  if it had come out
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  it dropped out of the blue
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  without the special editions.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Like the special editions,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  if the special editions
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  didn't make everybody's feel
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  like there was a disturbance
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  in the force
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  then you're not hooked up right.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  I remember when Phantom Menace
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  came out,
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  opening day,
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  I went and saw it in the theater
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  and I walked out
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  and me
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  and my friends
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  and everybody else
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  came outside the theater,
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  everybody was really excited.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Everybody enjoyed it.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Yeah, I did too.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  It weren't bad.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  They're, you know,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  I've said this before.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  They're not terrible.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  They're only significantly
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  worse compared to the original trilogy.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  And I see lots and lots
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  of action movies,
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  you know,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  the type of movies
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  where there are things
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  like laser guns
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  and chase scenes
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  and superhero powers
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  and stuff like that.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  And the prequel trilogy
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  is way better
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  than almost all of them.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  It's way better
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  than typical stuff
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  than I see.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  You know,
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  it's maybe
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  better than typical.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  I was going
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  to go the other direction
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  though.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I was going to say
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  that it wasn't that
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Phantom Menace
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  was a good movie
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  or even necessarily
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  a passable movie.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I think that it's people
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  went into that theater
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  so fully prepared
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  to be excited
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  that they could not
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  emotionally handle
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  the movie they actually saw
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  and so they had to walk
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  out feeling good about it.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  And it wasn't until
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  maybe the next morning
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  when we all woke up
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  and we got in the shower
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  and we get out.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  We still don't quite feel
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  clean
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  but it starts to dawn on us
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  that that was a really terrible thing
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  that just happened.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Now, I remember thinking
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  as I watched
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  I didn't come out thinking
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  it was a bad movie
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  and I still don't think
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  it's a bad movie
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  but the parts that were
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  that were worst
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  were so obviously bad
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  right away.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  But you don't think
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  it's a bad movie?
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I don't.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  I think it's
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  like it's a minus-action movie.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  It's supposed to be
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  a kids movie
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  and it all centers around
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  trade negotiations.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  But they don't spend too
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  much time.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  I agree it's stupid.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  I remember thinking
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  at the time
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  why are they going on on this?
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And I still don't really
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  know what happened
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  in that movie.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  And I also think
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  that it's suffered
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  from some fundamental
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  big picture
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  problems like establishing
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  which sides
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  the good guys, which sides
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  the bad guys.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Like that awesome
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  incredible clarity
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  the way that the empire
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  was almost
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Nazi deliberately.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  I mean,
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  the helmet design
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  for Vader
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  comes from
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  one of the inspirations
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  is a Nazi helmet.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  The lack of clarity
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  is that the whole trilogy
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  suffers from that.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  And it's all based
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  on the stupid cockamomie
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  idea that the emperor
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  was more or less
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  trumped up the whole war
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  on false charges
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  and there was no
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  good guys or bad guys.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And it just makes
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  the movie less enjoyable
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  as popcorn thriller.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Like if you're going
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  to make a popcorn movie
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  you want to have
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  crisply, clearly
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  defined good guys bad guys,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  not any kind of
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  ambiguity in that area.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Yeah, you should
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  you should know who's
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  who.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Right.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  And who's fighting
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  with whom?
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Why are they fighting
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  the droids?
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  And every time
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  we meet somebody interesting
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  they almost immediately
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  die.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Seriously,
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Darth Maul,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  we get to meet that guy
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  we're excited
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  and then he gets
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  gotten half.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  I kind of,
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  I had a feeling
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  that he was going
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  to go down
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  because he didn't
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  talk enough.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  The fact that
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  we don't
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  made it feel
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  like they were
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  setting us up for that.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Yeah,
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  we're all super excited
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  about Darth Maul
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  and then he's barely
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  in the movie
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and when he's
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  in the movie
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  he's awesome
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  and then he dies.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Yeah,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  the best good guy
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  in the movie
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  is quite gone too
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  because Obi-Wan
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  had such a limited
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  part in the movie.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Like our hero,
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  the only thing
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  we can
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  like even remotely
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  attached to emotionally
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  he dies.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  But then to me
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  the thing
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  that stuck out
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  the most about
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  that movie
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  originally
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  and instantly
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  the first,
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  you know,
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  and I saw it
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  on opening
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  day too
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  was the whole
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  opening the
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  can of warms
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  to me
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  the thing
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  with the mid-aclorience
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  thing is
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  it really made
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  the movie would
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  only make sense
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  if you found
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  out that,
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  you know,
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  due to some
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  way that the contracts
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  were written
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  for the movies
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  the 20th century
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Fox held the rights
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  to make prequels
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  and George Lucas
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  wanted nothing
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  to do with it
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  but he didn't
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  have the
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  legal ability
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  to do it
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  and so 20th
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  century Fox
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  went ahead
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  and made
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  this prequel
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  trilogy
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  without George
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Lucas's
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  approval
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  or insight
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  or input
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  and they handed it
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  to a bunch of people
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  who had no idea
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  what it
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  who didn't really understand
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  what made the original
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  the original trilogy
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  what it was
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  right
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  so they've got to drop
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  like the emperor
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  from a helicopter
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  and I can't call anything
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  specter
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  right
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  what made the original trilogy
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  so great
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  was that it
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  explained so little
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  and it was built
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  you know,
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  it felt like you're
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  seeing a two-hour snippet
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  of something that
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  could have been
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  80 hours
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  and they never
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  they just told you
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  your father's
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  fought
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  and the clone wars
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  never told you what it was
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  just sounds
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  like a cool name
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  for a science fiction war
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  your father fought
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  in the clone wars
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  they don't even
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  there's no explanation
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  for it
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  that's all they say
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  and that's the best
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  explanation
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  it just sounds
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  like it
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  fills out the world
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  it makes the world
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  seem so much bigger
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  there's a real history
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  in this world
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  and then the new one
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  is just
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  filling in
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  it's just
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  explaining all
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  the mysteries
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  from the first trilogy
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and creating
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  no new mysteries
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  of its own
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  like no
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  uh
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  like if it had
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  been done successfully
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  you know in a way
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  that people wanted
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  a prequel trilogy
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  like when people heard
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  that the new star wars
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  trilogy was going to be
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  a prequel rather than a
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  sequel
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  and it was going to
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  go back in time
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  rather than forward
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  it sounded exciting
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  right everybody
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  was in favor of the
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  general idea
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  because the first trilogy
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  had opened up all these
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  mysteries that everybody
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  wanted answered
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  or at least that they thought
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  they wanted answered
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  the only way that prequel
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  trilogy would have
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  worked was if
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  the prequel trilogy
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  had itself
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  left
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  left
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  it left it open
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  that wow i'd like to go back
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  another thirty years
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  in time
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  and see what happened
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  that right there should have
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  been just as many
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  mysteries about what had
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  led up to the prequel
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  trilogy
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  as there was in the
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  original trilogy
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  yeah right now
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  in in my mind
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  the chronology
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  of the star wars
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  universes
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  all the stuff that happened
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  in the original trilogy
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  uh
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  and then all the stuff that happened
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  in the prequel trilogy
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  and before that was like
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  i don't know
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  ten thousand years ago
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  with the jedi order formed
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  yeah maybe
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  there's some stuff that happened
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  then i don't really care
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and instead we got like an explanation for the force that makes it sound as though if you
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  gave a jedi a blood transfusion
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  he'd lose his powers
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  right
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  right
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  but
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  now now there's a thing you could physically take away from somebody
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  right they have like a device that you could like stick the
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  the kid's hand and it comes up with a number
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  like you're taking a standardized test
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  but what seems like the only reason to do that as a writer the only reason to do that is to explain
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  how they were able to
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  like you have to have some way of showing that and it can test off the charts
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  i guess but it's why not just say you sense it
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  right i'm not saying that did the handled it well i'm not saying it was a good decision i'm just saying
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  that's got to be that's the only thing i could think of the the Lucas said
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  okay well i got to solve this problem here's how i'll do it
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  well it was a pretty hand-pisted way
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  and it's totally not cinematic
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  cinematic would have way would have been
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  to do something that was physical like make him
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  like a test of how many you know how heavy a thing he could levitate
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  or something like that right or do it like yeah
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  yeah like like yoda and Luke in the swamp on digabaw
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  when he has to lift up the exping or when he goes into the cave
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and he fights vader who turns out to be him like give us a nice call back to that
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  that would be the way to handle that's how they did it with Luke
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  it was good enough for Luke
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  speaking of yoda let me tell you about our good friends at square space
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  i can see that connection

[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  for building websites

[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  and part of the thing that makes the new square space seven interface
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  so much better than what came before and it really has always been a good interface for a while

[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  really really visual and amazing degree of customizability
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  without any kind of technical coding acumen
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  but if you do want to get in there if you do have coding level

[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  the thing I dig about Squarespace is
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  their templates are great it's really easy to use
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  even like when I go to a Squarespace site
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  I can rarely tell that it's Squarespace
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  which is sort of the mark of
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  yeah templates done well as they don't all look the same doesn't have that sort of
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  gross oh well this guy just uses and it kind of feels like
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  almost almost the platonic ideal of what they wanted
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  what apple wanted iWeb to be yeah anybody can anybody can just make a website now
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  we've all been empowered we can all start a blog we can all start a podcast
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  or whatever like we can just put your stuff here
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  you know I have to really think about it but it's also cool that
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  they sponsor everything
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  we can't we joke about this
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  it's become like kind of a cliche sponsored by Squarespace but the truth is
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  we can make fun of that but how cool is it that we have a company like that
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  this is doing really cool stuff and they're also kind of a
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  a patron to the arts
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  I've thought about that a lot because you know
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  they sponsored my website enough and I certainly sponsored this
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  the talk show enough that it's occurred to me like
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  how is it possible that they can keep sponsoring
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  and you know a lot of the shows I listen to are sponsored by them
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  I've thought about it and it in some sense I think
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  it can be explained by the fact that they've
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  their company that's embraced the modern media world
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  meaning you know like the post PC world of devices like the post
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  internet world of media where you know in the old days your big
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  budget for advertising would go to print and TV
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  well probably I should list TV first TV and then print
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  in the world you know in the old world and TV commercials
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  are super expensive they're super expensive to produce
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  and they're super expensive to buy at least if you're going to
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  put in front you know get a large number of people to listen
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  I think it makes total spent sense for them because I think that they're
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  much more targeted like I've seen Squarespace ads on TV
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  they have TV ads I mean they definitely have a huge
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  ad budget I've seen them on the subway too
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  yeah but people who listen to podcasts of any kind
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  let alone technical podcasts are so much more likely to be the sort
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  of people who are going to build a website of any kind
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  that it's a better way to target at you know
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  you know far less money than you would pay to get an ad in
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  you know a New Yorker or something like that
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  yeah so Spectre
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  Spectre the title of the the 24th Bond movie
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  they had a they had a press conference today in London
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  this was all a huge surprise to me I mean maybe I'm just not paying
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  enough attention but I had no idea this was coming this
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  this came out of nowhere yes yeah I knew that I've tried to
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  stay as spoiler-free as I could but I knew that there was a new one
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  coming out a new Sam Mendez had been resigned to come back
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  even though he he didn't swear it wasn't like I'd never say
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  never again thing where he said I'm never going to do another one
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  but he was pretty adamant that he only wanted to direct one
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  you know because he does so many other things you know
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  and he you know not just other movies but he you know
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  does theater and stuff like that and in fact
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  I don't square space yeah the production of the movie
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  was actually set back because I think it would have
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  they would have been further ahead already if they hadn't been waiting
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  for Mendez because he had it maybe that's why it only
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  took a year he had a play in London that he was directing
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  and you know and directing a play is you know I don't know
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  it's a weird thing because you know it's the opposite
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  of a movie like as soon as you get a scene right in a movie
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  you move on whereas in a play you're doing it
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  night after night after night but you know
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Skyfall was but such a box office and critical success
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  that it you know it was almost inevitable that they
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  would get him to come back I think they you know
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  more or less had to make him an offer he couldn't refuse
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  and he brought back like the same writing team
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  in the same I would go at the same production team
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  yeah that kind of worries me though because I actually
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  think that I know like I said the header of the show
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  that I didn't do and I'm not going to do a whole two-hour
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  thing on Skyfall but the more time goes on and the more
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  Skyfall settles in the the less I like it you start to
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  see the seams I feel like it's a really it's kind of a poorly
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  written film that was made extraordinarily well like
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  it's it's well cast the cast is perfect the look is very
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  good it has a good feel the and you know that just the
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  it's just such a great cast you know Harvey Harvey
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Harvey Bartham is so good as a Bond villain it's
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  such you know Roger Deacon's does such amazing cinematography
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  it's just a gorgeous gorgeous film and it so clearly
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  made by people who love the at least the you know
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  the bond movies have varied so much over the 50 years
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  of course but they would it's so clearly made by people
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  who love the things about bond that I love about bond
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  it felt like a love letter to bond yeah yeah and a well
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  done one the group yeah you know it makes here's the
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  here's an example it makes no logical sense but I like
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  it's just one of the things that I thought was perfect
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  movie is the way that when bond wants to
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  it's the car that the MI6 could track he gets the old
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  DB5 and it makes no because nobody would notice that
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  well and and even makes and even makes that joke that yeah
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  this is certainly inconspicuous and it also makes no sense
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  in the sense that it's a reboot of bond you know the
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  whole starting with casino royale it's a read right and
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  whatever that car even comes from whatever the vague
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  rules of continuity were before and and then you know up
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  until then it was sort of a hand wavy sort of continuity
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  between bond movies you know where it was sort of insinuated
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  that it was one guy who had done all these things even if
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  it was played by different actors well you say that but
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  Lazenby accounts you know well no no no I mean the that opening
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  scene in on a majesty yeah on a majesty circuit service
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  he gets in that fight on the beach and he turns and he
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  looks at the camera that never would have happened to the
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  other fellow oh yeah that never happened to the to the other
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's just it's just part and
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  again we get into two hour on her majesty
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  see it's clearly the most divisive of all the bond
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  movies in my opinion because it's either somebody's reason
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  people either hate it or love it and I I have good friends
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  whose whose taste in movies I generally agree with in large
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  measures who swear up and down that it's the best bond
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  movie what yeah oh name names that aren't
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Nat yeah really that I that's he's such a smart guy
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  you can just google it you can find lots of people who
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  make the argument film crit hulk loved it
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  yeah read film crit hulk did you read film crit hulk's
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  bond treatise no he reviewed he wrote like a massive thing
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  it almost like a like a booklet almost like a booklet
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  like thing where he reviewed every single bond movie
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  this this is fascinating and I don't know if he said
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  it was his very favorite but he at least said it was if
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  not it was very close I think the the get punch at the
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  very end was good I think that makes the movie worth it I
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  don't know if I'd say it's good certainly not the
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  best no but it's but it's so stupid that it makes no sense
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  that blowfeld was left alive there was a Bob Bob
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  sled chase with gunfire and and blowfeld's Bob
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  sled like overturns or whatever and bonds at the bottom
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  and what he doesn't go up there double check that
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  but he just assumes that he's dead it doesn't make any sense
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  I felt like I feel like he deserved to have his wife killed
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  by like there was no that's harsh there was no
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  cockamami you know way that he disappeared off a cliff
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  and maybe he had a you know parachute or something
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  or some secret escape or something like that he just
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  wanted to rookie move yeah he just didn't go and
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  check yeah like he's never seen a good he's never seen a
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  movie I guess yeah so what do you think of the title
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  I think in the same way that I want to believe the
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  JJ Abrams picked every shot in the Star Wars teaser for a reason
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  I have to believe I want to believe that that title is very
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  very intentional yeah that title is them not just saying
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  hey we got the right to use this name we're going to bring
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  some back whatever but like they're trying to say in the same
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  way that that at the end of Skyfall you hear money penny
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  yeah you hear that name that means something and you see
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Ray finds coming in as M and you see on the back of the office
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  door that that leather door right they're just like from the
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  movies it kind of right now we're in this place where the bond
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  movies the country of the bond movies is Luke it looks like
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  yeah I even he even I got I wrote on during Fireball
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  he's just Ray finds M is a very Bernard lead like M you know
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  now there's obviously a different dynamic because Ray
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  finds is clearly not that much older than Daniel Craig
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  and he's new as M whereas in the old bond movies it
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  always and and in the novels both in the movies and the
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  novels it there's an idea that M at M has been there forever
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  you know that he's been there for a lot he's been in charge of
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  M I 6 for a long time right it's a kind of a paternal
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  relationship yeah that yes exactly there it's in fact it's in
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  the novels at least I think it even is it even says so
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  explicitly that it's like a paternal relationship and you
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  can kind of see it in the movies yeah what the like the
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  thing with the gun the the the the the oh God what was the
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  what was the gun that he originally had the one that in the
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  original quartermaster comes in and says it's it would be
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  good for a lady yeah there's the argument about the
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  and I had a bread and he gave me for not knowing this but yeah
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  the the question of he was supposed to be using the other
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  gun and he's like he's very steadfast that like no this is
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  I think he should be carried a Beretta and the quartermaster
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  and M insisted that he switched to the Walter PPK was it
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  was it was it yeah was a Beretta it was a Beretta yeah
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  but the argument about that it never felt to me like this was
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  bond sticking to what he knew and what he liked so much as it
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  was it was kind of him sticking it to M but he was being
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  it felt like a little bit of youthful teenage rebellion yeah
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  it's a little bit of a little bit of calm a little bit of calm
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  be there.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  Major booth right boot right the backstory on that is that
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  there was a guy who was like a weapons expert who wrote to
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Ian Fleming after one of the novels and he said look I love
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  these novels I'm big fan but I've got to tell you your choice
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  of weapon for this guy is is is pretty poor this is a this
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  gun as terrible stopping power it's you know there's there's
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  nothing to recommend it over you know for this and for the
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  serious business that he gets into he ought to carry you know
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  like a something something else and so Ian Fleming wrote
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  him back and with like a thank you thank you this was one
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  you know wonderful feedback and then named a character after the
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  guy as like an honor for him.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  Did you watch the I think it was the BBC
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  Fleming the man who would be bond you know I have it in my notes
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  and talk to you about that I I this was might have been a year
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  ago where me and you and Brent were somehow like in a back
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  channel you know with Q branch our soft you know Q branch our
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  software thing you guys had watched it and recommended it and
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  well well Brent was he watched the first episode and recommended
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  that we watch it but said it was terrible and so I watched it and
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  I strongly disagreed with his assessment I put it on my I put
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  it on my list of things to watch and then it was like I hit one
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  of those like June 30th it was there on July 1st it wasn't
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  it was gone from Netflix and I thought and I remember
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  especially I don't think it was on iTunes either or it should be
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  on I think well maybe I don't know but at the time a year in the
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  15 dollars but it was like well it anyway it's right now as we
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  speak in in December 2014 it's back on Netflix and oddly enough
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  I actually started watching it like four nights ago how far
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  are you three out of four what do you think I'm making that
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  gesture with my hand that's like you know like so so like I'm
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  glad it exists and I am enjoying it but it feels like a BBC
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  TV show not like a movie the that attitude of I like it I'm
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  enjoying it I'm glad it exists but it's not great is kind of I
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  mean the the worst bond movies are still enjoyable and
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  there's there's twenty four of them yeah so there's
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  gonna be good ones there's gonna be bad ones but even the
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  worst of the bond movies even if you really hate never say
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  never again you really hate majesty secret service you still
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  enjoy watching it still a bond movie and what the show
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  felt like to me was not so much like a biopic about
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  Fleming as it was kind of kind of a semi sort of maybe a
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  little bit sanctioned prequel maybe I read it as this and
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  it's right there in the title the man who would be bond so
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  it feels to me like this is the template for bond by the way
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:57.500]  I think you just grew bird the word BIO PIC I've always said
[1:31:57.500 --> 1:32:03.000]  it biopic like biography picture biopic biopic would be
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  like if it was like a disease over the eye or something
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  all let's let's find this out BIO like I like that you call it a
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  group right I'm gonna let's look this up now I want to know
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  well my problem with looking up emphasis and maybe this is why
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  so many words is I don't know how to read the diocritical
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  marks and there's like three or four different systems of
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  diocritical marks to show you how to like pronounce a word
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  nor the emphasis because I don't I don't understand any of them
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  once like all those Schwoz and everything start showing up I don't
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  well this is what the internet is for yeah it'll you can just
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  listen a little audio clip here here's one
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  biopic oh you're right yeah it's a yeah it's a bio and a picture
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  so it's a biopic bio I biopic to me sounds like somebody
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  taking photographs in the bathroom I just think it's industry
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  lingo you know yeah yeah I get chick flick I've learned something
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  to the biopic and see if you had said biopic I would have called
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  you out on that yeah I had I had I and I I you know
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  Jack whenever I hear somebody pronounce a word differently than
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  I have pronounced it my entire life I generally assume
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  I generally assume that I've just learned something because it's
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  usually a safe bet like you know it's like with the sit thing
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  like you get you mispronounce enough words that you've read
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  visually but never pronounced enough and you're almost always
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  wrong you start to assume that if I pronounce it differently I'm
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  wrong did you mispronounce it no but in the way that like you pointed
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  out that maybe if you go
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  getting done information if you killed if you're a
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Sith apprentice and you just killed your master to become
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  the master maybe you don't take an apprentice if you realize
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  that you're completing like a thousand generation chain of
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  that happening you know over and over again every time if you're
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  the new guy thirty years later you've got no idea how to pronounce
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  metacolorians did you see the thing where the the poster
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  that they unveiled and there's a cool little movie they have
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  to where it just shows the the the name specter being like animated
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  it was yeah it almost like the in the bullet in the glass it
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  almost reminds me of the did you see you saw it at singleton
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  too but you see Dave Addy's post yeah on the opening credits
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  of alien yeah it's sort of that same sort of effect where
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  the word specter is revealed piece by piece in the letters
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  it and it's just a how like the type nerd in me and the bond
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  nerd in me for being it was like maybe twenty seconds of
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  video that shows you nothing it felt really good watching
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  yeah and the way that you see you mentioned did you just
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  mentioned that the logo looks like the old specter look
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  or the broken glass underneath the yeah there's the bullet
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  like a bolt to the glass but the way the glass shatters there's
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  there's the like the tentacles like the Hydra style
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  but the specter logo middle of the the Hydra meaning
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  that the the Hydra logo from the Marvel universe
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  and the specter logo all right share some visual
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  similarities right but the idea behind the logo is
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  that it's like a multi tentacle organization that you
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  know you can't you know kill one tentacle and still got
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  other seven ones around the world or whatever you
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  cut off one head and two martial appear so
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  so it's most interesting casting to me is Kristoff Walt
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  as oh yeah I mean there's there's there's lots of
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  good all the news and casting is good news but but
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Kristoff Walt's that's that's like now we got a
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  fucking movie yeah it's funny it's and it seems like
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  they've really in and there's what's his name the
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  guy from Guardians of the Galaxy it's David Batista
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  yeah is Mr. Hinks which is so obviously it's so
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  old-school bond henchmen I mean you know look at the
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  guy yeah it's got to be like a criminal henchmen
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  but the name Mr. Hinks sounds perfect but it's
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  totally taken it back like you know to to Connery
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  and more era bond you know it's got a little bit
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  of camp in it which is that's that's kind of what
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  made bond fun then will it work now I don't know so
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  the speculation has been there have been rumors and
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  again I've tried to avoid them but you know I
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  think everybody now that they're calling the
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  movie Spectre it's not spoiling anything that
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  there were rumors that Kristoff Walt's was going
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  to play blowfeld for a while you're saying you didn't
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  see those rumors the the name that what was the name
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  they gave him for him and their announcement
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  they've saying he's playing a character named
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Oberhauser yeah which if you Google that name I
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  Google it because I wanted to find out what it meant
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  in German because I thought maybe that was a hint at
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  something because I kind of had it just has the
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  code name for a character this isn't the
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  character's real name and if you Google that name
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  it's the name of this like Nazi general who is
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  tried for war crimes after World War 2 like this is
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  very famous Nazi and to me that's that's so
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  over the top that it can't possibly be a real
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  character's name that has to be masking something
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  yeah I think he's blowfeld
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  if you're going to bring back if you're going to bring
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  back Spectre you might as well bring back
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  blowfeld I mean you can make the argument that
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  you're going to bring back Spectre and then blowfeld
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  is revealed in the next movie in the same way that
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  you got hints of Spectre maybe even glimpses of
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  blowfeld in even like as far back as Dr. No you don't
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  really get to see Blowfeld until two or three
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  movies in four movies for yeah for movies in or
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  five five it was so first movie was Dr. No and
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  Blowfeld was a guy and you saw him from behind a
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  chair and he had the cat but you never saw his face
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  and in Russia with love you saw him in that
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  secret meeting room where he was behind
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Phoenician blinds so you still couldn't see his face
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  and he like that was where he unveiled that
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  was where they unveiled the the gag that
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Dr. Evil used where he had like a board room table
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  and he could hit right right to kill a guy
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  and then he was an in gold finger
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  he wasn't in gold finger gold finger and gold finger had
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  nothing to do with the Spectre and then in the next
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  the next movie was Thunderball which was a
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Spectre plot to steal a nuclear missile
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  but Blowfeld I don't even know if he was even
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  pictured in it it was Largo the guy with the
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  eye patch was the head operative of the
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  mission oh I think maybe we saw him I don't
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  think we even see him in Thunderball I don't
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  even think he makes a blowfeld in like you
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  don't get to see his face but he's there
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  I think that Largo is the only guy
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  and then the next movie is you only live twice
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  and that's where we finally see him
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  and he's played by David Pleasant
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  the the the and it's the one
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  everybody remembers it's the guy the
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  bald guy with the scarred face
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  right in the in the crazy suit
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  right the like you know the Dr. Evil
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  the Dr. Evil look I want to say we
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  saw him and we saw a glimpse of him in two
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  weeks prior mostly because the three times
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  that we see him the first two hints
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  and then the time when we actually see him
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  there's like three different looks
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  the clearly three different actors
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  it's always different actors and in fact
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  it was part of the way that they they just
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  had this Lucy goosey continuity that
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  would never fly anymore and the guy who
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  played him in Dr. No even though he
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  was just seen in a chair from behind
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  the stroke in his pussy was the actor
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  who played I think his name was
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Strangwise or maybe it was the guy who
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  the guy who played him in from Russia
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  with love was the guy who played
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Strangwise the Strangwise the guy who
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  was the guy who in in Jamaica
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  in Dr. No was the like mineralogist
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  who was crooked and tried to sneak
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  in and bond killed him while he
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  was playing remember bond was playing
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  solitary to wait for him to come back
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  and he shot right right right that guy
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  played played below felt in the next
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  movie and then the craziest one is
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  in you only live twice the one
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  he goes to Japan and before it gets
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  all crazy racist and he don't the
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  he'll face makeup he meets the
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  MI6 operative in Tokyo and the guy
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  is wearing a kimono and it's like he's
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  been stationed there he's a
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  British guy who's been stationed there
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  for 30 years and it's a nice little
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  touch he makes he he he makes him a
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  martini and he says start not
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  shaken right which is of course
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  wrong but bond being a polite
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  British person says perfect thank
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  you you know just to accept it
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  doesn't bother correcting him and then
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  he gets stabbed by like a ninja
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  assassin and bond has to go chasing
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  him that actor the guy who played
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  a British intelligence agent in
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  you only live twice two movies
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  later is the guy who played
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  blow felt in diamonds or forever
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  really yeah and he doesn't even
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  look different it wasn't even
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  like they gave him different makeup
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  or a different hairstyle that's
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  right that's right so a lot of this
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  blurs together for me because I watch
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  all of the bond movies over the course
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  of a month it's a twenty twenty
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  you would never ever have like a
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  like a recasting it's almost like
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  you know like they were they were
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  casting out of like you know like
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  sat on it live like where you have
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  like an ensemble cast and you just
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  have to keep reusing actors so
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  you say that but look at Dr. Who
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Peter Capaldi the new doctor he
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  was in an episode as you know
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  just some side character like five
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  years ago the the previous
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  companion was always in that same
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  episode in fact as it totally
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  different character maybe there's
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  just not that many actors in the
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  UK yeah I don't know there's
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  random people at least it was like
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  an old boys club back then I don't
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  know people and I think because
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  nobody got to rewatch movies on
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  home video that everybody just assumed
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  that they would slide I do it
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  was like I think ahead it was like
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  don't even watch this again
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  right I don't know but it's crazy
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  that just two movies apart the same
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  guy played a British agent and
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  blowfeld
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  um
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  yeah I'm guessing see his face too
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  I'm guessing that Kristoff
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Waltz's blowfeld because you've
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  got to bring back specter you got to
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  bring back blowfeld and if you're
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  going to have blowfeld who I mean
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  he's as good an actor as anybody I
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  mean he's that's just it that's just
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  uh they try to do the thing where
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  they they want to keep you guessing
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  as to who the who the guy was
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  who came into the murder but that
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  you can just say it look but this is
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  the character actor that I've seen
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  another TV show clearly that's the
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  murderer right you look at this big
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  budget big production like this you
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  don't bring in Kristoff Waltz to just
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  play some dude if that's it I look at
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  this way if blowfeld is in the
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  movie it's got to be Kristoff Waltz
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  and if blowfeld's not in the movie
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  then when because how many more does
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  Daniel Craig have in him right if
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  you're going to bring back specter for
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  the end of of Daniel Craig's run in
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  the role you got to have blowfeld in
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  there as soon as possible I figure
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  you bring them you got to bring them in
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  and you know finally have you know
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  like in the old bond movies finally have
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  a movie where bond doesn't get the
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  guy at the end you know blowfeld
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  I'm expecting blowfeld wherever his
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  crazy schemas in this movie will
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  escape at the end we'll be back in the
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  next movie
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  you know whatever hard lessons bond has
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  learned in casino royale quantum
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  solace and skyfall he hasn't had a
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  huge failure yet other than the
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  just the failure of Vesperland
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  right that's pretty bad
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  well yeah but it wasn't it wasn't a
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  failure that was a personal failure
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  that wasn't a failure on the level of
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  the guy who was trying to destroy the
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  world kind of got away with blowing up
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  chunk of it. Speaking of of
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  specter and evil worldwide
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  multi-tenical organizations I want to
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  tell you about our good friends at
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  backblaze. Backblaze is unlimited
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  unthrottle online backup for your
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  Mac. They have over 100 petabytes of
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  data backed up for all their customers.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  Sounds dirty. It really I forget
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  what they even told us how big a
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  petabyte is and I forget how big it is.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  It sent us an email and it was just
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  it was it's so much more data than you
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  have. It's crazy and it's they've
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  done great stuff you know if you
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  Google it and they talk about like how
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  to set up a data center that's reliable
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  and cheap and how much you know cost to
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  get drives and stuff like that.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  It's crazy how how much data they
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  have backed up but how they figured
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  out a way to do it cheap because
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  there's a factor with backblaze
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  I've talked about for a while but it
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  is a factor where there's almost a
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  too good to be true feel to it
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  because it's just
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  five bucks a month per computer
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  for unlimited unthrottle backup
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  and it's again it's one of these things
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  it's such a great product but
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  I remember I heard about it for a
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  long time before I signed up because I
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  remember there's other shows that they
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  sponsored and one of the reasons
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  I didn't sign up is it had like this
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  too good to be true feel to it
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  because you think things like well
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  probably only backs up your startup drive
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  no it backs up like if you have like
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  an external hard drive that is
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  three terabytes or four terabytes
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  or bigger where you keep all of
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  your you know digital media
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  and stuff like that they back that
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  up too right it might take a while
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  depending on your upstream but once
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  it's backed up it's up there
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  and you know then after that everything
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  is you know incremental when you add
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  new files and stuff like that
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  but it's not just your startup drive
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  you know it's everything and five
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  bucks per mac per month
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  for unlimited unthrottle backup
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  and it just works and it just runs
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  you install their software and
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  forget about it
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  you see they like fate well you
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  don't use Facebook but sometimes you see
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  posts from people or emails from people
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  or YouTube comments from people
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  where every other word is misspelled
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  and there's no punctuation or
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  capitalization and you wonder in 2014
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  when every device you could possibly
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  have a battery has spell check
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  how it's possible that these people
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  like there's no excuse for misspelling words
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  unless autocorrect gets you
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  in the same way you've got no excuse
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  if your hard drive crashes and you don't
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  have a backup at five dollars a month
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  there's just it's unfathomable to me
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  that you wouldn't have had something in place
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  it's I here's what I'm going to do
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  this holiday season is I because I have
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  a bunch of family members with Mac's who
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  don't have backblays yet and I'm not going to give
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  it as a gift because you know here's
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  but talking stuff but when I'm at their house
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  I am going to in addition to a gift
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  I'm going to give them backblays and I'm going to set it up for them
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  and just soak it up because I feel better
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  my parents don't have backblays on their Mac yet
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  but I'm going to make that make sure
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  it's like my commitment this year when we go home
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  for the holidays I'm going to do it because I
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  would feel so much better if all the pictures
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  my mom has on her Mac are backed up
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  somewhere outside of her house
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  and just do that for everybody in your family
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  when you go home for the holidays
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  and you're going to feel so much better about it
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  I think it's like in addition to a gift
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  give them backblays because
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  eventually it's going to happen
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  I had somebody in Amy's family
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  just had a Mac have a hard drive go bad
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  like so bad that like when you reboot and go into
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  disc utility it's like
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  I got nothing you know
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  and then they took it to the Apple store
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  and they were like you we got nothing
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  so like everything you know they lost photos
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  they had a whole bunch of photos you know
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  that just gone
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  I feel and I had the same thought you did
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  I felt terrible about it because I felt like
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  there's so many things you could do
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  like if they had backblays I feel bad
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  I felt a little guilty that I hadn't
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  yet told them that they should have backblays
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  because it would have saved them
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  five bucks a month per computer
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  unlimited un-throttle backup
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  and here's the thing you get a risk-free
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  no credit card required trial to start out
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  just go to backblays.com slash daring fireball
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  and you can get up to try out
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  you can just do that for your relatives
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  just give them the free trial over Christmas
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  and show them how easy it is and you know
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  let them foot the bill so great
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  and tell them to let backblays know that
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  you heard it on the talk show
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  yeah use that use RL
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  backblays.com slash daring fireball
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  you can't go wrong
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  there's no excuse
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  there's no excuse for for not having
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  how many do you even have a camera
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  that takes pictures on film
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  well I do
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  but I haven't I don't know if it works anymore
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  but I take I don't know
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  probably hundreds of pictures a month
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  and they're all digital
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  and they're all on my hard drive
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  if anything happens
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  and I didn't have a backup and that's like
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  every record of my life
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  I lose my hard drive
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  I just don't exist anymore
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  I'm like Michael J. Fox and back to the future
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  in that photo
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  and my hand starts disappearing
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  it can definitely happen
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  especially I mean
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  SSDs can go bad too
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  but if you have anybody who has
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  anything stored on a spinning hard disk
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  man you got to have it backed up somewhere else
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  or your laptop gets stolen
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  I mean there's a million things that can happen
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  there's five bucks a month
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  you can get health insurance for five dollars a month
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  of course you do it
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  of course you're free
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  like unlimited unbridled online backup
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  for five dollars a month
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  yeah
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  well imagine if health insurance meant
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  that if you get hit by a bus
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  you could like reboot to where you were yesterday
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  right
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  I would definitely pay five dollars a month for that
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  right that's what back blazes for your data
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  five bucks a month
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  if only there was back blazes for us
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  it'd be great
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  that should be their two point up product
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  their engineers are working on it
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  yeah
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  so what else would expect
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  here's the thing I was thinking about with Spectre
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  and in that one it's
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  that this was just resolved legally last year
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  this whole backstory
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  and those of you who have been listened
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  to that whole bond five by five
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  the talk show of thing from years ago
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  know that we covered this
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  but the basic stories
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  there's a guy named Kevin McClorie
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  who
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  he and Fleming had collaborated with
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  before the bond thing even really got big
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  I don't think
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  yeah they were doing it wasn't it supposed to be like a TV movie
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  yeah
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  and they came up with collaborative
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  I think there was even a third collaborator
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  who never
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  you know somehow got bought out of his rights
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  early on in the process
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  somebody got screwed
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  but forget about the third guy
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  just as he and Fleming and Kevin McClorie
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  came up with the premise that was basically Thunderbolt
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  what if a criminal organization
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  could somehow
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  compromise a pilot
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  who would be flying a test flight
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  with a nuclear armed fighter plane
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  and get the compromise pilot
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  to drop the bomb
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  not you know ignite it
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  but just drop it in the ocean
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  somewhere where they could you know
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  then pick it up from the bottom of the ocean
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  and then hold the world
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  the western world hostage
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  which is really pretty clever
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  one of the things about that Thunderbolt plot is
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  in the grand scheme of the whole world is at risk
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  James Bond plots
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  it's actually seems pretty plausible right
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  that they're armed by today's standards
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  there are pilots
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  who are flying planes that have nuclear armed weapons
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  and then at that point you've got one guy who
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  if you can compromise that one guy
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  maybe you know you're going to do something with it
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  nothing came of it I guess
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  whatever the original what TV movie it was supposed to be
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  somehow it fell through
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  but Ian Fleming thought well that was a hell of a good story
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  and he went ahead and just used it
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  for the novel Thunderbolt
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  well wouldn't you?
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  I mean I can see the contention there
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  but yeah I guess
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  I don't know who came up with how much of it
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  who knows
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  I mean like only really maybe maybe only Ian Fleming
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  and Maclory really know how much of it
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Ian Fleming truly had a right to reuse
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  how much of it he came up with
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  but regardless they you know the Maclory sued
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  and there was even some
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  I remember reading about it that the Ian productions
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  you know the people who make the movies
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  even they were aware of that
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  and they even you know were wary of making
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  doing a movie of Thunderbolt until it was resolved
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  but they had lawyer you know enough lawyers
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  who said not ads is all going to go away
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  this Maclory is a crock you know a crackpot
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  but it ended up that he got the rights it
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  by the time it was ended it ended with
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  it was like a you know like the fable of Solomon
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  where you know two women come in saying
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  this is our baby right and he's like
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  yeah cut it in half and the woman who said no
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  no he's like oh you must be the real mother
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  because you know you're more concerned
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  about the baby than you are about this
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  it was like a solemnonic decision with this
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  where they both had the rights to Thunderbolt
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  Ian Fleming and thus Ian productions
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  who had the rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  and Kevin Maclory
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  so Kevin Maclory had the legal rights
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  to make a movie based on the novel Thunderbolt
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  and that's you know and he spent like decades
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  trying to get it made and that's what eventually
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  became never say never again
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  that's why I never say never again is plot
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  is so similar to Thunderbolt
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  it's a weird it's a weird moral
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  fable because who wants half a baby
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  it is weird yeah it's weird it's weird
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  that you know it's like all those fables you know
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  they're painted the the the lying woman was
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  like you know painted in broad strokes
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  she was like the empire you know
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  she's like they're that of a baby
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  like that's right right right
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  50 percent yeah and say like if she had a fleet
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  of Thai fighters she wouldn't to put shields
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  save a couple blocks
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  whatever it takes get it done
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  it's weird that Kevin Maclory got even
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  the ability to use the name James Bond
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  right whatever you'd say about his claim
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  to the story okay great you can you can use
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  the same story just use a different name
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  for the character yeah I've linked to
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  this before I'll put it in the show notes again
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  I hope it's still there on YouTube
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  do you ever see the re-cut opening of
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  never say never again yeah
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  I think I think when you linked to it
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  maybe maybe it was on this show
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  or maybe it was on during fire
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  but you talked about how great it would be
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  if they they redid the whole movie like that
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  it's that just of it is is the real
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  never say never again has this terrible
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  cheesy 80s soundtrack and theme
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  and even the logo thing is really
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  cheesy and it's part of what makes it feel
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  off right from the start and some genius
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  on put up on YouTube pretty much like
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  the whole like opening five minute thing
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  of never say never again
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  but with the real James Bond theme
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  music and
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  you know logo and you know the stuff like that
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  and it it improves it so immensely
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  and it feels real it feels like this is a real
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  James Bond movie and it's exactly like what I said
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  earlier about John Williamson Star Wars
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  it makes you realize right it makes you realize
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  how much that music and
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  graphical theming is part of what makes it feel like
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  a bond movie
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  well we saw we saw that pretty clearly at the end of
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  casino royale when you first hear the
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  I forgot the guy's name
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  you first hear the bond thing yeah I know
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  yeah and they held the the silhouette
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  you know pulled the gun out and shoot a bullet
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  into the screen and the blood comes down
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  they held it until the end of that movie
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  right right because this was the
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  that the whole point of that movie was this is how
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  he becomes bond right it was like this
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  it was almost like the whole movie was sort of a
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  feature length
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  what's it called like a prelude
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  what do you call like chapter zero of the book
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  prolog yeah prolog like it was like a two
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  hour prolog yeah why kind of read it as
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  similar to like Batman Begins
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  and that was at the time in movies when
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Batman Begins and like rebooting a thing was the
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  time to do like give us more origin stories
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  please yeah it was it yeah casino royale
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  is like the greatest origin story ever I think
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  I would think I'd agree with that I think I
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  agree with that in so much of it for me and
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  there's I don't think I'm giving away any
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  secrets by saying the Vesperland my favorite
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  bond girl and I think that is such such a
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  defining moment in bond's life if you want to
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  imagine that it's it's one guy and this is all
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  his story that the story of Vesperland
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  is the story of bond without her there's no
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  change bond yeah and they you know it
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  wasn't like he started as a 85 pound
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  you know sickly weakling who needed a
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  super serum to become James Bond
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  he was already he wasn't bitten by a
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  radioactive secret agent right he was
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  obviously already well trained in the
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  military and had the mindset and was on the
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  type of person who would be on a career
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  path to become a double-o in MI six it's
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  you know what is it like what would that
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  what would that character be like when he's
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  one cut below becoming a double-o
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  you know and what would he be like when he
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  first gets granted double-o status and
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  isn't really comfortable at that level it
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  doesn't really get it yet it isn't really
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  isn't quite prepared for it you know
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  still maybe a little a little
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  insufferably arrogant yeah
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  he knows is on the cusp but he's not
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  he's not seasoned enough to be
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  comfortable in it yet yeah and we've
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  that scene on the train with him
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  and Vesper going back and forth
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  trading shots and he loses that
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  argument yeah if anybody who doesn't
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  anybody who doesn't hold that that's one of
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  the best scenes in an action movie in
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  recent memory you know I would say
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  ever but you know in the modern
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  era of movies it's like we're just
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  not going to be able to have a we're
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  not going to agree on anything when it
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  comes to cinema it's not even
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  that's one of my favorite scenes in a
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  movie yeah it's just so good it's
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  and it's you know it's in a series
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  where the the level of actual
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  personal interplay between bond and
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  the women in the movie it's just
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  notoriously thin you know and it's
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  more or less just blah blah
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  blah let's go to bed right and
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  yeah in this place so well against
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  that but it even stands on its own
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  it works in both directions which
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  I think is what makes it so great
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  right you can see why both of them
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  like each other and you can see why
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  both of them dislike each other and you
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  can see why both of them like the
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  other because of the reasons that they
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  dislike the other yeah when she
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  asks how's the lamb and he says
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  skewer yeah he says it with a
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  smile like he's kind of into this
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  he's into this lady yeah yeah
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  it's definitely one of the best
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  scenes I it makes it to otherwise
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  it's a great movie anyway but it's
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  really the scene that like puts it
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  over the top what do you think I was
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  with specter and the movie
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  specter and the organization is
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  that there's there they could be
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  repeating a pattern so in the in
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  the Sean Connery films there's Dr.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  No and that's a specter movie
[1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  Dr. No is is you know one of the
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  agents of specter and from
[2:00:01.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  Russia with love is a specter
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  movie then the third one gold
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  finger was just about it was off
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:09.000]  specter and it was just this crack
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  pot guy gold finger in his plan
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  and then in the fourth and fifth
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  and they went back to to specter
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  with Dr. No and and you only live
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  twice so you're saying that with
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  casino royale you had this
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  there was this shadowy
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  organization that I believe you
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  know you and I chatted about this
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  today in prep for the show but I
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  believe in casino royale there was
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  never given a name to it but there
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  was the guy mr. White which is
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  the guy who he the great scene at
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  the end of the movie when this guy
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  mr. White who had been like
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  behind all this scheming and the
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  ending of la chiffra and who
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  saved James Bond's life by coming
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  in and killing la chiffra and letting
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Bond go when he was being tortured
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  the chiffra yeah how would you
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  pronounce it I think it's la
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  chiff a sheaf yeah I mean I'm sure
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  the internet's going to correct
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  yeah a chiff a chiffra whatever
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  la chiff I guess that's what they
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  say in a movie actually it's
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  foreign this mr. White guy is
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  you know obviously if not the
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  next up it's he's a higher up in
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  some shadowy criminal organization
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  and then he's you know one of
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  the neat things about quantum
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  of solace which it opposite of
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  Skyfall I continue to like more and
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  more as I as the years go on and
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  I rewatch it if I read it I bet
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  of all the the the commentaries I
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  did with Dan on the original series
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  the one I would probably change the
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  most if I redid it now is quantum
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  of solace which I read at the time
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  did not like because of a bunch of
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  some weak writing the more I
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  watch it I like it more and I
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  even like I like the idea that
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  it starts like an hour after
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  casino royale yeah it's like the
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  next day yeah he's got like
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  he's got mr. White in the trunk
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  of his car but you don't even know
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  that until he opens the trunk of
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  his car when you see it in
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  theaters it had been like two or
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  three years since casino royale so
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  you've probably forgotten about
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  that and I think that assuming
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  that this was a whole new story
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  starting over was what ruined
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  the movie for the people who didn't
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  like it but if you watch them if
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  you it yeah that's a good point I
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  think that's why I like it more
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  and more I do think so that it's
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  the fact that it continues from
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  it yeah take a day take an
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  afternoon and watch them back to
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  back quantum solace is a much
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  better movie than you probably
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  said I didn't know this I was
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  under the impression that the
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  criminal organization and you know
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  and then they had like the right
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  hand man to M was in fact
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  double agent working for them you
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  know and he betrays them and you
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  know almost kills them and bond
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  and he's the guy rescues Mr.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  White from captivity that that
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  organization in quantum solace
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  it ends up that they call the
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  organization quantum at some point
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  and if you google and you know
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  look around and just google for
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  quantum organization James Bond
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  you'll see that there's people who
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  call that organization quantum
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  and that's how I read it I guess
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  but wouldn't it be cool though if
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  if if they somehow make it seem
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  as though that organization is
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  a good investor well it was
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  pretty strongly hinted at least
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  and that's how I read it right
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  and that was or maybe that was
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  like the code name well yeah
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  earlier yeah like a code name of
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  it and the explanation behind the
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  scenes was that they they hadn't
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  settled this lawsuit with the
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  clever Kevin McClory mistake
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  mistake you know getting back
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  to McClory the whole thing is a
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  year ago in twenty thirteen
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  eon productions finally wrote a
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  check of you know both sides
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  agreed not to say what it was but
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  some amount of money they gave to
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Kevin McClory's estate because I
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  guess McClory died a few years ago
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  and now
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  eon wholly owns the rights to
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  specter and Thunderbolt again
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  that seems like the thing that
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  could only happen after McClory
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  dies and after
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  Albert Broccoli dies right once
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  once like the people who were
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  actually having
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  actually involved in that that
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  angry battle are out of the picture
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  it could like cooler heads
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  prevail right because that was one
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  of the side effects even though
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  McClory only had the rights to
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  redo as in terms of Ian Fleming's
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  rights to do Thunderbolt somehow
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  part of the side effects of this
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  judgment was that
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  eon couldn't use specter anymore
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  and they did make a few more
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  movies you know after Thunderbolt
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  but at some point after diamonds
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  or forever the the lawsuit got to
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  such a place where they felt like
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  they couldn't or shouldn't or
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  explicitly told they can't make if
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  they use specter then McClory would
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  get the rights to that movie too
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  you know that if they put them in
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  the spotlight that then
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  McClory you know somehow
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  specter was somehow part of what you
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  got with Thunderbolt and so last
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  year they finally just made it all go
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  away and now they own the rights
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  to it so now they can call it
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  specter so I feel like they
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  should clearly they should do
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  that right they should make you know
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  somehow blur the lines of what
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  was called quantum and just say
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  that that's you know specter
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  yeah it could be that it was
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  quantum was an offshoot it could be
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  that that was the precursor organization
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  wouldn't have been don't even
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  really need to give us a bunch of
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  backstory
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  you just tied together quickly
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  give us one line of dialogue
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  like the call it call it give us
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  an illusion to project quantum
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  and that's good enough
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  I hope they don't I hope they don't
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  reuse the acronym the special
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  projects and something something
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  because it doesn't even really add up
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  to specter you have to like
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  cross out a couple of letters
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  and to get the s and the p you
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  have to count both the s and p
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  and special or you know
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  it we know what you're doing you're
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  just trying to get to the word
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  specter just if you want to call
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  it specter just call it specter
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  it's a cool name yeah
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  because it's we all agree it's a cool
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  name yeah it does no reason to
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  background in it and and the one
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  that Fleming came up with was
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  pretty bad it's kind of like
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  shield like shield has a crazy
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  yeah and they totally embrace
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  that with the in one of the
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  I don't know if it's an iron man
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  movie or yes I'm in where
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  they didn't have the acronym yet
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  but agent Colson you know set
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  them from the whatever homeland
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  blah blah blah blah blah
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  strategic homeland intelligence
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  something in logistics division
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  I can't believe I remembered that much of it
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  right but yeah and he like
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  somebody says that's a mouthful and he
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  says yeah we're working on it
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  yeah that's actually but if you think
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  about it it's actually I remember
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  thinking about it when it came out
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  it's actually pretty good that
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  there aren't any like real clunker
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  words in there like there are in the
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  specter actor and I wonder how many
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  people they had working on that
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  I don't know if they came up with
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  one guy who was really good at
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  a background naming
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  that's just such a fun word
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  where is the yeah it's the special
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  executive for counter intelligence
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  terrorism revenge and extortion
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  so he have to use the SM the P from
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  the special right and I mean if
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  you're going to if you're going to make a
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  special case for any word it should be
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  the word special and the way
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  Fleming spelled it counter intelligence
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  was hyphenated so you have to ignore
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  the eye
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  some words you get two letters
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  sometimes you get two words only on one
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  letter and I think a revenge
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  really sticks out as sort of you know
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  that if you weren't background naming it
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  why would you put revenge in as the
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  organizations you know counter
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  intelligence okay terrorism definitely
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  extortion definitely right
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  like as opposed to you know like a religious
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  terrorist group that is just after it
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  for the you know for the the the
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  virgins in heaven or whatever you know
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  inspectors in it for the money so yeah
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  right extortion definitely part of it
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  but revenge like it's like look guys we
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  can do all these things but only
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  the people who have wronged us yeah
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  because it also implies that you're
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  going to have a they're going to build up a
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  list of enemies along the way that they
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  have to get revenge against as opposed
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  to wouldn't your wouldn't your ideal be
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  that you leave no enemies behind
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  that there is nobody that you need to
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  seek revenge against because you're
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  never going to get wronged
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  oh I thought it was that they were it
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  was all the name of revenge against
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  people for things that are already
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  happened
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  oh maybe
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  which leaves you no room for advancement
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  or growth
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  former schoolmates of blow fell
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  there's the guy like gave him a
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  swirly and second grade right the
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  girl who wouldn't go to the problem
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  with them
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  it's pretty pretty short list
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  we're not going to be that busy
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  to be honest with you guys
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  we might have to add some letters
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  at the end for like I don't know

[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:27.360]  heard that world my eyes
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:30.800]  but uh... that's because i don't have a real job in a real world linkedin
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:34.360]  it's it's true it's linked in the real world if you have a job linked in
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:37.840]  is super super you know important

[2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:45.760]  that linkedin is so much better than like the you know last time i had to get a
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:49.400]  real job it was like real resumes where you'd like open up a document and keep
[2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:50.600]  your resume up today
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:52.280]  well with something like
[2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:56.840]  linkedin where there's an API your profile stays up to date based on the
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:11:00.640]  stuff that you've learned from linda so as you learn more stuff your linkedin
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:01.640]  profile
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:04.800]  shows it which is kind of clever

[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:53.960]  huge deal
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:57.560]  i was learning photoshop when i would actually get my hands on psd that's
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:11:59.960]  when i learned that's like when i got that was the best part of it
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:03.320]  so here's a fun fact that they have this is amazing thirty percent of
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:07.480]  colleges and universities and most of the ivy league schools offer linda dot
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:12.120]  com subscriptions to their students and faculty members

[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:17.720]  of stuff
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:20.040]  and it's the type of stuff that colleges aren't really but meant for it
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:23.080]  they're not going to get a good course in college and i had to use photoshop
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:25.960]  colleges really meant for stuff that's timeless
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:31.240]  and linda dot com is meant for stuff that changes year after year after year

[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:25.560]  i you couldn't have missed it there's a best i think it's an episode one there's a vesper joke
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:26.680]  uh...
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:30.280]  i'm i'm sure i did but i'm coming comes to a bar
[2:13:30.280 --> 2:13:34.200]  and it's i guess it's supposed to be like a cd place i don't know i didn't
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:36.760]  really look like it it seemed like poor art direction but he goes up to the
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:39.160]  bartender and just says uh...
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:42.120]  three measures of gordon's one measure of uh... yes
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:48.440]  half a measure of kina le le and the bartender hands them a bottle of beer
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:51.400]  and there's a sort of uh... you know
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:54.360]  we don't have shit like that here look on the bartender's face
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:59.080]  and it's it's i like that because it's a joke that you have to be a fit you know
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:02.040]  you know if you're not a bond fan it doesn't make it that's that that whole
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:05.080]  interaction makes no sense and if you are a bond fan
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:07.720]  it's it makes all the sense in the world
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:10.600]  well i think it still makes sense it it means that here's a guy is coming in
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:13.720]  wanting a hoodie twitty kind of drink and he's it says something about that
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:15.240]  character in his uh...
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:19.800]  misunderstanding of where he was because he was kind of this entitled brat at
[2:14:19.800 --> 2:14:20.760]  that point in his
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:23.640]  and in the story i was going to say in his life which may have also been true
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:24.520]  yeah
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:27.480]  it's very watching it at no point did it occur to me
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:31.160]  to to take this as a little reading of anything that ever happened to the
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:31.960]  inflami
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:34.680]  like i'm sure there's elements of truth to it but it seems like
[2:14:34.680 --> 2:14:37.880]  this is somebody making a miniseries out of
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:42.280]  the stories that the inflaming told the people to make himself sound cool
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:47.000]  i actually since i started watching it i i haven't i've resisted the urge to
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:50.120]  google it because i want to watch the fourth episodes before i do but then i
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:51.560]  want to look and see
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.720]  how much of it is purportedly true
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:56.840]  i think a significant amount of it is is
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:14:59.560]  true i think it's you know it
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.720]  when i went through it it see uh... from what i read it seemed like most of this
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:08.520]  was uh... like blurred lines like so much of what he did while he was
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:13.800]  in in the service was like redacted and he you know stuff that you're
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:16.440]  they'll never come out and say whether that's true or not whether he actually did
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:17.240]  those things
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:20.440]  but what they could line up is like well there's elements of truth and these
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:24.440]  things probably happen maybe not the way he said uh... but the the
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:27.400]  consensus it seemed was that this is sort of you know
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:31.000]  as much bullshit as it was truth right which to me is i mean that's that's what
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.800]  storytelling is and that's what he was was a storyteller
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:37.720]  yeah and it seems like it's set up where he's sort of
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:40.120]  uh...
[2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:42.920]  repeatedly he he you know he works
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:46.840]  as you know in in British intelligence during world war two
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:51.080]  that's almost the bulk of the movie or the series
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:55.560]  and it just comes up with clever his whole job is to come up with clever
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:58.600]  ideas to screw the Germans
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:02.200]  but he he keeps wanting to get sent out into the field and isn't
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:04.760]  isn't allowed to
[2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:08.120]  and then you know it sets it up that his the whole the whole reason he wrote
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:12.520]  the bond series was to have a guy like him who does get to go out in the field
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:14.200]  yeah a little bit of uh...
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:17.480]  exploring those fantasies getting a little bit of those fantasies your character
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:20.760]  yeah i forget her name but that there's like uh...
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:21.560]  uh...
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:23.720]  a money penny like woman
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:26.280]  who works with his bought for his boss
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:27.320]  who is
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:32.600]  almost two uncannily like the uh... the original money penny in the movies
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:35.960]  which must have been that that had to be intentional oh i think it's
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:40.680]  absolutely didn't you know i i think it's over the top intentional
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:43.480]  i wouldn't be surprised if i i don't know i don't know i haven't looked it
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:46.680]  up yet but i wouldn't be surprised if that part of it for example is just
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:49.240]  purely fiction
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:52.280]  but i don't know it's so tough to tell because so much of that era of his life
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:54.280]  is his him telling the stories yeah
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:59.080]  my bottom line on flaming is uh... for anybody if you love bond and you like
[2:16:59.080 --> 2:17:02.280]  the you like bond you should watch it especially while it's free on that
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:06.200]  flex and if you're not if you're like kind of like and on bond it's i would say
[2:17:06.200 --> 2:17:07.080]  skip it
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:10.360]  what was the other uh... everything or nothing the documentary
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.520]  yeah that was disappointing to i thought
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:16.200]  really well i liked it but again i wouldn't recommend it for anybody who wasn't a
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:17.640]  big fan
[2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:19.800]  i would say if you've seen
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:22.120]  every or nearly every bond movie
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:25.320]  you'd probably like flaming you'd probably like everything or nothing
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:28.280]  actually i take it back now that i think about more i think everything i think i
[2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:31.080]  think i'm misremembering off the top of my bed i actually i think i
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:34.360]  top my head i think i actually really liked uh... everything or nothing
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:37.880]  i enjoyed it and uh... if for if or nothing else
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:43.240]  to hear lazan b get to talk about in hindsight the way he acted and his role in
[2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:47.000]  the bond universe yeah that's worth the price of admission
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:49.560]  yeah i totally take it back now that i think about it because that's the one i
[2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:52.280]  i was misremembering it's the one where uh...
[2:17:52.280 --> 2:17:55.560]  in addition to some great stuff with lazan b
[2:17:55.560 --> 2:17:59.640]  uh... i thought there was really really great stuff with uh...
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:01.800]  pierce brazan
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:05.320]  oh yeah well he was talking about he he says uh... i forget the
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:08.920]  forget exactly says that he he pretty much comes right out and
[2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:10.760]  says on camera that
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:14.680]  after uh... after gold night he doesn't really remember the differences between
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:17.080]  the movies because they're all more or less the same he well not that he doesn't
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:20.360]  remember the differences but that he can't he doesn't remember which one was which
[2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:23.080]  right right uh... yeah that's what i mean that there's like well they all
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:25.960]  they all kind of blurred together like he remembers you know who was in them
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:29.240]  and he remembers you know that but he can't you know which ones the world is not
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:33.800]  enough which one is you know
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:37.400]  because that that era i have the same problem i remember gold and i very very
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:40.280]  clearly and everything after that for him i don't remember which
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:42.920]  i don't even remember it was there it was he in three of them or four of them
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:45.000]  he was in five i believe
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:45.800]  now
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:47.400]  yeah
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:49.080]  let's go look it up
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:53.880]  because gold and i uh... world is not enough tomorrow never dies
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:56.120]  right i think i think it was three
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:18:59.400]  no i i'm gonna bet i think there's five
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:00.920]  i'll do as high as four
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:02.040]  you might be right
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:03.480]  so there was gold nine
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:07.240]  in ninety five tomorrow never dies in ninety seven
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:10.920]  uh... that's the one with uh...
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:15.400]  uh... the news right yeah the the the Rupert Murdoch
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:20.120]  yeah the Rupert Murdoch guy and uh... terry hatcher as like an old girlfriend
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:23.480]  who's now back in his life because she was dating the Rupert Murdoch then there's the
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:24.840]  world is not enough
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:29.160]  that was with the news Richards yeah and then die another day
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:32.520]  uh... that's right there were four uh... holly berry right
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:37.960]  uh... i think that was holly berry and i think that was also the uh...
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:40.840]  the invisible car
[2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:42.200]  and the ice hotel
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:46.600]  just try to say that without laughing and it's impossible
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:49.560]  but yet but it you know what and it's funny you want to talk about you know is
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:53.480]  spectra good calories you know like those those those other titles are so
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:57.720]  empty tomorrow never dies the world is not enough die another day
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:01.880]  they sound like bond movies but they sound like what they are like bond movies
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:04.360]  that are indistinguishable from one another
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:06.760]  yeah exactly exactly like
[2:20:06.760 --> 2:20:10.760]  die another day tomorrow never die so if you told me that the plot of die another
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:15.240]  day was tomorrow never dies i would say i would believe you and if you told me the plot of
[2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:18.760]  tomorrow never dies was in fact the plot of die another day
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:20.040]  i would believe you
[2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:23.160]  i guess that the title means nothing to refer to anything that happened in the same
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:26.200]  thing with the world is not enough i don't know like if you if you told me the world
[2:20:26.200 --> 2:20:29.720]  is not enough is the one with the Rupert Murdoch guy i would say that makes sense
[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:33.480]  because it's like he wanted to take over the world or something i don't know
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:34.760]  but it's not
[2:20:34.760 --> 2:20:37.160]  whereas if you told me
[2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:42.120]  that doctor know was about a crazy german guy who wants to steal all the golden
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:49.880]  forts i would be like no you know or if you told me that diamonds are forever
[2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:55.320]  which a lot of people don't even like you know diamonds are forever was about a guy
[2:20:58.680 --> 2:21:05.880]  you know who had a crazy tank that looked like
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:12.200]  uh hila monster on an island in jamaica i would be like no that was doctor no
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:19.960]  at least like gold finger that that meant something to the plot
[2:21:19.960 --> 2:21:23.160]  right diamonds are forever that meant some moon raker that definitely meant
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:26.600]  something to the plot see what you will about moon raker that title meant something
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:27.960]  right but tomorrow never dies
[2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:32.920]  tamus guy false guy fall you know and it breaks a pattern where it's not named after like the
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:37.960]  bad guy or the mcguffin but it's about the character you know you'll you'll never like 30
[2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:44.360]  40 years from now we're not going to forget which one skyfall was killer song yeah quantum of
[2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:50.280]  solace quantum of solace fails that test the song test no the title test and it and and the song
[2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:56.520]  test it is and uh you know how hard did quantum of solace have the sound garden song maybe it
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:01.480]  was a good song or is that the it was uh chris cornell chris cornell but not not full on sound
[2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:07.080]  garden i think yeah that wasn't bad i would say it passes the song test but skyfall that that song
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:12.440]  like that still stands you still hear that on the radio yeah steer here in the when you're at
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:16.120]  shopping or something you'll hear that on the pier like that's still a good song yeah those are
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:20.840]  bad anyway pierce Brosnan even it's a heat confusing and so uh i would tell i would
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:26.200]  totally recommend the world or no what's the documentary uh everything or nothing yeah because
[2:22:26.200 --> 2:22:31.000]  that's that's where we learned what what eon productions stood for at eon everything or nothing
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:36.840]  right which was a huge reveal to me yeah same here i didn't know that and it's because i
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:41.560]  just knew i'd always confused me that it didn't seem like it had any kind of reference to the
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:46.760]  initials of cubby broccoli or the the other guy who was his original co-producing partner
[2:22:49.160 --> 2:22:52.280]  salt spin yeah yeah harry salt spin yeah that's right
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:56.920]  there's like a million people listening this right now like
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:02.440]  angry that that they're not able to have their voices heard when they when we're trying to
[2:23:02.440 --> 2:23:07.240]  struggle to remember these things we need alive we need the live audience i'm sure people are
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:13.160]  yelling at their phones right now it's salt spin yeah salt spin all right one last thing before
[2:23:13.160 --> 2:23:18.600]  we wrap up keep this show short uh i do i want to talk to you about i was uh you've got a new
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:23.560]  thing so you've got a new thing uh you've been doing for a couple weeks couple months better
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:26.840]  at the better elevation podcast you used to have a blog we used to have a blog called better
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:32.120]  elevation yeah this is i guess it's i i went from it being a blog to it being this other thing
[2:23:32.120 --> 2:23:39.560]  and does it coincide does it it coincide with the end of unprofessional uh it through i guess or
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:45.960]  just it yeah it's not like a direct i mean there's like a chronological i had this availability
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:50.680]  and i was thinking about what i could do creatively but there's no like this led to that kind of
[2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:56.840]  uh causal relationship so now you're doing a show on youtube do you consider yourself a youtuber
[2:23:56.840 --> 2:24:02.280]  i guess just today i i signed up for a vimeo pro account mostly because they had this this
[2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:06.840]  deal sort of a black friday deal where if you bought it's 200 bucks a year for vimeo pro account
[2:24:06.840 --> 2:24:12.760]  and that their deal was if you buy the one year membership the pro account for $200 they would
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:18.520]  give you a $200 gift card to be an h which is uh like a photography electronic store here in
[2:24:18.520 --> 2:24:22.840]  New York and i need to buy some more equipment so this was like well i'm gonna spend that money
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:27.400]  anyway i may as well get a vimeo account up um rolling my eyes thinking about our sponsors
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:31.960]  this we don't really have anybody who sells gadgets even in a rotation of sponsors but b and h i
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:40.360]  is a fantastic uh uh store they have amazing prices amazing amazing service and this crazy like
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:45.080]  nomadic tube system for sending the things down to i i don't even know how to explain it in
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:50.120]  in the confines of a uh a nice short podcast like this yeah that i've never been there in person
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:54.680]  but i've heard that it's cool it's pretty amazing yeah it's like uh when you were kid do you ever
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:24:58.920]  go to like the the drive-up teller at the bank and they have the demand tubes yeah i when i was
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:03.560]  a kid like i was so fascinated like the my imagination went nuts like there must have been a
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:08.280]  chocolate factory back there where willy wanka and the opalumpas were sending money through tubes
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.840]  and sometimes candy would come through when they noticed there's a kid in the car and uh that
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:17.480]  it's kind of like being in the chocolate factory watching the tubes go over your head
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:21.640]  that's what it's like being a B&H man if you want like an obscure lens for like a cannon or
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:27.160]  Nikon or something like that man B&H has everything um but anyway you're but you're doing you're
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:32.280]  doing this how many episodes do you have to know five six uh six i think and they're about four
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:42.040]  or five six minutes long and it's uh so it's sort of the opposite of like this show which is two
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:48.600]  hours of i don't want to say rambling i want to you know but it's the complaint about podcast like
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:55.160]  the talk show that it's unstructured and and goes on it's five minutes of very tightly scripted
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:03.720]  and then edited monologue yeah and a couple weeks ago i i did an episode about podcasting about
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:09.080]  what i thought the problem with podcasting is and uh it it it's almost uncomfortable to say it
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:15.800]  here on this show because you know it's this show but it sort of seems like there's the talk show
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:19.640]  and then there's a bunch of shows that kind of followed the template of the talk show
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:26.280]  and even even on things that i've done i've tried to never do a podcast about like you know
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:30.760]  work stuff right i've done podcast about design like even unprofessional is very specifically not
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:34.520]  talking about work that was the whole premise of unprofessional was that it was here's somebody
[2:26:34.520 --> 2:26:41.000]  whose work we admire and right at whatever field and we are our ground rules for the episode
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.520]  is that we are not going to talk about that work yeah that's the one rule we can talk about
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:49.160]  anything but work and sometimes it would be crazy stuff like uh talking to somebody about like
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:54.680]  no elephant genitalia because that was just where the conversation wound up uh with mulch we had
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:58.440]  mulch on when i'm talking about uh what would be like to eat people and just you know you never
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:01.720]  know where it's gonna the conversation's gonna take you and that's kind of what it's like to be
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:05.240]  a bar and talk to people i'm surprised the elephant genitalia didn't come up with mulch
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.360]  because frankly whenever i see them it's all he ever wants to talk
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:19.000]  uh it's like if mulch is so intimately familiar with elephant genitalia you know the old thing
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:22.440]  where there's like three blind guys feeling an elephant and they all the say different things
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:28.760]  are one guys like you know it's a tree trunk it's uh mulch if he was the blind guy would
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:35.960]  be riding at an eat the middle he'd be like it's an elephant and it's a man the male i know this
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:43.960]  elephant i'd recognize that anywhere these grapefruit sizes they're probably bigger than grapefruit
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:49.240]  size actually i i have honestly i have no idea i am i'm so clearly not familiar with elephant
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:54.120]  genitalia i think that i think the topic was about how they they were or were not prehensile
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:02.840]  elephant penis no not to be they're huge but why would they be prehensile but i don't
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:08.280]  well it was because uh like kangaroos kangaroos they are prehensile anyway yeah getting way off
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:13.160]  topic here i didn't know that yeah and i only know this because i was at a zoo in australia
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:17.560]  and there were some kangaroos going at it that and uh yeah it was like it was like the the male
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:21.000]  kangaroo on top of the female kangaroo and it was like it was kind of feeling around down there
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:25.160]  trying to find where to go and it was uh it was a very uh illuminating and disturbing moment
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:29.560]  that should be just as well known as the pouches thing and you know well i don't think they like
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:36.440]  telling about the kids in school one time we had amis uh ami as a much younger brother and he was
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:41.800]  still a kid he's in college now but he was um i don't he was only like 10 or 11 we took him to
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:47.320]  the philadelphia zoo and we were at the turtle exhibit and these turtles they have signs i mean these
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:51.800]  turtles are like something like the male is like 85 years old i mean he's ancient and he's super
[2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:58.040]  pulled and when you know it the guy that kind went right up behind the female and and just went
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:04.440]  right at her and i forget if it was the male or the female or if it was if it was impossible to tell
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:08.840]  because neither of their mouths were really moving but one of them was really really getting into
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:16.440]  it audibly i mean it's broad daylight open and i would say 10 or 15 feet away from the railing
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:24.360]  and these these big three four foot grand turtles and they're just screwing right there to open
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:32.840]  and all these kids there are so many kids and all the kids are saying uh what are they doing
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:40.120]  what is he hurting her and i mean the question kids are really like you know like something was
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:44.760]  clearly going on and it was noisy you said you were concerned right and for the most part those
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:50.840]  turtles don't even move and this the male this old male turtle is really going and it was
[2:29:50.840 --> 2:29:55.640]  i it was one of the best it was like the reason zoos exist because it's like what do you watch do
[2:29:55.640 --> 2:30:02.440]  you watch the 85 year old turtle have added or do you turn around and watch all the parents
[2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:08.760]  tried to decide what do i do like some of the parents were clearly of the let's just pretend
[2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:14.760]  this is nothing uh you know let's just you know let's get real catholic about this and just
[2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:22.200]  go into denial that this is going on and other parents were more of the sort of liberal open minded
[2:30:22.200 --> 2:30:27.000]  i don't want to act as though this is anything to be embarrassed about i'm going you know how do
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:32.040]  i explain this to my kid in a sort of mature professional and and there's no way you could
[2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:36.680]  there's no possible way that you could talk to like a 10 year old kid in a serious way about turtles
[2:30:36.680 --> 2:30:41.640]  who are having having sex if it comes a meta zoo where you're watching people watch animals
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:44.360]  all right that would be a good bond movie title turtles having sex
[2:30:45.800 --> 2:30:52.040]  i'd watch it um no but yet but you're pod that's one of the things it it i've had it in my
[2:30:52.040 --> 2:30:56.360]  notes for the next time you're on the show to talk about the podcast you called it podcast intervention
[2:30:58.120 --> 2:31:02.760]  yeah it just seems like uh we've got a lot of really smart people and uh a lot of very talented
[2:31:02.760 --> 2:31:09.640]  people but we we've kind of fallen into and when i say we i mean like you know the apple
[2:31:09.640 --> 2:31:13.800]  tech community not i mean not like the world at large or even the tech community at large but like
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:18.600]  and within our bubble it's like a lot of people kind of doing variations on the same
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:22.840]  theme and it's not that i think people shouldn't do podcasts in fact i think people should do
[2:31:22.840 --> 2:31:25.960]  more podcasts i think everybody should have a podcast i think it's a great way to communicate
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:32.120]  ideas and broadcast them uh i just wish that we would maybe try some other stuff too and maybe try
[2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:36.760]  some variation in the way we approach podcasting you're you know we work together you're not gonna you
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:40.760]  know it's it's we work together on this show you edit the show for those who don't know Dave
[2:31:40.760 --> 2:31:46.600]  edits the show Dave uh even handles the sponsor subsales now for this show the talk show i mean
[2:31:46.600 --> 2:31:52.440]  it yours closest there is to well you are you should you should be correct you do enough work
[2:31:52.440 --> 2:31:56.360]  on this show that you should get a credit except we don't have credits if the show had any kind
[2:31:56.360 --> 2:32:02.440]  of visuals there would be an edited and some kind of maybe even produced by Dave whiskis credit on
[2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:08.040]  the talk show um so it's no surprise that you're going to say good things about it but when i saw
[2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:13.000]  that episode of a better elevation i even though you i i don't even remember if you mentioned
[2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:18.120]  my show i think you said good things about the show and ATP something about the fact that we
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:23.720]  you know that the show and ATP work because the authors have strong voices that we already knew
[2:32:23.720 --> 2:32:27.560]  and now we get to hear them in another context something it's it's it's the already new part it's
[2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:31.560]  that you would you listen to the talk show not because you heard there's this thing called the talk
[2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:34.200]  show and it's a great podcast you're probably listening to the talk show because you're redaring
[2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:39.480]  fireball yeah i don't who knows i you know that's a good question i just assumed that for as
[2:32:39.480 --> 2:32:45.080]  popular as this show has gotten i just assumed that it's it's a subset of the people who redaring
[2:32:45.080 --> 2:32:49.240]  fireball that there are very i maybe there are some though i'd love to hear from you but if
[2:32:49.240 --> 2:32:54.520]  there are people who don't like daring fireball but do like the show but i i do kind of feel like
[2:32:54.520 --> 2:32:58.600]  it's sort of like i it's funny to start tying some of these strings together but i think it's in
[2:32:58.600 --> 2:33:05.400]  the way that Fleming only works if you're already a bond fan yeah that the talk show only works if
[2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:09.720]  you're already a daring fireball fan well yeah you you've referred to the talk show as the it's
[2:33:09.720 --> 2:33:15.240]  like the director's commentary track right right but what i saw your your better elevation it
[2:33:15.240 --> 2:33:23.320]  even though you're a complimentary towards the show i took it as you know i took it as as
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:28.680]  motivation that why don't i up the game i do feel like i'm incredibly lazy with the format of
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:32.920]  this show that there's more i could do we could do anything you know that i think that's a
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:37.400]  a healthier response and really like all i i kind of piss some people off and some people thought
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:43.480]  that i was attacking one person or another um i don't want to get into like all of that but
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:49.800]  the when i when i had mentioned on the in the video that we have multiple podcast networks that
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:56.440]  are run by a white dude who is on more than one of those shows close if not every show on that
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:34:01.320]  work then almost every show on the network and it's really easy to assume that i'm talking about
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:04.760]  anyone this people really i'm the fact that there are more than one there's more than one
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:08.760]  person that i could be talking about is kind of what i'm talking about right it's not like it's not
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:15.240]  like as anything particular to do with leal a port or Dan Benjamin or even who like moises
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:20.440]  for somebody like that you know or or mike hurley or veneer gee or there's so many to choose from
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:24.840]  and that's kind of what i'm talking about where we might have a hundred podcasts but it seems
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:28.600]  like it's maybe the same twenty people doing all one hundred of them right and that again that's
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:32.360]  not even necessarily a bad thing right that the problem is with any one of those people are any
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:37.720]  one of those shows it's that you can you can say that vague phrase you know white dude you know from
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:42.440]  the tech world who's on a bunch of shows and it can apply to so many of them yeah and any one of
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:46.120]  those shows any one of those people their quality shows quality people the most of them are friends
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:49.320]  of mine people that i would i would speak very highly of them and their shows and their approach to
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:53.480]  their work mike hurley i talked to a lot even before like i sent him the script for the show
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:57.320]  and we talked a lot about like the state of podcasting and what what could be done to push
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:01.720]  things forward and he's got a lot of great ideas and i really do think that he's a voice for
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:07.720]  for positive change there but uh like at a macro level when you zoom out you you start to see a lot
[2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:12.600]  of like it's like it's like the speaking tying threads together it's like you zoom out in
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:17.320]  attack of the clones and you see just a sea of blue and green light sabers that wouldn't look great
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:21.240]  you start to see the problem with only two colors you have to add some more colors in there
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:28.040]  and i'm worried that as our sphere of influence grows we're not really adding anything else
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:33.240]  to it like we're kind of working with those same ingredients yeah and i worry that we and by
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:39.160]  we i really mean me since i have a popular show and i already have an audience that i'm not doing
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:47.320]  anywhere near enough to exercise any sort of muscles to play with the form it's you know hit record
[2:35:47.320 --> 2:35:52.280]  and we've got plenty of stuff to talk about and i think that it's you know and based on feedback
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:58.520]  from people and the fact that you know the the download numbers for this show are going up they're
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:03.400]  growing up faster than traffic at daring fireball like a daring fireball has sort of peaked
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:08.440]  readership wise at least in terms of things you can measure but the show is gaining popularity
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:12.600]  and i think it's because i've gotten so many interesting people on who have interesting things to
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:18.920]  say but the form is incredibly lazy it's get somebody interesting on the other end and hit
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:24.680]  record for two hours and then you know pass it over to Dave to get the levels fixed and
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:30.680]  the mistakes cut out whereas we could do anything you know we could do something like cereal or
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:35.320]  whatever yeah people were i kept saying when that that came out there's one of the discussion
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:40.760]  now about podcasts over the last couple of weeks and i keep hearing the same phrase repeated which is
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:50.040]  podcasts are the new blogs which i disagree with because with a blog post presumably you would
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:53.480]  come up with an idea and you'd think through it and you would edit it and you would refine it
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:58.360]  and you'd go through a few drafts whereas on a podcast you you at least from what i know on the
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:02.920]  landscape it's more like sitting down and you hit recording having a conversation so it's not that
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:08.760]  podcasts or the new blogs it's more like podcasts or the new i.m. logs like this is a conversation
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:12.840]  there's nothing wrong with that my my only argument is that i think we could also be doing other
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:20.760]  things to push it forward yeah i totally agree with that i like for example i and i and no not that
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:27.480]  nobody has ever done it but like for something like WWDC you know instead of just doing one big show
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:31.400]  or like i've done last couple years like the live show which i could still do but why not in the
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:38.440]  course of the week do you know a couple of 15 minute episodes just with you know new stuff like
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:43.000]  if i don't have time on day one to do a real episode of the show why can't i have something that
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:48.600]  hits the feed and goes to podcast things with just like a 10 minute overview yeah and like build
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:53.320]  build around segments rather than my conversation right and it would be you know in loose terms
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:57.240]  because the analogy doesn't hold for long but it would be like the way that i'm doing fireball
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:38:02.040]  it's not just big long articles it's in fact most of it is you know real short things just
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:06.600]  links to other things why couldn't the feed for the talk show have a bunch of little things in it
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:12.920]  yeah yeah and and so it was i don't know Jason Snell was on unprofessional months ago and we had
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:18.520]  this like sort of meta discussion about podcasting and what it all means and i was thinking
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:26.760]  about video and how you'll you'll have you know a decent podcast that that gets a fair bit of
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:31.400]  traffic you'll get you know 10,000 people listening to an episode but you put out a youtube video
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:36.760]  and that could hit tens or hundreds of thousands of views make it hit millions of views there's
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:42.360]  people out there with with youtube channels that have uh 28 of 30 million subscribers to say nothing
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:47.240]  of the views they get just subscribers people who are actively subscribed to that channel and it
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:53.080]  just seems like there's this huge audience for for this kind of content that uh maybe we're just not
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:57.400]  we're not tapped into for whatever reason and i started thinking about that and i decided that whatever
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:02.520]  i do next i want to i want to try something new i want to i want to push a boundary that i don't feel
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:07.800]  like we've been pushing and something that i i definitely feel i haven't pushed yeah and for sure the
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:15.320]  way to do video i think is not the uh let's just record a podcast and we'll also let the camera on
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:23.080]  our computer stream as well we record a podcast you know what i mean like yeah how would
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:28.680]  stand in that these e-show was just them filming while they were recording the radio show
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:34.040]  yeah and that was a little bit higher production value i'm you know um like i'm thinking like
[2:39:34.040 --> 2:39:39.240]  like uh and i know some people like it some people actually like it but like the way that um
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:44.200]  with Leo's shows the guests are all you know there's also you know they're they're recording
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:49.160]  audio but they also have video and some of the people are in the studio and it works a little bit
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:54.280]  more because it looks a little bit more like a regular tv thing but like like whenever i've been on
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:59.320]  you know um mac break weekly or something like that it's just a stupid view of me here in my
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:05.320]  home office you know staring at the computer with headphones on and to me that's it's not really
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:10.200]  adding anything to me it's almost distracting i feel like i i would never enjoy listening to it
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:15.480]  watching it show like that like i don't want to see the guys record ATP that would i would
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:20.840]  gain nothing from that whereas i do think though that in theory there was something that like the
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:27.560]  ATP guys could do that would be video but it's a different thing right right and that's where i get
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:31.880]  excited about the idea of video as a medium and it's so funny to talk about this as if it's like
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:38.920]  some new frontier that we've just discovered whereas uh your son who's ten already knows everything
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:42.680]  about youtube and that's just like the world he lives in and like you're not somebody until
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:46.200]  you have a youtube channel well and it's funny because it's something you know it gets to the
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:51.320]  the weird notion that you have to have a name for a thing and that that the name for a thing can
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:58.200]  affect the way people feel and see and approach it you know and that uh it was possible to do
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:03.160]  what is exactly known as blogging before the word blog or web blog or whatever you want to call it
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:08.680]  hit but that it was only after we had a name for it that we all kind of agreed that you'd make posts
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:15.960]  and they would you know top down chronological order um it that it made the whole thing take off
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:21.800]  and yeah people were doing what we now call podcasts before the word podcast existed i mean
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:26.840]  they were doing it before there was even an iPod which is where the pod and podcasts come from
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:35.720]  you know i remember the first show i ever did was shan king's your mac life and it was
[2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:43.400]  i was after during fireball started so it was like 2002 um but the tech it was only 12 years ago
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:47.720]  but the tech was sold that there was no like way to do it over the internet i actually had to use
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:54.040]  like a telephone and call in and we talked for like two hours i think we need there needs to be a
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:42:00.840]  template for this kind of thing yeah in the in the way that um linked blogs sort of became a thing
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:05.880]  after caught key and during fireball like we had a template we kind of knew how that worked and so
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:10.200]  like oh well that that seems like a thing i understand it i can i can do that not to the same level
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.480]  of quality but i can make a thing to that pattern and it's it's not that there's anything wrong
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:20.680]  with following the pattern it's that uh after a while if no new patterns start to emerge then maybe
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:25.480]  we've got a problem yeah i think part of it you know if you want to have something that what did
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:30.600]  you call for like a tumblr for podcasts more or less yeah there's there's no like drop in
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:36.040]  easy system like it it seems like in the same way that anybody could sit down in front of tumblr or
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:41.080]  square space and and just make a website there's no way to do that for podcasts and it seems like
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:45.480]  there should be it seems like there should be really great software for making podcasts because
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:50.840]  everybody who writes software has a podcast now you think that this like it would just happen
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:56.280]  yeah i almost feel like the board podcast has become known as just two people or or or a panel of
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:02.360]  people just turning on record and talking and that the name at the word itself is sort of limited
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:07.400]  the idea of what it what it can be whereas if we just called them shows it would be a little bit
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:12.600]  more open-ended and might be might entice people more to do editing and i think also the word
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:20.200]  podcast has this like vibe of nerdy tech thing maybe i don't know about that i think it definitely
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:26.520]  has a sort of amateur ring to it just like blog did and it will will and will continue to wear
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:32.360]  off as more and more podcasts get better production wise and more and more people with you know
[2:43:32.360 --> 2:43:39.720]  like npr you know i like the millions of people who listen to cereal which is a podcast
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:43.960]  yeah and it's a it's a great example of what you could be doing with the medium and what's
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:51.080]  funny to me is audio as a medium is older than movies it's older than tv yeah that that we're
[2:43:51.080 --> 2:43:56.520]  not looking at that as the template is it's interesting to me like well you get like in comparable
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:03.080]  they're doing radio plays and that kind of thing you get my i forget the name of the show
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:08.120]  uh my curly and casey list talking about you know real life stuff these these are shows that are
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:12.920]  kind of if if the format isn't pushing a boundary then at least the subject matter is and that's
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:18.200]  like i i'd love to see more of that but also i'd like to see people trying things that aren't
[2:44:18.200 --> 2:44:23.720]  just audio like there are other things we could be doing and we have in the same way that
[2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:30.360]  we we it's so easy to sit down from a computer and put something on the internet that you've
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:37.960]  typed out or that you recorded an audio it's it's in fact even easier as bad as as weird as it is
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:42.120]  that the tools don't exist to make podcasting easier it's even weirder that we're not doing more
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:47.640]  video when those tools do exist for video i feel like it's an editing problem to them because i
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:52.360]  feel like the the tools to make these like we're and it will come eventually they'll probably
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:56.120]  come sooner rather than later but i feel like it's more than just about hitting record
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:03.880]  and then hitting stop and then somehow being able to quickly post what happened in between hitting
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:09.560]  record and stop like i'm not saying it's right it's i know your level of quality anything but
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:15.240]  uh the tools for editing and posting video from your phone way better than podcasting your phone
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:18.120]  yeah i think it's funny that we've got these super high-def cameras and there's always this
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:22.360]  big push every year when the new iPhone comes out we talk about the camera but there's been no
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:26.760]  major advancements to the microphone technology hmm that's a good point right like nobody would
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:32.200]  recommend or nobody would recommend uh recording a podcast using the built-in mic on an iPhone
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:36.440]  whereas you could record pretty you can record pretty damn good video with the microphone
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:41.000]  but the audio notoriously is terrible yeah i found you i go and i spend all this this damn money on
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:49.160]  a the canon uh 5d mark 3 and i find that when uh when i'm on vacation or from traveling i just
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:54.840]  shoot for my iPhone because those videos are stellar yeah especially with um a little bit of post
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:59.560]  processing to the video you can really get pretty fairly you know again the word professional is
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:05.000]  a little loaded and has other meanings but pretty close to what you know what better you can get
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:10.440]  better than what used to be considered professional video pretty quickly right yeah definitely
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:16.600]  and professionally loaded but okay so the video i shoot for on my phone i probably wouldn't put
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:22.120]  into uh the next James Bond movie but it works great on my youtube channel right and the shots
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:26.680]  look fantastic and i don't mean it looks great in an amateur this is something i threw together
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:31.400]  in a weekend kind of way i mean like you know on that side screen and that side and that kind of
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:38.280]  format that kind of content it works brilliantly yeah this is hide that video there's definitely
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:43.640]  something intimate about video too that is different and i tell you honestly i sometimes have
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:53.320]  trouble watching your better elevation videos because i know you i do and it's in a way that i have a
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:58.840]  lot of trouble listening to my own voice and show like if it was up to if it was up to me i couldn't
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:03.480]  edit this show because i just can't bring myself to listen to it i can listen to parts of it
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:07.320]  and you know i've done it enough for enough years that it doesn't it's not like an instant
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:13.480]  ik factor but it's it's really hard and i remember seeing like on letterman like i think Johnny
[2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:18.600]  Depp is one of these actors who who professors that he never watches his own movies yeah and i used
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:23.160]  to i used to think that was bullshit i used to think come on you're just you're being falsely
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:28.120]  modest but i actually think it's true now i think depending on your mindset you just can't bear to
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:33.560]  watch yourself yeah you can't enjoy it you can't see it the way other people do and it's like i kind
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:37.640]  of get that feeling when i watch your better elevation videos because i know you if i didn't know
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:42.200]  you it wouldn't occur to me you would just be this guy saying this interesting thing on a video
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:47.080]  but because i know you it's like wait that's Dave and he's like look at me because he's looking at
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:52.360]  the camera yeah guy mentioned something about being a little weirded out like i was i was staring
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:56.280]  him directly and like i was making eye contact with him i but i think it's because i know you
[2:47:56.280 --> 2:48:02.520]  i don't know but like your most recent one you did without you being on camera it was entirely
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:08.440]  visuals uh or not well everything's visual but like but yeah it's it's like it's all sort of
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:12.360]  almost like like slide where yeah and it was done in the style of and i got to give credit too
[2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:17.400]  it was done in the style of cgp graze videos yeah and that that as an influence has written all
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:22.120]  over it if you've ever seen anything that cgp graze done it's it's pretty obviously in his style
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:27.240]  and it was it partly an homage and it was partly me kind of playing around with it and and i
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:32.200]  realized that i had started to get into into habits with like the the way i was handling jump cuts
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:35.560]  and the way i was doing anything on that you're like i felt like well this is still really early
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:39.160]  and the whole point is to be experimenting so let's try something new it may maybe it's going to
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:42.680]  be terrible maybe it's going to be unwatchable but i'm just going to try something new and if it
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:47.000]  works it works if it doesn't yeah that was your episode called how to make a hit app i found that
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:53.240]  when super easy to listen to or watch you know like it went down like butter whereas all the ones
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:57.160]  where you're on camera to me not because they're you're bad or awkward or they're on
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:01.080]  professional but it's because they're you i know you there's something weird about that
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:05.320]  because i'm looking longingly into your eyes through your computer screen i don't know it's the
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:10.200]  way like whenever you see somebody you know on a video doesn't it have like a weird effect on you
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:16.440]  you know like i i you know i've seen letterman thousands of times over the years but like if somebody
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:21.800]  i knew was on letterman it's weird like it's weird when i see Clayton Morris on tv yeah
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:27.880]  right like yeah i can see that well maybe like now i'm just sort of thinking out loud but those
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:33.640]  Johnny i videos that they they show whenever apple releases a new product that same video where
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:40.360]  he's talking about the aluminium and how the thing is contoured in the whatever imagine the whole
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:45.400]  time he's talking he's staring into the camera right that would probably be a little off-putter
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:49.640]  so maybe there's maybe there is an element to there's an intimacy to eye contact that that
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:55.720]  is not necessarily good or bad but that there might be something too bad yeah maybe there's some
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:00.440]  kind of psychology but like you know the nightly news guys all look right the camera you know the
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:04.680]  teleprompter is set up so that it looks like they're looking at the camera yeah and i think it's it's
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:10.600]  maybe a instructional versus informative i don't know maybe there's got to be i'm sure somebody's
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:14.440]  done studies on this yeah i don't know look this stuff up figure out the hell i'm doing i don't know
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:18.280]  John Stewart does the for a whole first half of his show looking right at the camera yeah it's true
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.520]  could be about the distance from the camera to like the length of focal length of the lines i don't
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:27.320]  know but that's often a week where should people go where so you're not married to youtube in
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:31.560]  particular you might be switching to vimeo it's video well not not switching i'm i'm just trying
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:36.520]  the like youtube i know is a thing and for for searchability youtube is the second largest search
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:42.360]  engine and that's that's a real thing and i don't want to miss out on the kids in their youtube
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:46.840]  but i also some people just pay youtube in the hate google and that's you know at least an
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:51.080]  understandable position and if that's the case now i'm on vimeo because i got that killer deal
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:55.720]  so both like i'm just trying to i'm trying to make some stuff and see what works and
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:50:59.640]  whatever works you know when it comes to words it's like it's interesting to me and it's like you
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:04.840]  said with the kids in their youtube like i hear the word youtuber and to me it sounds dismissive
[2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:08.760]  like i would be hesitant to say that you're a youtuber now because i don't want to
[2:51:08.760 --> 2:51:13.880]  i don't i would it sounds to me like i'm insulting you like i'm calling like when people call
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:19.400]  deuce how they're Armstrong a mommy blogger it's like it's not a mommy blogger she's a writer
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:26.040]  she's a really good one but it's you know it somehow everything new i think sounds novel and
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:31.000]  diminutive like i'm sure the word like when they first started abbreviating television is tv it
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:37.800]  it's you know in the 40s or 50s it sounded like dismissive it's just tv it's you know it's crap
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:43.320]  whereas for me with that word right who was born in the era where tv is just almost
[2:51:43.320 --> 2:51:49.080]  unimaginably dominant dominating cultural force it just is what it is you know they could
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:55.160]  call it anything and it would just seem awesome because tv is awesome um you know i used to
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:52:00.360]  reject the word blog i really it just is not a good word to me i used to i stuck with calling them
[2:52:00.360 --> 2:52:06.120]  web blogs for as long as i could but now it's been long enough that it's you know it no longer
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:10.440]  feels like anything and i feel like youtuber is that way and i've noticed with Jonas like
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:15.640]  you know who watches obsessive amounts of youtube he watches far more youtube than he watches
[2:52:15.640 --> 2:52:23.480]  commercial television um and youtuber is just it's as no plus or minus meaning at all it just
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:31.560]  mean somebody who's shows you can watch on youtube you know that's it there's this really cool
[2:52:31.560 --> 2:52:37.320]  democratization of content effect where this is sort of like this was our dream right the internet
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:42.120]  dream was that anybody could make stuff and just put it out there right i'm playing music with
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:48.360]  some friends now and we're talking about like well in the 90s if you wanted to you know make a
[2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:51.640]  video that would be seen by anybody if you want to make a record you had to have a record deal and
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:56.360]  you had to have all this money and a cost of fortune now like we could we could record a song and
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:00.760]  make the video for it and have like the song on iTunes in the video on youtube by the end of the day
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:06.520]  well the big thing i remember from the 90s was pressing your own CDs and being you know given
[2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:11.080]  them out at you know if you're big good enough to even be booked at a venue then you give them
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:15.720]  out or sell them at the venue where if you're still below that you you know like on college campuses
[2:53:15.720 --> 2:53:22.120]  and stuff you know set up shop somewhere and just hand them out to people yeah now we live in this
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:25.720]  this time where you can just make stuff and put it on the internet and it's there for anybody
[2:53:25.720 --> 2:53:30.920]  and that's really cool and it seems like the people the like the most creative and the most talented
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:36.120]  and the people with the the access to the best equipment and technology should maybe be the ones
[2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:41.640]  making the best content but it doesn't necessarily seem to always be that way yeah and the last
[2:53:41.640 --> 2:53:47.640]  thing that really hit me about that and ties into your your podcasting episode the podcast intervention
[2:53:47.640 --> 2:53:55.080]  episode is it ties into the at first if you're older and you're used to the what's comes the new
[2:53:55.080 --> 2:54:01.400]  stuff seems amateur you know like whether it's blogging for writing or youtube videos five minute
[2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:07.400]  youtube videos for video and it just seems like well this is the lesser this is the the self you
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:13.800]  know what do they call it when you publish your own novel self published novel this is where the
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:18.760]  people who can't make it in the real world go and you know pretend like they're doing it and then
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:23.800]  you open your mind and realize that you know the good stuff could be coming from anywhere and you
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:29.240]  realize that the new format is the one that has the most freedom where you don't have to do it in
[2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:35.240]  30 minute increments because you're based on this TV model where everything has to be 30 60 90 minutes
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:42.680]  long to fit in a schedule and you can do something like say I have a six minute essay on making
[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:49.720]  hit apps and it can be exactly six minutes long it's exactly what I feel like if there's anything
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:56.280]  I've done you know successfully with form with during fireball it's it's right in a form where
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:01.080]  if I need if I need a thousand words I can use a thousand words if I need three thousand words I can
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:06.520]  use three thousand words and if I can make my point with three words I use three words and you
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:11.160]  could never do that in the print world you couldn't have a you know Paul Krugman's column in
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:17.640]  New York Times can't be seven words long it has to you know has to be 750 words or 350 or 750 I
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:23.880]  think is what they have yeah and I look at it your stuff and Marco stuff and Jason Snell stuff
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:29.000]  and it seems especially the three of you in particular it strikes me that you guys have these
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:33.160]  voices that people listen to and you've got these shows like literally voices that people listen to
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:40.360]  and and like there's an authority and a legitimacy to that and it would be cool to see that kind
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:49.160]  of weight put behind yeah podcast ideas yeah and so I think maybe the the even the word intervention
[2:55:49.160 --> 2:55:54.200]  and like maybe it came off a little bit more I don't know like I was condemning something that I
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:58.680]  meant for it too but like my my whole point my the whole spirit of all of this is like I just want
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:03.000]  to try new stuff and I want other people to try new stuff because I think that there's a lot of
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:08.360]  really smart really talented people with a lot of pretty advanced technology in their pockets
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:12.040]  all right where's the best place then where's the one place people can go if they want to see a
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:17.880]  couple episodes of better elevation uh youtube.com slash better elevation or vimeo.com slash
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:24.760]  better elevation or just usual for better elevation yeah I think that I think that works
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:40.440]  of angelic genitalia turtles screwing slash better elevation slash better elevation so hey let's talk
