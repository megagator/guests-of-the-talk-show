[00:00.000 --> 00:03.480]  Is this the show are we on the show is this the show could be
[00:06.520 --> 00:08.520]  Which
[00:08.640 --> 00:10.120]  2015
[00:10.120 --> 00:14.760]  Mega franchise sequel news. Are you more excited about this week?
[00:14.760 --> 00:17.120]  We've got Star Wars with a new trailer that came out
[00:17.460 --> 00:21.840]  like the week before Thanksgiving and we've got now as of today the day we're recording a
[00:22.280 --> 00:26.980]  title and cast for the 24th Bond movie I think it's
[00:26.980 --> 00:31.700]  to me Star Wars and only because I've seen some of it
[00:32.340 --> 00:40.200]  Getting to see the Millennium Falcon flying over some sand wherever that was tattooing or whatever was that like you get chills
[00:40.260 --> 00:43.500]  It's pretty interesting to me because they're probably my two favorite franchises
[00:44.060 --> 00:45.020]  That if you're at that
[00:45.020 --> 00:49.580]  Yeah, drawing a blank on anything else that you would call a franchise that I could put up there with them
[00:50.900 --> 00:53.380]  Well, maybe not up there with them. But like the the Marvel
[00:53.380 --> 00:59.900]  You know cinematic universe stuff. I like that stuff, but it's not there's no Marvel movie that's ever been announced
[00:59.900 --> 01:02.580]  that's gotten me anywhere near as excited as
[01:05.380 --> 01:09.620]  Either of these that maybe it's because it's so new like do you think maybe in 30 years?
[01:09.620 --> 01:14.500]  Do you think someday Jonas when they reboot the Marvel stuff Jonas would get that excited? I don't know
[01:14.500 --> 01:19.540]  I know I wouldn't I just don't think that they're of the caliber. Wait, you've seen Guardians, right? Yeah
[01:19.540 --> 01:23.940]  Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't say that it's of the caliber of Star Wars
[01:23.940 --> 01:28.660]  But I'd say that that's the thing that I've seen in theaters lately that gave me anywhere near that same level of feeling
[01:31.660 --> 01:33.340]  Yeah, but it's still a
[01:33.340 --> 01:38.180]  Guardian knowing that Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is coming out or when they when they announced the trailer or whatever
[01:38.180 --> 01:41.820]  It's there's no way that I'm gonna be as excited as I am about either of these movies
[01:41.820 --> 01:46.380]  Yeah, but that's cuz you grew up with Star Wars. Well, it's and grew up with James Bond. Maybe that's it
[01:46.380 --> 01:49.980]  I'm not even saying it's because the quality I'm just saying right right me
[01:50.940 --> 01:55.700]  and there's an it's just interesting to me though because they're the two my two favorite franchises and
[01:56.420 --> 02:01.580]  They're coming out in such close proximity to each other. So Star Wars is I don't think there's a date
[02:01.580 --> 02:04.020]  It's like just December 2015
[02:04.020 --> 02:09.140]  Yeah, December and then was it November 9th for bond or 6th or something, but it's a specific date
[02:09.820 --> 02:15.000]  Yeah, I'm surprised that the Bond movie. It doesn't even start filming until Monday
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.860]  So it hasn't even started filming it and it's gonna be in theaters in November
[02:18.860 --> 02:25.020]  I honestly thought that blockbuster action movies like that took more than a year. Well, maybe they they've
[02:25.540 --> 02:30.100]  They knew about the movie. So maybe like the visual effects are all done. They just got to go and shoot it real quick
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.780]  All the effects are canned
[02:33.780 --> 02:39.140]  But I guess it just goes to show how much longer production cuz and clearly these are two franchises that are known for
[02:39.340 --> 02:43.300]  For high production values, you know Bond and Star Wars. Yeah
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.860]  I
[02:44.860 --> 02:49.540]  Think it just goes to show how much more time it takes to make a truly effects
[02:50.620 --> 02:53.500]  laden film like a Star Wars film than
[02:54.500 --> 02:58.680]  Than a bond movie. I mean obviously there's a lot of effects work in a Bond movie
[02:58.680 --> 03:04.180]  But a lot of the sets and everything are practical and so I guess it doesn't take that much longer to edit
[03:04.660 --> 03:10.740]  You know after shooting then Star Wars. Well, yeah the visual thing not just that there's more visual effects
[03:10.740 --> 03:16.260]  But I don't I'm I haven't seen the script for the new Bond movie, but I'm guessing that none of the characters are fully CG
[03:16.900 --> 03:19.300]  Yeah, I mean, I hope there's no Jar Jar
[03:21.980 --> 03:23.420]  I
[03:23.420 --> 03:25.860]  I guess I just as curious to me
[03:25.860 --> 03:32.500]  I just seems that just seems like the pace of Star Wars seems exactly right to me and I know that if I were a kid
[03:32.940 --> 03:36.620]  Like when I was a kid and the Star Wars movies were new and there in the first one
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.380]  I thought it took impossibly long for each one to come out
[03:39.380 --> 03:41.140]  I I could not believe how you know
[03:41.140 --> 03:46.240]  They had to wait four years for the Empire Strikes Back. And well, I think it was another two years for Return of the Jedi
[03:47.140 --> 03:51.100]  Yeah, I couldn't believe I had to wait that long because I just I didn't have the patience
[03:51.100 --> 03:56.840]  but now that I'm an adult like ever since this new Star Wars movie was announced the whole thing where Lucas is selling it to
[03:56.840 --> 03:58.500]  Disney and
[03:58.500 --> 04:02.120]  you know that they're gonna have a new trilogy and it's gonna be
[04:02.780 --> 04:07.620]  You know basic gist it's gonna be the original, you know cast 30 years later
[04:07.620 --> 04:13.660]  you know more or less the same amount of time in the real world that's passed since Star Wars is gonna be in their universe
[04:13.660 --> 04:18.220]  what it is and then they announced JJ Abrams was gonna direct and the writers and etc and
[04:18.820 --> 04:20.140]  the the
[04:20.140 --> 04:24.020]  The schedule it just felt to me like well this all seems fair
[04:24.020 --> 04:25.940]  This seems like a reasonable amount of time
[04:25.940 --> 04:31.620]  Like this is proceeding at a reasonable pace and yeah 2015 sounds like a reasonable time for the movie to come out
[04:31.620 --> 04:37.580]  This Bond movie that they're not shooting until Monday coming out 11 months from now
[04:37.580 --> 04:42.180]  that seems crazy you say that but episode 1 Phantom Menace came out in
[04:42.700 --> 04:47.180]  99 and Attack of the Clones came out in 2001 and then
[04:47.420 --> 04:50.060]  Revenge of the Sith came out 2003 sets two years between movies
[04:50.060 --> 04:52.980]  You got to figure they probably took a little bit of time off between right?
[04:52.980 --> 04:58.020]  So let's say let's say a year and a half and do to do each one of those
[04:58.020 --> 05:02.340]  I guess I don't know and those are I mean they had to make Jar Jar
[05:02.340 --> 05:03.500]  They had to animate all those clones
[05:03.500 --> 05:08.280]  They had to do the I mean that there's a lot of not just make an explosion and put it over here and do some
[05:08.280 --> 05:11.060]  green-screen stuff but like fully realized
[05:11.060 --> 05:16.100]  Well more or less fully realized CG characters that have to be animated and all these little details. I
[05:16.980 --> 05:19.620]  Can see it I can see how that would take longer
[05:19.620 --> 05:23.780]  I think and if they can do that in a year and a half then it's not inconceivable that you I mean didn't they make
[05:23.780 --> 05:31.100]  One with solace and like a weekend. Yeah, I think the visual effects and everything just like knock that one out real quick
[05:32.500 --> 05:37.260]  I'm putting you on the spot here Dave because it's it's it is it's it is
[05:38.100 --> 05:45.340]  It is dangerous not dangerous, but it's hallowed the talk show ground talking about the Bond movies
[05:45.340 --> 05:52.860]  That's forgot about that and it is something that I you know purposely and deliberately did not you know in the old run with
[05:53.020 --> 05:58.100]  Dan Benjamin, we did the thing where we went through one through 22 and
[06:00.420 --> 06:02.420]  You know 22 be
[06:03.220 --> 06:08.500]  We included never say never again, which is not in the M production. So we did 23 episodes of the show
[06:09.140 --> 06:10.300]  where
[06:10.300 --> 06:15.460]  One bond movie per show we took, you know spent like an hour talking about
[06:16.660 --> 06:17.820]  Which was a lot of fun
[06:17.820 --> 06:20.600]  I think the longtime listeners of the show when people come up to me at
[06:20.900 --> 06:26.220]  WWDC or plays like that everybody I'd say half the comments about the show are always about the the bond series
[06:26.220 --> 06:28.220]  I remember I listened to those
[06:28.380 --> 06:32.020]  At a time when I hadn't even seen all the movies and but that part of the show
[06:32.020 --> 06:36.260]  You know has a lot more staying power than the first half of the show, right exactly evergreen
[06:36.260 --> 06:43.220]  All right, it's you know, pretty much as relevant and I didn't you know, we Dan and I broke up and he's no longer here
[06:43.860 --> 06:45.700]  and then
[06:45.700 --> 06:50.140]  Skyfall came out and so there was no episode where I did that
[06:50.980 --> 06:57.060]  And I don't think there ever will be I don't think be right to do it with somebody else and it's not gonna happen with Dan
[06:57.060 --> 06:58.100]  Benjamin
[06:58.100 --> 07:01.540]  But we can talk, you know without going for a whole hour about Skyfall
[07:01.540 --> 07:03.420]  We can still talk bond, but it's tough
[07:03.420 --> 07:06.840]  you're putting you on the spot here because people are gonna are gonna hold you up against the
[07:07.420 --> 07:10.260]  though the old stuff well, I
[07:11.180 --> 07:14.460]  Just hope I can live up to everybody's expectations. So you're more excited about
[07:15.540 --> 07:22.060]  Star Wars then then then Spectre, which that's the title. It's it's I don't know. It's uh, I
[07:22.700 --> 07:24.700]  Say yes, but because I've seen it
[07:24.900 --> 07:29.820]  like you ask you ask somebody who somebody with more than one kid who their favorite kid is and
[07:29.820 --> 07:33.820]  It's you can't really answer that question. But if one of the kids hasn't been born yet
[07:33.820 --> 07:36.220]  We're like, well, I like the first one better because I've seen it. Yeah
[07:36.220 --> 07:38.860]  Well one of the differences and I've been thinking about it a lot this way
[07:38.860 --> 07:39.820]  I just think it's so
[07:39.820 --> 07:44.820]  interesting that they're coming out at the same time and now the big news came out within a week or two of each other and
[07:44.940 --> 07:48.940]  They're too my two favorite thing. It just seems so serendipitous and I was thinking about it a lot
[07:50.660 --> 07:56.300]  I'm even thinking maybe I'll do maybe like a Star Wars special episode of this show. It's sometime this month
[07:56.300 --> 08:00.660]  Maybe like a you know, and the Star Wars theme call it a holiday Star Wars
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.460]  Star Wars holiday special
[08:03.780 --> 08:07.260]  And go just go two hours on something something, you know
[08:07.260 --> 08:12.740]  I could we could I could easily put together a guest or two and we could do three shows on Star Wars
[08:13.340 --> 08:17.980]  You could start a whole new podcast just talking about Star Wars. All right, but comparing it to the bond franchise
[08:18.580 --> 08:24.100]  Clearly one of the big differences is that we're up to bond 24 and Star Wars
[08:24.100 --> 08:27.780]  We've only had six movies or seven if you want to count the Clone Wars
[08:27.780 --> 08:31.980]  Which really I really don't think it's fair because even though it was released theatrically
[08:32.340 --> 08:37.260]  They just decided to put into theaters a 90-minute TV pilot
[08:37.900 --> 08:39.700]  Yeah, that's a funny way to look at it
[08:39.700 --> 08:43.900]  I think what was it was made as a TV pilot and they were like, this is actually pretty good
[08:44.220 --> 08:48.740]  You know, maybe you know, we'll you know reframe it for cinema, you know
[08:48.740 --> 08:54.460]  It's green side. Maybe they didn't maybe they didn't even maybe it was 1.85 which or something like that
[08:54.460 --> 09:00.100]  So which is close to the 69 I remember seeing that in the theater then walking out and just thinking what what was that?
[09:01.100 --> 09:05.900]  Like that wasn't that wasn't anything like I thought it was gonna be and I'm watching the cartoon like the animated series
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.900]  It was really good and
[09:08.740 --> 09:10.220]  Sometimes good
[09:10.220 --> 09:12.860]  Well, it wasn't it wasn't consistently good
[09:12.860 --> 09:19.100]  It wasn't I would I would say with my my most recent benchmarks for Star Wars quality being the prequel trilogy
[09:19.420 --> 09:21.420]  Clone Wars was pretty good. I
[09:21.900 --> 09:25.820]  Don't know. I think it was worse than the prequel toilet trilogy really
[09:25.820 --> 09:31.900]  Yeah, I don't I think it it always felt padded out to me. It always felt to me like they didn't you know, they
[09:32.420 --> 09:35.660]  Yeah, I think how many episodes did they do per season? Did they do 20?
[09:36.340 --> 09:39.420]  No, I thought it was less than that. I don't know whatever they did
[09:39.420 --> 09:44.820]  They only had about half as many that were decent and it always felt padded out and maybe cliffhanger shows
[09:45.140 --> 09:49.660]  Did you watch it while it was going? Yeah for the most part not like we but but
[09:50.340 --> 09:54.680]  Yeah, maybe that's it cuz I watched them all back-to-back. So I'd watch six or seven at a time
[09:55.380 --> 09:59.060]  And so that you if there's a bad one, it's kind of lost
[10:00.220 --> 10:05.540]  It's padded out by the good ones. So even if even if half them are bad, you're still kind of remembering more of the good stuff
[10:05.540 --> 10:08.100]  Yeah, I don't know. I just felt like overall it it it
[10:08.100 --> 10:09.700]  I
[10:09.700 --> 10:15.100]  don't know it was a lost opportunity and I felt like they had a lot of things that were repetitious and that took away from
[10:15.100 --> 10:18.420]  that the the prequel trilogy like the fact that
[10:19.660 --> 10:22.320]  obi-wan and Anakin had a bunch of
[10:23.300 --> 10:25.300]  encounters with
[10:25.460 --> 10:26.820]  Dooku
[10:26.820 --> 10:33.900]  Makes it changes the like the way the movies present it, you know, they had the the one encounter in the second movie where?
[10:33.900 --> 10:40.740]  Anakin lost his arm and obi-wan almost got killed and Yoda came in and rescued him with the you know
[10:40.740 --> 10:45.060]  Quick fight and then in the next movie and they made it seem as though look
[10:45.060 --> 10:49.460]  We haven't seen this guy since the last time when he fucked us up real good. Let's do this
[10:49.460 --> 10:51.460]  Let's do it right this time
[10:51.700 --> 10:57.340]  But in the meantime if you've watched the Clone Wars TV show they've fought against Dooku dozens of times in between
[10:57.340 --> 10:58.580]  Well in the movies
[10:58.580 --> 11:03.660]  It always seemed like there's a huge chunk of time that we just didn't get to see and it felt really awkward
[11:03.660 --> 11:09.380]  Because in the original trilogy the time between Empire and Jedi if you think about it
[11:10.180 --> 11:17.060]  There's probably some stuff that happened like the just getting Lando into Jabba's Palace and like getting everything set up to pull that off
[11:17.220 --> 11:21.500]  Must have taken some time, but you're not really missing out on much by not seeing those things
[11:21.500 --> 11:26.380]  All right, you can still get a sense of time has passed, but you don't need to know exactly how much time right?
[11:26.380 --> 11:31.220]  and there was a reference in Empire Strikes Back where when Han decides to
[11:31.220 --> 11:33.220]  To
[11:33.260 --> 11:36.860]  Leave Hoth to go pay Jabba off and it's like
[11:38.500 --> 11:40.100]  He mentions like
[11:40.100 --> 11:41.780]  This is where we need live audience
[11:41.780 --> 11:47.740]  It's like Ord Mandel or something like that that there was like a bounty that they encountered a bounty hunter recently
[11:47.860 --> 11:51.980]  Yeah, who tried to kill Han and you know, you know just little things like that
[11:51.980 --> 11:53.300]  Yeah, you get hints at it
[11:53.300 --> 11:57.980]  You get hints that there there's been some time has but the difference between the gap between episode 2 and episode 3
[11:57.980 --> 12:04.060]  It just feels like we missed a movie. Yeah, if you're watching it sitting down to watch it
[12:04.060 --> 12:07.020]  Even if you watch them back to back it feels like there's an entire movie missing
[12:07.020 --> 12:12.260]  Which is one of the big failings of the prequel trilogy. Yeah, but so I in that regard
[12:12.260 --> 12:17.340]  I didn't mind the Clone Wars going into some more of that backstory stuff because I felt like I missed it to begin with my
[12:17.340 --> 12:19.340]  Yeah, I just I just feel like it could have been better
[12:19.620 --> 12:24.700]  Yeah, well my trouble with it was that it never really felt like Star Wars. Yeah, I agree with that, too
[12:24.700 --> 12:29.860]  There's like a style change that it was fine. And once you kind of ease into it, like once you get used to it
[12:29.860 --> 12:31.180]  It's pretty it's pretty good
[12:31.180 --> 12:38.020]  It's entertaining but it never really felt like canonical Star Wars and the way that the Expanded Universe stuff always kind of feels like fanfiction
[12:38.300 --> 12:41.740]  Yeah, yeah, just didn't quite feel like it same thing with scene in the movie
[12:41.740 --> 12:47.460]  So I still say there's only six movies. I would love that and that's the big difference is we've only had six movies over
[12:49.380 --> 12:51.660]  What 37 years
[12:51.660 --> 12:57.020]  Whereas we've had 24 Bond movies in 50 years. So
[12:57.620 --> 13:01.700]  it's you know clearly a different pace because there was a huge gap between the
[13:02.340 --> 13:07.460]  Trilogies and we've had another gap since the last trilogy that really helps to soften the blow
[13:07.460 --> 13:12.340]  I think if this next Bond movie isn't very good. That's okay, right?
[13:12.340 --> 13:18.220]  And I think that's actually where Star Wars especially now that Disney owns it and you know, this is what Disney does
[13:18.220 --> 13:22.620]  It's they're going to you know, they they keep franchises going we're going to see you know
[13:22.620 --> 13:26.500]  There's there's going to be more Star Wars trilogies after this one whether it's you know
[13:26.500 --> 13:31.660]  A thousand years ago or in the future or whatever and some might be good and some might be bad
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.660]  But eventually it will you know?
[13:34.100 --> 13:39.620]  It'll work itself out and there'll be ebbs might be that you can you can get by with ebbs and flows
[13:39.660 --> 13:44.740]  but the fact that there have only been six is what makes people bitch so much about the
[13:44.740 --> 13:49.780]  The prequel trilogy because we've only had six and three of them were kind of duds
[13:50.220 --> 13:57.260]  Yeah to make a comparison in another medium you look at a TV show like Sherlock and each season is only I think three episodes
[13:57.860 --> 14:00.900]  So it's if one of them is bad. It stands out way more
[14:00.900 --> 14:05.220]  Yeah, where is it like a normal TV show if it's 20 episodes in a season if one's bad
[14:05.220 --> 14:11.080]  You don't just wait till next week. All right, right and it's like I've always said it like comparing baseball to football
[14:11.080 --> 14:17.080]  Yeah, it's really drastic because baseball plays a hundred in US plays
[14:17.400 --> 14:21.920]  162 regular season games a year and football and the NFL they only play 16 games
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.640]  So like if your favorite team only lose loses four games in a row
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.040]  It's not good in baseball, but it's you know, four out of 160
[14:30.040 --> 14:32.480]  It's a long season if you lose four football games in a row
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.880]  That's a quarter of your season is you've just lost all in a row right baseball you lose a game
[14:36.880 --> 14:39.440]  You just wait until the game they play later that afternoon, right?
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.960]  but I do feel though that the pressure is really on Star Wars at this point though because everybody was
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.680]  Consensus is that they were so disappointed in the last trilogy
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.640]  Consensus I think is the right word. These things are always going to be subjective
[14:53.640 --> 14:59.200]  But I think that if you polled people if this were a democracy if opinions were democracy
[15:00.400 --> 15:04.600]  They'd just be expunged from the record if we could if we go back in time and unmake those movies
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.080]  I bet most people would elect to do that
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.520]  I'm I'm not of that opinion and I've spoke it's been a long time
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.080]  I think since I've talked Star Wars on this show
[15:11.080 --> 15:18.200]  I'm nowhere near as down on the prequel trilogy as a lot of my peers are of our generation and maybe it's partly because I
[15:18.200 --> 15:24.320]  Have a son who you know is so young and I've said this before it was with moltz a while back
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.320]  But in in Jonas's peers, they don't really see the difference between a trilogy
[15:29.320 --> 15:34.000]  there's just Star Wars movies and for a long time he was even confused about the
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  the chronology of them
[15:36.920 --> 15:38.920]  and I know some people, you know, like I
[15:39.400 --> 15:45.120]  Syracuse that famously has like wouldn't even let his kids watch the prequel trilogy good parent
[15:46.320 --> 15:53.200]  yeah, I understand why as a cinema fan you would do that, but you're robbing your kid of
[15:54.600 --> 15:58.680]  You know something that is pierce now they did, you know, they like the clone troopers and stuff like that
[15:58.680 --> 16:04.800]  It's it's it's different for them. I don't know and I think it's very hard to compare to when
[16:05.240 --> 16:07.640]  You live in a world where you can watch them on demand
[16:07.640 --> 16:13.200]  Whereas I grew up and it wasn't I don't think they came out on home video until like I don't know the late 80s
[16:13.520 --> 16:19.080]  So there's plenty of crap that we watched when we were kids that we really liked and we can look back as adults and recognize
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.960]  It was terrible. You could only see the Star Wars movies in cinema and you know
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.520]  They did re-release them like in between so like you could go see Star Wars two years after it came out
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.880]  Again, but you know, you were limited by how many times your parents would let you go to the movie theater. Yeah
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.560]  Yeah, I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15
[16:39.320 --> 16:41.320]  Which was like what like 10 years ago?
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.440]  Closer to 2018. Did you watch them? Yeah, so your your initial exposure was in
[16:48.200 --> 16:49.560]  home video
[16:49.560 --> 16:55.680]  Like I remember I was in the comics. I was yeah like 13 like between 11 and 13
[16:55.680 --> 16:56.960]  I when I was really into comics
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.200]  I would go to the comic book stores and they would have like Star Wars stuff and it always looked to me
[17:01.200 --> 17:04.520]  Maybe it was the haircuts or the quality of the printing but it always just looked old
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.460]  It looked like old 70s like like the original Battlestar Galactica or Flash Gordon like it had that vibe
[17:10.460 --> 17:13.000]  It's like this is stuff that's like it's gonna be old and cheesy. I don't want to bother
[17:13.000 --> 17:20.120]  and it wasn't until a friend had gotten I think for his birthday the VHS set like one of the VHS VHS sets that came
[17:20.120 --> 17:21.480]  out before the
[17:21.480 --> 17:23.760]  re-releases the re re re re releases
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.800]  And he's like no you got to see this and he puts in the tape and I think that Kim and all of his other friends
[17:29.800 --> 17:31.280]  That were there everybody fell asleep
[17:31.280 --> 17:35.800]  So the movie ends and I'm still like glued to the edge of my seat. My life had been changed
[17:36.320 --> 17:41.480]  I'd still remember seeing it the first time and I was I don't know it must have been must have been the first run
[17:41.480 --> 17:43.480]  77 so
[17:43.640 --> 17:47.000]  I was only like four years old and I remember going with my dad
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.720]  To the theater to see it and my dad I didn't go to lots of movies in the theaters
[17:53.720 --> 17:55.720]  But you know, I went to a fair amount
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.280]  and
[17:57.280 --> 17:59.580]  You know, my dad would often be the one to take me
[18:00.320 --> 18:03.920]  And my sister's two years younger than me and a lot of times, you know, she was only two
[18:03.920 --> 18:06.160]  I guess then so she probably wasn't even going to movies yet
[18:06.680 --> 18:10.080]  And I remembered a general feeling that my dad
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.840]  Didn't really give two shits about the movies that I you know kids movies
[18:15.560 --> 18:19.400]  You know, he went he has a good sport about it. But you know, it's you know, it's
[18:19.960 --> 18:25.400]  Most of the movies I went to see when I was four or five years old were pretty crappy and not very interesting to a
[18:25.400 --> 18:27.280]  36 year old man. I
[18:27.280 --> 18:34.080]  Remember the opening of Star Wars and that opening shot of the Star Destroyer and it's just on this immense screen
[18:34.080 --> 18:39.480]  So it really looks big and it's really one of those things like one of the things the original trilogy
[18:39.480 --> 18:41.640]  I think did so well is take advantage of
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.640]  Cinema meaning that when something looks big on screen it it is big
[18:47.960 --> 18:49.880]  right as opposed to like
[18:49.880 --> 18:54.440]  When you see something that's shot more like a TV show and it's just close-ups and it's just you know
[18:54.440 --> 18:57.680]  You're just seeing somebody's face huge. It doesn't give you the sense of enormity
[18:58.360 --> 19:02.340]  That the sense of enormity that that Star Destroyer gives you in a theater
[19:02.340 --> 19:06.180]  I remember my dad like turning to me and he was just like whoa
[19:06.180 --> 19:12.100]  Like my dad was blown away and I remember thinking that that was even as amazing as the movie is that holy cow
[19:12.100 --> 19:16.260]  My dad is blown away. It's just seared in my memory watching that the opening of that
[19:16.260 --> 19:19.260]  I wish that my first exposure had been in a theater
[19:19.260 --> 19:26.460]  Although, you know, maybe it looking back maybe the fact that the first time I saw it was on somebody's crappy CRT television in the 90s
[19:27.100 --> 19:32.500]  VHS just makes it that much clearer to me how good the story was or how compelling those characters were I
[19:33.380 --> 19:35.380]  remember to another
[19:35.380 --> 19:42.840]  I do remember the I also remember the first time I saw Star Wars on home video. It was my friend Joe's
[19:43.400 --> 19:44.700]  birthday
[19:44.700 --> 19:50.340]  Must have been I don't know what year it would have been probably around like 84 or five
[19:50.500 --> 19:52.500]  maybe we're around 11 or 12 and
[19:53.700 --> 19:59.000]  So it's a Jedi. Yeah, I think it was post-jed. I think but it was it was
[19:59.380 --> 20:02.700]  a sleepover birthday party with about a dozen of us and
[20:02.700 --> 20:04.300]  And
[20:04.300 --> 20:09.380]  Joe's dad was all cagey and acted like he had this secret this awesome secret
[20:09.380 --> 20:16.260]  He waited until after we had our pizza and stuff. And this is before there were any legit home video versions. They weren't released yet
[20:16.860 --> 20:23.260]  Joe's Joe's dad had a bootleg version of the Empire Strikes Back the best. Holy shit and
[20:25.100 --> 20:29.100]  And we couldn't believe well honestly and I knew Joe's dad and you know
[20:29.100 --> 20:33.140]  He was a lawyer and he was he was the dad who drove his car really fast
[20:33.140 --> 20:37.220]  so like if you if like a bunch of us were going to the mall and two dads were driving you wanted to go with
[20:37.220 --> 20:40.500]  Joe's dad because he'd drive he had like a Peugeot and he would drive it really fast
[20:42.780 --> 20:46.700]  It just seemed too good to be true though, I really thought that he was setting us up I
[20:47.700 --> 20:52.540]  Couldn't believe that I was gonna get to watch Star Wars in a house. I thought he's he's shitting us
[20:52.540 --> 20:54.540]  He's gonna put that in and it's gonna be
[20:54.540 --> 20:59.780]  Mary Poppins or something he put it in and holy shit. It was Star Wars and it was the other thing
[20:59.780 --> 21:01.420]  I remember very distinctively
[21:01.420 --> 21:03.780]  It was because it was bootleg somehow
[21:05.440 --> 21:12.380]  What they did for the aspect ratio was it wasn't pan and scan and it wasn't letterboxed it was squished
[21:12.860 --> 21:14.460]  optically
[21:14.460 --> 21:18.140]  Yeah, gross, but it was still none of us had ever seen it
[21:18.140 --> 21:22.940]  there were no legit versions of any Star Wars movies out on the market at the time and
[21:22.940 --> 21:27.580]  It was funny. It's just one of those things like you got used to I'd say within like 10 minutes
[21:27.580 --> 21:33.420]  He got used to it and it was just awesome. It was absolutely blowaway awesome
[21:33.860 --> 21:40.480]  During the like the late 90s just after Napster. Did you did you get into the thing of downloading movies at all?
[21:41.420 --> 21:45.860]  No, I never I I could never be bothered with I did a little bit
[21:45.860 --> 21:50.740]  but it always seemed like too much work and it was always so hard to find it and then you had to like
[21:50.740 --> 21:55.820]  Splotch them all together. Yeah to get him to play on anything. I had you had to
[21:56.740 --> 22:01.340]  Had to post process and you know all that shit that Don Melton's script does
[22:01.340 --> 22:03.540]  I just can never get into it
[22:03.540 --> 22:09.420]  I always seem like too much work and I never ever ever ever want to watch a motion picture on it on a computer
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.660]  Well, I was you know, 18 years old
[22:11.660 --> 22:16.220]  I didn't know anybody the idea that I could see a movie but that was still in theaters was very compelling to me
[22:16.220 --> 22:20.500]  But the problem was that they would always be out of sync halfway through the movie
[22:20.580 --> 22:24.880]  like there's no way to get the audio and the video to line up the way you would expect them to and I
[22:25.780 --> 22:30.460]  To this day. I have no idea technically what would even cause that problem or why anybody would find that to be acceptable
[22:30.460 --> 22:32.460]  but I remember watching a ton of movies where
[22:32.500 --> 22:36.700]  By the end the audio is out of sync with the video and the aspect ratio is just super squished
[22:36.700 --> 22:38.140]  You can get used to the aspect ratio
[22:38.140 --> 22:40.780]  I don't know that you can get used to the audio being out of sync
[22:40.780 --> 22:44.620]  I you just gotta turn out you gotta turn off the part of your brain that gives a shit
[22:44.620 --> 22:47.620]  No, cuz these aren't movies if you wanted to see this movie done
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.620]  Well, you would have gone to the theater to see it. Anyway, I guess
[22:50.540 --> 22:55.020]  Well, I wonder how many movies I thought were terrible. They're actually pretty good. I don't know. That's a good question
[22:55.900 --> 22:57.900]  So what'd you think of the Star Wars trailer?
[22:59.060 --> 23:03.280]  Well or teaser we got to talk about that lightsaber. Yeah, I
[23:04.300 --> 23:08.380]  Didn't think anything of it. I was surprised that I was mostly offline at the time
[23:08.380 --> 23:10.340]  I was it was Thanksgiving weekend. We were traveling
[23:10.340 --> 23:15.560]  So I I heard that the trailer came out, but I didn't want to watch it on shitty screen
[23:15.560 --> 23:18.500]  so I just put it off and I waited till we got home and then like
[23:18.660 --> 23:23.540]  The couple of days after Thanksgiving I watched I wanted to see it. I wanted to see it for the first time on my TV
[23:24.860 --> 23:30.280]  I've of course noticed the lightsaber, but I didn't really think anything of it because I thought that the
[23:32.820 --> 23:37.080]  The the prequel trilogy established that there's some degree of
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.880]  Of
[23:38.880 --> 23:43.240]  Individuality and lightsaber design especially among the Sith and I'm okay with that
[23:43.240 --> 23:46.520]  Yeah, cuz Dooku had his weird curved thing. That was fine
[23:47.200 --> 23:49.880]  Darth Maul, of course with his famous double and that was a scene
[23:50.440 --> 23:55.440]  When the when the Phantom Menace trailer came out the very first trailer was a huge deal
[23:55.440 --> 23:58.680]  And this was right around the time when video on the internet started being a thing
[23:58.840 --> 24:05.600]  like finally we had enough bandwidth to get video and there there were like a million parodies of the episode the Phantom Menace trailer like
[24:05.600 --> 24:10.200]  There's a South Park version. I remember pretty clearly everybody was doing a thing with the trailer
[24:11.040 --> 24:13.040]  but before the days of YouTube
[24:13.680 --> 24:16.400]  And I remember that moment when you see Darth Maul
[24:16.920 --> 24:17.960]  And he you know
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.480]  The snap hiss and the red blade comes out and you get excited and then the other one comes out
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.120]  Yeah, and you just kind of like you lose your mind for a second
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.980]  Like that's that's so why didn't I ever think of that? Well, that's exactly like what I would have drawn as a kid
[24:30.980 --> 24:37.940]  This had kind of a similar effect where I'm watching the trailer and you hear the snap hiss and the red blade comes out
[24:37.940 --> 24:41.260]  And there's like this weird crackle effect. You don't know it's like it's the rain what's going on
[24:41.420 --> 24:46.260]  It's like a broken lightsaber and you're like the me at least I'm tuned into that for a second
[24:46.260 --> 24:50.460]  I'm excited like I get chills and then these little tiny blades come out the side
[24:50.540 --> 24:55.900]  So my reaction went from whoa to wait what I just you know, I don't know I accept it
[24:55.900 --> 24:59.620]  I didn't I didn't you know, it's obviously a weird design
[24:59.620 --> 25:04.260]  I think if I were a Jedi or a Sith I would not use a lightsaber like that
[25:04.700 --> 25:06.700]  You're just that much more likely to hurt yourself
[25:07.260 --> 25:07.860]  You know
[25:07.860 --> 25:13.660]  I don't I feel like if you if you know the force you the the force will keep you from hurting yourself with it
[25:13.660 --> 25:16.980]  But it doesn't do what is it? What is it for if it's a cross guard?
[25:16.980 --> 25:22.780]  I mean the internet has done a pretty good job of showing that that's a terrible design if somebody's blade slides down
[25:22.780 --> 25:26.060]  It's gonna cut the metal part not the blade. It's gonna cut right through it
[25:26.060 --> 25:29.060]  Yeah, but maybe it
[25:29.460 --> 25:33.500]  Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's supposed to be something like a cross guard. Maybe it's just supposed to look cool
[25:33.500 --> 25:36.200]  Maybe it's just you know, the guy thinks it looks badass. I don't know
[25:36.380 --> 25:42.100]  I've always had the impression that you don't really need a cross guard on lightsabers like you do on real swords because it seems to
[25:42.100 --> 25:47.540]  Me like when two sabers connect they kind of stick and there's no way to slide it. Oh, really?
[25:48.540 --> 25:50.380]  I've never gotten that out of it
[25:50.380 --> 25:55.180]  But I know it seems like it seems like when they lock up and they make that two sabers locked up sound
[25:55.180 --> 25:57.340]  It doesn't seem like there's any kind of friction between them
[25:58.300 --> 26:02.780]  For a long time watching the the obi-wan vader fight at the end of a new hope
[26:02.780 --> 26:07.820]  I thought that like obi-wan's blade was shorting out because the angle at which that scene was filmed
[26:08.220 --> 26:12.620]  His lightsaber kind of tilts back and it looks like the blade shortens
[26:12.620 --> 26:17.300]  So I thought for a long time that his blade was shorting out and that's where the dramatic tension in that scene came from
[26:17.300 --> 26:21.580]  Wasn't a literary list was at the angle. Yeah, it's funny a lot of that
[26:21.580 --> 26:26.420]  It's funny because how the the saber fights get ever more elaborate, you know
[26:26.420 --> 26:32.140]  The the one the one in Star Wars a new hope is is so pedestrian
[26:33.660 --> 26:40.580]  Because it's old guys it's a couple old guys. Well, and it's an old guy a David Prowse wasn't old at the time
[26:40.580 --> 26:45.860]  He was actually pretty much in the prime of life, but he had a helmet on I just met the characters
[26:45.860 --> 26:50.900]  Obi-wan and Vader were supposed to be yeah, but that's why that's not why it was like that. I think it was big
[26:50.900 --> 26:55.260]  I think partially Alec Guinness was was physically a little a little limited
[26:56.060 --> 26:58.060]  Because he was kind of old
[26:58.340 --> 27:02.380]  And I think David Prowse famously couldn't see shit out of the Darth Vader helmet
[27:02.380 --> 27:07.900]  He just couldn't see so there was like, you know severe limitations as to what there are any stuntman who was in there
[27:07.900 --> 27:14.120]  You know could could could see and it was combined with I think the optical needs of the way that they you know
[27:14.120 --> 27:20.200]  The way that they had the sabers made so that they were made out of the glow glowy stuff that they could easily
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.360]  Rotoscope the colors on yeah, no, maybe
[27:23.960 --> 27:25.640]  You know and they just never done it before
[27:25.640 --> 27:29.400]  I mean and it's still see because it had never been done before and it just looked so cool and
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.640]  You know, maybe somebody had had the idea of laser swords, you know in pulp science fiction
[27:35.640 --> 27:38.000]  You know for a hundred years over and over and over again
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.560]  but nobody had ever made one that looked like it was really a real thing which is you know, the
[27:42.560 --> 27:46.280]  The awesome part about lightsabers and a new hope they looked real
[27:48.320 --> 27:50.680]  But that lightsaber fight was pretty that was pretty weak
[27:51.080 --> 27:58.320]  Let me say this before before we go on to I am super super anti spoiler like I I know
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.720]  Nothing about this nudes episode 7 other than the basics of you know that you know
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.500]  Who's directing it the cast the rough time frame and that's it. I don't follow any of the websites
[28:09.500 --> 28:12.960]  I don't know anything. I'm the same way and I don't want to watch the trailer. I
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.680]  I trusted I
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.860]  Might skip subsequent trailers. I trusted the fact that it was a
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.880]  Immediately billed as a teaser
[28:23.960 --> 28:28.600]  Yeah, yeah, like calling it a teaser made me feel very safe about watching it
[28:28.600 --> 28:33.040]  I get I don't like watching trailers for movies and it kind of comes
[28:33.640 --> 28:35.640]  Really comes down to the Hunger Games
[28:35.660 --> 28:39.320]  When I went to see the Hunger Games is because my friends wanted to go see movie and that's what they picked
[28:39.320 --> 28:42.960]  I knew nothing about it other than the poster had a girl with a bow and arrow
[28:43.360 --> 28:45.840]  Like I didn't know I didn't even know it was a based on a book
[28:45.840 --> 28:48.400]  I went into that movie knowing nothing and knowing nothing
[28:48.400 --> 28:52.780]  I enjoyed it and I was kind of hung up on how much I enjoyed
[28:53.200 --> 28:55.600]  every moment of that movie was a surprise to me and
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.360]  I realized that most of the time if I watch a trailer for something
[28:59.360 --> 29:02.800]  It's a movie that I want to see and if I want to see the movie
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.000]  I already know going into the trailer that I want to see the movie. I know now I'm
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.600]  I mean they can Disney can just have my money today. I'll pay for the ticket now
[29:10.640 --> 29:13.240]  There's no way I'm not gonna go see the next Star Wars movie
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.720]  So what does watching the trailer get me?
[29:16.080 --> 29:23.040]  It can only show me things that I would get to see later and be surprised by yeah, the modern era of trailer
[29:23.880 --> 29:29.520]  Editing which is evolved very very clearly into the form of Kim
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.300]  How much can we condense the entire plot of this movie? Right?
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.940]  I mean minus maybe like a just the ultimate
[29:38.820 --> 29:41.140]  plot twist at the end everything but
[29:41.500 --> 29:45.860]  Yeah, and if you're a movie person then you like even while you're watching the movie
[29:45.860 --> 29:52.220]  You'll start to figure things out and if they give you enough plot points in the trailer your moviegoer story
[29:52.900 --> 29:57.740]  Follower mind is gonna fill in those gaps and you you know what the story's gonna be before it all down the theater
[29:57.740 --> 30:01.140]  It always surprises me too when and I'm not a big
[30:01.140 --> 30:04.580]  Believer in like the three-act structure
[30:04.580 --> 30:11.020]  I don't think that any you know, I don't think most good films adhere to it in a very formal sense
[30:11.020 --> 30:15.060]  I just think it's the basic sense that you know, you know, you want to have a beginning middle and end
[30:17.860 --> 30:22.700]  But in loose terms it always surprises me when a trailer that has my attention and hey
[30:22.700 --> 30:26.260]  This looks like a good movie file this way make a Vesper, you know note, you know
[30:26.260 --> 30:29.600]  Make a note in Vesper to you know, put it on my movies to watch list
[30:29.600 --> 30:31.600]  it
[30:32.320 --> 30:35.960]  Once the trailer gets to that part where I'm into it I this is a movie
[30:35.960 --> 30:40.400]  I'm making a note now because when it comes out, I want to see it and then it keeps going
[30:41.240 --> 30:46.100]  I've already been there and it keeps going and they're clearly going into act two, right?
[30:46.100 --> 30:49.800]  They're clearly going into the middle of movie and it's like why why are you showing me this?
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.780]  I don't want it. You already had me. Why why are you doing this like say something?
[30:54.780 --> 31:00.040]  Let me let me just experience this and I do think too though as somebody who has a rudimentary
[31:00.200 --> 31:07.160]  You know dilettantes and interest in making movies and has you know, I should I made student films in college and I you know
[31:08.040 --> 31:12.000]  Diddle with video now and think about it. I understand, you know, how
[31:12.540 --> 31:19.840]  How fun it can be to edit video but how hard it is to edit video the way that you that trailer?
[31:20.040 --> 31:22.080]  editors can condense a
[31:22.080 --> 31:28.320]  a two-hour motion picture into 90 seconds that spoils almost all of it is
[31:28.960 --> 31:30.160]  incredible
[31:30.160 --> 31:33.560]  artistically as like the craft of editing cinema how how
[31:34.280 --> 31:38.360]  how how they can but it's the effect of it is so
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.760]  It's just so
[31:41.760 --> 31:48.340]  Disappointing well ever since Hunger Games and I've this I've established this rule every time I break it every time I watch a trailer
[31:48.340 --> 31:53.140]  I regret it. The most recent example is I watch the trade. Did you see a million ways to die in the West?
[31:53.160 --> 31:55.160]  No, that's what's his name?
[31:56.160 --> 31:58.360]  Yeah, Seth MacFarlane. Yeah, I haven't seen that. Is it good?
[31:59.280 --> 32:02.560]  It might have been but if you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie, right?
[32:02.560 --> 32:04.840]  That's you know what I have seen the trailer and I know exactly
[32:05.620 --> 32:08.960]  That's every funny thing that happens that movie is in the trailer. Yeah
[32:09.240 --> 32:09.760]  No
[32:09.760 --> 32:15.880]  That's a good example of a movie that I probably would have put on my to to watch list but didn't because I felt like the
[32:15.880 --> 32:21.820]  Trailer spoiled at all. Like I don't understand. I was I was hoping cuz Family Guy as a show like it or hate it
[32:21.820 --> 32:26.060]  It's pretty dense with jokes. So I went in thinking well, yeah, they put some stuff in the trailer
[32:26.060 --> 32:30.000]  But there's gonna be a lot of stuff. No, no, those are all the jokes
[32:30.480 --> 32:36.340]  Yeah, and to the point when did when the things happened that happened in the trailer and people in the theater are laughing
[32:36.340 --> 32:38.340]  I'm kind of wondering why
[32:38.480 --> 32:42.080]  Did you not see the trailer? Yeah. How is it? How is this still funny to you?
[32:42.080 --> 32:46.160]  I remember very specifically there was a movie and I don't know why
[32:48.080 --> 32:51.760]  It was a movie with Robert De Niro and
[32:53.680 --> 32:57.640]  He was a like a bounty hunter going after Charles Grodin
[32:58.480 --> 33:04.960]  It was an 80s movie. Let me look it up De Niro and Charles Grodin. I have no idea what that would be Midnight Run
[33:05.520 --> 33:06.480]  1988
[33:06.480 --> 33:12.440]  Mmm now for whatever reason I saw that was in now that was like when I was in like junior high high school
[33:12.440 --> 33:15.680]  I was going to movies every week. That was just what we did
[33:15.680 --> 33:18.320]  You know, it's like a group of teenagers as we went to movies
[33:18.320 --> 33:23.600]  So I saw tons and that was like peak theater watching movies life of for me
[33:23.600 --> 33:27.200]  I saw the trailer for that movie like a dozen times and
[33:27.840 --> 33:31.160]  Charles Grodin is like a guy with a bunch of phobias and
[33:31.160 --> 33:37.480]  and Robert De Niro is like a bounty hunter who's paid to bring him in because he's got like a bail outstanding
[33:37.600 --> 33:42.120]  So I do remember this so it's like a buddy, you know, it's like a mismatched, you know
[33:42.120 --> 33:44.160]  It's the yeah and the tropes category
[33:44.160 --> 33:49.880]  it's De Niro is a tough guy and Grodin's at the opposite and he's got all these things and he says like
[33:50.520 --> 33:55.760]  You know, there's this line where Charles Grodin says something like I've got agoraphobia agoraphobia act
[33:55.760 --> 34:00.120]  You know something else phobia claustrophobia and De Niro says if you don't shut up
[34:00.120 --> 34:02.120]  you're gonna have fist a phobia and
[34:03.160 --> 34:08.760]  it was in the trailer every all the time and then we went to see the movie and he gives the line in the movie and
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.040]  It's it was you know, and everybody in the theater laughed and I remember thinking why is everybody laughing?
[34:13.160 --> 34:16.440]  Surely you've seen this because it's in all the trailers. It was in the commercials
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.840]  It was like the signature spoiled joke of the movie. But yet for some reason the theater still laughed
[34:22.440 --> 34:27.440]  Yeah, I don't get it. Well, that's just I think it's just something I think I was too cynical at times a teenager
[34:27.440 --> 34:33.360]  I think it's the way that in a crowd people pay the movie people want the movie to be good because they took two hours
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.560]  Of their lives to see it and they spent the money to get the ticket they and they're you know in a community
[34:38.640 --> 34:43.360]  You know a group like they wouldn't laugh if they were watching it at home if it was spoiled
[34:43.360 --> 34:46.000]  But you'd watch when you're in the theater like that's the difference
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.080]  Yeah, and that was even a really funny movie if I'm watching it by myself at home. I
[34:50.080 --> 34:57.620]  I rarely laugh out loud, right? It's a laughter is a is like a laughter at a comedy movie is a is like a group thing
[34:57.680 --> 35:04.160]  did you see somebody was just somebody maybe it was you somebody posted a link to the the original trailer for a new hope and
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.860]  Rewatching that after watching the episode 7 trailer
[35:10.460 --> 35:17.000]  Was a real a really interesting juxtaposition in the editing styles because then back in the 70s
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.080]  It was things like meet Luke Skywalker young adventurer
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.640]  and he's like you give a little bit about the character and then it talks about and then they're gonna have these crazy adventures and
[35:24.640 --> 35:31.040]  They do these things and they encounter these villains and you get excited about the type of story more than any specific thing
[35:31.040 --> 35:35.080]  That's gonna happen. They don't give it anything away at least in the in the dialogue, but if you watch
[35:36.040 --> 35:38.920]  The the video that's going by if you've seen that movie
[35:39.520 --> 35:45.240]  There's like wow that they kind of give everything away, but you don't know that I think I think I know which version of the trailer
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.880]  You're talking about. I think it was one and they didn't even have the the music yet. Is that the one? Yeah. Yeah
[35:49.880 --> 35:52.720]  Yeah, they didn't even have the music and so there's this weird
[35:52.800 --> 35:55.800]  We'll have to see if we can get a copy of that for the show notes, but there's a weird
[35:57.920 --> 36:04.340]  It's like you know in your mind that without the John Williams music Star Wars wouldn't quite be Star Wars that it's as essential
[36:04.400 --> 36:10.640]  Maybe even more essential than any you know any cast member more than the logo or you know
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.060]  It's it's that essential to the fabric of what it feels like to be a Star Wars movie, you know that it's you know
[36:17.060 --> 36:22.280]  You don't even have to think too much about like the role that that musical scoring can play in cinema
[36:22.320 --> 36:28.180]  But then to see a trailer where there is no actual John Williams Star Wars music you just think man
[36:28.180 --> 36:31.440]  This is just this is like a saltine without salt
[36:32.880 --> 36:36.240]  This just isn't right. What's that that opening?
[36:36.240 --> 36:40.560]  Mmm note, just that one. Yeah is enough to get you excited
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.680]  No clearer example than in the new teaser when I see the Millennium Falcon and you hear the the score swell up
[36:46.040 --> 36:51.140]  You get chills, right? At least I did. Yeah, there's like a real like I could feel like I got butterflies
[36:51.140 --> 36:53.680]  I got really really excited because it's like everything that
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.760]  Everything I need to tell me that this movie is a Star Wars movie is right there on the screen
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.800]  Give me give me the Millennium Falcon and a John Williams score just even the first note of the John Williams score and I'm in
[37:04.800 --> 37:11.360]  I'm hooked. You've got my money. Yeah, so kudos to JJ Abrams and to Disney and everybody else that they made a completely
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.960]  Well, not completely spoiler free but as spoiler free as anything could be a true teaser
[37:16.300 --> 37:21.040]  Well, we were talking about this on Twitter the the question of the stormtrooper and whether or not he's really a stormtrooper
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.360]  I mean, there's a lot of room for speculation so much room for speculation that the speculation it's purely fun
[37:27.360 --> 37:31.480]  I don't feel like we can ruin it. I don't feel like saying that guy in a stormtrooper outfit ruins anything
[37:31.480 --> 37:35.640]  I don't know who he is. I don't know why he isn't as easy a stormtrooper or is he a guy who was disguised as
[37:35.640 --> 37:38.120]  Right the old Han and Luke trick, right?
[37:38.120 --> 37:41.940]  And so we end up having a conversation like we did on Twitter about you know
[37:41.940 --> 37:46.280]  What does this mean and what could but there's no way we can there's no way any of that discussion would ruin anything
[37:46.280 --> 37:50.580]  I like how this episode is turning into the Star Wars special episode of the talk show
[37:51.320 --> 37:55.520]  Let's take a break and and thank our first sponsor. It's
[37:56.280 --> 37:58.280]  our good friend George Lucas
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.560]  Uh, no, it is our good friends at need and EED
[38:04.660 --> 38:09.660]  Need is a refined retailer and lifestyle magazine for men
[38:10.300 --> 38:12.940]  I've had people since they've started sponsoring a show who've
[38:13.900 --> 38:18.700]  who've mentioned that man you say lifestyle magazine for men and it's like your eyes start rolling back in your head and
[38:20.540 --> 38:24.100]  My friend Jim ray, you know Jim ray, yeah, I know Jim ray
[38:24.100 --> 38:29.600]  At Jim ray is by far and away the best dressed friend that I have Jim Jim ray
[38:29.600 --> 38:36.240]  I always looks like he's just stepped out of a goddamn magazine ad he is well groomed. He is well tailored
[38:36.240 --> 38:38.940]  He it's it always looks stylish
[38:38.940 --> 38:41.600]  I always feel like a slob next to him no matter how well dressed I am
[38:41.820 --> 38:44.140]  Jim ray told me and this is great that
[38:44.380 --> 38:50.860]  He heard the show and he he heard me say that need is a lifestyle magazine for men and it made him his eyes roll
[38:50.860 --> 38:53.740]  Even though he clearly reads things like that so he can stay up on fashion
[38:53.740 --> 38:56.340]  But he checked him out anyway, and then he said to me, you know
[38:56.620 --> 39:02.260]  They're like the lifestyle magazine for men who roll their eyes at the words lifestyle magazine
[39:02.820 --> 39:07.800]  And I was like you'd mention him because I was I went to look at the website earlier when I was talking to Matt
[39:07.860 --> 39:12.700]  Alexander the guy who runs it I went to the website to check it out and my first thought was
[39:13.020 --> 39:19.020]  This this looks like what Jim ray would do. Yeah, it's it but I love Jim's description
[39:19.020 --> 39:22.740]  It's the lifestyle magazine for men who don't like lifestyle magazines for men
[39:22.740 --> 39:26.620]  and it is a source and curate a
[39:27.060 --> 39:33.500]  Selection of exclusive products from brands around the world things like shirts slacks pants shoes watches
[39:35.900 --> 39:37.420]  Anything like that
[39:37.420 --> 39:39.100]  and
[39:39.100 --> 39:40.620]  it's
[39:40.620 --> 39:45.180]  Curated meaning there's you don't go there and have to pick between 40 different styles of pants
[39:45.180 --> 39:49.940]  they go they have like three like a pair of jeans a pair of khakis and
[39:49.940 --> 39:52.700]  Something else and that's it
[39:52.700 --> 39:57.140]  if you like one of those three you pick your size and you buy it and if you don't wait till the next edition and
[39:57.860 --> 40:01.220]  Maybe they'll have something else that you like but that way you're not sitting there making choices
[40:01.220 --> 40:05.180]  They've made these choices for you and you see something you like you get it
[40:06.500 --> 40:11.060]  They just launched their holiday collection. This is volume 2.1 just came out

[40:59.380 --> 41:00.860]  I forget what they call it

[41:06.460 --> 41:07.480]  It's kind of a weird setup
[41:07.480 --> 41:12.280]  But if you if you're if you're as hardcore about your ice as I know some people are this is the way to go

[42:54.400 --> 42:56.400]  Oh, oh, it's a it's like a
[42:56.960 --> 42:58.840]  travel toiletry bag, ah

[43:11.080 --> 43:14.600]  Get 90 bucks worth of freeze a 90 buck Dopp kit. I
[43:15.320 --> 43:19.920]  Should probably get that I needed a toiletries kit. I just carry my stuff around and like a ziplock bag
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.840]  Savage no, I don't I have something a little better in the ziplock, but it's pretty shitty
[43:24.840 --> 43:28.840]  Anyway, anybody who emails them after ordering will receive

[43:36.520 --> 43:42.240]  Addition.com great great sponsor. It's like what a great way if you want to if you care about looking good
[43:42.240 --> 43:44.960]  But you want to put zero effort or thought into it. This is a great way to go
[43:44.960 --> 43:46.960]  I don't even mean that a bad way. I mean that very
[43:46.960 --> 43:54.480]  Complimentary to the service that you that we could just go to a website and click on something
[43:54.480 --> 43:56.400]  All you have to know is your size
[43:56.400 --> 43:58.120]  And you can look good. I'm credible
[43:58.120 --> 44:04.440]  I've always thought I've said this before in many different contexts, but it is a general rule of thumb. You seldom go wrong by
[44:05.400 --> 44:11.120]  Thinking that the most interesting of anything is at the extremes the very biggest the very smallest
[44:11.120 --> 44:16.840]  The most complicated the most simple, right
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.400]  Those are the areas were to me anything whether it's something you're buying a device or whatever. It's just the most interesting
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.160]  And I would say like need is almost like the antithesis of Amazon you go to Amazon and it's like that
[44:30.160 --> 44:35.880]  They even call it the everything store, right? It's it's and it's not only does Amazon sell everything
[44:35.880 --> 44:41.360]  They have these partnerships with all these other things. So you search for something and you get results from other stores. Ah,
[44:41.880 --> 44:44.840]  You go to need and they've got like one pair of jeans right now
[44:45.640 --> 44:51.680]  That's like here's your jeans this month right done, right? Do these look good? Yes. All right, give us your size
[44:51.680 --> 44:55.620]  We'll send them to you. No, I haven't done the pricing yet, but I'm tempted
[44:55.620 --> 45:00.060]  I wonder how much it would be to just every month you just buy everything they offer
[45:00.400 --> 45:04.800]  Yeah, I bet it wouldn't be that much money. Just have like a standing, you know, have your size have your size
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.520]  You know your shirt size and your pants. I it's just done standing order. Yeah, let me subscribe to that
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.160]  Like let me just get like here's my size. Here's my money charge my card every month
[45:13.160 --> 45:15.880]  Whatever it's gonna cost and just send me the new stuff. Yeah a
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.600]  clothing of the month Club
[45:20.160 --> 45:22.800]  All right Star Wars trailer should we dissect it
[45:22.800 --> 45:27.440]  I say I'm gonna save everything else about Star Wars for a future episode, but we could dissect the trailer
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.240]  We can dissect the trailer. I think who do you think the narrator is? I
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.480]  I know the actor the okay. It's Andy Serkis, right? Right
[45:37.240 --> 45:41.640]  there's some speculation that it was Benedict Cumberbatch, which was uh, I can hear it but
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.280]  Be a be weird choice. Yeah, unless Khan shows up in this movie, too. I am
[45:47.960 --> 45:51.440]  presuming it feels to me cinematically like the narrator of
[45:51.920 --> 45:58.360]  The film or of the teaser is the Sith or Sith light guy we see with the red lightsaber
[45:58.360 --> 46:00.360]  That that's him. I
[46:01.560 --> 46:03.560]  read it as
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.720]  Like some sage like character, but I guess there isn't there's like an air of darkness or villainy to the voice
[46:09.720 --> 46:13.280]  Yeah, he sounds a little Sith like sounds a little bit like Darth Maul actually
[46:13.840 --> 46:19.800]  Hmm Jonas thinks though Jonas watched it with me. He thinks that the character with the red lightsaber is a woman
[46:19.800 --> 46:21.800]  He thinks it's like a witch. I
[46:22.280 --> 46:27.720]  That would be interesting. I think he's thrown off though by the sort of kilt like
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.440]  Thing that the guy is wearing now because that's pretty tip. I mean even
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.800]  Darth Vader kind of wears us. Yeah, but Jonas, but he but his cape usually hides it
[46:38.480 --> 46:40.880]  Yeah, well see I don't I don't read it as a woman
[46:40.880 --> 46:45.480]  But I think it's it's interesting because the the way the figure the posture of the figure
[46:46.080 --> 46:48.080]  sort of masks gender
[46:48.480 --> 46:51.740]  Like if they were just standing up straight you could you kind of read it
[46:51.740 --> 46:57.200]  Yeah, I you know it it could just be it honestly after he said that to me. I rewatched it
[46:57.200 --> 46:59.320]  I've watched it. I get the dozen times
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.600]  I did rewatch it and after he at first I thought no way and then I rewatched it and it does seem possible at least
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.960]  and it did it makes me realize that even as open-minded as I try to be I have a
[47:10.480 --> 47:14.140]  Older, you know, I'm the old dad who just assumes if you have a red lightsaber
[47:14.360 --> 47:20.160]  You're a man, even though I've seen that, you know, the Clone Wars thing with Asajj Ventress and you know
[47:20.480 --> 47:22.960]  But Jonas as you know as a much more
[47:22.960 --> 47:27.280]  I think you know, he was much more open to the idea that that character could be a man or woman
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.640]  Well, it's nice to see the Sith being more inclusive
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.780]  Do you think in this do you think that the lightsaber might have something to do with that?
[47:36.780 --> 47:41.560]  I mean if that's the case, I don't mean the the weird cross guard thing, but like the weird kind of
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.520]  Almost flame looking blade rather than just a solid. Yeah, there's a John there's an article put it in the show notes
[47:48.520 --> 47:55.840]  I already have it written down John Brownlee in Fast Company Fast Company's design blog has a thing in defense of the new Star Wars
[47:56.040 --> 47:57.040]  lightsaber
[47:57.040 --> 47:58.240]  and
[47:58.240 --> 48:04.720]  His argument is that each Jedi's at least the major characters, you know
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.280]  Like some of the scenes in the prequel trilogy where they had like a hundred Jedi running around, you know
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.280]  And you know, they were just all copy and paste jobs, you know, you get blue you get green you get blue
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.320]  You get green, but they only had a year and a half to make this move that but the major characters all had a lightsaber
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.560]  That said something about their character and I think that's true, you know
[48:23.560 --> 48:28.600]  And you know like OB like he says like obi-wan's lightsaber is just plain and he's you know
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.200]  And it's simple and it's elegant. It is exactly what he says. It's the elegant weapon from a more civilized time
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.380]  Even in the original Darth Vader's lightsaber had a black, you know more black than chrome on the handle
[48:41.380 --> 48:44.920]  Just looked a little bit more into the time. Here's the only one who had a red lightsaber
[48:45.560 --> 48:51.480]  Right, which looks it just at least to my eyes, you know, and maybe it's just I'm trained it
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.920]  But it just seems more natural that the bad guys would have read right reds the color of yeah
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.480]  We didn't see green until return of the Jedi and then I guess the only reason we saw green is because it showed up
[49:02.480 --> 49:05.500]  Better against the the blue sky. Yeah on Tatooine. Yeah
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.500]  No, that was actually yeah
[49:07.500 --> 49:13.380]  That's the exact story is that they were they they had they just they at the time they had just thought blues
[49:13.380 --> 49:19.880]  Good guys are blue bad guys are red and then they went to do it and they'd never done one outside before and they
[49:19.880 --> 49:21.880]  Were like wow, this doesn't look good
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.360]  So they said we'll make it green
[49:25.380 --> 49:31.920]  Yeah, it works and then even episode one. We still only see red green blue wasn't until episode two
[49:31.920 --> 49:37.680]  That we start to see other colors and I think the the first non red green blue we saw was mace windows
[49:37.680 --> 49:39.680]  Right the purple, right?
[49:39.860 --> 49:44.900]  The story goes that Samuel L Jackson specifically requested purple. Yeah, I've heard that story
[49:44.900 --> 49:50.260]  I heard that then that Lucas said no, no, no, and then like a day later Lucas came back
[49:50.260 --> 49:52.260]  He's you know what? I thought about it. Sure
[49:53.060 --> 49:55.060]  What do you think is going through Lucas's head?
[49:55.580 --> 49:59.700]  What do you what do you think his thought process is like is there like some canonical?
[49:59.700 --> 50:06.680]  Here's how the gems inside the thing work or or is he just like trying to hold steadfast to some
[50:07.620 --> 50:10.580]  Ideology he has about not well. No, he's totally a kiss changing
[50:10.580 --> 50:12.900]  I don't know somehow it worked though for me
[50:12.900 --> 50:16.980]  like it's one of the things little things that worked for me in the prequel trilogy where is it's
[50:17.860 --> 50:22.380]  somehow in a world where we went from an original trilogy where there were only
[50:23.900 --> 50:26.040]  Three Jedi four if you count Vader
[50:26.040 --> 50:31.480]  Right. Oh, I bet that was I bet it was the the scene at the the end of clones where you've got
[50:31.480 --> 50:34.200]  You know a thousand Jedi on the screen at the same time, right?
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.360]  How do you how do you more visually establish that mace Windu is above all of these guys that he's you know?
[50:39.360 --> 50:46.660]  He's you know in a you know in a trilogy filled with at some points in some scenes hundreds of Jedi
[50:47.040 --> 50:51.780]  How do you have how do you establish that? This guy is a cut above or two cuts above?
[50:51.940 --> 50:54.400]  Well, not just that but the if I'm Lucas
[50:54.400 --> 50:57.080]  I go home and I think to myself well
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.680]  I've got to do this scene with a thousand Jedi on the screen at once and if all you see is
[51:01.120 --> 51:05.160]  Being in blue. Oh, you can see where you could see where mace Windu was in the movie
[51:05.260 --> 51:10.720]  Yeah, it's like well not just that but you could realize well if I'm gonna give people like yellow and pink and all this other
[51:10.720 --> 51:13.880]  Shit, I should just give him the purple lightsaber. So
[51:14.440 --> 51:18.560]  This guy fast company Brownlee. He his theory is that
[51:19.280 --> 51:22.720]  Because at the end of Return of the Jedi the only two Sith left
[51:22.720 --> 51:30.480]  The Emperor and Vader are killed that anybody whoever this guy is if it is a Sith to restart the Sith
[51:30.480 --> 51:33.160]  He didn't have a master to teach him how to make a lightsaber, right?
[51:33.160 --> 51:39.560]  And so he had to do it on his own and that's why it crackles and sizzles and seems a little bit less a little bit
[51:39.760 --> 51:42.020]  You know a little bit less technically well put together
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.080]  another assumption of the male pronoun
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  Yeah, well, I
[51:48.640 --> 51:52.240]  Don't know he she I don't know what to say there. But yeah this character. No
[51:52.240 --> 51:56.320]  Oh, I'm not not to you but more to just like the idea that even this guy
[51:56.560 --> 51:59.440]  All right. No, I I think that that would be a really
[52:00.240 --> 52:02.240]  interesting switch
[52:02.560 --> 52:04.760]  To it would it would play against our expectations
[52:04.760 --> 52:09.600]  but in my mind story wise I would have assumed that whoever the new Sith is would have been like a
[52:09.840 --> 52:16.080]  Student of Luke's or something that has gone to the dark side rather than somebody who just like woke up one day
[52:16.680 --> 52:18.680]  although, you know if if
[52:18.680 --> 52:26.400]  The good guys can show up as ghosts and help guide other good guys like like obi-wan and Yoda did with Luke
[52:26.920 --> 52:33.000]  Maybe there's something to the Emperor was able to do the same thing to restart shit. Well, and the other thing too that
[52:33.880 --> 52:36.480]  The that the whole thing with there's only two at a time
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.080]  That's a dumb rule. That's a dumb rule and it was clearly already broken
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.960]  They just didn't call them Sith. Like yeah, there were already, you know, there was the video game
[52:44.960 --> 52:47.880]  I mean again, what's canon and what's not anymore is up to for date
[52:47.880 --> 52:52.680]  But there was the one I think it was actually called that wasn't it called like the secret apprentice where Vader had a secret apprentice
[52:53.120 --> 52:56.080]  You probably the force unleashed, right?
[52:56.080 --> 53:00.800]  so he had a secret apprentice and the you know, even if you'd say well a video game is in Canon
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.800]  I think the Clone Wars show is and
[53:04.200 --> 53:09.520]  You know, there was Asajj Ventress who was like a secret apprentice to Dooku so there were
[53:10.560 --> 53:12.560]  you know, there's there's a
[53:13.600 --> 53:15.160]  Established
[53:15.160 --> 53:17.920]  Idea that there are Sith like force
[53:18.560 --> 53:21.960]  users who are trained by the Sith who just aren't called Sith and
[53:22.920 --> 53:25.960]  Use red lightsabers and you know, it could just be one of them
[53:25.960 --> 53:31.800]  I I would say that because what we get the the always to thing it's from that line of dialogue from Yoda
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.880]  Nice is always to there are and I think that that
[53:35.840 --> 53:37.840]  the more I
[53:37.920 --> 53:44.720]  Don't know forgiving reading of that line would be that what he meant was there's always gonna be more if we see one
[53:44.720 --> 53:47.400]  There's got to be another one right always a master and apprentice
[53:47.400 --> 53:53.320]  Not that there are only two exactly two, but there are always at least two. They're always coming pairs, right?
[53:53.320 --> 53:56.600]  Right, like we've we've seen this one dude. There's gonna be another dude
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.480]  We don't know if this is the master or the apprentice, but there's gonna be and somewhere out there. There's another dude
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.880]  It just seems it's like you said it's such a stupid rule that if they if they're if their goal was to overthrow the Jedi
[54:07.880 --> 54:12.600]  Order over there's hundreds of them. All right, we're gonna overthrow these guys and we're only gonna have two of us
[54:12.600 --> 54:16.180]  Do you think like somewhere along the way as they're passing down the stories?
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.480]  Like one of the guys when he's training his new apprentice
[54:19.480 --> 54:24.160]  Maybe just leave out the part where everybody before you including you has killed their master
[54:24.760 --> 54:28.600]  You just leave that out of the history so that you don't plant that idea in your friend is his head
[54:30.160 --> 54:35.040]  Because to me I'd be like, you know what fuck it. I'm not training an apprentice. I'm just I'll be the last one
[54:35.040 --> 54:36.400]  I'll live forever. It's gonna be great
[54:36.400 --> 54:39.960]  I think it's cuz I think the idea there was that they always you know
[54:39.960 --> 54:44.320]  That each one of them is so arrogant and so confident in their you know
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.480]  Dominance over their apprentice that they're they're not they always think that this can't happen to me
[54:48.680 --> 54:53.840]  But when you're like the 301 and you know, you know from history that that's always gone the other direction
[54:54.080 --> 54:56.080]  That's not a reasonable thing to think anymore
[54:57.080 --> 55:03.160]  Right. It's like I know you and I trust you, but if I knew that if I knew that the last 30 people
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.120]  who who hired a
[55:06.120 --> 55:10.640]  You you you I designer that's to work with them got killed by them
[55:11.080 --> 55:16.580]  Like it really I'm pretty sure that you're I I trust you you seem like a non psychopath. You seem like a friend
[55:17.440 --> 55:20.840]  But I probably wouldn't I probably decided not to hire a UI designer
[55:21.400 --> 55:23.680]  Right, it would be a good choice
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.680]  They are to go wrong
[55:28.120 --> 55:32.360]  Like do you think in like Sith orientation? This is they're like, okay
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.540]  Well, here's here's the story of how literally everyone before you has killed their master including me
[55:38.320 --> 55:40.320]  But don't do that
[55:40.920 --> 55:42.920]  Please
[55:47.240 --> 55:49.840]  What else happens in the trailer we see some stormtroopers
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.520]  X-wings. Yeah, the the new stormtroopers and that's I think notable
[55:54.960 --> 56:00.900]  That says a lot about the movie and the the time period and the attitude of the movie that we see stormtroopers
[56:00.900 --> 56:02.100]  where
[56:02.100 --> 56:09.420]  At some point in the last 30 years in a galaxy far far away. Not only is the Empire still going
[56:10.180 --> 56:17.840]  They've hired some industrial designers to come in and redo some shit. Yeah, it seems like a slightly tweaked stormtroopers
[56:18.820 --> 56:20.540]  Yeah, it's not it's not a huge departure
[56:20.540 --> 56:25.960]  Like they feel like stormtroopers right in the same way that the clone troopers kind of feel like stormtroopers, but more
[56:25.960 --> 56:31.560]  Just on the other side of it like there hasn't been even though it's been a longer period of time
[56:32.080 --> 56:37.600]  It seems like there's been less advancement, which is what you would expect from an empire. That's just lost their Emperor
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.920]  All right, but there's still you know, there's still designers working out costume details and and maybe there's some new ships and stuff
[56:42.920 --> 56:48.680]  But notably the TIE fighters we see look like and yeah, they look like TIE fighters. Yeah, they look like TIE fighters
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.600]  the x-wings we see look pretty much like x-wings but with a little bit of advancement and so in the same way that
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.480]  The original trilogy the universe felt lived in like everything had carbons going on. Everything was a little broken a little bit shitty
[57:02.280 --> 57:05.920]  It kind of seems like we're on an upswing like the economy is getting better
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.480]  But it hasn't turned around so much like there's been a long period where things still kind of sucked and there wasn't a lot of
[57:13.640 --> 57:17.120]  Technological advancement which is what I would expect to have happened there and it feels authentic
[57:17.120 --> 57:20.960]  yeah, my my read just based on the teaser is that
[57:20.960 --> 57:23.960]  the the the
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.600]  Tremendous victory of both blowing up a second Death Star and killing the Emperor and Vader and
[57:32.240 --> 57:39.440]  Leave leaving the entire, you know, which presumably the entire, you know, leadership structure of the Empire was you know
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.920]  Based on the Emperor's extraordinary, you know abilities
[57:45.880 --> 57:47.080]  Has
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.440]  Crippled the Empire but like didn't defeat them. They were still in it, you know
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.060]  The entire vast Imperial Army their military remained loyal to the cause of the Empire
[57:57.400 --> 58:00.440]  And that the rebel is the rebellion is still thus
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.400]  Still like the scrappy upstart planets that are fighting against them
[58:04.400 --> 58:11.460]  So like it maybe like knock them knocked it down said that they were on even terms and it's been like a 30-year war of attrition
[58:11.460 --> 58:19.220]  Oh, that's interesting. That's my read from the from the teaser. Yeah. Yeah, I could get that and maybe like not
[58:19.220 --> 58:22.700]  not necessarily that the Empire's got their back up against a wall, but more that
[58:23.300 --> 58:30.320]  They had to decentralize leadership or something or maybe somebody stepped in and there's a and lost so many resources that they're no longer
[58:30.500 --> 58:32.380]  They're no longer
[58:32.380 --> 58:38.180]  Advancing at the extreme pace that they were when we last saw them right like when we last saw them
[58:38.180 --> 58:43.900]  they went in just 20 years from the prequel trilogy to the
[58:45.780 --> 58:50.300]  To the original trilogy they went from those Republic starships
[58:50.300 --> 58:55.180]  We saw in the Clone Wars to the Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, you know that we see, you know
[58:55.940 --> 58:58.980]  lots of technical advancement in their starship design and
[58:59.500 --> 59:01.180]  armored design in 20 years
[59:01.180 --> 59:04.540]  but now in 30 years they've made very little progress at all and
[59:04.540 --> 59:08.380]  The rebellion hasn't really either because they're still you know up against it
[59:09.420 --> 59:13.100]  That's my room, but they still had time to redesign the stormtrooper outfits
[59:13.700 --> 59:19.500]  Not really redesign. I would say it was more like like a dot one like a like a point release
[59:19.500 --> 59:19.740]  Yeah
[59:19.740 --> 59:25.500]  Like a 1.1 releases of the armor and there could have been like some kind of necessity there
[59:25.500 --> 59:27.860]  Like maybe they just ran out of that armor
[59:27.860 --> 59:32.620]  I'm a little surprised that the TIE fighters look exactly the same though because I I always thought as a kid
[59:32.620 --> 59:38.460]  based on Return of the Jedi like when the TIE interceptors came out which were much more like
[59:39.540 --> 59:41.580]  like Vader's prototype from
[59:42.540 --> 59:45.620]  1977 with like the tie advance. Yeah. Yeah with the
[59:47.020 --> 59:50.020]  You know the curved wings like the the three panel
[59:51.180 --> 59:55.560]  Almost like octagonal. We have the the bombers had that too
[59:55.560 --> 59:58.900]  I thought that the tie interceptors were like the new models that were coming in
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:05.020]  But who knows what the explanation maybe there are more like maybe I'm just thinking the the economics of video games where?
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.860]  in the games any of like the
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:14.940]  like the the x-wing TIE fighter games the the TIE fighter has no shields and
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.180]  just kind of sucks, but the TIE interceptor has shields and
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.740]  I said that one or the advance one of them it can it can even go to light speed and
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:30.640]  It just seemed to me that we'll just stop using the TIE fighters. They they have no shields
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:37.140]  Like you're just sending people to their death with those things. Yeah, they well they went for a quantity over quality approach
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.380]  We'd rather have a hundred TIE fighters than ten, you know x-wings
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.620]  Well, it's clearly the mark of a military that doesn't feel like it has much in the way of opposition
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:52.340]  the TIE fighters were there to show off how many they had it to like just be a
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.240]  An imposing presence right and that they were not designed for real bad, right?
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.700]  And they didn't really even value the lives of their own troops
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.620]  Yeah, because everybody was the Empire so we'll just replace you maybe even at the time
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.740]  Maybe they were still using clones for this some of this stuff
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.980]  I thought the other one of the other interesting things in the teaser is that
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.960]  None of the shots of the ships are in space
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:20.520]  That when you see the x-wings, they're flying really low like almost right out right around a few feet above the wall surface
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.520]  of some body of water and when we see the Falcon and the TIE fighters coming at it, it's right above the
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.220]  Surface of the planet it just now occurs me. You're right
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.100]  So we've got a teaser for a movie called Star Wars that doesn't show a single star, right?
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.700]  I don't think it did well, maybe there's at the end when the crew and the credit comes up
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.380]  It shows a star field when the logo comes up, but we don't see any footage of space
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.220]  Yeah, right. We don't see and we don't see any big space cruisers
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:52.740]  We don't see any you know Star Destroyers or whatever the Republic has. Wow. Well, I hope nothing happened to space
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.420]  Pretty cool. What do you think about the idea that they didn't show any of the that the only face?
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:03.220]  They show is the the new character the the black guy in the stormtrooper outfit. What's it? The actor's name?
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.680]  Oh, I forget. He's somebody that I hadn't heard of before. Yeah, British, dude
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.700]  I think it's it's I
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:18.620]  I want to believe I sincerely want to believe that everything about this teaser was a well-thought-out decision
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.700]  John Boyega
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:26.260]  Yeah, yeah, that's right. I want to believe that everything we were shown we were shown for a reason
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.080]  Yeah, I want to believe that not only were we not shown
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:37.520]  Well, no, the the other face we see is the the girl riding on the oh, right. Okay, right. Yeah, who just looking at her
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.620]  She's got like a real
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.580]  The Natalie Portman Carrie Fisher kind of look. Yeah, and so it wouldn't be a big jump
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.540]  I think most people are assuming that she must be like Han and Leia's kid
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.600]  but the the characters we see the faces we do see the
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.100]  They're new characters. These are people we have no idea who they are
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.180]  This isn't Harrison Ford. This isn't Mark Hamill
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.920]  It says to me that they they want our expectation going in to be
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.840]  that we're going to be exposed to new things not just
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.880]  Fan service rehashing of old stuff. Yeah that said it ends with a shot of the Millennium Falcon
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.840]  right as we hear the the John Williams score fanfare swell up, so
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.160]  Again, it feels literally show us the show us the things that are gonna get us
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.120]  Interested and give us a sense of what we should expect from the movie
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.480]  Which I think is gonna be this is a familiar world, but we're gonna be meeting new people
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.440]  We're going to be taking things beyond what you what you've seen before and then ending it on a note of
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.580]  Literally on a note of here's what here's what we mean. We know you came in hoping to say
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.000]  My favorite you remember this. I don't know if you remember this it was
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.620]  When when were the original that when did the special editions come out it was like
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:04.020]  97 97 I remember something, you know when the trailer for that care teaser came out for that
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:10.500]  It was really good teaser. It was in the theater and it was like it showed a TV and
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:17.020]  It was like for you know for a generation kids, you know, people have only seen yeah Star Wars trilogy on on the
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.420]  You know TV set and then an x-wing
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:26.820]  Blew up the TV set it like ends up the TV set was an outer space and an x-wing flew by and like blew it up
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.820]  Which sounds really cheesy when you describe it now, but it was powerful
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:36.300]  No, but like somebody at like, you know, ILM did it right like it looked right it didn't let me just conceptually
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.620]  Just the idea of a tie an x-wing blowing up a TV. It just sounds dumb, right?
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.980]  It's like how did that ever get past the the first pitch meeting?
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.240]  It sounds like something that you would do like in the Terry Gilliam style from you know
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.240]  It would just be silly but it a giant foot squishes it
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.660]  Yeah, it somehow worked because it was just like we're not gonna show you any of it yet
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.400]  We're just gonna let you know you're gonna see it on a big-ass screen
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.480]  Which is really all you need to know. Yeah, even
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.360]  Even for what it was we can say there's a lot that could be said about
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.320]  the special editions
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240]  The the idea that
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:21.640]  Things were put in the end of the movie to make it better to enhance it for to make it feel more modern to clean it up that was exciting I think the execution was terrible, but the idea was really
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.460]  The that you'd get like a really crisp clean print and they cleaned it up and the blacks would be blacker and the lines would be cleaner
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.240]  That sounded great
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.420]  If that meant that we had to sit through a couple of extra do backs and the the Tatooine
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.940]  Stormtrooper scene then fine, whatever some of them are okay
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.200]  I I don't want to get into it. But I mean it's like my basic feeling I didn't I don't have any kind of
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.440]  Purity, you know that all it has to be exactly like what you saw in 1977 or it's you know, it doesn't count
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.240]  I wasn't opposed to any it's minor tweaks, but some of them were just so stupid
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.360]  I mean the Han shot first thing is right, right
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:00.800]  If you get rid of that awful Jabba scene and you get rid of any time any time you digitally move Han Solo
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:07.200]  Anytime Harrison Ford is on screen and they digitally alter anything take those out and put them back the way they were and the rest
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.760]  Of it. I'm fine with it should have been oh
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.400]  It should have been limited to things that only true obsessive
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.960]  Obsessives would even notice that you'd almost have to see it side by side to notice it like oh there was only one do back
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.240]  back in it then now there's a couple but any the the the
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:26.440]  The I forget what's even called the the monster the big animal thing on in Mos Eisley
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.900]  That the Jawa falls off of yeah, like even that was kind of okay
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.760]  Like it didn't it didn't take me out of the movie. It was kind of silly, but it didn't offend me
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.800]  All right. I remembered and I remember liking some like I thought like the way that they spruced up cloud city
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.840]  Bespin in Empire Strikes Back where there was more stuff going on outside the windows
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.980]  Yeah, I need to feel more alive and less like a matte painting. Yeah, and it is in hindsight, you know
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:55.400]  The the lack of anything outside the windows in the original felt a little cheap. I don't know but yeah
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.400]  Yeah, like they like it felt like you're there on a set right but then you know, I don't know
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.120]  I still think I think even the Jawa falling off though anything that's like a gag is too much
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.200]  I will have a way, you know, he didn't need it. But anyway, that's that's neither here nor there
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.720]  It was a good it the best thing about the special editions though
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.800]  Is that it let us know that George Lucas had lost his mind and it I think it set expectations for the new trilogy
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.760]  Accordingly, do you really think it did because I have anybody I know still managed to be disappointed
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.600]  I think the reaction to Phantom Menace would have been even more heartbreaking
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.400]  I think there would have been people jumping on buildings if it if it had come out it dropped out of the blue without the
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.080]  special editions
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.400]  like the special editions if the special editions didn't make everybody's
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:44.120]  Feel like there was a disturbance in the force then you're not hooked up, right? I remember when Phantom Menace came out opening day
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.120]  I went and saw it in the theater and I walked out and
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:52.080]  Me and my friends and everybody else that I could hear talking outside the theater. Everybody was really excited. Everybody enjoyed it
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.960]  Yeah, I did too. It weren't bad there there, you know, I've said this before they're not terrible. They're only they're only
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:05.240]  Significantly worse compared to the original trilogy and I I see lots and lots of of action movies
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.480]  you know the type of movies where there are things like laser guns and chase scenes and and
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:16.240]  You know superhero powers and stuff like that and the the the prequel trilogy is way better than almost all of them
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.760]  That's way better than typical stuff that I see, you know, it's maybe better than typical
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.900]  I was gonna go the other direction though
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.840]  I was gonna say that it wasn't that Phantom Menace was a good movie or even
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.700]  necessarily a passable movie
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:34.320]  I think that it's people went into that theater so fully prepared to be excited that
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.760]  They could not emotionally handle the movie they actually saw and so they had to walk out feeling good about it
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.760]  and it wasn't until maybe
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.180]  The next morning when we all woke up and we got in the shower and we get out
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.840]  We still don't quite feel clean that it starts to dawn on us that that was a really terrible thing that it just happened now
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.200]  I remember thinking as I watched I didn't come out thinking it was a bad movie and I still don't think it's a bad
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.480]  Movie, but they're the parts that were that were worst were so obviously bad right away
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.180]  Like what you don't think it's a bad movie. I don't I think it's you know, it's like a b-minus action movie
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:13.440]  It's supposed to be a kids movie and it all centers around trade negotiations, but they don't spend too much time. I agree
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.040]  It's it's stupid. I remember thinking the time it's like god
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.320]  Why are they going on on this and I still don't really know what happened in that movie
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.920]  No, and I still yeah, and I also think that it's suffered, you know from some fundamental
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.740]  Big-picture problems like establishing which sides the good guys which sides the bad guys, you know, they like that
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:38.920]  Awesome, incredible clarity the way that the Empire was almost Nazi like deliberately. I mean, it's you know, you know the helmet design
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.760]  for Vader comes from a you know, one of the inspirations is a
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]  You know a Nazi helmet
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.220]  The
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.060]  Lack of clarity said a whole trilogy suffers from that, you know
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.980]  And it's all based on the stupid cockamamie idea that the you know that the Emperor was more or less
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.460]  You know trumped up the whole war on false charges and there was no good guys or bad guys
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.980]  And it just makes the movie less enjoyable as popcorn thriller
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:10.460]  like if you're gonna make a popcorn movie you want to have crisply clearly defined good guys bad guys not any kind of
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:16.620]  Ambiguity in that in that area you should you should know who's who right and it's you know, who's fighting with him
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:22.220]  What why are they fighting the droids, you know, and every time we meet somebody interesting they almost immediately die
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.380]  Seriously Darth Maul we we get to meet that guy we're excited and then he gets cut in half. Ah
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.300]  I kind of I had a feeling that he was gonna go down because he don't he didn't talk enough
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:40.720]  The fact that we don't made it feel like they were setting us up for that. Yeah, but we're we see the trailer
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.580]  And we're all super excited about Darth Maul and then he he's barely in the movie and when he's in the movie
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.580]  He's awesome. And then he dies. Yeah, and the best good guy in the movie is Qui-Gon too
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.540]  Okay, Obi-Wan had such a limited part in the movie
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:55.520]  Yeah, like our hero the only thing that we can like even remotely attached to emotionally he dies
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.860]  But the thing to me the thing that stuck out the most
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.540]  about that movie
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:07.580]  Originally and instantly the first you know, and I saw it on opening day two was the whole opening the can of worms with this
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.140]  midichlorians not so yeah, right and it's to me the thing with the midichlorians thing is
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:19.560]  it it really made it the movie would only make sense if you found out that you know,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.060]  like due to some cut the way that the contracts were written for the movies that 20th Century Fox held the rights to make
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.580]  prequels and
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.720]  George Lucas wanted nothing to do with it, but he didn't have the he didn't have the legal ability to do it
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:38.620]  And so 20th Century Fox went ahead and made this prequel trilogy without George Lucas's, you know
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.500]  approval or insight or input and
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.880]  They handed it to a bunch of people who had no idea what who didn't really understand what made the original
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.900]  Original trilogy what it was, right?
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.540]  So they've got a drop like the Emperor from a helicopter and I can't call anything specter, right?
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:12:00.100]  What made the original trilogy so great was that it explained so little and it was built, you know
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:05.980]  It felt like you're seeing a two-hour snippet of something that could have been 80 hours and they never they just told you your father's
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:10.980]  Fought in the Clone Wars never told you what it was just sounds like a cool name for a science fiction war, right?
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:15.300]  Your father fought in the Clone Wars. They don't even there's no explanation for it. That's all they say and
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:22.220]  That's the best explanation. It just sounds like that it fills out the world. It makes the world seem so much bigger
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:29.060]  There's a real history in this world. All right, and then the new one is just it, you know filling in
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:32.260]  it's just explaining all the mysteries from the first trilogy and
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.380]  Creating no new mysteries of its own like no
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.100]  Like if it had been done successfully
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.780]  you know in the way that people
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:47.700]  wanted a prequel trilogy like when people heard that the new Star Wars trilogy was gonna be a prequel rather than a sequel and it
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.580]  Was gonna go back in time rather than forward. It sounded exciting, right?
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.580]  Everybody was in favor of the general idea
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.420]  Because the first trilogy had opened up all these mysteries that everybody wanted answered
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700]  Or at least that they thought they wanted answered
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:04.940]  The only way the prequel trilogy would have worked was if the prequel trilogy had itself left
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.780]  it left it open that wow, I'd like to go back another 30 years in time and
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:16.120]  See what happened then right there should have been just as many mysteries about what had led up to the prequel trilogy as
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.700]  There was in the original trilogy. Yeah right now in in my mind
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:25.020]  The chronology of the Star Wars universe is all the stuff that happened in the original trilogy
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.820]  And then all the stuff that happened in the prequel trilogy and before that was like, I don't know 10,000 years ago
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.700]  The Jedi Order formed. Yeah, maybe there's some stuff that happened then I don't really care
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:34.860]  All right
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:40.380]  And instead we got like an explanation for the force that makes it sound as though if you gave a Jedi a blood
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.180]  Transfusion he'd lose his powers. Right, right
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.180]  But
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:52.980]  Now now there's a thing you could physically take away from somebody right they have like a device that you could like stick the
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.220]  Kids hand and it comes up with a number
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:01.380]  Like you're taking a standardized test. Well, it seems like the only reason to do that as a writer
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.100]  the only reason to do that is to explain how they were able to
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.060]  like you have to have some way of showing that Anakin tests off the charts I
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:13.180]  Guess but that's why not just say you sense it, right? Well, I'm not saying that he handled it
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.420]  Well, I'm not saying it was a good decision
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.260]  I'm just saying that's got to be that's the only thing I could think of the Lucas said, okay
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.060]  Well, I got to solve this problem. Here's how we'll do it
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:26.680]  Well, there's a pretty ham-fisted way and it's totally not cinematic a cinematic would have way would have been to do something
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.580]  That was physical like make him like a test of how many you know
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.160]  How heavy a thing he could levitate or something like that, right or do it like yeah, yeah
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.780]  but like Yoda and Luke in the swamp when Dagobah
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.120]  When he has to lift up the X finger when he goes into the cave and he fights Vader who turns out to be him
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.600]  Like give us a nice callback to that. Yeah
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.560]  That would be the way to handle. That's how they did it with Luke. It was good enough for Luke
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.800]  Speaking of Yoda. Let me tell you about our good friends at Squarespace. I
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.880]  Can see that connection
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.000]  Squarespace is
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.480]  the all-in-one platform for building websites
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.880]  They just launched Squarespace 7 a new version
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.520]  You can go to squarespace.com
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:19.860]  Slash-7 se ven spell it out and get a full detail on all the stuff that's new, but it's a redesigned interface
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.480]  Integrated they have added integration with Google Apps
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560]  Partnership with Getty Images for
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.720]  stock photography and stuff like that
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.480]  15 all new templates with Squarespace 7
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]  things like cover pages
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.440]  All these templates beautifully designed
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.520]  I don't know how they I don't know how they keep popping out so many great templates with all these designs and
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:51.480]  and part of the thing that makes the new Squarespace 7 interface so much better than what came before and it really has always been a
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  Good interface for a while, but it's all
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.280]  WYSIWYG like you're when you're looking at your own website and you're logged in and you want to change something you can just
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.120]  Change it right there. You don't have to go to a separate editing interface. You can just edit it right there in place
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.960]  Really really visual and
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.180]  amazing degree of
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.140]  customizability without any kind of technical coding acumen
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.600]  But if you do want to get in there if you do have coding level expertise
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.400]  You can go in there inject your own JavaScript change the templates the way that you want anything like that
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.160]  simple and beautiful
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.800]  very powerful

[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:04.180]  Slash to the talk show and find out more the thing I dig about Squarespace is their templates are great
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.100]  It's really easy to use
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:10.600]  Even like when I go to a Squarespace site, I I can rarely tell that it's Squarespace
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:17.080]  Which is sort of the mark of yeah templates done. Well as they don't all look the same doesn't have that sort of gross
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.320]  Oh, well, this guy just used the thing
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.640]  It kind of feels like the almost almost the platonic ideal of what they wanted what Apple wanted I web to be
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.840]  Yeah, anybody can anybody can just make a website now. We've all been empowered
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.360]  We can all start a blog we can all start a podcast or whatever. Like we can just put your stuff here
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.160]  You know have to really think about it, but it's also cool that they sponsor everything
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:45.240]  I think we we kind of we we joke about this. It's become like kind of a cliche sponsored by Squarespace, but the truth is
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.920]  We can make fun of that. But how cool is it that we have a company like that?
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.380]  This is doing really cool stuff and they're also kind of a a patron to the arts
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.880]  I've thought about that a lot because you know
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.540]  They sponsor my website enough and I certainly sponsor this the the talk show enough that it's occurred to me
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:08.320]  Like how is it possible that they can keep sponsoring and and and you know, a lot of the shows I listen to are sponsored
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.600]  By them and I've thought about it and it in some sense
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.820]  I think it it can be explained by the fact that they've they're a company that's a embraced the modern media world
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.240]  meaning
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:27.160]  You know like the post PC world of devices like the post internet world of media where
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.600]  you know in the old days your big budget for advertising would go to print and
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.920]  TV well probably I should list TV first TV and then print in the world
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.320]  You know in the old world and TV commercials are super expensive
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.960]  They're super expensive to produce and they're super expensive to buy at least if you're going to put it in front
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.160]  You know to get a large number of people to listen
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.120]  I
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.480]  Think it makes total spent sense for them because I think that they're much more targeted like I've seen Squarespace ads on TV
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.280]  They have TV ads. I mean they're they definitely have a huge ad budget and I've seen them on the subway, too
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.880]  yeah, but
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.080]  people who listen to
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.680]  podcasts of any kind let alone technical podcasts are so much more likely to be the sort of people who are going to build a
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.680]  website of any kind
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.500]  That it's a better way to target at you know
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:22.200]  You know far less money than you would pay to get an ad in you know, the New Yorker or something like that
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.320]  Yeah, so
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.780]  specter
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:31.840]  Specter the title of the the 24th Bond movie they had they had a press conference today in
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.880]  London this was all a huge surprise to me
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.000]  I mean, maybe I'm just not paying enough attention, but I had no idea this was coming this this came out of no
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.880]  Yeah, see I knew that I've tried to stay as spoiler-free as I could but I knew that there was a new one coming
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.280]  I knew Sam Mendes had been resigned to come back even though he did I he didn't swear
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.200]  It wasn't like a never say never again thing where he said I'm never gonna do another one
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.360]  But he was pretty adamant that he only wanted to direct one, you know, because he does so many other things
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.160]  You know and he you know, not just other movies, but he you know does theater and stuff like that
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.080]  And in fact side on Squarespace
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:05.520]  Yeah
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.560]  the production of the movie was actually set back because I think they would have
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.140]  they would have been further ahead already if they hadn't been waiting for Mendes because he had a
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:21.240]  Maybe that's why I'd only take a year. He had a play in London that he was directing and you know and
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.020]  and directing a plays, you know, I don't know it's all it it's a weird thing because you know
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.900]  It's like the opposite of a movie like as soon as you get a scene right in a movie you move on
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.180]  Whereas in a play you're doing it night after night after night
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.620]  Yeah
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.780]  but you know Skyfall was but such a
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.900]  box office and critical
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:45.940]  Success that it you know, it was almost inevitable that they would get him to come back
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.300]  I think they you know more or less had to make him an offer
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:54.380]  He couldn't refuse and he brought back like the same writing team and the same I would go to the same production team
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.260]  Yeah, that kind of worries me though
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.900]  because I actually think that I know like I said
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:05.540]  Header of the show that guy didn't do and I'm not gonna do a whole two-hour thing on Skyfall
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:08.840]  But the more time goes on and the more Skyfall settles in
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.380]  The the less I like it you start to see the seams
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:19.180]  I feel like it's a really it's kind of a poorly written film that was made extraordinarily
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500]  well, like
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.460]  It's it's well cast the cast is perfect. The look is very good
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:31.700]  It has a good feel and you know, the just the it's just such a great cast, you know
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.660]  Harvey Javier Bardem is so good as a Bond villain
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.080]  It's such you know, Roger Deakins does such amazing
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:48.020]  Cinematography, it's just a gorgeous gorgeous film and it's so clearly made by people who love the
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.080]  At least that you know, but the Bond movies have varied so much over the 50 years of the course
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.480]  But they would it's so clearly made by people who love the things about Bond that I love about Bond
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.040]  It felt like a love letter to bond. Yeah. Yeah and a well-done one
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:08.440]  Agree. Yeah, you know it makes here's that here's an example that it makes no logical sense
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440]  But
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.160]  I like it is one of the things that I thought was perfect in movie is the way that when bond wants to
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.860]  Ditch the car that that mi6 could track he gets the old db5
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.360]  And it makes note because that nobody would notice that well
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.000]  Em even makes em even makes that joke that yeah
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.160]  this is certainly inconspicuous and it also makes no sense in the sense that it's a reboot of
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.260]  Of bond, you know the whole starting with Casino Royale. It's a rewrite and whatever
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:46.480]  Where did that car even come from whatever the vague rules of continuity were before and and then you'll you know up until then
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.360]  It was sort of a hand wavy sort of
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:54.920]  Continuity between Bond movies, you know where it was sort of insinuated that it was one guy
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:01.440]  Who had done all these things even if it was played by different actors. Well, you say that but Lazenby
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.460]  What it counts, you know, well, no, no. No, I mean the that opening scene in
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.040]  Our majesty. Yeah on her majesty circuit service
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.040]  He gets in that fight on the beach and then he turns and he looks at the camera
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:20.960]  That never would have happened to the other fellow. Oh, yeah that never happened to the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's just it's just
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.720]  And again, we get into a two-hour on her majesty
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.360]  See, it's clear
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.600]  Her majesty Secret Service is clearly the most divisive of all the bond movies in my opinion because it's either somebody
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.280]  Reason people either hate it or love it. I know and I I have good friends who's who's who's tasting movies?
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:43.520]  I generally agree with in large measures who swear up and down that it's the best Bond movie. What? Yeah
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.080]  Oh name names not irons
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.640]  Nat yeah, really that huh? That's
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.120]  He's such a smart others. You can just google it. You can find lots of people who will make the argument
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.880]  Film crit Hulk loved it
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.040]  But yeah read film crit. Did you read film crit?
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.180]  Hulk's bond tree tice know he reviewed he wrote like a
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.440]  Massive thing almost like a like a booklet almost like a booklet length thing where he reviewed every single bond movie
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.520]  This this is fascinating
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.420]  And I don't know if he said it was his very favorite, but he at least said it was if not, it was very close
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:25.640]  I think the the get punch at the very end was good. I think that makes the movie worth it
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.040]  I don't know if I'd say it's good. It's certainly not the best
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:34.040]  No, but it's but it's so stupid that it makes no sense that blowfeld was left alive
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.960]  there was a bob bobsled chase with gunfire and
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.200]  and blowfelds
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:48.440]  Bobsled like overturns or whatever and bonds at the bottom and what he doesn't go up there double-check that he just assumes that he's dead
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:55.960]  It doesn't make any sense. I felt like I deserve it. I feel like he deserved to have his wife killed by me like
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:03.360]  There was no sorry. There was no cockamamie in a way that he disappeared off a cliff and maybe he had a you know
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:10.240]  Parachute or something or some secret escape or something like that. He just it's like a rookie move. Yeah, just didn't go and check
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.960]  Yeah, like he's never seen a good
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560]  He's never seen a movie. I guess yeah
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.600]  so what do you think of the title I
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:27.040]  Think in the same way that I want to believe that JJ Abrams picked every shot in the Star Wars teaser for a reason
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:34.280]  I have to believe or I want to believe that that title is very very intentional. Yeah
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.600]  That title is them not just saying hey, we got the rights to use this name
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.600]  We're gonna bring stuff back whatever but like they're trying to say in the same way that at the end of Skyfall
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.520]  You hear Moneypenny
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.080]  You hear that name and that means something and you see
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:55.000]  Ray fines coming in as M and you see on the back of the office door that that leather door, right?
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.360]  But just like from the old movies it kind of right now
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:04.480]  We're in this place where the Bond movies the country of the Bond movies is the loop, right? It looks like yeah, I even
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.800]  he even
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.040]  It's a guy I wrote on during fireball day. He's just
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.520]  Ray fines M is a very Bernard lead like em
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:20.800]  Mmm, you know now there's obviously a different dynamic because ray find is clearly not that much older than
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.680]  Daniel Craig and
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.580]  He's new as M
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:31.980]  whereas in there in the old Bond movies it always and and in the novels both in the
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880]  movies and the novels
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.120]  It there's an idea that M and M has been there forever, you know that he's been there for a lot
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.840]  He's been in charge of mi6 for a long time, right? It's a kind of a paternal relationship. Yeah, yes exactly
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.660]  It's in fact, it's in the novels. At least I think it even is it even says so explicitly that it's like a paternal
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.320]  Relationship and you can kind of see it in the movies. Yeah with the like the thing with the gun the
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.720]  the the
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.820]  Okay, what was the was the gun that he originally had?
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:11.900]  Yeah, the one that in the original quartermaster comes in and says it would be good for a lady
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.540]  Yeah, there's the argument about the end. I hit a Beretta
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.740]  He hit me for not knowing this but yeah
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:21.540]  The the question of he was supposed to be using the other gun and he was like, he's very steadfast that they thought this is
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:29.440]  I think he should be carried a Beretta and the quartermaster and M insisted that he switched to the
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.260]  Walter PPK
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:35.620]  Was it was it yeah, it was a Beretta. It was a Beretta. Yeah
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:42.020]  And but the argument about that it never felt to me like this was bond sticking to what he knew and what he liked
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.020]  So much as it was it was kind of him sticking it to him
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.460]  But he was being it felt like a little bit of youthful teenage rebellion
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.140]  Yeah, a little bit as much as a bit of column a little bit of column B there
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.360]  Boot major booth right boot, right
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:01.520]  The backstory on that is that there was a guy who was like a weapons expert who?
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.440]  Who wrote to Ian Fleming after one of the novels and he said look, I love these novels. I'm big fan
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.600]  but I've got to tell you your choice of weapon for this guy is is
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.200]  It's pretty poor. This is a this this gun has terrible stopping power
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.360]  It's you know, there's there's really nothing to recommend it over
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.660]  You know for this and for the serious business that he gets into he ought to carry, you know
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.960]  like something something else and
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.040]  So Ian Fleming wrote him back and with like a thank you. Thank you
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.440]  This is one, you know, wonderful feedback and then named a character after the guy
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.220]  That's like a honor for him. Did you watch the I think is the BBC?
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:48.240]  Fleming the man who would be bond, you know, I I have it in my notes here to talk to you about that. I I
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.960]  this was
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:57.600]  My friend a year ago where me and you and Brent were somehow like in a back channel, you know with Q branch
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.160]  Soft, you know Q branch our software thing
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.000]  You guys had watched it and recommended it and well
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.520]  well Brent was he'd watched the first episode and recommended that we watch it but said it was terrible hmm and
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.640]  I so I watched it and I I strongly disagreed with his assessment
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.520]  I put it on my I put it on my list of things to watch and then
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:24.320]  It was like I hit one of those like June 30th. It was there on July 1st. It wasn't it was gone from Netflix and
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.060]  I thought
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:32.080]  And and I remember especially I don't think it was on iTunes either or yes, it should be on ice
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.300]  Well, maybe I don't know but at the time a year in fifteen dollars, but it was like well
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:43.640]  It's anyway, it's right now as we speak in in December 2014. It's back on Netflix and oddly enough. I actually
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:50.040]  Started watching it like four nights ago. Oh, how far in are you three out of four? What do you think?
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:59.240]  I'm making that gesture with my hand. That's like, you know, like so so like I'm glad it exists and I am enjoying it
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.480]  But it feels like a BBC TV show not like a movie
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:10.600]  The that attitude of I like it. I'm enjoying it. I'm glad it exists, but it's not great is kind of I mean the
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:17.480]  The worst Bond movies are still enjoyable and there's there's 24 of them. Yeah, so there's gonna be good ones
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.360]  There's gonna be bad ones. But even the worst of the Bond movies, even if you really hate
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.720]  Never Say Never Again, you really hate Majesty Secret Service. You still enjoy watching it
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.720]  It's still a Bond movie and what the show felt like to me was not so much
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.440]  Like a biopic about Fleming as it was kind of
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:39.960]  Kind of a semi sort of maybe a little bit sanctioned prequel
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:46.040]  Maybe I read it as this and it's it right there in the title the man who would be bonds
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.560]  It feels to me like this is the template for Bond by the way. I think you just grew bird
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:55.200]  The word biop I see I've always said it biopic
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.400]  like biography picture biopic
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.760]  Biopic would be like if it was like a disease or something like that
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.960]  It would be like if it was like a disease over the eye or something. Oh, let's let's find this out biopic
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.720]  I like that. You call it a group break, right? I'm gonna all right. I'm gonna let's look this up
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.120]  Now I want to know
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:20.860]  Well, my problem with looking up emphasis and maybe this is why I mispronounce so many words is I don't know how to read
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.840]  the diacritical marks
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:26.520]  In there's like three or four different systems of diacritical marks to show you how to like
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.400]  Pronounce a word and where the emphasis goes. I don't I don't understand any of them
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.480]  Once I call those Schwoz and everything starts showing up. I don't know
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.260]  Well, this is what the internet is for. Yeah, it'll uh, you can just listen a little a little audio clip. Here's one
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.520]  Biopic oh, you're right. Yeah, it's a yeah, it's a bio and a picture. So it's a biopic
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.520]  Bye-bye biopic to me sounds like somebody taking photographs in the bathroom. I
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:33:00.240]  I I just think it's industry lingo, you know, yeah. Yeah, they're like a chick flick. I've learned something today
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.680]  biopic
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.560]  And see if you had said biopic I would have called you out on that. Yeah
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.200]  I've had I and I I you know
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.320]  Whenever I hear somebody pronounce a word differently than I have pronounced it my entire life
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:17.040]  I generally assume I generally assume that I've just learned something
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.840]  Because it's usually a safe bet like it's you know, it's like with the Sith thing like you get you
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:28.840]  Mispronounce enough words that you've read visually but never pronounced enough and you're almost always wrong
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.920]  You start to assume that if I pronounce it differently, I'm wrong
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:39.700]  Wait, did you miss found Seth? No, but in the way that like you pointed out that maybe if you know
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:47.860]  I think down information if you killed you if you're a Sith apprentice and you just killed your master to become the master
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.500]  maybe you don't take an apprentice if you realize that you're completing like a
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:58.420]  Thousand generation chain of that happening, you know over and over again every time and if you're the new guy 30 years later
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.980]  You've got no idea how to pronounce medical organs
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:10.480]  Did you see the thing where the the poster that they unveil and there's a cool little movie they have to where it just shows
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:13.780]  The the name specter being like animated it
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.840]  Oh, yeah, it almost like the in the the the bullet in the glass
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.920]  It almost reminds me of the did you see you saw it at Singleton too?
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.880]  But you see Dave Addy's post on the opening credits of alien
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:31.060]  Yeah, it's sort of that same sort of effect where the word specter is revealed piece by piece in the letters
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.140]  and it's just a
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:39.420]  Like the type nerd in me and the bond nerd in me for being it was like maybe 20 seconds of video that shows you
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:42.020]  Nothing, it felt really good watching it
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:46.300]  Yeah, and the way that the you see and you mentioned did you just mention is that the logo looks like the old specter?
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:50.540]  Look the broken glass underneath. Yeah. Yeah, there's the the bullet like a bolt through the glass
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.980]  But the way the glass shatters, there's the like the tentacles like the Hydra style
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.480]  all right, but the specter logo middle of the the Hydra meaning that
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:04.300]  The Hydra logo from the Marvel Universe and the specter logo shares some visuals limited similarities, right?
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:07.680]  But the idea behind the logo is that it's like a multi tentacle
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:14.660]  Organization that you know, you can't you know kill one tentacle and still got other seven ones around the world or whatever
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.920]  You cut off one head and two Marshall appear
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.840]  So
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.120]  I the most interesting casting to me is Christoph Waltz. Oh
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:31.760]  Yeah, I mean there's there's there's lots of good all the news and casting is good news. But but Christoph Waltz that's that's like
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.360]  Now we got a fucking movie. Yeah
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.920]  It's funny. It's and it seems like they've really in and there's what's his name the guy from Guardians of the Galaxy
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.360]  Galaxy is David Bautista. Yeah is mr. Hinks, which is so obviously it's so
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:54.320]  Old-school bond henchmen. I mean, you know, look at the guy. Yeah. Yeah gotta be like a criminal henchman with the name. Mr
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.940]  Hanks sounds perfect, but it's totally taking it back like
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.100]  You know to to Connery and more era bond, you know
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:10.100]  It's got a little bit of camp in it. Yes, that's that's kind of what made bond fun. Then. Will it work now?
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:17.140]  Yeah, I don't know. So the the speculation has been there have been rumors and again, I've tried to avoid them
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:23.680]  But you know, I think everybody now that they're calling the movie specter. It's not spoiling anything that there were rumors that Christoph Waltz
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:30.580]  Was gonna play Blofeld for a while. You're saying you didn't see those rumors the the name that what was the name?
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.540]  They gave him for him in their announcement. They've saying he's playing a character named Oberhauser
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:36.940]  Yeah
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:41.780]  which if you google that name I googled it because I wanted to find out what it meant in German because I thought maybe that
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:46.040]  Was a hint at something because I kind of had it just has the scent of this is a codename for a character
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.220]  This isn't the characters real name
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.700]  And if you google that name
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:53.140]  It's the name of this like Nazi general who has tried for war crimes after World War two
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.500]  Like this very famous Nazi and to me that's that's so over-the-top
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:05.160]  That it can't possibly be a real character's name that has to be masking something. Yeah, I think he's Blofeld
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.860]  If you're gonna bring back
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.780]  Specter you might as well bring back Blofeld
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:13.260]  I mean you could make the argument that you bring back
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:18.500]  Specter and then Blofeld is revealed in the next movie in the same way that you got hints of Specter or maybe even
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.460]  Glimpses of Blofeld in even like as far back as doctor
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:31.180]  No, you don't really get to see Blofeld until two or three movies in four movies before yeah four movies in or five five
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:34.580]  It was so first movie was dr
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:39.940]  No, and Blofeld was a guy and a cat you saw him from behind a chair and he had the cat
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:46.380]  But you never saw his face and then in Russia with love you saw him in that secret meeting room where he was behind
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:52.420]  Phoenician blinds, so you still couldn't see his face and he'd like that was where he unveiled
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:56.620]  that was where they unveiled the the gag that dr. Evil used where he had like a
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:04.160]  Boardroom table and he could hit right right to kill a guy and then he wasn't in Goldfinger
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.140]  he wasn't in Goldfinger Goldfinger and Goldfinger had nothing to do with the specter and then in
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.980]  The next movie was
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.620]  thunderball, which was a specter plot to steal a
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.460]  A nuclear missile
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:26.860]  But Blofeld, I don't even know if he was even pictured in it. It was Largo
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:33.660]  The the guy with the eyepatch was the the head operative of the mission. Oh, I think maybe we saw him
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.180]  I don't think we even see him in thunderball. I don't even think he makes a
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.940]  Blow feldian like you don't get to see his face, but he's there
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.060]  I think that
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:48.620]  Largo is the only guy and then the next movie is you only live twice and that's where we finally see him and he's played
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.620]  by David Pleasence
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:57.780]  The the the and it's the one everybody remembers it's the guy the bald guy with the scarred face
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:03.260]  Right in the in the crazy suit, right the like the you know, the dr. Evil the dr. Evil look
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:09.300]  I want to say we saw him and we saw a glimpse of him in two movies prior mostly because
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:14.500]  The the three times that we see him the first two hints and then the time when we actually see him
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:21.460]  There's like three different looks the clearly three different actors. It's always different actors. Yeah, and in fact, it was part of the way that they
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.540]  they just had this loosey-goosey continuity that would never fly anymore and
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:30.300]  The guy who played him and dr. No
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:36.040]  Even though he was just seen in a chair from behind stroking his pussy
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:43.000]  Was the actor who played I think his name was
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:52.120]  Strang wise or maybe it was the guy who played the guy who'd played him in in from Russia with love was
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.560]  The guy who played strang wise the strang ways the guy who was yeah the guy who in in Jamaica in
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.440]  dr. No
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.600]  was
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  the the like
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.800]  mineralogist who was crooked and
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.620]  Tried to sneak in and bond killed him while he was playing member bond post playing solitaire to wait for him to come back
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.980]  And he's right, right, right. That's that guy played
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.640]  played below felt in the next movie and then the craziest one is
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240]  In
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:33.240]  You only live twice the one where he goes to Japan and before before it gets all crazy racist and he dawned the
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.080]  The yellow face makeup. He meets the mi6 operative in
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.800]  Tokyo and the guy is
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:47.200]  Wearing a kimono and it's like he's been stationed there. He's a British guy who's been stationed there for 30 years and
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.840]  It's a nice little touch he makes he
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.060]  He makes him a martini and he says stirred not shaken right which is of course wrong
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:03.860]  But bond being a polite British person says perfect. Thank you, you know, it just accepts it and doesn't bother correct him
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:11.140]  And then he gets stabbed by like a ninja assassin and bond has to go chasing him that actor the guy who played a
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:15.860]  British intelligence agent in you only live
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:21.620]  Twice two movies later is the guy who played blow felled in diamonds or forever
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.300]  Really? Yeah, and he doesn't even look different
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.100]  It wasn't even like they gave him different makeup or a different hairstyle. Oh, that's right. That's right
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:32.820]  So a lot of this blurs together for me because I watch all of the bond movies over the course of a month
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.380]  It's it's 20
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:42.440]  You would never ever have like a like a recasting. It's almost like, you know, like they were they were casting out of like
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:50.140]  You know like Saturday night live like where you have like a an ensemble cast and you just have to keep reusing actors
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:54.540]  Oh, well, you say that but look at Doctor Who Peter Capaldi the new doctor
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:59.060]  He was in an episode as you know, just some side character like five years ago
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:05.860]  The the previous companion was always in that same episode. In fact as a totally different character
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:11.060]  Maybe there's just not that many actors in the UK. Yeah, I don't know
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:14.100]  There's ran out of people at least it was like an old boys club back then
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:20.220]  I don't know people and I think cuz nobody got to rewatch movies on home video that everybody just assumed that they would slide I
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:24.340]  Do it was like I think ahead. It was like nobody's ever gonna watch this again
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:31.140]  Right, I don't know but it's crazy that just two movies apart the same guy played a British agent and blow felt
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.900]  Yeah, I'm guessing see his face too
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:41.820]  I'm guessing that Christoph Waltz is blow felt because you're gonna bring back specter
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:46.900]  You got to bring back blow felt and if you're gonna have blow felt who I mean, he's as good an actor as anybody
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.820]  I mean, he's that's just it. That's just it like in these procedural TV shows
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:57.420]  They try to do the thing where they they want to keep you guessing as to who the who the guy was who committed the
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:02.540]  Murder, but like you can just say look, but this is the character actor that I've seen in other TV shows clearly
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:03.740]  That's the murderer
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:10.340]  Right you look at this a big-budget big production like this. You don't bring in Christoph Waltz to just play some dude
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:16.540]  Yeah, that's it. I look at it this way if blow felt is in the movie. It's got to be Christoph Waltz and
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:23.820]  If blow felts not in the movie then when because how many more does Daniel Craig have in him
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:26.980]  right if you're gonna bring back specter for at least for the end of
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.220]  Daniel Craig's run in the role you got to have blow felt in there as soon as possible
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:36.140]  I figure you bring them you got to bring them in and you know
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:43.220]  You know finally have you know like in the old Bond movies finally have a movie where Bond doesn't get that guy at the end
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.100]  You know blow fell to skin. I'm expecting blow felt
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:50.260]  Whatever his crazy scheme is in this movie will escape at the end and will be back in the next movie
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:55.840]  You know, whatever hard lessons Bond has learned in Casino Royale quantum of solace and Skyfall
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:02.100]  He hasn't had a huge failure yet other than the just the failure of Vesper land
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:08.120]  All right, that's pretty bad. Well, yeah, but it wasn't it wasn't a failure. That was a personal failure
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.060]  That wasn't a failure on the level of the guy who was trying to destroy the world
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:14.340]  Kinda got away with blowing up a chunk of it
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:23.540]  Speaking of specter and evil worldwide multi-tenacled organizations. I want to tell you about our good friends at back blaze
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:33.120]  Back blaze is unlimited un-throttled online backup for your Mac
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.840]  They have over 100 petabytes of data backed up for all their customers
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.720]  Sounds dirty it really that's I forget what did
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.560]  They even told us how big a petabyte is and I forget how big it is
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.880]  They sent us an email and it was just it was it's so much more data than you have
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.160]  It's crazy and it's they've done great stuff
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:45:00.240]  You know if you google it and they talk about like how to set up a data center that's reliable and cheap and how much
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.240]  You know cost to get drives and stuff like that
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:10.920]  It's crazy how much data they have backed up but how they figured out a way to do it cheap because there's a factor with
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.000]  Back blaze and I've talked about for a while
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.880]  But it is a factor where there's almost a too-good-to-be-true feel to it
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:24.480]  because it's just five bucks a month per computer for unlimited un-throttled backup and
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.880]  It's again. It's one of these things. It's such a great product
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.040]  But it I remember I heard about it for a long time before I signed up
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.520]  I because I remembered there's other shows that they sponsored
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.560]  And one of the reasons I didn't sign up is it had like this too-good-to-be-true feel to it
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.720]  Because you think things like well it probably only backs up your startup drive
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:51.240]  No, it backs up like if you have like an external hard drive that is three terabytes or four terabytes or bigger where you keep
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.540]  All of your you know digital media and stuff like that
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:00.160]  They back that up to right it might take a while depending on your upstream, but once it's backed up
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:06.640]  It's up there, and you you know then after that everything is you know incremental when you add new files and stuff like that
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:13.440]  But it's not just your startup drive. It's you know it's everything and five bucks per Mac
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.640]  per month for unlimited un-throttled backup, and it just works, and it just runs you install their software and
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:23.800]  Forget about it you see like like fate
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.880]  Well, you don't use Facebook
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:30.480]  But sometimes you see posts from people or emails from people or YouTube comments from people where every other word is misspelled
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.520]  And there's no punctuation or capitalization and you wonder in 2014
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.040]  When every device you could possibly touch that that has a battery has spell check
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:45.660]  How it's possible that these people like there's no excuse for misspelling words unless autocorrect gets you in the same way
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.240]  You've got no excuse if your hard drive crashes, and you don't have a backup at five dollars a month
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:53.680]  There's just it's it's unfathomable to me that you wouldn't have had something in place
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.720]  It's I here's what I'm gonna
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.540]  Do this holiday season is I because I have a bunch of family members with Macs who don't have backblaze yet
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:04.700]  And I'm not gonna give it as a gift because you know here's here's backup. Here's your present
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:11.000]  I'll get him a real gift but talking stuffer, but when I'm at their house. I am going to in addition to a gift
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.560]  I'm gonna give them backblaze
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.360]  And I'm gonna set it up for him and just soak it up because I I feel better
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.840]  I'm like my parents don't have backblaze on their Mac yet
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.860]  But I'm gonna make that make sure it's like my commitment this year when we go home for the holidays
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:28.640]  I'm gonna do it because I would feel so much better if all the pictures my mom has on her Mac are backed up somewhere
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.840]  outside of her house and
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:36.140]  And just do that for everybody in your family when you go home for the holidays
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.480]  and
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.600]  It'll be you're gonna feel so much better about it
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.920]  I think it's you know it's like a in addition to a gift give them backblaze because
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.600]  Eventually, it's gonna happen. I had somebody in my and Amy's family. Just had a Mac have a
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.200]  Hard drive go bad like so bad that like when you reboot and go into disc
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.200]  Disc
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  Disc utility it's like I
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.960]  Got nothing. You know and then they took it to the Apple store, and they were like
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.840]  Yeah, we got nothing so like everything. You know they'd lost photos. They had a whole bunch of photos. You know that
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.760]  just gone I
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.480]  Feel and I had the same thought you did I feel terrible about it because I felt like there's so many things you could
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.360]  Do like if they had backblaze I feel bad. I felt a little guilty that I hadn't
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.160]  To yet told them that they should have back please because it would have saved them
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.560]  five bucks a month per computer unlimited unthralled backup and
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:40.880]  Here's the thing you get a risk-free no credit card required trial to start out just go to back blaze comm slash daring fireball and
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.240]  You can get it to try out you could just do that for your relatives
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:50.600]  Just give them the free trial over Christmas and show them how easy it is and you know let them put the bill
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.880]  So great and tell them to let back blaze know that
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:59.240]  You heard it on the talk show. Yeah use that use RL back blaze comm slash daring fireball
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  You can't go wrong
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.560]  There's no excuse. There's no excuse for for not having how many do you even have a camera that takes pictures on film?
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.600]  No, well, I do I but I haven't I don't even know if it works anymore
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:18.160]  yeah, I but I take I don't know probably hundreds of pictures a month and
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.680]  and they're all digital, and they're all on my hard drive or
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:29.040]  Somewhere yeah, if anything happens, and I didn't have a backup, and that's like every record of my life I
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.560]  Lose my hard drive. I just don't exist anymore. I'm like Michael J Fox and back to the future in that photo
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:36.840]  My hand starts disappearing
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.560]  It's a hit they can definitely happen especially I mean SSDs can go bad too
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:45.120]  But if you have anybody has anything stored on a spinning hard disk man
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.040]  You got to have it backed up somewhere else or your laptop gets stolen, or I mean there's a million things that can happen
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:55.600]  It's just that there's five bucks a month imagine. You could get health insurance for five dollars a month of course
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:01.280]  You'd do it of course your free like unlimited unthrottle online backup for five dollars a month. Yeah
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.800]  Well imagine if health insurance meant that if you got hit by a bus you could like reboot to where you were yesterday
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:14.000]  All right, I would definitely pay five dollars a month for that right. That's what backblaze is for your data five bucks a month
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.500]  If only there was back place for us
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.800]  It'd be great that should be their 2.0 product
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  The engineers are working on yeah
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.500]  So what else would specter here's the thing I was thinking about with specter and and and that one it's
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:37.460]  That this was just resolved legally last year this whole backstory and those of you who've been listening listen to that whole bond
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.540]  5x5 the talk show thing from years ago know that we covered this but
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:46.340]  The basic stories there was a guy named Kevin McClory
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.900]  who
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:54.140]  Ian Fleming had collaborated with before the bond thing even really got big. I don't think
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:59.980]  Yeah, they were there doing it wasn't it supposed to be like a TV movie. Yeah, and they came up with collaboratively
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.700]  I think there was even a third collaborator though who who'd never you know
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:10.220]  Who somehow got bought out of his rights early on in the process somebody got screwed but forget about the third guy
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:17.260]  The gist of it is Ian Fleming and Kevin McClory came up with the premise. That was basically Thunderbolt. What if a
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.940]  criminal organization
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.660]  Could somehow
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:30.700]  Compromise a pilot who would be flying a test flight with a nuclear-armed fighter plane and
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.540]  get the compromised pilot to
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:39.060]  Drop the bomb not, you know ignite it but just drop it in the ocean somewhere where they could
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:42.700]  You know then pick it up from the bottom of the ocean and then hold the world
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.540]  You know the Western world hostage
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:49.140]  Which is really pretty clever like it, you know
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:54.580]  One of the things about that thunderbolt plot is in the grand scheme of the whole world is at risk
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.020]  James Bond plots
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:52:01.980]  It's actually seems pretty plausible right that there are by today's standards, right?
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:06.620]  that you know that there are pilots who are flying planes that have
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:13.500]  Nuclear-armed weapons and then at that point you've got one guy who you know, if you could compromise that one guy
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500]  Maybe you know you get them to do something with it
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.260]  Um
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:18.260]  Nothing came of it
[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:22.540]  I guess whatever the original what TV movie that was supposed to be somehow it fell through
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:27.780]  but Ian Fleming thought well, that was a hell of a good story and he went ahead and just used it for the
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:33.300]  Novel thunderball. Well, wouldn't you I mean I can hardly I mean I can see the
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:40.540]  Contention there, but yeah, I guess I you know, I don't know I'd you know who came up with how much of it who knows?
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:47.540]  you know, I mean like only really maybe maybe only in Fleming and and and McClory really know how much of it Ian Fleming truly
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:49.840]  Had a right to reuse how much of it he came up with
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:55.540]  But regardless they you know that the McClory sued and
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:00.980]  There was even some I remember reading about it that the eon productions, you know
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:06.580]  The the people who make the movies even they were aware of it and they even you know were wary of making
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:10.500]  Done, you know doing a movie of thunderball until it was resolved
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:15.700]  But they had lawyer enough lawyers who said nah, this is all gonna go away. This McClory is a crock, you know a crackpot
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:22.220]  But it ended up that he got the rights it by the time it was ended it ended with
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:28.740]  It was like a you know, like the the fable of Solomon where you know, two women come in saying this is our baby
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:32.820]  Right and he's like, yeah cut it in half and the woman who said no
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:38.380]  No, just you know, he's a god you must be the real mother because you know, you're more concerned about the baby than you are
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:39.500]  about this
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:44.620]  It was like a Solomonic decision with this where they both had the rights to thunderball
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:50.940]  Ian Fleming and thus eon productions who had the rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond and Kevin McClory
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:56.660]  So Kevin McClory had the legal rights to make a movie based on the novel thunderball
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:03.020]  And that's you know, and he spent like decades trying to get it made and that's what eventually became never say never again
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:08.780]  That's why I never say never again plot is so similar to thunderball. It's a weird. It's a weird
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:11.460]  Moral fables who wants half a baby?
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:15.580]  It is weird. Yeah, it's weird. It's weird that you know, I
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:18.260]  You know, it's like all those fables, you know
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:24.700]  They're painted the the the the lying woman was was like, you know painted in broad strokes. She was like the
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:29.540]  The Empire, you know, shoot she's okay with half a baby. That's fine, right?
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:33.860]  Yeah, and to say like if she had a fleet of TIE fighters, she wouldn't to put shields on
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:36.780]  Save a couple bucks
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.780]  Whatever it takes get it done
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:44.020]  It's weird that Kevin McClory got even the ability to use the name James Bond, right?
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:48.620]  Whatever you'd say about his claim to the story. Okay, great. You can you can use the same story
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:55.100]  Just use a different name for the character. Yeah, I've linked to this before. I'll put it in the show notes again. I hope
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:59.220]  It's still there on YouTube. Do you ever see the recut opening of never say never again? Yeah
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:02.900]  I think I think when you link to it, maybe maybe was on
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.020]  This show or maybe it was on during fireball
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:09.500]  But you talked about how great it would be if they redid the whole movie like that, right?
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:15.540]  It's the gist of it is is the real never say never again has this terrible cheesy 80s
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.500]  soundtrack and theme and
[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:22.500]  Even the logo thing is really cheesy
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:28.280]  And it's part of what makes it feel off right from the start and some genius on
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:34.160]  Put up on YouTube pretty much like the whole like opening five-minute thing of never say never again
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.900]  but with the real James Bond theme music and
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:46.420]  You know logo and you know the stuff like that and it it
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:50.060]  Improves it so immensely and it feels real
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:54.840]  It feels like this is a real James Bond movie and it's exactly like what I said earlier about John Williams in Star Wars
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:58.700]  it makes you leave it right it makes you realize how much that music and
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:03.720]  Graphical theming is part of what makes it feel like a Bond movie
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:09.700]  Well, we saw we saw that pretty clearly at the end of Casino Royale when you first hear the
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.760]  Got the guy's name when you first hear the bond thing. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, and you and they held the
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480]  the silhouette, you know
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.440]  Pulled the gun out and shoot a bullet into the screen. Yeah, and the blood comes down
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:25.160]  They held it until the end of that movie
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:29.760]  Right, right because this was that the whole point of that movie was this is how he becomes bond, right?
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  it was like this it was almost like the whole movie was sort of a a
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:36.680]  feature length
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.120]  What's it called like a prelude
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.600]  What do you call like chapter zero of a book
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.360]  Like prologue. Yeah prologue like it was like a two-hour prologue
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  Yeah, well, I kind of read it as
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.720]  similar to like Batman Begins and that was at the time in movies when Batman Begins and
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:01.000]  And like rebooting a thing was the thing to do like give us some more origin stories, please. Yeah, it was a
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:06.600]  Casino Royale is like the greatest origin story ever. I think I think I'd agree with that
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.760]  I think I'd agree that in so much of it for me and
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.760]  there's I don't think I'm giving away any secrets by saying that Vesper land my favorite bond girl and I think that
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:20.580]  Such such a defining moment in bonds life if you want to imagine that it's it's one guy and this is all his story
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.160]  that
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.680]  The the story of Vesper land is the story of bond without her. There's no James Bond
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.540]  yeah, and they you know, it wasn't like he started as a
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:33.760]  85 pound
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:41.680]  You know sickly weakling who needed a super serum to become James Bond. He was already he wasn't bitten by a radioactive secret agent, right?
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.400]  he was obviously already well trained in the military and had the mindset and was on the type of
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:53.760]  Person who would be on a career path to become a double-o in mi6. It's you know, what is it?
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:59.080]  Like what would that what would that character be? Like when he's like one cut below becoming a double-o?
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:07.560]  You know and what would he be like when he first gets granted the double-o status and isn't really comfortable at that level
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.560]  It doesn't really get it yet. Isn't really
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:16.520]  Isn't quite prepared for it, you know, but still maybe a little a little insufferably arrogant. Yeah
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.440]  He knows he's on the cusp, but he's not he's not seasoned enough to be comfortable in it yet
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:28.400]  Yeah, and we've that scene on the train with him and Vesper going back and forth trading shots and he loses that argument
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:34.200]  Yeah, if anybody who doesn't anybody who doesn't hold that that's one of the best scenes in an action movie in
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:40.160]  In recent memory, you know, I would say ever but and you know in the modern era of movies
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:45.760]  It's like we're just not gonna have be able to have a we're not gonna agree on anything when it comes to cinema
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.800]  It's not even actually that's one of my favorite scenes in a movie. Yeah, it's just so good
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:56.640]  It's and it's you know, it's in a series where the the level of actual
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:04.280]  Personal interplay between Bond and the women in the movie. It's just notoriously
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:09.580]  Thin, you know and it's more or less just blah blah blah. Let's go to bed
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:14.640]  Right. Yeah, and this plays so well against that but it even stands on its own
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:17.280]  It works in both directions, which I think is what makes it so great, right?
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.720]  You can see why both of them like each other and you can see why both of them dislike each other and you can see
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.920]  Why both of them like the other because of the reasons that they dislike the other
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:31.760]  Yeah, when she asks, how's the lamb and he says skewer? Yeah sympathizes. He says it with a smile
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:36.120]  Like he's kind of into this he's into this lady. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely one of the best scenes
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:42.120]  I it makes it to otherwise it's a great movie anyway, but it's it's really the scene that like puts it over the top
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:47.460]  What do you think I was thinking about this with specter and the movie specter
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:52.820]  And the organization is that there's there they they could be repeating a pattern
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.820]  So in the in the Sean Connery films, there's dr. No, and that's a specter movie. Dr
[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:03.740]  No is is you know, one of the agents of specter and from Russia with love is a specter movie
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:10.660]  Then the third one goldfinger was just about it was off specter and it was just this crackpot guy goldfinger and his plan
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:15.300]  And then in the fourth and fifth ones, they went back to to specter with dr
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:20.660]  No, and and you only live twice. So you're saying that with Casino Royale you had this one
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:26.340]  There was this shadowy organization that I believe you know you and I chatted about this today in prep for the show
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:30.640]  But I believe in Casino Royale there was never given a name to it, but there was the guy mr. White
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:33.340]  Which is the guy who he?
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:37.460]  The great scene at the end of the movie when this guy mr
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:41.940]  White who had been like behind all this scheming and the funding of Le Chiffre
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:48.620]  And who saved James Bond's life by coming in and killing Le Chiffre and letting Bond go when he was being tortured
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:55.080]  The offer. Yeah, how would you pronounce it? I think it's Le Chiffre Le Chiffre. Yeah, I mean
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.580]  I'm sure the Internet's gonna correct me. Yeah, let's shift shift for whatever
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:01.460]  Le Chiffre, I guess that's what they say in a movie actually
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.540]  It's foreign
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:09.220]  This mr. White guy is you know, obviously if not the highest up
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:12.660]  It's he's a higher up in some shadowy criminal organization
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:18.140]  And then he's you know, one of the neat things about quantum of solace, which it opposite of Skyfall
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:23.500]  I continue to like more and more as I as the years go on and I rewatch it
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.500]  like if I redid I bet of all the
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:32.820]  Commentaries I did with Dan on the original series the one I would probably change the most if I redid it now is quantum
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:40.180]  of solace, which I at the time did not like because of a bunch of plot holes and some weak writing the more I watch it
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.620]  I like it more
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:49.260]  And I I even like I like the idea that it starts like an hour after Casino Royale. Yeah, it's like the next day
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.900]  Yeah, he's got it. He's got mr
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.260]  White in the trunk of his car
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:55.520]  But you don't even know that until he opens the trunk of his car
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.440]  When you see it in theaters, it had been like two or three years since Casino Royale
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:06.420]  so you've probably forgotten about that and I think that assuming that this was a whole new story starting over was what ruined the movie for
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.500]  The people who didn't like it, right, but if you watch them if you it yeah, that's a good thing
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:14.820]  I think that's why I like it more and more. I do think so that it's the fact that it continues from it
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:21.240]  Yeah, take a day take an afternoon and watch them back to back quantum of solace is a much better movie than than you
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:22.500]  Probably so I didn't know this
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:29.960]  I was under the impression that the criminal organization and you know and that they had like the the the right-hand man to M
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:33.300]  Was in fact the double agent working for them, you know
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:39.500]  And he he betrays them and you know almost kills em and bond and he's the guy who rescues mr. White from captivity
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:48.300]  That that organization in quantum of solace it ends up that they call the organization quantum at some point and if you google and you
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:50.460]  Know look around and just google for quantum
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:54.660]  Organization James Bond you'll see that there's people who call that organization
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.760]  Quantum and that's how I read it
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:03.120]  I guess but wouldn't it be cool though if it if if they somehow make it seem as though that organization is specter
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.240]  Well, it was pretty strongly of the hinted at least and that's how I read it
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.520]  Right is that that was or maybe that was like the code name. Well, yeah earlier
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:10.760]  Yeah
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:12.480]  like a code name of it and the
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:18.080]  Explanation behind the scenes was that dates they hadn't settled this lawsuit with the clever Kevin Maclaurin estate
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.240]  Miss state, you know getting back to Maclaurin. The whole thing is a year ago in 2013
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.160]  Eon productions finally wrote a check of you know
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.420]  Both sides agreed not to say what it was
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:35.160]  but some amount of money they gave to Kevin Maclaurin estate because I guess Maclaurin died a few years ago and now
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.380]  Eon wholly owns the rights to
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.640]  Specter and Thunderball again
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:46.080]  That seems like the thing that could only happen after Maclaurin dies and after Albert Broccoli dies
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.120]  Right once once like the people who were actually having
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:53.640]  Actually involved in that that angry battle are out of the picture
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.320]  It could like cooler heads prevail, right?
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:01.360]  because that was one of the side effects even though Maclaurin only had the rights to redo as in terms of Ian Fleming's material to
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.040]  Do Thunderball somehow part of the side effects of this judgment was that?
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:06.880]  Eon
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:13.480]  Couldn't use specter anymore and they did make a few more movies, you know after Thunderball, but at some point after
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:15.480]  Diamonds are forever
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:21.720]  The the lawsuit got to such a place where they felt like they couldn't or shouldn't or were
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:26.700]  Explicitly told they can't make if they use specter then Maclaurin would get the rights to that movie, too
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:32.840]  You know that if they put him in, you know, the spy love me that then then Maclaurin
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:36.400]  Oh somehow specter was somehow part of what you got with Thunderball
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:42.200]  And so last year they finally just made it all go away and now they own the rights to it
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:44.400]  So now they can call it specter. So I feel like they should
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.840]  Clearly they should do that, right?
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:53.640]  They should make you know somehow blur the lines of the what was called quantum and just say that that's you know specter
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.840]  Yeah, it could be that it was quantum was an offshoot. It could be that that was the precursor organization
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:02.640]  Don't even really need to give us a whole bunch of backstory
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:08.160]  You just tie it together quickly but give us one line of dialogue
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:14.560]  Yeah, like they call it call it a give us an allusion to project quantum and that's good enough. Yeah
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:21.560]  I hope they don't I hope they don't reuse the acronym the special projects and
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:25.400]  Something something because it doesn't even really add up to specter
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:29.840]  You have to like cross out a couple of letters and to get the S and the P
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:33.620]  You have to count both the S and P and special or you know
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.920]  We know what you're doing. You're just trying to get to the word spec
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:41.200]  You're just if you want to call it specter. Just call it specter. It's a cool name. Yeah, we all agree. It's a cool man
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.600]  Yeah, it there's no reason to background in it. And and the one that Fleming came up with was pretty bad
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:49.480]  It's kind of like shield shield has a crazy
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:56.000]  Yeah, and they totally embraced that with the there in one of the I don't know if it was an Iron Man movie
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.740]  Or yes, Iron Man where they didn't have the acronym yet
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:05.140]  But agent Coulson, you know said I'm from the whatever homeland blah blah blah blah blah
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:07.140]  and strategic homeland intelligence
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:11.940]  Something in logistics division. I can't believe I remembered that much of it, right?
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:17.040]  Yeah, and he's like somebody says that's a mouthful and he says yeah, we're working on it. Yeah
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:24.020]  That's actually but if you think about it, it's actually I remember thinking about it when it came out
[02:06:24.020 --> 02:06:30.140]  It's actually pretty good. Like there aren't any like real clunker words in there like there are in the specter actor
[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:35.500]  I wonder how many people they had working on that. I don't know or if they came up with one guy who was really good at
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:38.500]  background aiming
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:44.860]  That's just such a fun word. Where is the air? It's the special executive for counterintelligence
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.260]  terrorism revenge and extortion
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:51.740]  So you have to use the S and the P from special, right?
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:54.560]  And I mean if you're gonna if you're gonna make a special case for any word
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:59.540]  It should be the word special and the way Fleming spelled it if counterintelligence was hyphenated
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:01.540]  So you have to ignore the I
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:05.620]  Some words you get two letters
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:11.540]  Sometimes you get two words only have one letter and I think revenge really sticks out as sort of
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:17.780]  You know that if you weren't back running it, why would you put revenge in as the organization's, you know?
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:21.180]  counterintelligence, okay terrorism definitely
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:27.220]  Extortion definitely right like as opposed to you know
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:31.440]  Like a religious terrorist group that is just after it for the the you know
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.680]  for the
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:40.440]  Virgins in heaven or whatever, you know specters in it for the money. So yeah extortion definitely part of it, but revenge
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:45.480]  Like it's like look guys we can do all these things but only the people who have wronged us
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.040]  Yeah
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:52.100]  Cuz it also implies that you're gonna have they're gonna build up a list of enemies along the way that they have to get revenge
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:57.540]  Against as opposed to wouldn't your wouldn't your ideal be that you leave no enemies behind that
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:01.540]  There is nobody that you need to seek revenge against because you're never gonna get wronged
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:07.060]  Oh, I thought it was that they were it was all in the name of revenge against people for things that had already happened
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:11.120]  Oh, maybe which leaves you no room for advancement or growth
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:14.380]  former schoolmates of Blofeld
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:21.460]  Is the guy that I gave him a swirly in second grade right the girl who wouldn't go to the prom with him
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:25.960]  It's pretty pretty short list. We're not gonna be that busy. Don't be honest with you guys
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:30.300]  We might have to add some letters at the end for like I don't know
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:35.180]  Playing online poker we can we can maybe do some stuff together on the weekends
[02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.980]  How do you guys feel about larping?
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:45.620]  Let's if you take one last break and thank our final sponsor for this episode
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:47.940]  another longtime
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:49.940]  Good friend of the show
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.660]  lynda.com
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:56.060]  That's ly NDA calm
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:09:03.700]  lynda.com is an easy and affordable way to help you learn at your own pace with

[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:21.620]  App programming anything you can think of that you might be able to learn through an online video course lynda.com has it
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:28.480]  They stand out from the crowd. They have new stuff added daily new courses are constantly coming in
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.560]  They work with industry experts and software companies to provide timely training
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.760]  often on the same day that new versions are
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:40.740]  released and hit the market so like a new version of Lightroom comes out and
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:44.300]  There's a new version of the Lightroom course from lynda.com
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:52.140]  Same day or very very close thereafter because the person who teaches the course at lynda.com at Lightroom is like a beta tester and
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:54.400]  works with Adobe
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:10:01.980]  High quality easy to follow video. This is absolutely nothing at all like the type of stuff you see on YouTube. It's not
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:07.660]  You know somebody's shooting a video out of the camera on their MacBook. It's all super super
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:10.600]  professional high quality production values
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:15.580]  Learning at its finest they have great tools
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:18.780]  the tools include searchable transcripts
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:25.100]  Playlists and certificates of course completion, which you can publish to your LinkedIn profile
[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.100]  I remember the first time I heard that I rolled my eyes
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:32.820]  But that's because I don't have a real job in a real world LinkedIn. It's true. It's link in the real world
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:36.380]  If you have a job LinkedIn is super super, you know important
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:41.340]  And it's a cool way that your LinkedIn profile can be automatically
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:46.080]  It's the way that LinkedIn is so much better than like the you know last time I had to get a real job
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:51.260]  It was like real resumes where you'd like open up a document and keep your resume up today. Well with something like
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:58.340]  LinkedIn where there's an API your profile stays up-to-date based on the stuff that you've learned from Linda
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:02.980]  So as you learn more stuff your LinkedIn profile shows it which is kind of clever
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:08.100]  They have mobile apps for iPhone iPad and Android
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:11.260]  So you can learn on the go
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:16.340]  One low price of 25 bucks a month gives you
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:19.060]  unlimited access to over
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.320]  100
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.720]  Thousand video tutorials. It's a great deal for all the content
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:28.640]  You just pay that 25 bucks a month and you just watch as much as you want
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.320]  They have a premium plan
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.640]  if you pay annually
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:40.680]  You can download courses to your iPhone or iPad or Android and watch them offline great for taking them on airplanes
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.600]  premium plan members can also download project files and
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:50.080]  And practice along with the instructor so you get access to more more content than just the video you get actual
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.360]  Projects and stuff like that. That's huge huge deal
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.040]  I was learning Photoshop when I would I'd actually get my hands on PSD's that's when I learned that's like when I that was
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.560]  The best part of it. So here's a fun fact that they have this is amazing
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:10.200]  30% of colleges and universities and most of the Ivy League schools offer Linda comm subscriptions to their students and faculty members

[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.080]  And it's the type of stuff that colleges aren't really meant for they're not gonna get a good course in college on how to use
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:22.160]  Photoshop
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:28.400]  Colleges really meant for stuff that's timeless and Linda comm is meant for stuff that changes year after year after year

[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:21.120]  So Fleming the BBC series we finished that there would you get the best you you couldn't have missed it. There's a vest
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.120]  I think it's an episode one. There's a Vesper joke
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.600]  I'm I'm sure I did but Fleming comes to a bar and
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:31.880]  It's I guess it's supposed to be like a seedy place. I don't know
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.040]  I didn't really look like it if it seemed like poor art direction, but he goes up to the bartender and just says
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:43.840]  Three measures of Gordon's one measure. Yes half a measure of Kina Lele and the bartender hands him a bottle of beer
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.040]  And there's a sort of you know
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:52.840]  We don't have shit like that here look on the bartender's face and that's it
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:55.640]  I like that because it's a joke that you have to be a fit, you know
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.120]  You know, if you're not a Bond fan, it doesn't make it. That's that that whole interaction makes no sense
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.400]  And if you are a Bond fan, it's it makes all the sense in the world
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.800]  Well, I think it still makes sense
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:11.560]  it means that here's a guy's coming in wanting a hoity-twitty kind of drink and he it says something about that character and his
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  misunderstanding of where he was
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  Yeah, because he was kind of this entitled brat at that point in his and in the story
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.920]  I was gonna say in his life which may have also been true. Yeah
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:27.480]  it's very watching it at no point did it occur to me to to take this as a literal reading of anything that ever happened to
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.800]  Ian Fleming like I'm sure there's elements of truth to it
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:37.560]  But it seems like this is somebody making a miniseries out of the stories that Ian Fleming told the people to make himself
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:40.840]  Sound cool. Hmm. I actually since I started watching it. I
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:47.080]  I haven't I've resisted the urge to google it because I want to watch the fourth episodes before I do but then I'm gonna look at
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:53.560]  And see how much of it is purportedly true. I think a significant amount of it is is true
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:15:00.440]  I think it's you know it when I went through it. It's see I've from what I read it seemed like most of this was
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:06.120]  Like blurred lines like so much of what he did while he was in in the service
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:13.160]  Was like redacted and he you know stuff that you're they'll never come out and say whether that's true or not whether he actually did those
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:13.640]  things
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.160]  They'll never come out and say whether that's true or not whether he actually did those things
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.920]  But what they could line up is like well, there's elements of truth and these things probably happen. Maybe not the way he said
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:28.840]  But the the consensus it seemed was that this is sort of you know, as much bullshit as it was truth
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:33.400]  Right, which to me is I mean, that's that's what storytelling is and that's what he was was a storyteller
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.360]  yeah, and it seems like it's set up where he's sort of
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:43.400]  Repeatedly he you know, he works as you know in in British intelligence during World War two
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:47.160]  that's almost the bulk of the movie or that series and
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.800]  Just comes up with clever. His whole job is to come up with clever ideas to screw the Germans
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:00.040]  But he he keeps wanting to get sent out into the field and isn't isn't allowed to
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:04.120]  And then you know it sets it up that his the whole
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.760]  The whole reason he wrote the Bond series was to have a guy like him who does get to go out in the field
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.840]  yeah, a little bit of
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:16.440]  Exploring those fantasies getting to live out those fantasies through your character. Yeah, I forget her name, but the there's like a
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:25.000]  Money penny like woman who works with his bought for his boss who is almost too
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.920]  uncannily like the the original money penny in the movies
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:35.880]  Which must have been that they had to be intentional. Oh, I think it's absolutely and you know, I think it's over-the-top intentional
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.720]  I wouldn't be surprised if I I don't know. I don't know
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.720]  I haven't looked it up yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if that part of it for example is just purely fiction. Yeah
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.640]  But it's so tough to tell because so much of that era of his life is just him telling those stories
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:57.160]  Yeah, my bottom line on Fleming is for anybody if you love Bond and you love the way that he does it
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:01.120]  If you love Bond and you like the you like Bond you should watch it
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:06.640]  Especially while it's free on Netflix and if you're not if you're like kind of like and on Bond it's I would say skip it
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:13.120]  What was the other Oh everything or nothing the documentary? Yeah, that was disappointing too. I thought really well
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.720]  I liked it. But again, I wouldn't recommend it for anybody who wasn't a big fan. I would say if you've seen
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:24.880]  Every or nearly every Bond movie you'd probably like Fleming and you'd probably like everything or nothing
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:27.120]  Actually, I take it back now that I think about it more
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:31.600]  I think everything I think I think I'm misremembering off the top of my bed. I actually I think top of my head
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.160]  I think I actually really liked everything or nothing. I enjoyed it and I if for nothing else
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:44.040]  To hear Lazenby get to talk about in hindsight the way he acted and his role in the Bond universe
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:46.040]  Yeah, that's worth the price of admission
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:51.160]  Yeah, I totally take it back now that I think about it cuz that's the one I was misremembering. It's the one where
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:54.640]  In addition to some great stuff with Lazenby
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:58.760]  I thought there was really really great stuff with
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:01.440]  Pierce Brosnan. Oh
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:06.240]  Yeah, well he was talking about he he says I forget the forget exactly what he says
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.240]  but he pretty much comes right out and
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:12.560]  Says on camera that after after Goldeneye
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:16.000]  He doesn't really remember the differences between the movies because they're all more or less the same
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:20.940]  Well, not that he doesn't remember the differences, but that he can't he doesn't remember which one was which right, right?
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:24.920]  Yeah, that's what I mean that there's like well, they all they all kind of blurred together like he remembers
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:28.160]  You know who was in them and he remembers, you know that but he can't you know
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:31.320]  Which ones the world is not enough which one is you know?
[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:36.000]  Because that that era I have the same problem
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.040]  I remember Goldeneye very very clearly and everything after that for him
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.720]  I don't remember which I don't even remember that was there was he in three of them or four of them?
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.680]  It was in five I believe
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:46.680]  No, yeah
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.840]  Let's go. Look it up
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:51.740]  There's Goldeneye world is not enough tomorrow never dies
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.440]  I think it was it. I think was three. No, I'm gonna bet there's five
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:06.520]  I'll go as high as four you might be right. So there was Goldeneye in 95 tomorrow never dies in 97
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.440]  that's the one with
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:15.120]  The news right? Yeah the the the Rupert Murdoch
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:22.280]  yeah, the Rupert Murdoch guy and Terry Hatcher as like an old girlfriend who's now back in his life because she was dating the
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:28.600]  Rupert Murdoch off then there's the world is not enough. That was with Denise Richards. Yeah, and then die another day
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:31.760]  Oh, that's right. There were four Halle Berry, right?
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:35.680]  I think that was Halle Berry and I think that was also the
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.160]  the
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.160]  invisible car
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.800]  And the ice hotel just try to say that without laughing it's impossible
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.440]  But yeah, but you know what and it's funny you want to talk about, you know, it's specter a good title
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:57.040]  At least you know, like those those those other titles are so empty tomorrow never dies. The world is not enough die another day
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.640]  They sound like Bond movies, but they sound like what they are like Bond movies that are indistinguishable from one another
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.240]  Yeah, exactly. Like exactly like die another day tomorrow never dies
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.320]  so if you told me that the plot of die another day was tomorrow never dies, I would say I would believe you and if
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:15.040]  you told me the plot of
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:21.480]  Tomorrow never dies was in fact the plot of die another day. I would believe you I get the title means nothing
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.280]  I refer to anything that happened the same thing with the world is not enough
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:28.440]  I don't know like if you told me the world is not enough is the one with the Rupert Murdoch guy
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:33.960]  I would say that makes sense because it's like he wanted to take over the world or something. I don't know but it's not
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:38.160]  Whereas if you told me that dr
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:44.360]  No was about a crazy German guy who wants to steal all the gold in Fort Knox. I would be like no
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.560]  You know or if you told me that
[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:51.440]  Diamonds are forever, which a lot of people don't even like
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:55.240]  You know diamonds are forever was about a guy
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:00.400]  You know who
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:02.400]  I
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:05.640]  Had a had a crazy tank that looked like
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.140]  Gila monster on an island in Jamaica. I would be like no that was dr. No
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:16.440]  At least like
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:20.200]  Gold finger that that meant something to the plot, right?
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.840]  Diamonds are for them meant some moonraker that and definitely meant something to the plot say what you will about moonraker
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.800]  That title meant something right but tomorrow never dies
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:34.480]  Same with Skyfall Skyfall, you know and it breaks a pattern where it's not named after like the bad guy or the MacGuffin
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:38.640]  But it's about the character, you know, you know, you'll never like 30 40 years from now
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:42.360]  We're not gonna forget which one Skyfall was killer song. Yeah
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:47.880]  Quantum of solace quantum of solace fails that test the song test
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:53.000]  No the title test and the band and the song test it is and you know
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:59.600]  How did quantum of solace have the Soundgarden song? Maybe it was a good song or is that the it was Chris Cornell?
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:03.000]  Chris Cornell, but not not full-on Soundgarden. I think yeah, that wasn't bad
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.480]  I would say it passes the song test but Skyfall that that song like that still stands. You still hear that on the radio
[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:15.160]  Yeah, steer here like in the when you're out shopping or something. You'll hear that on the PA like that's still a good song
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:19.120]  Yeah, those are bad. But anyway Pierce Brosnan even admits that he confuses them
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:24.120]  And so I would tell I would hold hardly to recommend the world or no. What's the documentary?
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:31.240]  Everything or nothing. Yeah, because that's that's where we learned what what eon productions stood for the eon everything or nothing, right?
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:35.040]  Which was a huge reveal to me. Yeah, same here
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:40.280]  I didn't know that and it's because I just knew it always confused me that it didn't seem like it had any kind of
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.320]  reference to the initials of Cubby broccoli or
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:46.800]  The other guy who was his original co-producing partner
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:48.800]  I
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.320]  Saltzman yeah. Yeah Harry Saltzman. Yeah, that's right
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:56.960]  There's like a million people listening this right now like
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:03.560]  Angry that that they're not able to have their voices heard when they're when we're trying to struggle to remember these things
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:09.900]  We need a life. We need the live audience. I'm sure people are yelling at their phones right now. It's Saltzman. Yeah
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.040]  All right, one last thing before we wrap up keep this show short I
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:18.840]  I do I want to talk to you about it. I was you've got a new thing
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:25.000]  So you've got a new thing that you've been doing for a couple weeks couple months better on the better elevation podcast
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.320]  You used to have a blog. We still have a blog called better elevation
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:27.680]  Yeah
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:34.040]  This is I guess it's I went from it being a blog to it being this other thing and does it coincide does it?
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.600]  Coincide with the end of unprofessional
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:39.960]  It through I guess or just as
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:44.360]  It yeah, that's not like a direct. I mean there's like a chronological
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:47.640]  I had this availability and I was thinking about what I could do creatively
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:54.800]  But there's no like this led to that kind of a causal relationship. So now you're doing a show on YouTube
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.320]  Do you consider yourself a youtuber? I guess just today
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:04.260]  I signed up for a Vimeo Pro account mostly because they had this this deal sort of a Black Friday deal where if you bought
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:08.500]  It's 200 bucks a year for Vimeo Pro account and that their deal was if you buy
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:12.020]  The one-year membership the pro account for $200
[02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:17.340]  They would give you a $200 gift card to be an H which is a like a photography electronics store
[02:24:17.900 --> 02:24:22.860]  Here in New York, and I need to buy some more equipment. So this was like well, I'm gonna spend that money
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:24.860]  Anyway, I may as well get a Vimeo account up. I'm
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:31.080]  Rolling my eyes thinking about our sponsors this we don't really have anybody who sells gadgets even in the rotation of sponsors
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:33.080]  But B&H is a fantastic
[02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:35.980]  Store
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:43.340]  They have amazing prices amazing amazing service and this crazy like pneumatic tube system for sending the things down to
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:48.260]  I don't even know how to explain it in the confines of a nice short podcast like this
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:52.020]  Yeah, I've never been there in person, but I've heard that it's cool. It's pretty amazing
[02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:57.180]  It's like when you were a kid, do you ever go like the the drive-up teller at the bank and they have them?
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:58.300]  Yeah, yeah
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:02.860]  When I was a kid, like I was so fascinated like the my imagination went nuts
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:08.460]  like there must have been a chocolate factory back there where Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas were sending money through tubes and
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:12.860]  Sometimes candy would come through and they noticed there's a kid in the car and that's it
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:17.040]  It's kind of like being in the chocolate factory watching the tubes go over your head
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:18.940]  That's what it's like being a B&H man
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.980]  If you want like an obscure lens for like a Canon or Nikon or something like that man B&H has everything
[02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:30.260]  But anyway you bet you're doing you're doing this how many episode do you up to now five six six?
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:33.740]  I think and they're about four or five six minutes long and
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:36.860]  it's
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:39.100]  So it's sort of the opposite of
[02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:43.180]  like this show which is two hours of I
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:45.460]  Don't want to say a rambling
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:51.900]  I want to I don't you know, but it's the complaint about podcasts like the talk show that it's unstructured and goes on
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:56.420]  It's five minutes of very tightly scripted and then edited
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:58.420]  Monologue
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:05.860]  Yeah, and a couple weeks ago. I did an episode about podcasting about what I thought the problem with podcasting is and
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:11.980]  It it's almost uncomfortable to say it here on this show because you know it's this show
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:17.540]  but it sort of seems like there's the talk show and then there's a bunch of shows that kind of
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:19.900]  followed the template of the talk show and
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:22.820]  Even even on things that I've done
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:26.940]  I've tried to never do a podcast about like, you know work stuff
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:31.500]  I've never done a podcast about design like even unprofessional was very specifically not talking about work
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:38.780]  No, that was the whole premise of unprofessional was that it was here's somebody whose work we admire and right whatever field and we are
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:44.020]  Ground rules for the episode is that we are not going to talk about that work. Yeah, that's the one rule
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:49.380]  We can talk about anything but work and sometimes it would be crazy stuff like talking to somebody about like, you know
[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:54.500]  Elephant genitalia because that was just where the conversation wound up with molts
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.200]  We had molts on we went up talking about what it would be like to eat people
[02:26:57.580 --> 02:26:58.420]  You know
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:02.580]  You never know where it's gonna the conversation is gonna take you and that's kind of what it's like to be at a bar and talk
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.240]  To people I'm surprised the elephant genitalia didn't come up with molts
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:09.220]  Because frankly whenever I see
[02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:18.220]  It's like if molts molts is so intimately familiar with elephant
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:23.160]  you know the old thing where there's like three blind guys feeling an elephant and they all say different things and one guy's like
[02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:25.940]  You know, it's a tree trunk. It's
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:31.920]  Yeah, molts if he was the blind guy would be right underneath the middle and he'd be like it's an elephant and it's a man
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:34.620]  the male I
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:37.140]  Know this elephant
[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:44.720]  I'd recognize that anywhere these grapefruit sizes. Well, they're probably bigger than grapefruit size actually
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:49.540]  I have honestly I have no idea. I'm so clearly not familiar with elephant genitalia
[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:54.060]  I think that I think the topic was about how they they were or were not prehensile
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:57.620]  Elephant penis. No, not to be
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:02.980]  Why would they be pretty they're huge probably but why would they be prehensile, but I don't know
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:09.540]  Well, it was because like kangaroos kangaroos. They are prehensile. Anyway, yeah getting way off topic here. I did
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:14.700]  Yeah, and I only know this because I was at a zoo in Australia and there are some kangaroos going at it
[02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:15.780]  That's and yeah
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:20.460]  It was like it was like the the male kangaroo on top of the female kangaroo and it was like it was kind of feeling
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:25.180]  Around down there trying to find where to go and it was a it was a very illuminating and disturbing moment
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:30.700]  That should be just as well known as the pouches thing. Yeah. Well, I don't think they like telling that to kids in school
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:39.100]  One time we had Amy's Amy has a much younger brother and he was still a kid. He's in college now, but he was I
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:41.380]  Don't he was only like 10 or 11
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:46.780]  We took him to the Philadelphia Zoo and we were at the turtle exhibit and these turtles they have signs
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:50.620]  I mean these turtles are like something like the male is like 85 years old. I mean, he's ancient
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:58.700]  Super bold and wouldn't you know it the guy the guy went right up behind the female and and just went right at her
[02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:02.420]  and I forget if it was the male or the female or if it was
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:09.460]  If it was impossible to tell because neither of their mouths were really moving but one of them was really really getting into it audibly
[02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:10.780]  I
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:17.700]  Mean, it's broad daylight open and I would say 10 or 15 feet away from the railing and there's these big
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:22.000]  three four foot grand turtles and they
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:24.940]  screwing right there and open and
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:30.420]  All these kids there's so many kids and all the kids are saying
[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:33.460]  What are they doing?
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:35.780]  What is he hurting her?
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:42.740]  And I mean the question kids are really like, you know, like something was clearly going on and it was noisy genuine concern
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:49.660]  Right and for the most part those turtles don't even move and this the male this old male turtle is really going
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:55.300]  And it was I it was one of the best it was like the reason zoos exist because it's like what do you watch?
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:03.460]  Do you watch the 85 year old turtle have at it or do you turn around and watch all the parents try to decide?
[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:09.680]  What do I do? Like some of the parents were clearly of the let's just pretend this is nothing
[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:12.860]  You know, let's just you know
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:16.860]  let's get real Catholic about this and just go into denial that this is going on and
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:22.100]  Other parents were more of the sort of liberal open-minded
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:26.780]  I don't want to act as though this is anything to be embarrassed about I'm going you know
[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:28.860]  How do I explain this to my kid in a sort of?
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:35.900]  Mature professional and and there's no way you could there's no possible way that you could talk to like a ten-year-old kid in a serious
[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:41.260]  Way about turtles who are having having sex it becomes a meta zoo where you're watching people watch animals
[02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:44.340]  All right, that would be a good Bond movie title turtles having sex
[02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:47.020]  I'd watch it
[02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:50.500]  No, but yet but your pod that's one of the things that
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:55.780]  I've had it in my notes for the next time you were on the show to talk about the podcast you called it podcast
[02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:57.860]  intervention
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:03.900]  yeah, it just seems like we've got a lot of really smart people and a lot of very talented people, but
[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:10.460]  We've kind of fallen into and when I say we I mean like you know the Apple tech community
[02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:14.800]  No, I mean not like the world at large or even the tech community at large, but like in within our bubble
[02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:16.980]  It's like a lot of people kind of doing
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:22.060]  Variations on the same theme and it's not that I think people shouldn't do podcasts in fact
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:24.560]  I think people should do more podcasts. I think everybody should have a podcast
[02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:31.180]  I think it's a great way to communicate ideas and broadcast them. I just wish that we would maybe try some other stuff, too
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:36.820]  And maybe try some variation in the way we approach podcasting. You're you know, we work together. You're not gonna you know
[02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:41.940]  We work together on this show you edit the show for those who don't know Dave edits the show Dave
[02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:48.620]  Even handles the sponsorship sales now for this show the talk show. I mean you're as close as there is to
[02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:54.440]  Well, you are you you should you should be correct you do enough work on this show that you should get a credit except
[02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:56.900]  We don't have credits if the show had any kind of visuals
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:03.120]  There would be an edited and some kind of maybe even produced by Dave whiskers credit on the talk show
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:07.460]  So it's no surprise that you're going to say good things about it
[02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:14.100]  But when I saw that episode of better elevation, I even though you I don't even remember if you mentioned my show
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:18.500]  I think you said good things about this show in ATP something about the fact that we you know
[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:24.900]  that this show in ATP work because the authors have strong voices that we already knew and now we get to hear them in another
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.300]  Context something it's it's it's the already new part
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:31.740]  It's that you would you listen to the talk show not because you heard there's this thing called the talk show
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:37.220]  It's a great podcast. You're probably listening to the talk show because you read daring fireball. Yeah, I don't who knows I know
[02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:40.940]  That's a good question. I just assume that for as popular as this show has gotten
[02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:48.260]  I just assume that it's it's a subset of the people who read daring fireball that there are very I maybe there are some though
[02:32:48.260 --> 02:32:52.120]  I'd love to hear from you. But if there are people who don't like daring fireball, but do like the show
[02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:57.780]  But I I do kind of feel like it's sort of like I it's funny to start tying some of these strings together
[02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:02.380]  But I think it's in the way that Fleming only works if you're already a bond fan
[02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:07.020]  Mmm, then the talk show only works if you're already a daring fireball fan
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:11.980]  Well, yeah, you you've referred to the talk show as the it's like the director's commentary track writing fireball
[02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:19.900]  But what I saw your your better elevation it even though you were complimentary towards the show. I took it as you know, I
[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:23.460]  Took it as as
[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:25.640]  Motivation that why don't I up the game?
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:30.940]  I do feel like I'm incredibly lazy with the format of this show that there's more I could do we could do anything
[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:31.580]  You know
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:37.840]  But I think that's a healthy response and really like oh I kind of pissed some people off and some people thought that I was
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:39.840]  Attacking one person or another
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.960]  I don't want to get in the lake all of that
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.560]  but the when I when I had mentioned on the in the video that we have
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:53.900]  Multiple podcast networks that are run by a white dude who is on more than one of those shows
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:59.920]  Chloe if not every show on that network than almost every show on the network and it's really easy to
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:04.120]  Assume that I'm talking about any one of these people when really I'm the fact that there are more than one
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:07.560]  There's more than one person that I could be talking about is kind of what I'm talking about, right?
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:12.280]  it's not like it's not like it has anything particular to do with Leo Laporte or Dan Benjamin or
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.320]  Even who like Moises or somebody like that, you know
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:16.480]  Yeah
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:22.040]  or or Mike Hurley or Vinnie Richie or but there's so many to choose from and that's kind of what I'm talking about where
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:27.200]  We might have a hundred podcasts, but it seems like it's maybe the same 20 people doing all 100 of them
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:30.240]  Right and and that again that's not even necessarily a bad thing
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:32.960]  It's that the problem isn't with any one of those people or any one of those shows
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:38.320]  It's that you can you can say that vague phrase, you know white dude, you know from the tech world
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:41.020]  Who's on a bunch of shows and it can apply to so many of them?
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:41.640]  Yeah
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:46.720]  and any one of those shows any one of those people their quality shows quality people do most of them are friends of mine people
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:49.700]  That I would I would speak very highly of them and their shows and their approach to their work
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:54.320]  Mike Hurley I talked to a lot even before like I sent him the script for the show and we talked a lot about
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:58.840]  Like the state of podcasting and what what could be done to push things forward and he's got a lot of great ideas
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:02.840]  And I really do think that he's a voice for for positive change there
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:08.080]  but like at a macro level when you zoom out and you you start to see a lot of like
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:10.800]  It's like it's like the speaking tying threads together
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:16.560]  It's like you zoom out in attack of the clones and you see just a sea of blue and green lightsabers
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:19.600]  That wouldn't look great. You start to see the problem with only two colors
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:25.360]  You have to add some more colors in there and I'm worried that as our sphere of influence grows
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:29.560]  We're not really adding anything else to it. Like we're kind of working with those same ingredients
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:35.200]  yeah, and I worry that we and by we I really mean me since I have a
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:43.320]  popular show and I already have an audience that I'm not doing anywhere near enough to exercise any sort of muscles to play with the
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.200]  form
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:51.400]  It's you know hit record and we've got plenty of stuff to talk about and I think that it's you know
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:53.400]  and based on feedback from people and the fact that
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.880]  You know the the download numbers for this show are going up
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:03.040]  They're they're growing up faster than traffic at daring fireball like a daring fireball is sort of peaked
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.920]  Readership wise at least in terms of things you can measure but the show is gaining popularity
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:14.320]  and I think it's because I've gotten so many interesting people on who have interesting things to say, but the forum is
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:20.440]  Incredibly lazy. It's get somebody interesting on the other end and hit record for two hours and
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.040]  Then, you know pass it over to Dave to get the levels fixed and the mistakes cut out
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.920]  Whereas we could do anything, you know, you know, we could do something like cereal or whatever
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:34.520]  Yeah, people were I kept seeing when that when that thing came out
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:40.760]  There's one all this discussion now about podcasts over the last couple of weeks and I keep hearing the same phrase repeated which is
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.600]  podcasts are
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.600]  Are the new blogs?
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:48.880]  Which I disagree with because with a blog post presumably
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:54.200]  You would come up with an idea and you'd think through it and you would edit it and you would refine it and you'd go through
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.880]  A few drafts whereas on a podcast you you at least from what I you know on the landscape
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:01.040]  It's more like sitting down and you hit record and having a conversation
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:06.520]  So it's not that podcasts are the new blogs. It's more like podcasts or the new I am logs
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.740]  Like this is it's a conversation. There's nothing wrong with that
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:13.760]  My my only argument is I think we could also be doing other things to push it forward
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  Yeah, I totally agree with that. I
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.320]  like for example, I
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:24.920]  And I know not that nobody has ever done it but like for something like WWDC, you know
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.480]  Instead of just doing one big show or like I've done last couple years like the live show
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:36.120]  Which I could still do but why not in the course of the week do you know a couple of 15-minute episodes just with?
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.560]  You know new stuff like if I don't have time on day one to do a real episode of the show
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.640]  Why can't I have something that hits the feed and goes to podcast things with just like a 10-minute overview?
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:51.420]  Yeah, and like like build around segments rather than my conversation, right?
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:54.980]  And it would be you know in loose terms because the analogy doesn't hold for long
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:58.780]  But it would be like the way that I'm doing fireball. It's not just big long articles
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:02.860]  It's in fact, most of it is you know, real short things just links to other things
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:07.220]  Why couldn't the feed for the talk show have a bunch of little things in it? Yeah. Yeah
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:12.520]  And so it was I don't know Jason Snell was on unprofessional months ago
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:17.020]  and we had this like sort of meta discussion about podcasting and what it all means and
[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:20.200]  I was thinking about video and how
[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:27.060]  You'll you'll have you know a decent podcast that that gets a fair bit of traffic
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:29.060]  You'll get you know 10,000 people listening to an episode
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:34.780]  But you put out a YouTube video and that could hit tens or hundreds of thousands of views
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:38.820]  It could hit millions of views. There's people out there with with YouTube channels that have
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:46.580]  20 to 30 million subscribers to say nothing of the views they get just subscribers people who are actively subscribed to that channel and
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:51.060]  It just seems like there's this huge audience for for this kind of content that
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:57.540]  Maybe we're we're just not we're not tapped into for whatever reason and I started thinking about that and I decided that whatever I do
[02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.660]  Next I want to I want to try something new
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:04.660]  I want to I want to push a boundary that I don't feel like we've been pushing and something that I
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:06.740]  Definitely feel I haven't pushed
[02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:10.900]  yeah, and for sure the way to do video I think is not the
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:16.180]  Let's just record a podcast and we'll also let the camera on our computer
[02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:19.540]  Stream us while we record a podcast
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:23.620]  You know what? I mean? Like yeah, Howard Stern did that
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:31.300]  His e-show was just them filming while they were recording the radio show. Yeah, and that was a little bit higher production value
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:32.700]  I'm you know
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:34.700]  like I'm thinking like like
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:38.900]  And I know some people like it some people actually like it but like the way that
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:43.540]  With Leo's shows the guests are all you know, there's also, you know
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:44.600]  They're they're recording audio
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:45.980]  but they also have video and
[02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:51.340]  Some of the people are in the studio and it works a little bit more because it looks a little bit more like a regular
[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:54.580]  TV thing but like like whenever I've been on, you know
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:59.740]  Mac break weekly or something like that. It's just a stupid view of me here in my home office
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:02.580]  you know staring at the computer with headphones on and
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:07.540]  And to me that's it's not really adding anything to me. It's almost distracting
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:11.660]  I feel like I would never enjoy listening to it watching it to show like that
[02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:16.340]  Like I don't want to see the guys record ATP that would I would gain nothing from that
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:22.940]  Whereas I do think though that in theory there is something that like the ATP guys could do that would be video
[02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:25.340]  But it's a different thing, right?
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:31.500]  Right, and that's where I get excited about the idea of video as a medium and it's so funny to talk about this as
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.500]  If it's like some new frontier that we've just discovered
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:35.500]  whereas
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:37.500]  Your son who's 10?
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:43.340]  Already knows everything about YouTube and that's just like the world he lives in and like you're not somebody until you have a YouTube channel
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.380]  Well, and it's funny because it's something you know
[02:40:45.380 --> 02:40:48.500]  It gets to the the weird notion that you have to have a name for a thing
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:54.500]  And that that the name for a thing can affect the way people feel and see and approach it, you know in that
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:41:02.620]  It was possible to do what is exactly known as blogging before the word blog or web blog or whatever you want to call it
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:09.060]  Hit but that it was only after we had a name for it that we all kind of agreed that you'd make posts and they
[02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:11.340]  Would you know top-down chronological order?
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:21.500]  That it made the whole thing take off and yeah people were doing what we now call podcasts before the word podcasts existed
[02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:26.900]  I mean they were doing it before there was even an iPod which is where the pod and podcast come from
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:32.060]  And I remember the first show I ever did was Sean King's
[02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:39.700]  Your Mac life and it was I was after during fireball started so it was like 2002
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:43.420]  But the tech I mean it was only 12 years ago
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:46.620]  But the tech was so old that there was no like way to do it over the Internet
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:52.620]  I actually had to use like a telephone and call in and we talked for like two hours. Yeah, I think we need
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:56.740]  There needs to be a template for this kind of thing. Yeah in the in the way that
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:41:59.540]  link blogs
[02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:05.380]  Sort of became a thing after kot key and during fireball like we had a template we kind of knew how that worked
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:08.300]  And so it's like oh well that that seems like a thing. I understand it
[02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:13.060]  I can I can do that not to the same level of quality, but I can make a thing to that pattern and
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:16.420]  It's not that there's anything wrong with following the pattern
[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:21.140]  It's that after a while if no new patterns start to emerge then maybe we've got a problem
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.260]  Yeah, I think part of it
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:27.860]  You know if you want to have something that what did you call for like a tumblr for podcasts more or less?
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:28.540]  Yeah
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:33.780]  There's there's no like drop in easy system like it seems like in the same way that
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:38.460]  Anybody could sit down in front of tumblr or Squarespace and and just make a website
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:44.380]  there's no way to do that for podcasts and it seems like there should be it seems like there should be really great software for
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:46.380]  making podcasts because
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:50.620]  Everybody who writes software has a podcast now you think that this like they would just happen
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:51.060]  Yeah
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:57.940]  I almost feel like the board podcast has become known as just two people or or a panel of people just turning on record and
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:42:59.100]  talking and
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:04.220]  That the name at the word itself is sort of limited the idea of what it what it can be
[02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:10.660]  Or as if we just called them shows it would be a little bit more open-ended and might be might entice people more to do
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:16.300]  Editing and I think also the word podcast has this like vibe of nerdy tech thing
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:19.060]  Maybe I don't know about that
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:26.420]  I think it definitely has a sort of amateur ring to it just like blonde did and it will will and will continue to wear
[02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:33.300]  Off as more and more podcasts get better production wise and more and more people with you know, like NPR
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:39.100]  You know, I like the millions of people who listen to serial which is a podcast
[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:39.940]  Yeah
[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:45.340]  But and it's it's a great example of what you could be doing with the medium and what's funny to me is audio as a medium
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:47.940]  Is older than movies that's older than TV. Yeah
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.380]  that that
[02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:52.700]  That we're not looking at that as the template
[02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:58.820]  Is it's interesting to me like well you get like incomparable. They're doing radio plays and that kind of thing
[02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:05.140]  You get Mike I forget the name of the show Mike Hurley and Casey Liss talking about, you know real-life stuff
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:10.740]  these these are shows that are kind of if if the format isn't pushing a boundary then at least the subject matter is and
[02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:17.100]  That's like I I'd love to see more of that. But also I'd like to see people trying things that aren't just
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:22.380]  Audio, like there are other things we could be doing and we have in the same way that
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:29.420]  We we it's it's so easy to sit down from a computer and put something on the internet that you typed out or that you recorded
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:37.460]  An audio it's it's in fact even easier as bad as as weird as it is that the tools don't exist to make podcasting easier
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:42.100]  It's even weirder that we're not doing more video when those tools do exist for video. I
[02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:49.060]  Feel like it's an editing problem too though because I feel like the that the tools to make these like we're in they'll come eventually
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:53.580]  they'll probably come sooner rather than later, but I feel like it's more than just about hitting record and
[02:44:54.700 --> 02:45:02.260]  Then hitting stop and then somehow being able to quickly post what happened in between hitting record and stop like
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:06.300]  I'm not saying it right. It's I know you're not level quality anything
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:12.180]  But the tools for editing and posting video from your phone way better than podcasting from your phone
[02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:16.300]  Yeah, I think it's funny that we've got these super high def cameras and there's always this big push every year
[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:21.420]  When the new iPhone comes out we talk about the camera, but there's been no major advancements to the microphone technology
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:26.100]  Hmm, that's a good point. Right like nobody would recommend or nobody would recommend
[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:32.460]  Recording a podcast using the built-in mic on an iPhone. Whereas you could record it pretty you can record pretty damn good video with
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:38.220]  Yeah, but the audio notoriously is terrible. Yeah, I found you I go and I spend all this this damn money on a
[02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:45.780]  Canon 5d mark 3 and I find that when I'm recording a podcast using the built-in mic on an iPhone
[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:51.240]  When when I'm on vacation or if I'm traveling I just shoot from my iPhone because those videos are stellar
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:58.260]  Yeah, especially with a little bit of post-processing to the video. You can really get pretty fairly, you know
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:01.100]  Again, the word professional is a little loaded and has other meanings
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:08.720]  Yeah, pretty close to what you know, what better you can get better than what used to be considered professional video pretty quickly, right?
[02:46:08.940 --> 02:46:10.940]  yeah, definitely and
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:12.140]  professionally
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:18.620]  Loaded but okay. So the video I shoot from my phone, I probably wouldn't put into the next James Bond movie
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:20.620]  But it works great on my youtube channel
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:24.740]  Right and the shots look fantastic and I don't mean it looks great in an amateur
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:27.740]  This is something I threw together in a weekend kind of way
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:33.760]  I mean it's like, you know on that size screen and that size and that kind of format that kind of content it works
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:36.860]  Brilliantly. Yeah, this is high def video
[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:44.420]  There's definitely something intimate about video too that is different and I tell you honestly, I I sometimes have trouble watching
[02:46:45.180 --> 02:46:50.900]  Your better elevation videos because I know you I do and in your soul
[02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:55.360]  I it I it's in a way that I have a lot of trouble listening to my own
[02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:58.380]  Voice and show like if it was up to if it was up to me
[02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:01.880]  I couldn't edit this show because I just can't bring myself to listen to it
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.120]  I can listen to parts of it and you know
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:07.920]  I've done it enough for enough years that it doesn't it's not like an instant ick factor
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:09.820]  but it's
[02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:14.820]  It's really hard and I remember seeing like on letterman like I think Johnny Depp is one of these actors who?
[02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:20.600]  Professes that he never watches his own movie. Yeah, and I used to I used to think that was bullshit
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.000]  I used to think come on you're just you're being falsely modest, but I actually think it's true now
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.100]  I think depending on your mindset. You just can't bear to watch yourself. Yeah, you can't enjoy it
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:32.100]  You can't see it the way other people do
[02:47:32.100 --> 02:47:38.100]  and it's like I kind of get that feeling when I watch your better elevation videos because I know you if I didn't know you it
[02:47:38.100 --> 02:47:42.160]  Wouldn't occur to me. You would just be this guy to saying this interesting thing on a video
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:47.580]  But because I know you it's like wait, that's Dave and he's like looking at me because he's looking at the camera
[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:51.040]  Yeah guy mentioned something about being a little weirded out
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:54.360]  Like I was I was staring him directly and like I was making eye contact with him
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.360]  I but I think it's because I know you
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:03.000]  I don't know but like your most recent one you did without you being on camera. It was entirely visuals
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:10.040]  Or not. Well, everything's visual but like right? Yeah, it's it's like it's all sort of almost like like slide wear
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.920]  Yeah, and it was done in the style of and I got to give credit to it was done in the style of CGP Grey's
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:17.920]  Videos. Yeah, and that that as an influence has written all over it
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:20.200]  If you've ever seen anything that CGP Grey's done
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:22.520]  It's it's pretty obviously in his style and it was
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:26.060]  You know partly an homage and it was partly me kind of playing around with it
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:30.280]  and and I'd realized that I had started to get into into habits with like
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:34.000]  the the way I was handling jump cuts and the way I was doing anything on that show like I felt like
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:38.260]  Well, this is still really early and the whole point is to be experimenting. So let's try something new
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:42.920]  Yeah, maybe it's gonna be terrible. Maybe it's gonna be unwatchable, but I'm just gonna try something new and if it works
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:45.980]  It works if it doesn't and that was your episode called how to make a hit app
[02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:51.960]  I found that one super easy to listen to or watch, you know, like it went down like butter
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:58.640]  Whereas all the ones where you're on camera to me not because they're you're bad or awkward or I'm professional but it's because they're dude
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:04.000]  I know you there's something weird about that because I'm looking longingly into your eyes through your computer screen
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:10.200]  I don't know. It's the way like whenever you see somebody, you know on a video doesn't it have like a weird effect on you?
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:14.840]  You know, like I you know, I've seen Letterman thousands of times over the years
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:21.040]  But like if somebody I knew was on Letterman, it's weird like it's weird when I see Clayton Morris on TV
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:22.360]  Yeah
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:27.360]  Right. Yeah, I can see that. Well, maybe like now I'm just sort of thinking out loud
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:31.500]  But those Johnny I've videos that they they show whenever Apple releases a new product
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:38.460]  That same video where he's talking about the aluminium and how the thing is contoured in the whatever
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:42.720]  Imagine the whole time he's talking. He's staring into the camera, right?
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:49.660]  Probably be a little off-putting. So maybe there's maybe there is an element to there's an intimacy to eye contact that that
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:51.660]  is
[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:56.440]  Not necessarily good or bad, but there might be something to that. Yeah, maybe there's some kind of psychology
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:00.420]  But like, you know, the nightly news guys all look right at the camera, you know
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:05.060]  The teleprompter is set up so that it looks like they're looking at the camera. Yeah, and I think it's it's maybe a
[02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:11.420]  Instructional versus informative. I don't know. Maybe there's got to be I'm sure somebody's done studies on this
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:14.140]  Yeah, I don't look this stuff up figure out the hell I'm doing
[02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:18.260]  I don't know John Stewart does the for a whole first half of his show looking right at the camera. Yeah, it's true
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:22.260]  It could be about the distance from the camera to like the length of focal length of the lines
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:27.980]  I don't know, but that's often the weeds where should people go where so you're not married to YouTube in particular though
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:32.340]  You might be switching to Vimeo. It's video not switching. I'm just trying to like YouTube
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.340]  I know is a thing and for for searchability
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:40.340]  YouTube is the second largest search engine and that's that's a real thing and I don't want to miss out on
[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:42.180]  the kids and their YouTube
[02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:49.060]  but I also some people just hate YouTube and they hate Google and that's you know, at least an understandable position and if that's the
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:51.060]  Case now I'm on Vimeo because I get that killer deal
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:56.860]  So both like I'm just trying to I'm trying to make some stuff and see what works and whatever works
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:57.860]  You know when it comes to words
[02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:02.300]  It's like it's interesting to me and it's like you said with the kids in their YouTube like I hear the word
[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:09.140]  youtuber and to me it sounds dismissive like I would be hesitant to say that you're a youtuber now because I don't want to I
[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:13.860]  don't know it sounds to me like I'm insulting you like I'm calling like when people call
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:20.400]  Deuce Heather Armstrong a mommy blogger. It's like she's not a mommy blogger. She's a writer. She's a really good one
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:26.840]  and but it's you know, it somehow everything new I think sounds novel and diminutive like
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:33.280]  I'm sure the word like when they first started abbreviating television is TV it it's you know in the 40s or 50s
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:37.480]  It sounded like dismissive. It's just TV. It's you know, it's crap
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:43.140]  Whereas for me over that word, right who was born in the era where TV is an just almost
[02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:48.140]  Unimaginably dominant dominating cultural force. It just is what it is
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:52.680]  You know, they could have called it anything and it would just seem awesome because TV is awesome
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:58.820]  You know, I used to reject the word blog I really it just is not a good word to me
[02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:02.000]  I stuck with calling them web logs for as long as I could
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:08.520]  But now it's been long enough that it's you know, it no longer feels like anything and I feel like youtuber is that way
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.380]  And I've noticed with Jonas like, you know who watches
[02:52:12.120 --> 02:52:17.560]  obsessive amounts of YouTube he watches far more YouTube than he watches commercial television and
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.080]  Youtuber is just it's as no
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:26.360]  Plus or minus meaning at all. It just means somebody whose shows you can watch on
[02:52:27.680 --> 02:52:29.680]  YouTube, you know, that's it
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:31.680]  There's this really cool
[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:36.480]  Democratization of content effect where this is sort of like this was our dream, right?
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:40.160]  The the Internet's dream was that anybody could make stuff and just put it out there
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:47.560]  Right. I'm playing music with some friends now and we're talking about like well in the 90s if you wanted to
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:51.560]  You know make a video that would be seen by anybody if you want to make a record you had to have a record deal
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:53.560]  And you had to have all this money and it cost a fortune
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:59.240]  Now like we could we could record a song and make the video for it and have like the song on iTunes and the video
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:03.220]  On YouTube by the end of the day. Well, the big thing I remember from the 90s was
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:07.680]  Pressing your own CDs and being you know, giving them out at you know
[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:10.160]  If you're a bit good enough to even be booked at a venue
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:14.720]  Then you can give them out or sell them at the venue where if you were still below that you you know
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:19.160]  Like on college campuses and stuff, you'd you know set up shop somewhere and just hand them out to people
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:20.080]  Yeah
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:25.840]  now we live in this this time where you can just make stuff and put it on the internet and it's there for anybody and
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:32.560]  That's really cool. And it seems like the people the like the most creative and the most talented and the people with the access to the
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:34.560]  best equipment and technology
[02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:36.920]  Should maybe be the ones making
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:40.760]  The best content, but it doesn't necessarily seem to always be that way
[02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:44.440]  yeah, and the last thing that really hit me about that and ties into your your
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:50.760]  podcasting episode the podcast intervention episode is it ties into the
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:57.360]  At first if you're older and you're used to the woods comes the new stuff seems amateur, you know
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:04.900]  Like whether it's blogging for writing or YouTube videos five minute YouTube videos for video and it just seems like well
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:09.080]  This is the lesser. This is the the self, you know, what do they call it when you're publishing a novel?
[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:11.720]  self-published novel
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.200]  This is where the people who can't make it in the real world go and you know
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:21.360]  Pretend like they're doing it and then you open your mind and realize that you know
[02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:27.860]  the good stuff could be coming from anywhere and you realize that the new format is the one that has the most freedom where you
[02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:33.160]  Don't have to do it in 30-minute increments because you're based on this TV model where everything has to be
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:40.880]  30 60 90 minutes long to fit in a schedule and you can do something like say I have a six-minute essay on
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:45.600]  Making hit apps and it can be exactly six minutes long
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:50.000]  It's in which is exactly what I feel like if there's anything I've done
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:53.520]  You know successfully with forum with daring fireball
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:58.680]  It's it's right in a form where if I need if I need a thousand words
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:00.880]  I can use a thousand words if I need three thousand words
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:05.080]  I can use three thousand words and if I can make my point with three words, I use three words
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:08.200]  And you could never do that in the print world
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:13.080]  You couldn't have you know, Paul Krugman's column in the New York Times can't be seven words long
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:18.320]  It has to you know has to be 750 words or 350 or 750. I think is what they have
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:20.320]  yeah, and I look at it your
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:26.240]  Stuff and Marco stuff and Jason Snell stuff and it seems especially the three of you in particular
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:27.960]  it strikes me that
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.980]  you guys have these voices that people listen to and you've got these shows like literally voices that people listen to and and like
[02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:39.160]  There's an authority and a legitimacy to that and it would be cool to see
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:43.520]  That kind of weight put behind. Yeah podcast videos
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:46.920]  yeah, and so I think maybe the the
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:50.840]  Even the word intervention and like maybe it came off a little bit more
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:52.600]  I don't know
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:58.160]  like I was condemning something that I meant for it to but like my whole point my the whole spirit of all of this is
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:01.240]  like I just want to try new stuff and I want other people to try new stuff because I think that
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:04.840]  there's a lot of really smart really talented people with a lot of
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.640]  Pretty advanced technology in their pockets. All right, where's the best place then?
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:13.760]  Where's the one place people can go if they want to see a couple episodes of better elevation?
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:21.040]  youtube.com slash better elevation or vimeo.com slash better elevation or just Google better elevation
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:30.240]  Yeah, I think that I think that works elven gel genitalia turtles screwing slash better elevation slash better elevation
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:34.360]  So, uh, hey, let's talk about computers. Yeah
