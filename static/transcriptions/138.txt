[00:00.000 --> 00:10.460]  A couple weeks ago, a longtime sponsor of the show, Casper, you know, the people who
[00:10.460 --> 00:16.420]  sell mattresses, they had a spot and when I read their URL, I said that their domain
[00:16.420 --> 00:23.400]  name was caspersleep.com, which is what it used to be, and which in fact still does redirect,
[00:23.400 --> 00:26.920]  but their new URL is casper.com.
[00:26.920 --> 00:30.440]  When I did that, they sent like a nice little note and it was very friendly and it was like,
[00:30.440 --> 00:36.360]  hey, you know, that used to be our URL, but we sprung for just playing casper.com and
[00:36.360 --> 00:40.920]  the next time we have a spot run, you know, please use that one instead.
[00:40.920 --> 00:48.600]  And last week they had another spot in the show and like a dummy, I once again said on
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.560]  the air, go to caspersleep.com slash talk show.
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.920]  And they sent me a very nice email.
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.200]  That was so nice that I thought I should, uh, right here at the front of the show, just
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.280]  put a little insert here and just tell you, um, if you're in a market for a mattress and
[01:04.280 --> 01:14.440]  you want to go there, go to casper.com, uh, C A S P E R slash talk show casper.com slash
[01:14.440 --> 01:15.440]  talk show.
[01:15.440 --> 01:27.480]  Um, my thanks to them, uh, for their patience with me and, uh, uh, now on with the show.
[01:27.480 --> 01:28.480]  Joanna, how are you?
[01:28.480 --> 01:29.480]  It's been a while.
[01:29.480 --> 01:35.520]  I think it has been a while, but you hear no sirens and no dog.
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.280]  Unlike my last appearance on this show.
[01:37.280 --> 01:39.080]  Was that the last appearance?
[01:39.080 --> 01:40.080]  I think so.
[01:40.080 --> 01:51.200]  Yes, it was definitely the sirens, very, very angry, angry, angry listeners about the sirens.
[01:51.200 --> 01:55.460]  It has been a very Joanna Stern year in technology.
[01:55.460 --> 01:56.460]  Don't you think?
[01:56.460 --> 01:57.460]  Yeah.
[01:57.460 --> 01:58.460]  Just me all the time.
[01:58.460 --> 02:01.440]  They released me like 10 times.
[02:01.440 --> 02:09.920]  Well stern s I, what I mean by that is that to me, you are one of the most, um, uh, uh,
[02:09.920 --> 02:19.220]  obsessed in our racket with, you know, laptop keyboards and tablets and w you know, where
[02:19.220 --> 02:23.740]  are portable computers going?
[02:23.740 --> 02:27.160]  And it's been, what a crazy year, right?
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.760]  Insane and actually just had a conversation with my editor about my column next week.
[02:31.760 --> 02:35.300]  I think I've actually ditched the entire idea cause it's too hard.
[02:35.300 --> 02:39.240]  I hate to say that I'm ditching something cause it's too hard, but like trying to tell
[02:39.240 --> 02:47.320]  someone what to buy right now, it's just, it's too hard.
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.100]  Maybe that's the angle to take though, is to talk about how you can't really say here's
[02:51.100 --> 02:53.880]  what you should buy because it's too hard.
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.000]  It really is too hard.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  Well, I don't know.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.980]  I should probably not talk about what my idea was is someone listening will just do it better
[02:59.980 --> 03:00.980]  than me.
[03:00.980 --> 03:07.360]  But like my idea was I wanted to make a form or a chart where it's like you just go in,
[03:07.360 --> 03:10.280]  you tell Pete, tell it, this is what I want.
[03:10.280 --> 03:12.060]  This is what I want the computer to do.
[03:12.060 --> 03:13.340]  This is how I use my computer.
[03:13.340 --> 03:15.360]  This is the operating system I want.
[03:15.360 --> 03:18.280]  And then it tells you what to get.
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.680]  But making that it's really, really hard.
[03:21.680 --> 03:23.240]  The matrix has gotten very complicated.
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.400]  So you, you could have been on it and we'd, you know, been trying to work out a time that
[03:27.400 --> 03:32.460]  works for you to be on the show at any point in like the last like two or three months,
[03:32.460 --> 03:39.000]  like to talk about the iPad Pro or to talk about the Surface Book and the Surface Pro
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.640]  4 and all the keyboards and et cetera.
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.120]  But now we can just talk about them all at once.
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.040]  And yeah, and there was an iPhone before that.
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.040]  Right.
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.280]  And then what have I been doing with myself?
[03:49.280 --> 03:55.520]  There's been a lot of reviews, a lot of products, good products, some not so good, but really
[03:55.520 --> 03:56.520]  interesting.
[03:56.520 --> 03:57.520]  I saw...
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.540]  That's how I'm going to summarize this here.
[04:00.540 --> 04:02.880]  I saw a thing and I didn't see the breakdown.
[04:02.880 --> 04:03.880]  Maybe you did.
[04:03.880 --> 04:09.080]  But I saw a thing where, you know, that every year there's that with the Black Friday and
[04:09.080 --> 04:17.000]  the whole opening of the holiday shopping season, that 64% of the online purchases over
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.240]  the weekend were done on a mobile device.
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.240]  Yeah, I saw that too.
[04:22.240 --> 04:24.100]  Which is kind of astounding.
[04:24.100 --> 04:28.520]  The thing I don't know is what are they calling a mobile device?
[04:28.520 --> 04:30.760]  Does that include tablets or is that...
[04:30.760 --> 04:31.760]  Is it...
[04:31.760 --> 04:35.320]  Don't they usually break down by operating system?
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.040]  I guess so.
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.040]  But isn't that...
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.900]  I've been thinking about this for years, but I feel like part of what makes this year,
[04:42.900 --> 04:47.560]  what 2015 is so interesting, is that doing it by operating system really doesn't make
[04:47.560 --> 04:48.560]  sense anymore.
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.560]  True.
[04:49.560 --> 04:50.560]  Very true.
[04:50.560 --> 04:52.100]  I mean, Windows.
[04:52.100 --> 04:56.800]  Like someone could be on their Windows phone and they're actually on...
[04:56.800 --> 05:04.440]  It says Windows 10 and they could be on like a 50-foot desktop that runs Windows 10.
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.440]  Right.
[05:05.440 --> 05:15.640]  And conversely, on the Apple side, the iPad Pro is gonna qualify by OS as a mobile device,
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.000]  but it's...
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.680]  And by some definition, it is certainly mobile where you're certainly using it without any...
[05:22.680 --> 05:25.800]  You're not connected to power or anything like that.
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.200]  You don't have to be.
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.840]  But it's meant to be used on a desk of some sort or at least on your lap.
[05:33.840 --> 05:35.640]  It's not like a handheld device.
[05:35.640 --> 05:36.640]  Right.
[05:36.640 --> 05:37.640]  Right.
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.400]  I've been using mine more and more in bed.
[05:42.400 --> 05:49.520]  We've pretty much watched all of Jane the Virgin on the iPad Pro.
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.040]  It's really, really interesting as a TV.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.040]  Yeah.
[05:54.040 --> 05:59.480]  And the last two trips that I've taken, I took my air, I have this problem where I just
[05:59.480 --> 06:00.480]  have to take the air.
[06:00.480 --> 06:01.480]  It makes me feel better.
[06:01.480 --> 06:05.920]  But I pretty much only used the Pro, which...
[06:05.920 --> 06:08.880]  That's the difference between when you review something for a week and then you really start
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.920]  using it.
[06:11.920 --> 06:17.720]  As a travel device, it's really good.
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.920]  As much as it's kind of crazy that you're just kind of...
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.900]  It is the top of the laptop screen, just taking that off and having the screen without the
[06:24.900 --> 06:29.360]  keyboard to watch Netflix is huge.
[06:29.360 --> 06:33.900]  And the screen is like 90 times better than my air.
[06:33.900 --> 06:35.200]  So all right, let's keep going with it.
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.680]  Let's keep going with talking about the iPad Pro and we'll get to the other devices in
[06:39.680 --> 06:41.920]  due time.
[06:41.920 --> 06:49.360]  I have found, and it's one of the little things that it really makes a huge difference between
[06:49.360 --> 06:50.360]  the...
[06:50.360 --> 06:55.060]  And I know you mentioned this in your iPad Pro review for the journal.
[06:55.060 --> 07:01.480]  If you just look at the numbers, 9.7 inch for the standard iPad size to 12 point whatever
[07:01.480 --> 07:05.840]  inches this one is, it doesn't sound like a lot for some reason in my brain.
[07:05.840 --> 07:08.440]  But in practice, it's a tremendous difference.
[07:08.440 --> 07:10.440]  Yeah, it's giant.
[07:10.440 --> 07:12.760]  And one of the things, and I don't think I...
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.720]  It's like you just said, sometimes it's so hard in one week, the one week you get between
[07:17.720 --> 07:23.440]  when you get a review unit and when the reviews come out, it's hard to cover all the bases.
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.320]  And I've heard this from a lot of people who, readers of Daring Fireball, that it's a huge,
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.720]  huge deal for anybody who deals with actual documents.
[07:32.720 --> 07:37.760]  Like I know lawyers, for example, everything they do is like eight and a half by 11 pieces
[07:37.760 --> 07:38.760]  of paper.
[07:38.760 --> 07:45.440]  And I've also heard from some people in education that for teachers, it's a huge deal.
[07:45.440 --> 07:50.640]  If you have students submitting work in any kind of word processing document where it's
[07:50.640 --> 07:56.500]  a page, now they can read them right there on the iPad and it's not tiny.
[07:56.500 --> 07:58.320]  It's like the size it's supposed to be.
[07:58.320 --> 08:04.600]  And what I've done, I haven't been into comic books in years, but I started reading comic
[08:04.600 --> 08:09.100]  books on it and it's all the difference in the world.
[08:09.100 --> 08:12.760]  One of the reasons I never really got into reading comic books on iPads before is it
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.480]  was just too small.
[08:14.480 --> 08:18.480]  And now I saw it, Andy and Atko even tweeted a picture of it.
[08:18.480 --> 08:21.700]  It's just like side by side with like an actual comic book.
[08:21.700 --> 08:23.120]  It's like the actual size.
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.400]  It's absolutely the standard size for a comic book.
[08:27.400 --> 08:33.440]  And TV, I think, is a similar type thing where it, like, laying in bed or sitting on a chair
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.760]  somewhere and just having it right in front of you, it fills your field of vision in a
[08:38.760 --> 08:41.520]  way that the iPad didn't before.
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.840]  Yeah, and definitely for sharing a viewing experience, it's great.
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.880]  That's where I did feel like the iPad would be small, is like if you're watching a video
[08:51.880 --> 08:57.760]  with somebody, especially on an airplane when you're both trying to watch the iPad and you've
[08:57.760 --> 09:08.560]  got the middle seat bar between you and it's just been great for watching Netflix together.
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.560]  That should be their next ad.
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.720]  It should just be like a shot of two people watching Netflix on the iPad and like really
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.720]  close together.
[09:15.720 --> 09:22.440]  Maybe they're not going to hire me for marketing.
[09:22.440 --> 09:23.440]  Seems like a perfect ad.
[09:23.440 --> 09:24.440]  It does.
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.280]  Didn't they have one like that with the music?
[09:26.280 --> 09:33.240]  I seem to recall that there was an Apple ad that involved some sort of romantic moment
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.640]  where it was, I don't know, like teenagers, but they were sharing their headphones, you
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.640]  know, their earbuds.
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.640]  Yeah.
[09:40.640 --> 09:42.960]  And no, and the tagline is Netflix and chill.
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.000]  Well, I don't think Apple's going to put Netflix and chill in their ad.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.160]  I think that's what Apple's going to do, just put it right across the center of the ad.
[09:51.160 --> 10:00.480]  Although, I guess they sort of have a non-contentious relationship with Netflix, so who knows?
[10:00.480 --> 10:01.480]  Only semi-competitive.
[10:01.480 --> 10:04.280]  This is such a good ad.
[10:04.280 --> 10:08.000]  But maybe it's also a better ad for the smaller iPads, you know, because if that's what you're
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.080]  really after, you know, you're watching a movie, you're trying to get closer, you probably
[10:12.080 --> 10:16.680]  want the smaller iPad so you can get closer together.
[10:16.680 --> 10:23.440]  I've gone too far with this.
[10:23.440 --> 10:27.560]  But you still take your MacBook Air everywhere you go?
[10:27.560 --> 10:28.560]  Yeah.
[10:28.560 --> 10:29.560]  Yeah.
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.520]  I mean, God, my air is really a piece of shit now too.
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.560]  I'm like looking at it and there's crumbs stuck in between the bezel, like right underneath
[10:38.560 --> 10:41.120]  the O in the MacBook.
[10:41.120 --> 10:45.720]  The first O, not the second, there's just like, I think it's a piece of bread.
[10:45.720 --> 10:53.440]  Yeah, it's really, I went to Potbelly for lunch, so it's probably whole wheat bread.
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.960]  Anyway, yes, I take it because I don't know why I take it.
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.880]  I mean, there's certain apps that I there really are not even some certain apps, Photoshop
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.760]  I use during the day.
[11:07.760 --> 11:10.360]  Sometimes I do some video editing and stuff like that.
[11:10.360 --> 11:12.880]  I think it's mostly comes down to the multitasking.
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.240]  I think, you know, a reader asked me today on on Twitter, he was trying to decide between
[11:18.240 --> 11:20.560]  the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air.
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.160]  And I really think it just comes down to two things.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.160]  It's not power.
[11:25.160 --> 11:27.920]  I mean, it's it's certainly not power.
[11:27.920 --> 11:33.040]  It's not screen because the pro kills it on screen and all these other things.
[11:33.040 --> 11:36.120]  I think it comes down to peripherals and multitasking.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.520]  What do you think?
[11:39.520 --> 11:41.520]  Is there something I'm missing?
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.880]  Yeah, no, I, I think that covers it well.
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.040]  And then the other the other the only other thing I could think of that's a big ticket,
[11:51.040 --> 11:57.520]  like this might be the primary reason that you decide would be are there apps that only
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.600]  exist on one or the other, right?
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.880]  You know, and there are some that are many, in fact, that exist on both, you know, there's
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.040]  all sorts of writing apps, for example, that have, you know, clients that, you know, for
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.580]  both, both platforms, so you don't have to decide.
[12:16.580 --> 12:21.840]  There are other things that are either Mac only, or now there's a lot of apps that are
[12:21.840 --> 12:22.840]  iPad only.
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.440]  So if you're, if you feel like you need one of those, other than your decisions made for
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.440]  you.
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.480]  Yeah, I mean, the file system is another really big one.
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.600]  I guess that would be the third big thing, you know, and I kind of consider that under
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.240]  multitasking, which is not part of it, but, you know, I just deal with lots of different
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.240]  files and here, like people send Word documents, unfortunately, and they're marked up and you
[12:44.240 --> 12:47.840]  got to download them and you got to look at them and then you got to reattach them.
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.440]  And, you know, that's still a place where the iPad is just not, you know, in trying
[12:52.440 --> 12:53.760]  to make it simpler.
[12:53.760 --> 12:54.760]  Sometimes it's just really hard.
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.980]  You know, I actually wrote about in the review, or I don't know if the whole thing came in,
[12:58.980 --> 13:06.240]  but like, I was just trying to get a PDF from one app to another and just can't really do
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.240]  it, right?
[13:07.240 --> 13:10.120]  There's no central file to put something in.
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.800]  You can put it in iCloud, iCloud drive, but yeah, I just don't like to go there.
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.140]  Yeah, and not every app supports it depends where you, you know, it's the same with Dropbox
[13:20.140 --> 13:26.280]  where there are definitely some apps that you can, you know, use app A for this and
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.960]  send a thing from app B by putting it in your Dropbox and both apps have Dropbox integration,
[13:31.960 --> 13:34.840]  but you really, you can't count on it across all apps.
[13:34.840 --> 13:40.400]  Right, and you have to like hope that the share system works well in that app to then
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.440]  bring it to the other app.
[13:43.440 --> 13:45.680]  They were Adobe apps that I was using.
[13:45.680 --> 13:51.080]  Whereas, on the Mac, you would be shocked.
[13:51.080 --> 13:56.820]  I would be and in fact, it would instantly make me, any app that I use on a regular basis
[13:56.820 --> 14:02.400]  what I'm about to say would work and if I was trying a new app and this didn't work,
[14:02.400 --> 14:05.920]  it would almost certainly make me think this app is a piece of junk and I'm just going
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.360]  to, I'm not even going to spend any more time in it, which is if I'm in a context where
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.240]  I want to add a JPEG, doesn't matter.
[14:14.240 --> 14:15.640]  Is it an email attachment?
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.720]  I just want to send it to you.
[14:16.720 --> 14:17.800]  I'm using a chat app.
[14:17.800 --> 14:19.440]  I want to send you this picture.
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.520]  I want to add it to a document where I know the document can, you can add images to the
[14:23.520 --> 14:24.520]  document.
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.920]  I would just take it from the finder where I see the doc, you know, the image and drag
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.480]  it over and drop it in and it works everywhere and it's worked like that since, you know,
[14:34.480 --> 14:41.320]  I don't know, 1984 where you just drag stuff where you want it to go and it's crazy.
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.800]  It's still crazy to me and it's one of those things where I feel like I'm speaking a second
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.820]  language when I'm trying to work in iOS, which is that drag and drop isn't really even a
[14:50.820 --> 14:51.820]  thing there.
[14:51.820 --> 14:52.820]  Right.
[14:52.820 --> 14:53.820]  Yeah.
[14:53.820 --> 14:59.260]  No, I mean like on Tuesdays, which is like my big file column video day, my entire desktop
[14:59.260 --> 15:04.320]  is a mess and it's like my worst nightmare when I go to someone's computer and see like
[15:04.320 --> 15:08.980]  just billions of files all over their desktop, but, and then I always clean it up, like always
[15:08.980 --> 15:11.440]  clean it up Tuesday night.
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.360]  But like the reason that is just like, it's the easy, you know, I put something there,
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.360]  then I drag it to Dropbox and I send it to my video editor.
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.800]  I pull down one file, I edit it from, you know, a print editor.
[15:22.800 --> 15:28.280]  I then send it right back, you know, attach it, put it into Gmail, drag it into Gmail.
[15:28.280 --> 15:29.280]  Yeah.
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.480]  I mean, I think it's things like that.
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.380]  Those like sort of like, and I hate to say, cause I think those are the things that like
[15:36.380 --> 15:38.200]  make me old.
[15:38.200 --> 15:42.440]  Like I worry that these are the things that like I'm going to be that old person that's
[15:42.440 --> 15:48.240]  like, well, we, this is why I can't recommend this because it doesn't have a USB port, you
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.840]  know, or something like that where I feel like, you know, I feel old when I say these
[15:52.840 --> 15:57.080]  things, but you get in these routines of how you work.
[15:57.080 --> 16:03.640]  I feel the exact same way where I've, I've, I don't want to be curmudgeonly that way.
[16:03.640 --> 16:09.080]  And I see it from the feedback I get from readers where some of them are, I don't want
[16:09.080 --> 16:15.520]  to say angry, but they seem to be frustrated with the whole, Hey, maybe you can, you know,
[16:15.520 --> 16:20.340]  for some people you might be able to really just work on an iPad pro and they reject it.
[16:20.340 --> 16:23.720]  And they're like, and they say, how could you know, how can you work if you can't do
[16:23.720 --> 16:25.680]  XYZ?
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.520]  And I can, I, what I see them doing is they're projecting, I can't work with XYZ and I actually
[16:31.520 --> 16:32.520]  believe them.
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.800]  I believe them that they, you know, that this is important and there are definitely some
[16:36.800 --> 16:41.120]  tasks where you really want to be able to access, you know, have something like the
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.720]  finder where you can have just an arbitrary list of files of any type and just drag them.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.960]  But there are, you're crazy if you don't think that there's a lot of people who don't need
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.440]  that, whose workflow doesn't involve files and the file system at all.
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.560]  And I think that's where I see like, there are some days where I don't, I don't need
[17:02.560 --> 17:03.560]  that.
[17:03.560 --> 17:09.000]  And you know, that's what a majority of users, or I'm not, I can't say percentages, but many
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.380]  people, like you said, don't need some of these things.
[17:12.380 --> 17:17.000]  And that's where I think, you know, I, and I think I go back a little bit into what I
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.440]  wrote in my pro review.
[17:20.440 --> 17:23.740]  It certainly feels right now it's a niche product.
[17:23.740 --> 17:26.660]  Maybe it isn't.
[17:26.660 --> 17:32.160]  Maybe it really does have more appeal at this point than I think, I didn't even get specific
[17:32.160 --> 17:33.160]  on it.
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.680]  But maybe it has much more appeal than I thought right now, because more and more people ask
[17:37.680 --> 17:38.680]  me about it.
[17:38.680 --> 17:42.640]  And when I'm sort of trying to guide them between getting a laptop and the pro, it ends
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.400]  up saying, yeah, the pro is actually going to be perfectly great for what you need.
[17:47.400 --> 17:50.440]  And oh, you don't have an iPad or you haven't updated your iPad in years.
[17:50.440 --> 17:52.760]  Yeah, go for it.
[17:52.760 --> 17:53.920]  Yeah.
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.960]  So, I don't know, I think I'm just really interested in what Apple is going to be able
[17:59.960 --> 18:07.320]  to do with the software to make it to make it closer to what some people want as a laptop
[18:07.320 --> 18:08.320]  experience.
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.000]  Yeah, I think you and I, I highlighted that that sentence, I don't have it in front of
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.480]  me right now, but in your review, but more or less, and you know, it's not a unique observation,
[18:17.480 --> 18:20.840]  but I thought you said it very well, which is, but something more or less along the lines
[18:20.840 --> 18:31.700]  of comparing it to the Surface, certainly the Surface Pros from Microsoft, the Surface
[18:31.700 --> 18:41.100]  Pros are saddled with the overly complex Windows 10, and the iPad Pro is saddled with what
[18:41.100 --> 18:45.360]  is still clearly a phone operating system.
[18:45.360 --> 18:46.360]  Yeah.
[18:46.360 --> 18:47.360]  Right?
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.880]  So they're approaching, both companies are approaching a, they're trying to get to the
[18:53.880 --> 19:01.960]  same place, but Microsoft is going, is approaching it with a more complex legacy operating system,
[19:01.960 --> 19:08.880]  and Apple's approaching it with an overly simplistic, meant for a little four or five
[19:08.880 --> 19:11.880]  inch, three, four or five inch device operating system.
[19:11.880 --> 19:12.880]  Right.
[19:12.880 --> 19:15.480]  And I think that's like, what's going to be fascinating to watch over the next couple
[19:15.480 --> 19:18.520]  of years is like, how do they both get there?
[19:18.520 --> 19:22.760]  Like one's got to add, one's got to like, you know, it's like, one's got to pick up
[19:22.760 --> 19:29.080]  pieces on the root and the other's got to somehow dump them, hopefully, I don't know
[19:29.080 --> 19:35.740]  what Microsoft's plan is with a lot of the bloat that's in Windows, but yeah.
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.020]  And it's, I totally appreciate that it is an incredibly hard problem for both companies
[19:40.020 --> 19:41.020]  to solve.
[19:41.020 --> 19:44.140]  I mean, a lot of times we, you know, we on the outside can sit here and complain and
[19:44.140 --> 19:48.480]  make it, I, there are some problems that are frustrating because it really does seem like
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.360]  it ought to be easy for a company to fix, and maybe it's not and you don't want to,
[19:52.360 --> 19:57.380]  you know, who knows what the reasons are behind it, but this is one where clearly it's complicated.
[19:57.380 --> 20:02.640]  But like, just one specific issue with the pro, I do use the multitasking on the pro
[20:02.640 --> 20:07.440]  that the two things at the same time multitasking, where you slide it out from the left, I do
[20:07.440 --> 20:14.520]  it all the time, and it's one of those things that quickly became habit for me.
[20:14.520 --> 20:20.680]  So to compare and contrast, I think that it's taken me longer to become a habit is the new,
[20:20.680 --> 20:27.220]  the new way in iOS nine, that you can put two fingers on the keyboard and move the insertion
[20:27.220 --> 20:29.160]  point around when you're editing text.
[20:29.160 --> 20:33.600]  Yeah, I love it, but I keep forgetting to use it.
[20:33.600 --> 20:35.400]  Whereas the multitasking touch.
[20:35.400 --> 20:37.000]  Yeah, same thing.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  The touch.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.440]  I like it and and I'm starting to make it a habit, but it's it.
[20:42.440 --> 20:44.400]  I keep forgetting about it.
[20:44.400 --> 20:45.400]  Yeah.
[20:45.400 --> 20:50.760]  Whereas the multitasking on the iPad Pro is like I took to nature for sure.
[20:50.760 --> 20:52.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:52.720 --> 20:55.960]  But yeah.
[20:55.960 --> 20:59.960]  But for example, you can't put two Safari windows side by side.
[20:59.960 --> 21:00.960]  Right.
[21:00.960 --> 21:01.960]  Yeah.
[21:01.960 --> 21:02.960]  I mentioned that in my review.
[21:02.960 --> 21:07.080]  Oh, I've got to stand up, hold on, my Apple Watch just told me.
[21:07.080 --> 21:09.080]  Do you hear it?
[21:09.080 --> 21:10.080]  Yes.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.960]  Should I mute for today?
[21:11.960 --> 21:12.960]  I don't know.
[21:12.960 --> 21:15.160]  You know, like you feel guilty hitting that mute for today.
[21:15.160 --> 21:16.160]  Yeah, I do too.
[21:16.160 --> 21:18.200]  Did you hit the mute for today?
[21:18.200 --> 21:27.720]  No, what I do is I've had sound off on my my Apple Watch for months now, I forget.
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.060]  It's just been there's too many times where I want it to be mute.
[21:31.060 --> 21:32.060]  And so I've just left it muted.
[21:32.060 --> 21:33.060]  Okay.
[21:33.060 --> 21:34.060]  I'm not hitting mute for today.
[21:34.060 --> 21:35.060]  Yeah.
[21:35.060 --> 21:36.060]  I feel really bad.
[21:36.060 --> 21:38.240]  Because no one is going to remind me in like 30 minutes again, and then we can have this
[21:38.240 --> 21:40.160]  conversation over again.
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.880]  I feel bad muting for the day when it's this early.
[21:42.880 --> 21:46.520]  If it still isn't even dark out, I feel like it's too soon.
[21:46.520 --> 21:48.180]  I was like, the day's almost over.
[21:48.180 --> 21:49.180]  It's three o'clock.
[21:49.180 --> 21:55.760]  I mean, I stay up till like 1am, so it's not really almost over, but like, I feel like
[21:55.760 --> 21:58.520]  I can leave the office soon.
[21:58.520 --> 22:00.400]  I think you can always leave an office.
[22:00.400 --> 22:03.920]  Well, this is why I don't have no one's watching me.
[22:03.920 --> 22:07.520]  I mean, no one no one knows where I am.
[22:07.520 --> 22:09.560]  This is why I was never a good employee.
[22:09.560 --> 22:12.760]  But I've always felt like as soon as it's dark outside, you can leave.
[22:12.760 --> 22:13.760]  So come.
[22:13.760 --> 22:14.760]  Yeah.
[22:14.760 --> 22:15.760]  It's dark outside in New York.
[22:15.760 --> 22:18.280]  Yeah, it's perfect.
[22:18.280 --> 22:23.840]  It makes me a substandard employee, I think but yeah, I mean, really, nobody's watching
[22:23.840 --> 22:24.840]  my moves.
[22:24.840 --> 22:25.840]  Or at least that's what I think.
[22:25.840 --> 22:28.680]  Rupert, are you listening to this?
[22:28.680 --> 22:38.000]  That'd be awesome if he was on a Mac or Windows, you it would be crazy to think you couldn't
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.760]  have two browser tabs, Windows, whatever you want to call them side by side.
[22:43.760 --> 22:46.860]  It would be it'd be crazy.
[22:46.860 --> 22:49.080]  And that's where we are, though, on iOS.
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.960]  And I don't know what the solution is.
[22:52.960 --> 22:58.040]  I think it seems to me like with this, the way that the rules of iOS multitasking where
[22:58.040 --> 22:59.480]  you slide it over.
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.600]  And if you want to switch which app is in that right hand pane, why can't Safari be
[23:03.600 --> 23:05.320]  listed in there too?
[23:05.320 --> 23:09.520]  Yeah, and actually, like, I wouldn't mind that on the iPhone, too.
[23:09.520 --> 23:15.300]  Like, I wouldn't mind being able to separate out tabs as a new window.
[23:15.300 --> 23:19.280]  So like, I find it annoying sometimes, like, sometimes I'll go back and forth between two
[23:19.280 --> 23:20.280]  websites.
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.240]  And so you know, you've got to hit the tab button in the right corner.
[23:24.240 --> 23:25.240]  Yeah.
[23:25.240 --> 23:30.880]  What if I could just double tap to see two Safari windows side by, you know, in the multitasking
[23:30.880 --> 23:36.120]  trays, carousel thing?
[23:36.120 --> 23:41.680]  It's you know, I want that sometimes and the same thing with any with like a like a document
[23:41.680 --> 23:47.360]  editing thing where if you've got whatever app you use for text editing, let's just say
[23:47.360 --> 23:49.980]  though, you're using the built in notes app.
[23:49.980 --> 23:53.240]  Why wouldn't you want to be able to have two of those side by side so you could have one
[23:53.240 --> 23:56.920]  that was your notes for an article and the other is the article you're writing?
[23:56.920 --> 23:57.920]  Absolutely.
[23:57.920 --> 24:01.200]  I mean, I this is a secret about me.
[24:01.200 --> 24:04.800]  I my most used app on my Mac is text edit.
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.160]  I have right now for a lot of people that's is it that's Yeah, I think so.
[24:09.160 --> 24:14.320]  I feel like inferior like, you know, it's just like so simple and great.
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.640]  Right now I have 20 text edit windows open.
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.320]  I have untitled 21 up right now.
[24:21.320 --> 24:25.960]  I just like open them and you know, jot down notes and then I just close them.
[24:25.960 --> 24:31.560]  Like I and yes, it's because I have like three of the little ones on my screen right now
[24:31.560 --> 24:34.120]  for like three different things I'm working on.
[24:34.120 --> 24:38.200]  I would love I would love to be able to put two of them side by side on the on the on
[24:38.200 --> 24:39.200]  the pro.
[24:39.200 --> 24:40.200]  Yeah.
[24:40.200 --> 24:42.240]  I mean, I would love text edit on on iOS.
[24:42.240 --> 24:45.240]  Yeah, there were rumors last year that they were working on that.
[24:45.240 --> 24:48.840]  I mean, really, what have they been doing?
[24:48.840 --> 24:55.160]  I mean, no offense, text edit team, but there's not been many updates to your app since like,
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.160]  ever.
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.640]  And maybe they should get on it.
[24:58.640 --> 25:01.600]  I'm just just an advice for the text edit team.
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.600]  Love what you're doing.
[25:02.600 --> 25:03.600]  Love your work.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  Love your app.
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.840]  It's my most used app on my Mac, but maybe start working on the iOS version.
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.800]  It's funny that there was a rumor last year that there was going to be a text edit for
[25:15.800 --> 25:17.720]  iOS and preview too.
[25:17.720 --> 25:20.560]  Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.560]  Yeah.
[25:21.560 --> 25:24.960]  And that seemingly preview is another one of my favorites.
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.680]  Yeah, I mean, preview like and this is this is where when I sometimes really try and make
[25:30.680 --> 25:35.680]  the switch back to Windows, these are some of the apps that are so core to the operating
[25:35.680 --> 25:39.720]  system that that Microsoft just doesn't have.
[25:39.720 --> 25:40.720]  Preview is a great example.
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.920]  Microsoft just doesn't have something like preview on Windows 10.
[25:44.920 --> 25:50.640]  Like the basic thing where you can look at photos, yes, but some of those basic editing
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.400]  tools, and the ease of using them, not there.
[25:54.400 --> 25:55.400]  Yeah.
[25:55.400 --> 25:56.400]  Right.
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.080]  Just if you want to make a quick crop, or Yeah, quick crop, resize the photo, even touch
[26:01.080 --> 26:02.080]  up stuff.
[26:02.080 --> 26:05.080]  I mean, it's a great pre again, the preview team really.
[26:05.080 --> 26:11.280]  I mean, it's probably my second use most used app on my Mac.
[26:11.280 --> 26:12.280]  Here's an example there.
[26:12.280 --> 26:21.120]  I got a a complimentary review copy of a new book from the people at a list apart last
[26:21.120 --> 26:22.120]  week.
[26:22.120 --> 26:23.120]  Thank you to them for sending it to me.
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.120]  It was very kind.
[26:24.120 --> 26:25.560]  They sent it to me by email.
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.660]  And I opened it up and I started reading.
[26:30.660 --> 26:32.980]  And it was actually a book on responsive web design.
[26:32.980 --> 26:37.620]  So it's obviously something I need to read since my website still isn't responsive, started
[26:37.620 --> 26:39.040]  reading it.
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.720]  Because I don't know, hours later, next day, I wanted to I was like, Oh, I want to keep
[26:42.720 --> 26:43.720]  reading that book.
[26:43.720 --> 26:45.560]  And I was on the iPad Pro.
[26:45.560 --> 26:48.000]  And I'm like, Where the hell is that?
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.900]  And I like blanked out for a couple of seconds, like, why can't I find it here?
[26:53.900 --> 26:57.640]  And then I realized, oh, there's no preview here.
[26:57.640 --> 26:58.640]  Right.
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.440]  And you know, there is a way to do that.
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.520]  You can use iBooks, you can, you know, open the PDF in iBooks, and it'll sync across and
[27:06.520 --> 27:08.560]  you can read on the Mac and read here.
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.080]  But I use preview, not iBooks to read PDFs.
[27:11.080 --> 27:14.680]  Because it's, you know, when you double click it, that's what it opens in on your Mac.
[27:14.680 --> 27:15.680]  Right.
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.460]  I mean, I guess on iOS, they just figure photos is the answer.
[27:20.460 --> 27:26.960]  But photos doesn't have support for PDF and some of those kind of features that you have
[27:26.960 --> 27:28.240]  in preview.
[27:28.240 --> 27:34.760]  I think what it is more is that they even with iCloud, and even with the new iCloud
[27:34.760 --> 27:41.720]  drive, which does work pretty well, I think, I mean, in my experience, it's, it syncs pretty,
[27:41.720 --> 27:45.800]  pretty reliably and pretty quickly.
[27:45.800 --> 27:54.280]  But I feel like they, they're averse to adding document oriented apps to iOS.
[27:54.280 --> 28:00.760]  Right, as opposed to let's say notes where the new notes app is updated on Mac OS X El
[28:00.760 --> 28:03.660]  Capitan, and it's updated on iOS.
[28:03.660 --> 28:08.640]  But you don't have files, you know, now, technically, there are files hidden somewhere in your,
[28:08.640 --> 28:10.600]  you know, library folder somewhere.
[28:10.600 --> 28:12.760]  But there's no files that are actually exposed to you.
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.320]  Whereas preview is still about opening PDF dot PDF files and text.
[28:17.320 --> 28:18.320]  That's right.
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.560]  And that comes back to our file system conversation.
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.920]  Right, but they have it, they have it with iCloud now, and they have the iCloud Drive
[28:24.920 --> 28:25.920]  app.
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.820]  But it's almost like they don't want to even, even with the fact that it's that it is now
[28:29.820 --> 28:36.200]  technically possible to do, you know, in iOS, in a pretty easy, you know, way.
[28:36.200 --> 28:43.560]  I feel like they're just averse to it on, like, philosophical grounds, almost.
[28:43.560 --> 28:50.800]  Yeah, I mean, the problem with Yeah, I guess if you're using drive, and you really are
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.560]  invested in that, maybe you don't have a lot of these problems, or you do have the problem
[28:54.560 --> 28:56.640]  if if some of the apps don't use it.
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.440]  Hmm, I don't know, I can't say I can't say I'm gonna go to iCloud Drive, I just can't
[29:02.440 --> 29:03.440]  commit to that.
[29:03.440 --> 29:05.840]  What do you use it at all?
[29:05.840 --> 29:06.840]  Not really.
[29:06.840 --> 29:07.840]  I use it for photos.
[29:07.840 --> 29:08.840]  Is that?
[29:08.840 --> 29:09.840]  Yeah.
[29:09.840 --> 29:10.840]  It's different.
[29:10.840 --> 29:11.840]  Yeah, that's different.
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.600]  Because yeah, that's, that's just iCloud photo syncing, where it's not really in the file
[29:16.600 --> 29:17.600]  system.
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.480]  I live in a Google world.
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.940]  So then what do you know, I don't, I don't, I don't, I try to use as little Google stuff
[29:24.940 --> 29:28.140]  as possible.
[29:28.140 --> 29:32.360]  So with Google, where do you like, so you use Google Drive to sync documents from one
[29:32.360 --> 29:33.640]  thing to another?
[29:33.640 --> 29:34.640]  Yeah.
[29:34.640 --> 29:35.640]  How does that work in the Finder?
[29:35.640 --> 29:36.640]  I don't even know.
[29:36.640 --> 29:39.640]  Like, how does that work on a Mac?
[29:39.640 --> 29:45.000]  It Well, you you can sync all your Google Drive stuff to your Mac, I actually don't
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.440]  do that.
[29:46.440 --> 29:52.300]  I actually just go through the Chrome browser, because I don't want all those files there.
[29:52.300 --> 29:56.120]  And I think that that's more likely the most natural way to do it.
[29:56.120 --> 30:03.760]  And yeah, I mean, mostly everything for me is right in, is in, yeah, is in Chrome.
[30:03.760 --> 30:09.520]  Yeah, for me, I've, I do use iCloud Drive, but it only works with certain apps.
[30:09.520 --> 30:14.080]  I mean, my primary way of like, hey, I, if I have a file that I want to be available
[30:14.080 --> 30:19.320]  everywhere, I put it in my Dropbox folder, Dropbox is the more important, way more important
[30:19.320 --> 30:21.320]  to me, method.
[30:21.320 --> 30:28.380]  Yeah, I mean, I guess I just I really use drive for my documents.
[30:28.380 --> 30:33.760]  For like, my, yeah, my documents, I'm like, actively editing and filing.
[30:33.760 --> 30:38.400]  That's how I actually do file to my editors through Docs, Google Docs.
[30:38.400 --> 30:39.400]  Yeah.
[30:39.400 --> 30:40.400]  Now, for me, it's Dropbox.
[30:40.400 --> 30:44.760]  So like anything, like if I'm working on an article for during Fireball, it's a bb edit
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.760]  text file in, but it's saved, saved to a folder in Dropbox.
[30:49.760 --> 30:54.560]  Hmm, that's a, that's a good workaround.
[30:54.560 --> 31:01.640]  Yeah, I usually write a lot in text edit and then copy into, I have weird things, actually,
[31:01.640 --> 31:03.640]  I write most of my columns in Word.
[31:03.640 --> 31:05.960]  I'm just going to say it right there.
[31:05.960 --> 31:11.880]  Still, I just feel comfortable on a Sunday when I write, even when I write my scripts,
[31:11.880 --> 31:14.240]  I just feel really comfortable in Word.
[31:14.240 --> 31:19.120]  It's just like my my place, you know, so I just go into Word 2001.
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.120]  Yep.
[31:20.120 --> 31:21.120]  So 2011.
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.120]  I'm sorry.
[31:22.120 --> 31:23.120]  2011.
[31:23.120 --> 31:24.120]  And that's where I am.
[31:24.120 --> 31:30.240]  Um, yeah, that's, that's a weird thing, I guess I should probably upgrade this too.
[31:30.240 --> 31:36.320]  Well, not that bb edit isn't relevant, but the fact that I use a programming text editor
[31:36.320 --> 31:41.800]  as my writing thing is, you know, it's not really because I need to, it's, it's just,
[31:41.800 --> 31:43.200]  that's where I've always done my writing.
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.600]  And so it's, it's, you know, it is a comfort thing.
[31:45.600 --> 31:50.760]  I think you want to be as, you know, writers famously, you know, whether they're picky
[31:50.760 --> 31:55.840]  about which brand pencil they use, if they write in longhand, or, you know, certain brand
[31:55.840 --> 32:01.580]  of typewriter, or even like certain certain types of paper for to put in the typewriter.
[32:01.580 --> 32:03.520]  Writers have always been fussy about stuff like that.
[32:03.520 --> 32:08.280]  And I think it's because we have so many problems.
[32:08.280 --> 32:11.840]  Just problems in general, we just tend to know, like, sometimes I'll have like, you
[32:11.840 --> 32:15.580]  know, I just like don't know how I want to write something in our like, it's one of those
[32:15.580 --> 32:20.280]  pieces, you know, the iPad was a good example, the pro there were so many different ways
[32:20.280 --> 32:24.880]  could have gone about it, and I wanted to go about it, but I also had to write for a
[32:24.880 --> 32:27.160]  very mainstream audience on it.
[32:27.160 --> 32:31.920]  And so like, I just had such a hard time figuring out where to start that piece.
[32:31.920 --> 32:38.040]  And I probably opened like, every text editing program I had on my computer and just like,
[32:38.040 --> 32:42.520]  maybe if I write it in here, something will come, you know, like you just every procrastination
[32:42.520 --> 32:48.000]  technique, and it usually involves opening like every text editor I have on my computer.
[32:48.000 --> 32:54.600]  I'm like that sometimes too, especially with with the iPad Pro, where I wanted to write
[32:54.600 --> 32:56.120]  my review on the iPad Pro.
[32:56.120 --> 32:57.360]  So I didn't have bb edit.
[32:57.360 --> 33:02.280]  So it wasn't like a, you know, so I just started writing in three or four different apps.
[33:02.280 --> 33:06.040]  And then I got very confused about, well, where's the part that I wrote about the pencil?
[33:06.040 --> 33:07.480]  Oh, it's in the other app.
[33:07.480 --> 33:09.640]  Yeah, no, I did the same kind of thing.
[33:09.640 --> 33:14.040]  Because I was actually the day I started, like sitting down to write, it was running
[33:14.040 --> 33:15.040]  the battery test.
[33:15.040 --> 33:21.240]  So I was writing on my Mac, but then I actually ended up writing a lot of it in pages, because
[33:21.240 --> 33:24.640]  it was, you know, I used I guess I used iCloud Drive for that.
[33:24.640 --> 33:26.960]  Yeah, you must have.
[33:26.960 --> 33:28.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:28.280 --> 33:30.000]  You didn't even know it, though.
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  Didn't even know it.
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.000]  All right.
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.440]  Let me take a break here and thank my first sponsor and it's our good friends at Squarespace.
[33:37.440 --> 33:39.080]  You guys know Squarespace.
[33:39.080 --> 33:45.680]  It's the all in one way to build design and host your website.

[33:50.960 --> 33:55.040]  you can create a blog, you could use it to host a podcast.
[33:55.040 --> 33:59.380]  They even have like, for podcasting, they even you know, they even have their own custom
[33:59.380 --> 34:05.440]  audio player, they even support built in things like building a an RSS feed with all the weird
[34:05.440 --> 34:07.980]  iTunes stuff you need for a podcast.
[34:07.980 --> 34:11.240]  Anything you anything you need for your own personal website, or a company website, or
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.120]  any sort of website, or even a website for your dog.
[34:14.120 --> 34:19.120]  Yeah, a website for your dog, you could use, go to, you know, I'm not about this, you know
[34:19.120 --> 34:21.720]  how I like to talk about your sponsors.
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.320]  I actually did this also on the verge cast a couple weeks ago.
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.360]  I wrote about how to build your own website a couple of months ago, and I fell in love
[34:30.360 --> 34:31.420]  with Squarespace.
[34:31.420 --> 34:38.000]  And I actually made my whole concept was, I'm going to make a website for my dog.
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.600]  And so when you go to browser in your browser.com now, that was made with Squarespace.
[34:43.600 --> 34:44.600]  What's the website?
[34:44.600 --> 34:45.600]  What's the address?
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.520]  browser in your browser.com browser in your browser.com.
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.520]  And there's an example of a website built with Squarespace.
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.440]  It I just want to also say Squarespace does not pay me, I do not make the rounds on podcasts
[34:58.440 --> 35:04.280]  to talk about Squarespace.
[35:04.280 --> 35:05.280]  There it is.
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.040]  There it is browser in your browser.com.
[35:09.040 --> 35:11.160]  Tell me this is a really nice website.
[35:11.160 --> 35:12.160]  Okay.
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.160]  It really is.
[35:13.160 --> 35:14.560]  It really is.
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.300]  I even I it's even typeset and one of my all time favorite fonts.
[35:20.300 --> 35:23.120]  It's a beautiful, gorgeous Futura Bold.
[35:23.120 --> 35:24.120]  It's gorgeous.
[35:24.120 --> 35:25.120]  Thank you.
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.120]  Thank you.
[35:26.120 --> 35:27.120]  It really is.
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.360]  I Joanna Stern isn't even paid for this.

[36:17.920 --> 36:22.480]  I really have a browser in your browser.com.
[36:22.480 --> 36:23.480]  I can't wait.
[36:23.480 --> 36:24.480]  I'm paying.
[36:24.480 --> 36:25.960]  I'm paying the $9 a month.
[36:25.960 --> 36:32.160]  Like you just said for the custom domain and for the hosting and I need to update the site.
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.160]  I need to.
[36:33.160 --> 36:38.500]  Tonight I'm updating the site because people are going to go and it is nicely.
[36:38.500 --> 36:40.640]  It is actually very nicely responsive to here.
[36:40.640 --> 36:44.720]  I am dragging the window around and as soon as really well on mobile and you can.
[36:44.720 --> 36:45.720]  That's one of the nice things.
[36:45.720 --> 36:46.720]  You can see the view.
[36:46.720 --> 36:48.880]  You can see the mobile view.
[36:48.880 --> 36:49.960]  I did a whole column on it.
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.400]  I like I mean it was really fun, fun piece.
[36:55.400 --> 36:59.680]  They sponsor so many podcasts and I know that people I don't know if people if people tune
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.040]  it out or what but it is a remarkable service.
[37:04.040 --> 37:05.640]  It really is and there's nothing else like it.
[37:05.640 --> 37:06.640]  I can't think of anything.
[37:06.640 --> 37:07.880]  I know there's other ways to host websites.
[37:07.880 --> 37:08.880]  There's a gazillion ways to host websites.
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.940]  I can't think of a lot of other ways you should read my article but in the end all you need
[37:14.940 --> 37:19.800]  to know is that Squarespace was the top pick that one browser in your browser.com.
[37:19.800 --> 37:20.800]  There we go.
[37:20.800 --> 37:22.080]  But I reviewed like three or four of them.
[37:22.080 --> 37:24.240]  I really went through the things.
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.920]  It was a really popular article because a lot of our readers have small businesses and
[37:28.920 --> 37:29.920]  were interested in.
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.600]  I got tons of interesting emails of people who wanted to launch websites just for small
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.760]  things they wanted to do and they couldn't believe how easy it was.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.280]  I need to go work for Squarespace.
[37:39.280 --> 37:40.280]  What am I saying?
[37:40.280 --> 37:42.280]  I need to go.
[37:42.280 --> 37:52.640]  I basically sell Squarespace subscriptions or whatever people sell there.
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.520]  Next device on the list.
[37:56.520 --> 38:05.360]  I would love to pick your mind about the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.
[38:05.360 --> 38:12.040]  I actually just got the mailroom just dropped off the latest Surface Book which they tell
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.040]  me Microsoft descent says this is the shipping unit.
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.120]  I should have no problems but that's where I should back up and talk about some of the
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.840]  problems I have but I have to take it out of the box.
[38:24.840 --> 38:30.000]  What an interesting series of announcements from Microsoft.
[38:30.000 --> 38:38.080]  The book, my review was very, I'll actually just be honest and tell you the story about
[38:38.080 --> 38:40.600]  what happened with the review.
[38:40.600 --> 38:43.000]  I loved using the Surface Book.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.880]  I think it's an incredible piece of hardware that Microsoft made.
[38:47.880 --> 38:52.740]  Everything from the screen to how the keyboard works and the trackpad actually finally working
[38:52.740 --> 38:55.200]  very, very well.
[38:55.200 --> 39:01.860]  After years of reviewing, really just terrible.
[39:01.860 --> 39:08.620]  I have probably a lot of emotional and psychological issues because of how many terrible Windows
[39:08.620 --> 39:12.240]  laptops I've reviewed.
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.880]  It was just such a nice change.
[39:17.880 --> 39:22.760]  It was a really big step I think in the history of Windows laptops.
[39:22.760 --> 39:30.160]  So wrote this really good review and then the first unit I had had some issues.
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.160]  Actually the first Surface Pro 4 I had had some issues and so it wouldn't restart.
[39:35.160 --> 39:41.800]  And then the Surface Book, the first one I had had a driver issue and so it kind of kept
[39:41.800 --> 39:42.960]  crashing.
[39:42.960 --> 39:51.240]  And then they sent me another one and about, I don't know, 24 hours before filing or that
[39:51.240 --> 39:53.800]  review going up, the thing just completely crashed.
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.740]  The hard drive just completely crashed, couldn't restart Windows and there was a couple of
[39:58.740 --> 40:02.080]  other bugs that they said were going to be sorted through.
[40:02.080 --> 40:05.160]  And then other reviewers had the same problem.
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.080]  So I ended up basically saying I couldn't recommend the Surface Book and so now I'm
[40:09.080 --> 40:15.480]  at a point where I'm retesting it to see if they did solve this hard drive problem.
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.640]  It sounds like, from what I can tell, and I did not get one to review because I'm not
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.960]  really in that racket, but I've seen it.
[40:26.960 --> 40:34.800]  And I was at a Microsoft event here in Philadelphia where Ben Rudolph, who's the lead evangelist
[40:34.800 --> 40:39.120]  for these things, they hosted a thing and he was kind enough to invite me and I got
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.040]  to spend some time using it there.
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.000]  But it's very different than spending a week with it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.400]  But it sounds to me, from reading everything, that what Microsoft did is they seeded the
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.240]  review units before they had the, whatever you want to call it, golden master, this is
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.080]  what's going to go out to consumers and there were some pretty serious bugs because it wasn't
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.800]  just you, it was pretty much everybody kind of ran into the same issues.
[41:02.800 --> 41:09.560]  Yeah, I mean, there were bugs and then there were hardware problems and the bugs definitely
[41:09.560 --> 41:11.480]  did make it into shipping units.
[41:11.480 --> 41:17.520]  I got many emails and tweets from readers who said I had the same problems, I just went
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.040]  back to the Microsoft store, I returned it.
[41:21.040 --> 41:27.320]  There was some clear quality control issues, just clear issues that made it through to
[41:27.320 --> 41:28.720]  shipping units.
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.960]  I didn't hear about the hard drive failures, yes, and Microsoft did say that they had sent
[41:35.960 --> 41:41.660]  review units with different hard drives and they had caught these issues at the factory.
[41:41.660 --> 41:48.760]  So I had had the problem first on the Surface Pro 4 and then again the Surface Book as well.
[41:48.760 --> 41:56.320]  So yeah, I'm hoping this time around everything goes well and I can actually really recommend
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.800]  this as the best Windows laptop ever made.
[42:01.800 --> 42:04.280]  Does it have an actual hard drive in it?
[42:04.280 --> 42:05.760]  It's not an SSD?
[42:05.760 --> 42:07.800]  They're SSDs, yeah.
[42:07.800 --> 42:08.960]  But they had problems.
[42:08.960 --> 42:12.200]  They had problems, yeah, I'm sorry, I keep using the word hard drive, but yeah, they're
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.600]  SSDs with some sort of issue.
[42:16.600 --> 42:21.840]  And as far as I understand, they actually changed out the manufacturer of it.
[42:21.840 --> 42:24.220]  Hmm, interesting.
[42:24.220 --> 42:30.760]  So let's give them the benefit of the doubt for now and talk about it as what it's supposed
[42:30.760 --> 42:31.760]  to be.
[42:31.760 --> 42:38.800]  But let's assume that they're going to iron out the bugs and the manufacturing issues
[42:38.800 --> 42:46.720]  and talk about it just for what it should be.
[42:46.720 --> 42:55.400]  Yeah, I took this funny, I think one of the things that's been interesting about Microsoft
[42:55.400 --> 43:03.920]  over the last year is when they looked at the tablet market, they had to say, well,
[43:03.920 --> 43:04.940]  what's our strength?
[43:04.940 --> 43:07.840]  Our strength is not what the iPad is.
[43:07.840 --> 43:14.240]  We haven't created a really touch friendly platform that works or we have, but they tried
[43:14.240 --> 43:17.600]  to create a touch friendly platform and it failed.
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.000]  Windows 8 was by and large obviously a huge failure.
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.400]  And we haven't got the apps to make this that really great, immersive, compelling experience
[43:27.400 --> 43:29.400]  that the iPad has.
[43:29.400 --> 43:31.840]  But what we do find is people want to do more work on these things.
[43:31.840 --> 43:37.600]  So we want to make tablets more productive, which really was like, okay, we're going to
[43:37.600 --> 43:39.040]  make tablets that can replace our laptop.
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.160]  And it was like, okay, so why don't you just make a laptop?
[43:42.160 --> 43:44.840]  Like the tablet really couldn't replace your laptop.
[43:44.840 --> 43:48.680]  I mean, it could, but it wasn't as good as a laptop and it certainly wasn't as good as
[43:48.680 --> 43:52.920]  the laptops they had kept putting it up against, which was the Air.
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.360]  So they kept kind of convincing us, like, we're really good at productivity and so you
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.480]  should want to buy our device that can actually be a good laptop.
[44:01.480 --> 44:03.800]  And it was like, just make a laptop.
[44:03.800 --> 44:07.040]  And so now they made a laptop, but it's actually still a tablet.
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.800]  And so it kind of just like, you know, and that's trying to wrap my head around the whole
[44:10.800 --> 44:15.040]  industry right now, which is, you know, tablets that want to be laptops, laptops that want
[44:15.040 --> 44:16.760]  to be tablets.
[44:16.760 --> 44:21.560]  In the case of Microsoft, they've got a phone that wants to be a desktop, you know, what
[44:21.560 --> 44:28.220]  are all of this kind of hybridization of things and what do we actually want to use?
[44:28.220 --> 44:32.360]  And I think with the Surface Book, it's actually coming to a point where it's like, okay, this
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.280]  could, this kind of feels like the future.
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.080]  It doesn't, it isn't the best right now.
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.080]  It's not a great tablet.
[44:39.080 --> 44:42.640]  It's actually a pretty terrible tablet when you think about that.
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.380]  The battery life is really bad when you take it off the dock.
[44:46.380 --> 44:51.840]  But the idea that, you know, tablets can just be the tops of our laptops and that keyboards
[44:51.840 --> 44:56.600]  are just being added back to these things to make them laptops, well, that makes kind
[44:56.600 --> 44:57.600]  of sense.
[44:57.600 --> 44:58.600]  That makes sense, you know.
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.080]  And so I kind of looked at it from that perspective.
[45:01.080 --> 45:04.800]  And then I just really tried to look at it as like, this is just a Windows laptop.
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.580]  And it's like, got the build of an Apple laptop.
[45:08.580 --> 45:13.560]  It's got a touchpad that actually works that I don't want to hook up a huge mouse to it.
[45:13.560 --> 45:15.280]  It's got a beautiful screen.
[45:15.280 --> 45:22.280]  And so on hardware, Microsoft's finally giving us something that heightens and makes Windows
[45:22.280 --> 45:23.280]  worth it.
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.760]  I just threw out a lot of thoughts, but no, but that's it.
[45:27.760 --> 45:34.120]  So when when I was at the iPad Pro event in September, and in the hands on area, I was
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.860]  hanging out with my friend Michael Johnson, aka Dr. Wave on Twitter, who who's a developer
[45:39.860 --> 45:46.620]  at Pixar, and writes, you know, internal tools for Pixar and has written a lot of software
[45:46.620 --> 45:50.440]  to use the Wacom tablets and all sorts, you know, for their artists.
[45:50.440 --> 45:55.380]  I mean, I hung around with him because he knows what the hell he's talking about in
[45:55.380 --> 45:59.380]  terms of evaluating, you know, a stylus on a thing.
[45:59.380 --> 46:04.880]  And one of the things he did when he first got to try the Apple pencil on the iPad Pro
[46:04.880 --> 46:09.500]  is all he did was just in the like the the Apple Notes app, he just put the pencil down
[46:09.500 --> 46:14.840]  and just started scribbling circles, just spirally circles and just watching the latency.
[46:14.840 --> 46:17.560]  That's all he did just to see and he was very impressed.
[46:17.560 --> 46:20.980]  And you know, all he wanted to test at first was the palm rejection.
[46:20.980 --> 46:25.900]  And if he drew squiggles really, really fast, did it keep up?
[46:25.900 --> 46:31.940]  That's exactly what I did when I got to try the surface book with the trackpad is I just
[46:31.940 --> 46:36.620]  wanted to see just put my finger on the trackpad and look at the mouse cursor and I just moved
[46:36.620 --> 46:42.300]  it around, you know, in a circle really fast to see is this does this work like a MacBook
[46:42.300 --> 46:44.560]  trackpad where it's great?
[46:44.560 --> 46:49.140]  Or is it like every other PC I've ever put my hands on in recent years where it's, you
[46:49.140 --> 46:54.580]  know, oh, man, I can, I can see why people still miss the ThinkPad nubbin.
[46:54.580 --> 46:57.260]  Yeah, because the trackpad stinks.
[46:57.260 --> 46:58.260]  And it was great.
[46:58.260 --> 47:00.260]  I mean, the the Surface Pro trackpad.
[47:00.260 --> 47:02.180]  I mean, again, I did I spend a week with it?
[47:02.180 --> 47:03.180]  No.
[47:03.180 --> 47:05.380]  But in terms of just that quick test, it was great.
[47:05.380 --> 47:13.100]  I mean, I'm I'm the reviewer who has said for the last five years, it is probably Apple's
[47:13.100 --> 47:18.860]  most favorite thing that I have said that Apple makes the best Windows computer.
[47:18.860 --> 47:21.140]  And I said it when I was working at Engadget.
[47:21.140 --> 47:24.740]  I said I when I was working at the Verge, and I've said it when I've been working here
[47:24.740 --> 47:31.360]  at the journal, when you install Windows on a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro, Windows runs
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.400]  better there than it does on pretty much any other laptop I've ever tested in the last
[47:36.400 --> 47:38.180]  10 years.
[47:38.180 --> 47:41.900]  And that was a that is a problem for Microsoft.
[47:41.900 --> 47:48.480]  You know, as more and more people buy iPhones, more and more people see what Apple does in
[47:48.480 --> 47:51.380]  terms of hardware and software collaboration.
[47:51.380 --> 47:55.860]  That is a problem for Microsoft, especially in the place where they most want us to look
[47:55.860 --> 48:00.380]  to them, which is work, doing things.
[48:00.380 --> 48:04.700]  And so I think, you know, that's where the Surface Book, okay, maybe they're not going
[48:04.700 --> 48:08.140]  to sell as many as they as they may want.
[48:08.140 --> 48:14.020]  And I think that they, I think the pricing structure and is certainly, if you ask my
[48:14.020 --> 48:17.420]  opinion, I think a lot of it is to protect the OEMs and their partners right now.
[48:17.420 --> 48:22.140]  I think there's very clear delineation of what's been happening.
[48:22.140 --> 48:25.820]  You know, this is a computer that starts well above $1,200.
[48:25.820 --> 48:28.540]  Once you get it to where you want it.
[48:28.540 --> 48:32.540]  Most PC buyers buy things under $1,000.
[48:32.540 --> 48:36.900]  But still, I just think as a as a proof of concept, and for Microsoft to say, Look, we
[48:36.900 --> 48:41.700]  can actually make great hardware for a really great operating system that we have out right
[48:41.700 --> 48:43.140]  now.
[48:43.140 --> 48:44.660]  We can do it too.
[48:44.660 --> 48:54.980]  Yeah, they're, they're dancing in a very precarious situation dealing with the OEMs.
[48:54.980 --> 49:00.660]  And they have been ever since they started with the very first Surface, which was really,
[49:00.660 --> 49:05.500]  you know, clearly not as much, you know, it's more of a, even that, you know, when the first
[49:05.500 --> 49:10.260]  one, they had the two versions, one was the Surface that was the arm and, you know, way
[49:10.260 --> 49:14.520]  more like an iPad, and ran a different version of Windows, and then they had the Surface
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.380]  Pro, which had an Intel chip and ran the full version of Windows 8.
[49:18.380 --> 49:24.940]  Even though it was a full Windows 8 computer, it was clearly less of a, hey, this is a true
[49:24.940 --> 49:29.740]  alternative to a laptop from Dell, or from Lenovo, right?
[49:29.740 --> 49:33.240]  Or whoever else HP, whoever, you know, Nate, you name them.
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.100]  It was definitely this is like a new concept, whereas the, you know, now they've, you know,
[49:38.100 --> 49:42.460]  starting from that point, they're clearly and now with the Surface Book, they are clearly
[49:42.460 --> 49:47.620]  had they have an alternative to a laptop from one of their OEM partners.
[49:47.620 --> 49:51.740]  And that's a weird place for them to be.
[49:51.740 --> 49:52.740]  And I think you're right.
[49:52.740 --> 49:54.740]  Looking now to see the pricing.
[49:54.740 --> 49:59.180]  They had a more cheaper skew, and it's not here now.
[49:59.180 --> 50:01.420]  It's $1,500 starting right now.
[50:01.420 --> 50:05.420]  Right, which is definitely premium, even by Apple standards.
[50:05.420 --> 50:11.700]  Yeah, I mean, most people are buying that $1,000 Air, right?
[50:11.700 --> 50:15.540]  It definitely has impressive build quality, though.
[50:15.540 --> 50:17.780]  And I'm not surprised by that.
[50:17.780 --> 50:22.740]  I think the entire story of this, this device, the fact that the first units that were sent
[50:22.740 --> 50:27.020]  out had these weird bugs and manufacturing things, well, you know, guess what, hardware
[50:27.020 --> 50:32.380]  is hard, and Microsoft is still sort of new at it.
[50:32.380 --> 50:39.080]  And it's a tribute to the expertise of the existing companies, Apple, certainly.
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.700]  But even on the PC side, you know, that that most PCs that you test, right, don't have
[50:43.700 --> 50:44.740]  those sort of problems.
[50:44.740 --> 50:49.820]  That's unusual for you to get a review unit that has problems like this, right?
[50:49.820 --> 51:07.820]  Yes, well, it's, um, I'm trying to think back, I have had many instances where PC manufacturers
[51:07.820 --> 51:13.460]  had really messed up certain components, and they just did not work.
[51:13.460 --> 51:21.420]  Yeah, but you know what, you kind of seemed more forgivable in that in those senses.
[51:21.420 --> 51:23.420]  How about this?
[51:23.420 --> 51:24.900]  Unusual but not unprecedented.
[51:24.900 --> 51:27.740]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[51:27.740 --> 51:32.440]  So it's not surprising that they're, to me that they're having those problems.
[51:32.440 --> 51:38.180]  But on the other hand, they have been making, Microsoft has made peripherals for a long
[51:38.180 --> 51:39.180]  time.
[51:39.180 --> 51:43.420]  I mean, as long as I can remember, Microsoft has been making mice and keyboards, and their
[51:43.420 --> 51:47.260]  their mice and keyboards have always been excellent.
[51:47.260 --> 51:49.140]  I mean, truly top notch.
[51:49.140 --> 51:55.020]  Yeah, by the way, corrected the entry level is 1500.
[51:55.020 --> 51:57.180]  I don't know, for some reason, I thought it was 1300.
[51:57.180 --> 52:01.820]  It's it's 1500 on the surface book.
[52:01.820 --> 52:03.540]  So I'm not surprised.
[52:03.540 --> 52:07.460]  And I also thought, great peripheral peripherals.
[52:07.460 --> 52:12.060]  I thought that I thought that the keyboard on the surface book was excellent.
[52:12.060 --> 52:17.020]  The trackpad was excellent, the driver support to make sure that the good hardware trackpad
[52:17.020 --> 52:23.180]  actually translated to a good experience on screen was absolutely seamless.
[52:23.180 --> 52:31.660]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, the, the the issues really did come down to, I think, there were some
[52:31.660 --> 52:35.260]  bugs and issues with the drivers for the display.
[52:35.260 --> 52:37.420]  That was causing a couple of flickering issues.
[52:37.420 --> 52:38.740]  And then obviously, there was the other thing.
[52:38.740 --> 52:42.300]  So I'm excited to take this one out of the box and see how it goes.
[52:42.300 --> 52:44.660]  But I know, I've heard from a lot of happy buyers.
[52:44.660 --> 52:50.260]  I mean, you know, when it comes to, I mean, it's also really, really powerful system.
[52:50.260 --> 52:52.940]  So I don't like the pen too.
[52:52.940 --> 53:00.340]  I mean, I actually still now prefer the iPad Pro pen over the Surface pen, though I've
[53:00.340 --> 53:01.820]  lost both of them.
[53:01.820 --> 53:02.820]  So that's
[53:02.820 --> 53:08.540]  Wait, in your review, you said you only had lost the cap, but now you've lost the entire
[53:08.540 --> 53:09.540]  pencil
[53:09.540 --> 53:11.540]  Yes, I can't find the pen right now.
[53:11.540 --> 53:12.540]  Pencil.
[53:12.540 --> 53:13.540]  I think I know where it is.
[53:13.540 --> 53:15.460]  I mean, this is a really big problem.
[53:15.460 --> 53:20.260]  I mean, it's 2015 and we cannot find our styluses.
[53:20.260 --> 53:22.940]  We need a better way to keep track of our styluses.
[53:22.940 --> 53:29.780]  And actually, I have to say, Samsung, they have that feature where if the stylus goes
[53:29.780 --> 53:32.980]  too far away, it will tell you on your phone.
[53:32.980 --> 53:36.540]  I don't know if they have that in the current note, but they had it.
[53:36.540 --> 53:43.060]  Something like that is, I think, kind of the key to the prevention of the loss or the kidnapping
[53:43.060 --> 53:45.740]  of the styluses.
[53:45.740 --> 53:52.140]  I thought about the like, I kind of, I do enjoy one of my favorite Apple Watch features
[53:52.140 --> 53:55.380]  is the make your phone beep.
[53:55.380 --> 53:56.380]  Yeah.
[53:56.380 --> 53:57.380]  Yeah.
[53:57.380 --> 53:58.380]  I thought about that.
[53:58.380 --> 53:59.860]  I was like, we need something like that.
[53:59.860 --> 54:06.940]  Well, but the problem I think would be that I suspect that the pencil, I suspect that
[54:06.940 --> 54:10.740]  the pencil turned, well, yeah, it would need a, it would need a speaker and B, it would
[54:10.740 --> 54:12.240]  need to be on all the time.
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.620]  Like the reason it works for finding your phone is that until the phone is off, it's
[54:15.620 --> 54:20.380]  on in some degree and the pencil, I think one of the reasons it gets such a seemingly
[54:20.380 --> 54:26.940]  amazing battery life is that it somehow turns off in a very intelligent manner when you're
[54:26.940 --> 54:28.460]  not using it.
[54:28.460 --> 54:29.460]  Yes.
[54:29.460 --> 54:30.460]  And so I don't know.
[54:30.460 --> 54:37.540]  But also like they have, I did a piece a couple of a year or two a year ago about the Bluetooth
[54:37.540 --> 54:39.980]  low energy trackers.
[54:39.980 --> 54:44.700]  And so those work when they're in the vicinity of your phone.
[54:44.700 --> 54:49.860]  So possibly, and there's really interesting crowdsourcing stuff that's happening with
[54:49.860 --> 54:50.860]  those.
[54:50.860 --> 54:55.460]  That if those are in the proximity of another one of those, like have you seen the tile
[54:55.460 --> 55:00.320]  trackers or the tracker, like those, those can talk to each other.
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.300]  So what if all the styluses could talk to each other?
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.300]  That would be something.
[55:05.300 --> 55:08.780]  It needs to be solved.
[55:08.780 --> 55:10.440]  It's definitely a problem.
[55:10.440 --> 55:11.440]  It's definitely a problem.
[55:11.440 --> 55:13.860]  I need to have many conversations with Apple.
[55:13.860 --> 55:16.960]  Number one, let's talk about the styluses talking to each other.
[55:16.960 --> 55:19.960]  Number two, let's talk about text edit.
[55:19.960 --> 55:27.460]  Number three, let's talk about an ad where iPad lovers fall in love around the iPad.
[55:27.460 --> 55:30.060]  A shared movie is shared.
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.780]  All these things could happen in one ad.
[55:31.780 --> 55:33.740]  All right, I want to take a break here.
[55:33.740 --> 55:36.400]  And I want to thank our next friend of the show.
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.020]  Next advertiser, it is our good friends at Wealthfront.
[55:40.020 --> 55:47.160]  Wealthfront is offers long term passive investing, as dictated by strategies in modern portfolio
[55:47.160 --> 55:48.160]  theory.
[55:48.160 --> 55:54.460]  This is an academically proven and approved way to invest for the long term.
[55:54.460 --> 55:58.540]  How things in your portfolio should move in relationship to each other so that you have
[55:58.540 --> 56:05.020]  a balanced portfolio that is adjusted to your tolerance for risk.
[56:05.020 --> 56:06.260]  All sorts of stuff.
[56:06.260 --> 56:09.600]  Long story short, it's a replacement for a financial advisor.
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.280]  It's automated and algorithmic.
[56:11.280 --> 56:16.660]  You invest your money, you give them your money, and they take care of it for you automatically.
[56:16.660 --> 56:20.740]  It's just a way to invest for the long term.
[56:20.740 --> 56:23.380]  Why would you use it instead of a financial manager?
[56:23.380 --> 56:29.800]  Well, a financial manager usually takes about one to three percent fees.
[56:29.800 --> 56:31.780]  One percent is around the average.
[56:31.780 --> 56:36.780]  Wealthfront only takes 0.25 percent.
[56:36.780 --> 56:43.260]  And even then, they only take that fee on what you've invested over $10,000.
[56:43.260 --> 56:48.100]  And they have a special deal for listeners of the show.
[56:48.100 --> 56:53.380]  If you take the URL that I'm going to give you at the end, they will only apply their
[56:53.380 --> 56:56.620]  fees after $15,000.
[56:56.620 --> 57:01.540]  And the fee only applies to what you have invested above $15,000.
[57:01.540 --> 57:08.580]  So if you invest $15,001, they only charge that 0.25 percent fee on the dollar that's
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.020]  over $15,000.
[57:11.020 --> 57:15.180]  You can get started as low as $500, and in fact, that's what most of their customers
[57:15.180 --> 57:16.180]  do.
[57:16.180 --> 57:20.680]  Most people sign up, and to test the waters, they just put $500 or $1,000 in to see how
[57:20.680 --> 57:22.100]  it works.
[57:22.100 --> 57:26.300]  And then they put quote-unquote real money in only after they're happy with it.
[57:26.300 --> 57:27.720]  Really, really simple.
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.100]  It's a way to invest for the long term and not worry about it.
[57:32.100 --> 57:36.020]  How is it better than doing something like tossing money at the S&P 500 Index?
[57:36.020 --> 57:42.420]  It's because automatically, it's not just one index fund with a list of companies.
[57:42.420 --> 57:46.660]  They do some kind of complicated thing that you can go to their website and read about
[57:46.660 --> 57:50.540]  if you want to see the details, balance it automatically.
[57:50.540 --> 57:56.540]  So if one spectrum of your portfolio starts going up, they might move more of the money
[57:56.540 --> 58:04.660]  in that direction and take less out of some industry where stocks are going down.
[58:04.660 --> 58:06.180]  I have to read this at the end.
[58:06.180 --> 58:07.180]  Go there.
[58:07.180 --> 58:08.180]  Check it out.
[58:08.180 --> 58:09.180]  Here's what you do to go check it out.
[58:09.180 --> 58:12.300]  You go to Wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[58:12.300 --> 58:13.300]  Just go there.
[58:13.300 --> 58:15.220]  Check it out if you're looking to invest for the long term.
[58:15.220 --> 58:21.300]  And I have to read this for compliance purposes and to keep myself out of prison.
[58:21.300 --> 58:26.500]  For compliance purposes, I have to tell you that Wealthfront Incorporated is an SEC registered
[58:26.500 --> 58:28.620]  investment advisor.
[58:28.620 --> 58:36.240]  Brokerage services are offered through Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation member FINRA and SIPC.
[58:36.240 --> 58:39.140]  This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
[58:39.140 --> 58:43.580]  Investing in securities involves risks and there is the possibility of losing money.
[58:43.580 --> 58:45.740]  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
[58:45.740 --> 58:51.220]  Please visit Wealthfront.com slash the talk show to read our full disclosure.
[58:51.220 --> 58:54.540]  That was very well done.
[58:54.540 --> 58:56.620]  I'm freaked out.
[58:56.620 --> 58:57.620]  I love these guys.
[58:57.620 --> 58:58.620]  Sounds like a great service.
[58:58.620 --> 58:59.620]  It really does.
[58:59.620 --> 59:00.620]  I can't use it.
[59:00.620 --> 59:06.940]  That's part of the deal with the SEC stuff is that if you are being paid by them as an
[59:06.940 --> 59:11.540]  advertiser, I'm not allowed to invest the money with them.
[59:11.540 --> 59:14.300]  But it's interesting.
[59:14.300 --> 59:24.220]  It spooks me out that I have  this show is obviously sort of a seat of the pants operation.
[59:24.220 --> 59:29.940]  It really spooks me that the thing comes with this big bold thing and I've spoken to them
[59:29.940 --> 59:33.860]  on the phone to get briefed on how the whole thing works and they're very nice people.
[59:33.860 --> 59:40.220]  But to have an all caps bold, you must read this for legal purposes thing, it freaks me
[59:40.220 --> 59:43.380]  the hell out.
[59:43.380 --> 59:51.180]  With the Surface Book, I think you're clearly  it's clearly a laptop first and a tablet
[59:51.180 --> 59:53.540]  second for multiple reasons.
[59:53.540 --> 59:58.780]  It's part of the GPU processing is in the part that you detach.
[59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.380]  It's in the keyboard part.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.380]  Like you said, it doesn't get 
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:09.780]  And the battery life is all in the keyboard.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:20.060]  But it's way less cumbersome than I thought including the software support in Windows.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.060]  Yeah.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:26.340]  I mean, a lot of people also complained about the screen wobble, like that was like a deal
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.540]  breaker for some people.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.180]  I mean, the screen wobble is not a deal breaker for me.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:36.080]  I mean, yeah, like when you shake the top of the screen, it certainly wobbles more than
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:43.580]  a laptop that has a very sturdy hinge, but yeah, not a deal breaker, I think the screen
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580]  wobble.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.860]  If Apple had had a screen wobble like that and it's like, I don't know, I don't know
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.540]  how I'd feel if Apple had a screen wobble like that.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:01:02.060]  Well, I think if a MacBook had screen wobble like that but it didn't detach, it would
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.100]  be a pure complaint.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.220]  The other ones don't wobble.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.220]  This one wobbles.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.620]  What in the world is wrong with this hinge?
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.700]  Whereas if it wobbles but it's because you can detach it, it's a trade-off.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.100]  It's obviously not ideal but it is a trade-off.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:24.180]  And I think it's fair to say that, for example, with the iPad Pro, when you connect to Apple's
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:29.900]  smart keyboard, I can use it on my lap and in fact, I have.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:36.660]  I've used it on my lap resting on my thighs and I've found it sturdy.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.660]  Yeah, it's not great but it works.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.660]  Yeah, but it wobbles.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.220]  I mean, I think it wobbles more than the Surface Book would.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.220]  Yeah.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:47.700]  Even in my iPad Pro video, I showed it wobbling off.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:53.140]  But that's more top-heavy.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:02:01.660]  I think that's more because the smart cover, the smart keyboard case, weighs less than
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.660]  the tablet.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.660]  Yeah, it weighs less.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:09.060]  So when you put it on your leg and it's not on an even plane, it doesn't have the balancing
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.460]  to balance itself out.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.580]  It doesn't have the weight, the evenness of the weight.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:24.340]  But yeah, no, I mean, yeah, certainly there are compromises that you're making in design
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.260]  now for either option, right, and I don't really know what to call these things.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:35.740]  But when you're trying to put a tablet with the keyboard, you're sacrificing some of the
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:41.940]  best things about a laptop, which is using it on your lap or using it while it's still
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940]  your lap.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.260]  I just think of the scenarios when I actually use it on my lap, which is either sitting
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.660]  in bed or on a couch.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.220]  Then when you're combining the tablet with sort of the laptop, whatever you want to call
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:59.700]  these things that are sort of laptops with tablets like the Surface Book, you are making
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.840]  compromises in some of the laptop design.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:09.060]  So whether that be the screen hinge or battery or... Can't think of another example right
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.060]  now.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.500]  There's something else, but I can't think of it.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:20.220]  So there are these form factor compromises we're making on both sides.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:24.260]  That's what is so hard right now, like how I started the conversation.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:31.780]  It's so hard to ask people or to recommend things when it comes down to what a user's
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.900]  willing to compromise.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:41.360]  When I look at the differences between something like a Surface Pro 4 and the iPad Pro, they're
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.340]  such different products.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:48.660]  There are so many different compromises you'd make on either side, whether it's because
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:56.220]  of how the hardware was designed or because of how the software is so different.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.660]  That's what is very confusing about what's happening in computing.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:05.560]  Part of me wonders, does all of this have to be happening right now?
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.380]  Is this partially on the Windows side to get people more interested again in buying PCs?
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.620]  Is it just that laptops were boring and people weren't buying them?
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.300]  I don't know.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.220]  On the iPad side, I wonder, is this a way just to get more people interested again in
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.100]  the iPad because they want them to do more things?
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:31.300]  It ultimately comes down to when you're choosing a computer now, what is it that you want these
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.520]  things to do and what are you going to live with?
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.460]  What are the compromises you're going to live with?
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:43.900]  I find it, and this is not a normal problem that most people have, but because I have
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:49.380]  review units of all of these various products, I have all three iPad sizes here and they're
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:57.180]  all set up for me ready to go, and I have my MacBook Pro, and I find it hard at any
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.900]  given moment to choose, which if I'm going to go away for a week, which is what we did
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.740]  last week for Thanksgiving, family went away for a week, which iPad do I want to take with
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.740]  me?
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.740]  I don't want to take them all.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.040]  Just to get a break, because I've been using the iPad Pro so much, I thought, let's go
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.940]  to the complete opposite end of the lineup, and I just took the iPad Mini with me.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.620]  One of the reasons I did that was also because my phone is on Verizon.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:31.580]  My iPad Mini is on AT&T, and I find that that's a really useful combination while traveling
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.940]  because you can go somewhere where maybe one or the other has terrible service, but if
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:41.660]  the other one does, you can just use that one, and I really liked it.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.980]  I still like the iPad Mini a lot.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.320]  It's just good at very different things, though.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.980]  What iPhone do you have?
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.460]  It's iPhone 6S, but not the big one.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.460]  I can't stand the Plus.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:03.420]  Yeah, I don't like the Plus either, but I just did this smartphone buyer's guide, and
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:09.900]  it's like, on paper, the Plus is so much better.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:14.460]  It is the iPhone I should have, but I don't like using it.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.940]  It's just so big.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.500]  Yeah, technically, it is clearly the best device.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:24.260]  The image stabilization for video and still photos.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.580]  The battery life and the photos are justand you'd think, those are the two most important
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.040]  things we want in phones right now, right?
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.340]  Better cameras and better battery life.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.860]  Why don't I just get this bigger phone, and I just can'talso, when I reviewed it, I
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:41.460]  just couldn't gravitate towards the Plus.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.980]  I just hope with the 7 or the next version that maybe they figure out a way to get the
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:51.940]  bigger screen into a smaller body, and we won't have to make the sacrifices of these
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.020]  things because the phone will just feel smaller.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:00.420]  Yeah, I don't even care about getting more screen on the smaller device.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.540]  I just don't want a device that's any physically bigger than this.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:08.140]  What I just hope that they can figure out is to get the optical image stabilization
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.420]  in the smaller one.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:13.540]  It would be wonderful if they could get the battery life of the Plus in the small one,
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.540]  but I'm not holding my breath on that one.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.540]  Yeah.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540]  But I totally see why some people do.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:24.740]  I know our friend, Nilay, is a Plus user, and I was talking about it, but he told me
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.740]  Because he has giant hands.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.820]  He has giant hands, but he also told me that he, most days, literally does most of his
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.180]  work on his phone.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.540]  And if that's true for anybody, tons and tons of emails.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.860]  It is for so many people.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:42.780]  Yeah, and if that's true, that you actually send most of your email from your phone and
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:49.220]  stuff like that, I can totally see why having the bigger keyboard for two-thumb typing and
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.100]  the extra battery life is a killer feature.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:56.180]  I totally understand why some people love the Plus.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.180]  It's just not for me.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.180]  Yeah, same.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.020]  No, I mean, and I always want to.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.100]  Like when I was doing the smartphone buyers, I was like, I'm going to do it.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.060]  I put my SIM in there, use it for a day.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.060]  I just can't.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.380]  And then I just bought a new 6S on Sunday.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:17.500]  Yeah, well, I had been using the review unit for a while, and it was time.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:26.420]  It was time to send back everything, so I now have a brand-new 6 Plus, or 6S.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.860]  Well, hold that thought.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.860]  That's actually a good point.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:35.100]  So one of the things that we go through as reviewers of these things is we have to set
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:41.860]  up these devices more often than most people because at least three times a year, I have
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:47.900]  to set one up because now I get two review units, the 6S and the 6S Plus, and then I
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.940]  buy my own one that I actually use.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:09:01.940]  I think that the setup process for buying a new iPhone is terrible.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:02.940]  I just tweeted.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.260]  Did you see my tweet earlier this week?
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.260]  No.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.260]  Didn't even see it.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.260]  I can't pull it up right now, or maybe I can't.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:12.420]  I said, I got a new iPhone 6S.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.020]  I'm not restoring from backup.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:25.060]  I'm just setting it up as a new phone, hashtag YOLO, because usually I do a restore, and
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:29.060]  I'm not doing the restore anymore.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.060]  I wonder.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.020]  Maybe that's the way to go.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.100]  It's just freeing.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:37.260]  This phone, of course it's brand new, but it feels really still brand new.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:43.260]  It's not slow, with tons of apps and folders that I never use.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.460]  Yeah, that's the big thing.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.760]  It doesn't carry over the apps.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.060]  Everything else was blacked up to the cloud, and it also doesn't pull over your iMac.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.140]  So I got into this conversation online.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:06.780]  The biggest sacrifice you make now is that your Apple Watch activity data does not make
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.260]  its way over.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.260]  Which is terrible.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.260]  It's terrible.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:16.240]  Everyone said privacy, and I was like, I just wish there was an option to opt in, to sync
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.820]  that to the cloud, and bring it over to my new iPhone.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.420]  One of the things that I've seen people complain about, and this isn't my complaint, is I've
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:30.860]  seen people complain about, and somebody made a diagram and posted it to Twitter, where
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:38.920]  it was like in 2007, from out of the box to using it, the original iPhone, it was like
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.340]  three things.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.540]  Three little screens you went through, and then boom, you're at the home screen.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.780]  And now there's like 21 steps that you go through.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:53.020]  But that's not the part that I find terrible, because I understand that when they say, hey,
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.020]  do you want to allow location?
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.780]  I understand why they do that, and it takes, it's just a tap.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:02.780]  So I don't mind that, that you say, yes, I want to allow location.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.420]  Yes, here's my iCloud username and password.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.140]  Yes, you can share my data, my data with developers.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.700]  That's not my problem.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.080]  But given that they're already making you go through those steps, I don't find that
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.440]  to be a problem.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:27.220]  My problem is with the fact that once you're past that, it takes so long, and it's indeterminate
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.540]  for all of your stuff to come over.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:33.720]  And you've got all these apps that are like darkened out, because they're, it's like,
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.820]  they're coming, but they're not there yet, but you don't see any progress.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820]  You mean when you restore it?
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:38.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.820]  When you sign in?
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:40.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.820]  If you don't select setup as new.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.820]  Right.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.300]  I just don't see, for the Apple Watch Health stuff, I don't see why that isn't an option
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.700]  at that point, too, where what do you want to do with your Apple Watch?
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:58.060]  Do you want to just keep it on the iPhone, which is more private?
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:04.540]  Or would you allow us to store it in your iCloud account online, which
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.300]  That's all I'm saying, I just want an option.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.300]  Right.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.540]  And I don't see, it certainly is private.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:17.360]  I mean, I don't want, you know, and I realized that there's, if there's some kind of bug
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.620]  in, you know, on Apple's server-side stuff that someday somebody, there might be some
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.460]  kind of breach that would let that stuff out.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.780]  And I wouldn't want that to happen.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:32.960]  But to me, it's no more private than, in fact, I would, for me personally, I would consider
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.620]  it less private than my email, which I have
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.340]  Or your contact list.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:43.700]  Or my contact list or my iMessages, I actually use iMessage more than I use my Mac.com email.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.860]  So the contents of my iMessages are far more.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.740]  And I guess the whole iMessage history isn't stored on cloud.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.740]  Right.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.740]  Yeah.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.780]  My email is, if it was something I could opt into, I would, I trust Apple enough that I
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.780]  would trust it.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:02.820]  But your email with Apple is on their servers, not, not others.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:03.900]  Right.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.020]  But I, you know, they certainly host things.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.060]  They do host things that are private.
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:12.900]  And I don't see why my Apple Watch data can't be
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:20.300]  Yeah, I mean, I just wish it, I mean, even if it was just like, for the one time sync,
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.100]  and then they delete it or something, I don't know.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.260]  I don't know enough about that.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:30.260]  But yes, it, that is the one annoying thing I did not get from the restore.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.500]  And also iMessage history, you can get, you can sync all your old messages.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.500]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:41.140]  But other than that, I'm really happy with my setup as new iPhone.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.140]  Yeah.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.140]  It's a whole new world.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.140]  It's like,
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.860]  it's, it's a tempting way.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.740]  It's a tempting way to clean up all the apps you're not using too.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:49.740]  Yeah.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.700]  And it really makes you think about what the best apps you use and like, I redid my whole
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.700]  home screen and
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.540]  Right.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.180]  This is all I use a lot of Google.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:03.340]  But a lot of Google and social networks, basically.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.340]  Right.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.660]  Yes, the Starbucks app.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:11.820]  What pain, it's such a pain in the ass to set up.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820]  The Starbucks app?
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.820]  Wait for the sync.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]  No, no, no.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.980]  To set up a new device and have all those apps sync over.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980]  Yeah.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]  I find it easier.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980]  I do it.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.300]  See, and so for example, with iPads, I never, I almost never restore from a backup.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.660]  I just always start the iPad fresh.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:30.260]  So like the iPad Pro that I've been using, you know, since whenever they seeded the review
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.720]  unit.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.580]  It's a lot easier to do than with an iPhone because I don't feel like you're giving things
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.580]  up.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.580]  You're not giving things up like your message.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.660]  Well, I guess you are giving up somewhat of your message history.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660]  But
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.260]  It's probably not your main device for that.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.640]  Exactly.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.580]  And actually, I did the same for that Pro.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:56.100]  When I did the iPhone reviews, I have to think, no, you know, for the iPhone reviews, I didn't
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.300]  restore from backup.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.460]  And then when I started using it as like my phone for a little bit, I did restore from
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.220]  an old backup because I didn't want to test the battery life in my test with a, I just
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.620]  wanted to do it completely clean.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:16.800]  But yeah, but yeah, most of the time when I've got new phones, I do a restore and my
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.180]  wife has done a restore and her like, oh, and that's why I think it's also ridiculous
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:24.980]  is like in some of those restore files, they have crazy things in there.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:31.900]  The files can be like, I think her last one was like 60 or 70 gigs because she had done
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.300]  the restore of, you know, you do the restore, it's all your photos that were stored on the
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.940]  phone, videos, everything, you know, even photo thing, photos that were in your iMessages.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:47.140]  Yeah, and sometimes those I had, I had at one point had one of her files on my computer
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.380]  and it was taking up a ton of space.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:54.860]  Yeah, they can definitely get big, but that's 70 gigs is really big, because they don't
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.960]  back up some of the stuff.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.700]  They don't back up like your iTunes stuff, because they, you know, yeah, they can think
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.620]  that, right, they can sync it from the server.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.980]  But that's part of the process, though, that I hate is that it's indeterminate when that's
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.980]  going to finish.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.900]  There's nowhere to go where it shows you a progress bar that says, here's all the stuff
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.980]  that we are restoring and here's what what state it is.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.980]  Right.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:22.360]  I mean, for most people, a lot of this stuff should be in the cloud.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360]  Other than the apps.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.640]  I mean, the apps are also in the cloud, you just have to manually go into iTunes and select
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.540]  which ones you want.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.540]  That's what I did.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.620]  I went into the App Store.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.420]  I'm very happy with my decision to set up as a new iPhone and I encourage all listeners
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.420]  to do the same.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.900]  Yeah, it seems it's other than if you're going to be very upset about your Apple Watch data.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.140]  Why do I keep calling it the iWatch?
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.460]  Should I just call it the iWatch?
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:53.540]  I want to be like that person that keeps calling it the iTouch.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.660]  Tim Cook slipped and said iWatch on one of the events this year.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.700]  I forget which one, but might have been like at WWDC.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:04.200]  But at some point earlier this year, Tim Cook slipped and almost got the word all the way
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.620]  out of his mouth before he corrected himself.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:10.580]  It makes you wonder, were they going to call it the iWatch at some point?
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.580]  Probably.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.460]  Yeah, I suspect so.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:19.020]  I mean, obviously we do it because that was what it was rumored to be called for so long.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.140]  Right.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:26.440]  Yeah, I think what happened is that there was a, I think, well, who knows, because this
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:32.660]  is one of those things where who knows who the people are, but clearly there's a contingent
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:41.580]  within the company that has won out that has decided that the whole iPrefix thing is dated.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:48.820]  And maybe they were opposed to it all along, who knows, and that it was a Steve Jobs thing.
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:53.500]  One thing you know, this is one of the things we miss without Steve Jobs there is that when
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:18:00.100]  Steve was there, you knew with certain things like that, that he must have liked it.
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:05.660]  There's no possible way they would have used that iPrefix for the iMac, the iPod, the iPad,
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.800]  the iPhone, anything that had that iPrefix.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.180]  You know that Steve liked it because if he didn't, there's no way they would have used
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.180]  it.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:18.540]  Whereas who it is that's made them decide to get away from that, who knows?
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.540]  Is it Shiller?
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.540]  Is it Jonny Ive?
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.820]  Is it Shiller and Jonny Ive?
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.820]  Who knows?
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.820]  Right.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.760]  Somebody obviously doesn't like it anymore.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.580]  But I think that there must have been some people who do like it and were like, wait,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.140]  that's what we're known for.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.880]  People are already calling it the iWatch.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.620]  We haven't even told them we're doing it yet.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.180]  I think people like it.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:47.180]  It's just, I don't like that I keep saying it, but it's just like, that's what I call
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.180]  it.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:49.180]  Yeah, it's like the iTouch.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.180]  There was no iTouch.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.180]  There's never been an iTouch.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.620]  See, I never fell for that one.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:54.980]  I never called it that either.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.460]  I mean, also it's like that sounds wrong.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.380]  I always thought it sounded wrong.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.380]  I even write it.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:04.740]  I say it all the time, and it's gotten better over the years, but iPad is so close to iPod
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:11.340]  where I've had podcasts where I've been talking about the iPad and just said iPod like 10
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.380]  times and whoever's on the show with me is like, you know, you keep saying iPod and I'm
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.740]  like, I do?
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:25.460]  It's just, it's filed under the same cells in my brain, and they're like, my brain says,
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.660]  ah, close enough.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.540]  It's a thing from Apple.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.180]  The iPod Pro.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:33.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.880]  This actually reminds me, so like yesterday there's some internal email chain on our team
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:44.260]  and oh, I know, we got an email from a VR company and they were basically like trying
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:49.420]  to take your music and make it into a VR visualization, and so it started talking about like, oh,
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:54.020]  remember those visualizations in iTunes, you know, the music visualization?
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.420]  So it turns out those are still there because everything is still in iTunes.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:09.300]  And someone on our team went into iTunes and found the UI quilt or whatever the icons are,
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:17.940]  the.RSRC files, I'm pulling this up right now, and you can see in there all the old,
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:23.380]  like you know, it has support still for all of the old iPods, and it's amazing to look
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.380]  at.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.140]  I'll forward you this.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:32.540]  It has like, you know, all the way back to, it's got the original, it's got the original
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:43.500]  Apple TV in here, shuffles, iPod video, the U2 iPod, it's great.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.500]  The U2 iPod.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.500]  Remember that?
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.700]  It's a great U2 iPod.
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:49.700]  It was tremendous.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.700]  Yeah.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:59.060]  Yeah, just tons, I mean, my guess is it's because these are all still supported in iTunes.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.620]  Yeah, the first Apple TV is amazing.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.700]  That's really crazy.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:10.420]  That's almost Microsoftian in terms of backwards compatibility.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.620]  I'll send you these.
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.260]  I think you should have access to it.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.140]  Maybe you want to post them.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.140]  Okay.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.140]  Yeah.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.980]  They're, and then they have like the little icons we were looking for.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.740]  We were wondering if the little burn icon for burn to CD was still there, and it's not
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.220]  there anymore.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:34.660]  Boy, when's the last time they sold a machine that could burn a CD?
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.380]  That's been a couple of years.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.780]  You still can burn it though in iTunes.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.780]  Right.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.180]  If you have an external dock, yeah.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.180]  Right.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:48.400]  All right, before we go too far into the weeds on iTunes, let me take another break here
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.100]  and thank our next sponsor, and it's our good friends at MailRoute.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:59.620]  MailRoute is a company, they do one thing and they do it well.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:04.280]  They filter junk from email.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.620]  These are email nerds who do nothing but email.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.620]  This is great.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.460]  They don't host your email.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.460]  What they do is they provide, this sounds weird.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.720]  I know this sounds weird.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.920]  They provide a service.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:19.400]  If you have your own domain name or you host your email, you just change your DNS settings
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.940]  to point at MailRoute first, and your email goes through.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:24.940]  It's like a screen.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.900]  Think of it as like a sifting screen.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:34.700]  They take all the spam and junk out and then forward all the good email, anything left
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:39.280]  after that goes to your existing mail server.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.660]  You already have a mail server and your domain name.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.900]  You don't change your email server or your domain name.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.060]  You don't have to set up new accounts on a new thing or whatever.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.220]  All you do is change your DNS to point at MailRoute first.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:54.240]  The spam gets taken out and then your email just shows up.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.240]  The effect for you as a user of your email and for anybody else in your company or your
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.260]  team who uses your email, nothing changes.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:06.540]  You don't have to go into your mail clients and change anything on the user side.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.620]  All you notice is that all of a sudden, all the junk is gone and it's not in your inbox
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:11.980]  anymore.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.180]  It is tremendous.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.180]  I've used it.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.620]  It is really remarkable in terms of how accurate it is.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.620]  No spam filtering is perfect and they have really, really great features, super easy
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:31.020]  where you can get an automated message on a daily basis or a weekly basis that tells
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:35.320]  you here's all the questionable stuff that we filtered out and you can just review that
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.500]  to look for any kind of false positives.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:44.580]  Really easy to set up whitelisting if there's one particular message that got hit that you
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:49.000]  know you're going to get more from, maybe like PayPal messages or something like that
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.920]  that often get flagged to spam.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.620]  You can just easily whitelist a certain address, couldn't be easier.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:02.140]  You just set it up once, change your DNS, all of a sudden, spam and junk just go away.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.700]  Could not be easier.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.100]  They even have advanced features if you want them.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.540]  They have an API so you can program stuff.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:17.380]  They support LDAP, Active Directory, TLS, mail bagging, whatever that is, outbound relay,
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.860]  anything you would want from the people handling your email.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.100]  Great tech support, everything is just great.
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.060]  So here's what you do.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:35.780]  Go to mailroute.net slash TTS, the talk show TTS.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:39.460]  And when you go there, you'll start with a free trial, which is great.
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.740]  When you see how great the free trial is, once you start paying, you'll get 10% off
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.860]  for the lifetime of your account, not like one time, only 10%.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.660]  This is like for years to come, 10 years from now, when you're still using mailroute, you'll
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:57.140]  have saved like megabucks because you went to mailroute.net slash TTS.
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:02.220]  So go check them out if you host your own email.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.220]  What else is on your mind, Joanna?
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:14.620]  Joanna I really do not know what's on my mind right
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620]  now.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:19.820]  Dave I was talking about using the iPad Mini.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.660]  If you could only take one iPad with you on a trip, which one would it be?
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:29.740]  Let's say you're going away for a week, you're going to be away from home for a week.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:34.780]  Joanna Well, I'm weird because I don't read on an
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.780]  iPad.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.020]  Like I don't read books on an iPad.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.580]  So I have the Kindle Paperwhite, which I love.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.700]  So I would probably bring that Pro and I would try to not bring my Air.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.420]  I mean, am I going on vacation?
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.420]  Where am I going?
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:52.300]  That's probably actually what's really on my mind.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.500]  I'm going on vacation in a week and a half and I can't wait.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.500]  Dave All right.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.500]  Well, then there you go.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.500]  Joanna I'm exhausted.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.060]  Dave It's not even a hypothetical.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.980]  Joanna Yeah, I'm going to Cabo.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:12.500]  I'm going to probably bring I'll bring the Pro if I still have it and I haven't sent
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.500]  it back.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:18.220]  I mean, I just don't think I would.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:25.660]  Yeah, for watching Netflix and for or like watching any downloaded movies.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:29.500]  We did that as well.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:35.180]  I'm preferring it over the Air that I bought two years ago.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.460]  I think I should sell that Air probably, right?
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.420]  Dave I should sell all of this stuff.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:46.500]  I have so much stuff and I just keep it all and just hoard it here in my office and you
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.500]  know,
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.620]  Joanna So do I. I mean, I don't sell.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.640]  I did sell my iPhone 6.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.000]  I did it for a story but I pretty much would have.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.660]  That's what I think I'm going to be doing going forward.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:01.820]  I still haven't decided if I should go to get into the upgrade program.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.980]  Have you ever is that are you on that plan?
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:09.180]  Dave No, I actually still own one of every iPhone
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:14.340]  ever made because I bought every one for myself and I've kept them all.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:19.160]  In fact, I have more than one of every one because I have some of Amy's as well.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.620]  Some of Amy's we've given away to like family members.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.780]  I don't think we've ever sold one but we've given them away to people like her younger
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.300]  sister and stuff like that.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.420]  She had one that she broke so we don't have two of every one.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.520]  Joanna I'm thinking about doing this basically my
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.820]  own upgrade plan.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:44.820]  Everyone else should be on the Joanna Stern upgrade plan where I basically buy the phone
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:55.580]  outright then hopefully sell it right before the event, use an old phone, use that new
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.140]  money to buy the new phone.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:08.380]  That's basically what I sold my 64 gig 6 right before the event for 520 something dollars
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.380]  on SWAPA.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:15.740]  It was a good experience, way more money than you'd get on one of those other sites.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.540]  I got completely scammed on eBay so I didn't use eBay.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.260]  Dave You did get scammed on eBay?
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.700]  Joanna Oh yeah, totally scammed on eBay.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.700]  Dave Really?
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.020]  Tell me about that.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.920]  Joanna Yeah, I like put it up for sale on eBay.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:37.920]  The guy, of course claiming to be from Nigeria, well no, he didn't tell me he was from Nigeria.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.460]  So he's the guy who buys it, it says he lives in Boston and that he's buying the phone for
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.820]  $600.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.580]  That's probably where I should have been tipped off because it was like more than I had put
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.900]  it up for.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.860]  And so he then, this is actually hilarious because this was all for a story.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:58.480]  I was basically just putting it up there to test out eBay for a story.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.660]  And they say he says he's in Boston, I'm like, okay, he says, Oh, I can't send the money
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.920]  through eBay.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]  Something's wrong with it.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.900]  I need to send it through PayPal.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.340]  Okay, that's, that's fine.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.420]  Then he says, Oh, I can't send it through the right right PayPal because eBay doesn't
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.380]  own PayPal anymore.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.380]  That has absolutely nothing to do with anything.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.260]  Dave It is true.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.260]  It's true.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:24.260]  Joanna It's true.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.580]  But like that doesn't have anything to do with any like what, whatever it is, and then
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:36.420]  ultimately sends me a phishing PayPal email that says he sent me the $600 through PayPal.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:41.460]  And, you know, there was no real transaction that happened through PayPal.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.460]  Or through eBay.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.180]  Dave But you didn't send him the phone, though.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.500]  Joanna No, no, and I don't think in the end, I don't
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.620]  think he was actually after the phone.
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.860]  I think he was after some sort of information that I would have either clicked on when I
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.260]  clicked on that PayPal phishing thing.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.260]  Right.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.260]  Yeah.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.260]  Yeah.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:06.180]  And then like gave me a whole story like, oh, instead send the phone to Nigeria because
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.700]  my cousin is there and gave me a whole story about that.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:23.180]  But I was actually I know I can actually forward you the emails as I see the PayPal.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:27.360]  The really, what actually ended up happening, which was really I was very upset about from
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.580]  eBay was he had gotten my phone number.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:36.940]  Yeah, and that was that was where I, you know, the scam stuff happens and you need to be
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:40.700]  on the lookout for weird PayPal spoofing email addresses.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.980]  Yeah, his name is Stanley Bates.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:52.020]  And I, you know, in quotes, yeah, Stanley Bates from from Boston, and I knew obviously
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:56.460]  that something was really fishy when he wanted to send it through this weird PayPal looking
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.660]  thing in my, you know, it looks pretty real, to be honest.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:04.460]  But the address says, sale safety at usa.com.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.460]  Right.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:10.700]  Anyway, what what what I was really annoyed about was eBay has this loophole where after
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:15.420]  you've finished a transaction with someone and bought something and said you're going
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.820]  to buy this item or whatever and have the account.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:24.160]  There is a way using your listing number that you can look up their phone number and their
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.160]  email address.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:32.460]  So he had been he texted me Yeah, yeah, I was not happy about that.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.560]  But in the end, I sold my iPhone six.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.400]  And then I use that money to buy a new iPhone six s this past weekend.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.940]  And so you who did you sell it to swap?
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.940]  How do you spell that?
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.940]  Yes.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.940]  swap a.com.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:45.940]  SW a PPA.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:46.940]  Hmm.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:49.340]  Yeah, this was our first story.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.100]  It was right right before the iPhone event.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:54.380]  I wrote a piece about the best ways to sell your phone.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:01.800]  Right, but it I mean, obviously introducing a middleman definitely, you know, they're,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800]  they're in business.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.620]  So you're selling to them for less than what they're going to resell it for.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.460]  And then in theory, if you could sell, this is like the whole spirit of eBay.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.220]  In theory, if you could just find the person who wanted to buy it, you could sell it to
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:18.060]  them for some price in between to make money.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:23.760]  I'll send you the article that swap is, is a marketplace, an open marketplace.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.180]  So you are selling to another person.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.380]  Oh, really?
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.380]  Yeah.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:35.380]  So exactly the middleman options like gazelle or you you sell or what are the many other
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:41.100]  ones next worth or I cracked, they won't give you as good of a value as an eBay or an Amazon
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.620]  marketplace or swap.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.620]  Hmm.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.780]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.380]  Because I just hoard all of mine.
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.380]  Right.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.380]  Like an like an idiot.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.380]  I had a great experience with swap.
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:54.180]  But actually, it was, I had said on the listing that I would prefer it with someone in New
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:33:00.980]  York City and found a guy and we met in a very public place in New York and he bought
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.740]  the phone right, right there.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.560]  That legit guy, not Stanley Bates from Africa.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.860]  And so if you met in person, how does was the transaction still digital, though, where
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.820]  like he sent the money on PayPal before legit, I saw it.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.220]  I saw it clear in my PayPal account.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.220]  Right.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.220]  Yeah.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.220]  Yeah.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.220]  That sounds great.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:23.220]  Yeah.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.220]  I mean, you know, and then like, that's what this year, you know, I think back on like,
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.960]  what were some of the big themes of the year, you know, in smartphones, I just did this
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.960]  buying guide.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:38.300]  And it was like, all phones became great, most, you know, most of these Android phones
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300]  are great.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:43.300]  Now, you know, the iPhone became even better.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:48.540]  And the biggest deal was like how we buy our phones through carriers now, right, carriers
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:54.500]  decided, screw, screw these contracts.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.000]  Whether people really start upgrading their phones more frequently, I'm not so sure.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.500]  It's still not the easiest thing, you know, to navigate those deals.
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.500]  Certainly Apple's program is seems like the best of them all.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:15.580]  But yeah, I mean, how we buy and, and pay the carriers was certainly a big change of
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.580]  2015.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:27.020]  I mean, I'm, I'm still with Verizon, because I still think I get the best service with
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:28.020]  them.
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:32.300]  But I'm happy to say I won't be in a contract with them soon.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:36.460]  Yeah, I'm out of I've not been in a contract with them for a while.
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:37.460]  That was the decision.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.520]  I made this decision, like a year.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:46.460]  Was it a year ago, or two years ago, I forget when but no, I think it was a year ago.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:52.240]  But we stopped buying phones on contract, even when our we had the option to do it and
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.940]  just right, pay the whole price.
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.380]  And we will pay you, you know, we have a family plan with Verizon.
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:03.420]  We'll just pay that and just keep it all on the up and up and pay up front.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:04.420]  Right.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:08.500]  I'm still in the because I've made a family plan and we signed it about we signed it when
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.700]  the six apps when the six came out.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:14.820]  So I'm still stuck in that contract.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.820]  Yeah.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:22.900]  So then hopefully, you know, we can go to the these new bucket data plans and be better.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:29.220]  Do you get do you get good Verizon signal at the journal's office?
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:37.220]  Yeah, I get pretty good signal for all in the office here when I'm on the sixth floor.
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:43.420]  When I'm in New York, I find that it is a block by block crapshoot as to whether I have
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:48.420]  cell signal and this is with my Verizon phone didn't that didn't used to be the case.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.700]  Maybe it's just the places in midtown where I tend to be.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:51.700]  I don't know.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:57.860]  But it's it's not necessarily bad, like like the way that AT&T used to be horrendous in
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.860]  New York.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:03.300]  I mean, like truly unusable, like can't believe can't believe this.
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:07.620]  Anybody even gets by with this service, which I don't think is true anymore.
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.940]  But it's not like that.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.860]  But it's definitely not like it is for me here in Philadelphia and Philadelphia.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:14.180]  I get pretty strong signal almost everywhere.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:20.380]  Yeah, I mean, the thing I've noticed about Verizon is maybe I don't have as many bars
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:24.840]  everywhere, like as many bars as I'd probably have with AT&T.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.940]  But I get like better service and pockets where there usually isn't service.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.180]  So like in the elevator, I always get service in my building with Verizon, it always drops
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.060]  with AT&T.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:40.180]  And also on the subways here on my subway route to work, I have Verizon service and
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.980]  not always AT&T.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.060]  Oh, see, that's different here in Philly and Philly, I think AT&T like bribed somebody
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:50.540]  and has like exclusive cell service in the subway.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.540]  Oh, really?
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.540]  Yeah.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.300]  So they even have like, the subway, I don't even know how I never even heard of such a
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.300]  thing.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:03.320]  But in Philadelphia, the sports complexes, you know, like where you'd go see the Phillies
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.800]  or the Eagles or the Sixers and Flyers, they're all right next to each other there.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.220]  And it's way down in South Philly at the end of the line, like you can't go, you just ride
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:17.100]  the subway south and right at the last stop, you get out.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:21.020]  And that subway station is named like AT&T station.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:25.820]  So like, yeah, but I think that part of the deal was the same in at where the where the
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.740]  Giants play in San Francisco.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.420]  What's the name of that?
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.420]  stadium?
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:31.420]  Levi's stadium?
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.420]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420]  Leave.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]  Oh, no, not that.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:35.420]  That's the 49ers.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.940]  That's a giant play at AT&T Park.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:38.940]  AT&T Park.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:39.940]  Yeah.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:41.820]  I wonder if it's the same there.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:42.820]  Yeah.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:46.460]  I wonder if they have like exclusive cell towers in the stadium.
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.460]  I don't know.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.460]  Yeah.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:56.620]  I mean, I don't know, we're gonna deal with the 5G, the competition for 5G next, so.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620]  When do you think that's coming?
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620]  I don't think so.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.260]  I don't pay attention to stuff like that.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:07.300]  I thought they've been saying 2016 some of the tests are going to happen.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:12.700]  I think Verizon's been saying tests happening in in 2016.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.220]  Oh, God.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:20.260]  Yeah, you know, these things happen in waves.
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:28.940]  It's going to be it'll be another fun year of more stuff that is promised the next year.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:32.220]  Let me take one break before we wrap up the show and I have one more sponsor to thank.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:35.580]  It is our good friends at Backblaze.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:41.740]  Backblaze does online backup for your Mac or your PC.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:48.100]  But let's face it, most people listening here are probably going to take the Mac version.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.280]  But if you have a PC, you could definitely get Backblaze for it.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.140]  You install their software.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.260]  You get a free trial.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:01.540]  Everything on your Mac just backs up to their cloud based servers, everything.
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:05.180]  You have an external drive, but that backs up to there's no limit.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:08.380]  You say, well, I have a three terabyte drive.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380]  It'll back up.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.380]  The whole thing might take longer.
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:15.500]  It will take longer because that's you know, there's no way to to make three terabytes
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:19.320]  upload quicker, but it'll happen eventually.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.880]  And once it's there, everything else is incremental.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.980]  And then you don't notice it.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.240]  You don't have to click a button.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.220]  You don't have to go in there and set up a schedule for when the backup happens.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.300]  Backblaze just runs automatically in the background silently.
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:40.220]  And as files change on your Mac, it just keeps it in sync with what's online.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.180]  Then what can you do after that when it's backed up?
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:49.460]  Well, if catastrophe strikes, if your computer breaks, if somebody steals your computer,
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:54.580]  you can go to Backblaze and you can order, for example, everything restored onto a USB
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:57.100]  drive and they will mail it to you.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.500]  You could just download everything if you want to.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:04.460]  Or what happens in twenty five percent of all of their restores from customers work
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:05.460]  this way.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:07.600]  You can just restore one file at a time.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:13.620]  So you can just log in from any computer anywhere, log into your Backblaze account, browse your
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:17.120]  entire Mac, all of your files and download one file.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.720]  If you just like find yourself in a situation where you know you have a file at home or
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.220]  on your office Mac, but you're not there right now and you don't have it with you, you can
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.220]  get it.
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.220]  They've got Android app.
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.220]  They've got an iPhone app.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:34.820]  So you can use these apps to access your account and get anything from your system anywhere
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.560]  you are, anywhere in the world.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560]  How much does this cost?
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.180]  It costs one hundred dollars a month.
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:41.180]  It sounds like it should.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.860]  No, it doesn't cost one hundred dollars a month.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.700]  It costs five bucks a month.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:46.920]  Five dollars.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.700]  You just have unlimited, un-throttled backup and I'm telling you, you sleep so much easier
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:57.820]  knowing that everything on your Mac is backed up somewhere outside of your desk, that it's
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.300]  just out there.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.580]  So great.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:06.220]  Go to Backblaze.com slash the talk show and they'll know you came from the show and you
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:09.940]  get a no risk, risk free, no credit card required trial.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.940]  Just go there and check it out.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:17.140]  Backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.280]  You see that the Zuckerberg's announced that they're going to give away ninety nine percent
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.940]  of their fortune.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.940]  I did.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.940]  I did.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:25.940]  I'm looking at it.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:27.860]  I was actually just looking at that article just because the baby picture.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.140]  I was really just looking at the baby picture.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.240]  They announced it coinciding with the birth of their first child.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.420]  It's a daughter.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.980]  It is an adorable picture.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.580]  I'm a sucker for babies.
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.580]  I know.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:42.580]  Me too.
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.580]  And I like the name too.
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:44.580]  Max.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:45.580]  For a girl.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:46.580]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.580]  Yeah.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:53.780]  And so they've announced in a letter to their daughter that they will be giving away ninety
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:56.780]  nine percent of their fortune, which is very noble.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.620]  I know like the Gates.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:03.300]  The Gates is I think have pledged to give away ninety five percent of their fortune.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.660]  And I know that the Gates Foundation already has like forty one billion dollars.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.860]  They've already given an enormous amount of money to fund their foundation because he's
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.620]  saying over his lifetime.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.620]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:20.500]  I think and at the start, he's saying he's going to give up to or donate up to a billion
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:27.540]  dollars in stock a year for the next three years.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:31.300]  And I guess part of that, again, to cycle back to Wealthfront, you know, that some of
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.180]  this stuff is like SEC mandated that if you're going to say if you're going to talk about
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:41.620]  stuff like this with a publicly traded company, you've got to, you know, announce it in advance.
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:47.460]  But I, you know, I think, you know, it's something that, again, another little bit of a theme
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:48.880]  of the year.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.180]  So nostalgic for the year.
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:55.300]  You know, I'm just like, I think I just want the year to be over so I can go on vacation.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:01.860]  But like, it's a socially conscious move by Zuckerberg, obviously, and a really important
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:02.860]  one.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.160]  But it's also like, you feel like that's a little bit of a change that's been happening
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.420]  in Silicon Valley, and especially, you know, at Tim Cook's Apple, more and more the way
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:12.180]  he's you're laughing.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:15.900]  I am laughing because I, I have a point to make here, but keep going.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.200]  But you know, it's definitely a change.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  It's a change, right?
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:25.940]  I mean, like, and I feel like also like coming out of, you know, Tim Cook's socially conscious
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:30.480]  Apple where, you know, when he spoke at our at our conference in October, he spent a lot
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.740]  of time talking about how, you know, it's Apple's job to make the world a better place,
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:40.380]  which is like, obviously, Apple's always thought about that as a fight through technology,
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:47.580]  but you got also the sense like he wants to do that, even just in his position of power,
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:53.140]  as the as the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world, if not the most powerful,
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.980]  richest company in the world.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:01.060]  You know, his message there was really impactful, I thought.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:07.100]  I find Tim Cook to be an incredibly sincere person.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:11.360]  And I actually think when you listen to him, especially when you really don't just read
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.380]  the transcript, but if you can actually see him talk on video, or like you said at a conference,
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:19.700]  and he just hear him talk.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.240]  There is a sincerity in his voice when he talks about things like that.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:29.420]  And I know he said it many times that in his office, he's got portraits of Martin Luther
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.700]  King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.860]  And when he talks about that, and he said it many times, and if you just read it, you
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:43.900]  might think that that's just the thing that he wants to say.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:47.760]  But when you hear him talk about that, he gets choked up in a way.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.940]  And when he talks about Apple's products, he doesn't sound as sincere.
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:56.580]  And I don't mean that he doesn't mean it, but he actually is less fired up and emotional
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:01.700]  when he's talking about, say, you know, how he traveled to Europe a couple weeks ago using
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:05.380]  with just his iPad Pro and his iPhone as his only devices.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.380]  And I think he did.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:09.940]  I really think he's the type of person where he wouldn't lie about that.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:14.380]  He wouldn't say that if it weren't true, if he secretly had a MacBook Pro in his hotel
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.380]  room.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.380]  He wouldn't say it.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.380]  I really think that's true.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:23.320]  But there's a certain rehearsed tone to his voice when he's talking about their products
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320]  like that.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.940]  And when he talks about the social stuff, you could see his blood start to boil a little.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:35.540]  No, I totally and actually, like, I actually just pulled up our live blog from the conference
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:41.100]  and I didn't summarize a lot, but I said, you know, it doesn't only sound like marketing
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.340]  speak when he is up there.
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:47.460]  He truly wants to make a push for human rights and making the world a better place.
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:54.460]  And I can't remember specifically the points he made, you know, but yes, I totally agree
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:46:01.260]  with you the way I came out of that interview where he was grilled on everything from the
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:08.140]  car to the iPad to the Apple TV and how he's going to, you know, put down the cable companies.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:14.100]  Just thinking, okay, this guy wants to mostly, though, make the world a better place and
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:19.300]  use Apple as, you know, as a technology company to help do that.
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:23.420]  So yeah, I think just like, you know, it's cheesy, but it does feel a little bit of a
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.420]  different vibe.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.060]  I don't know.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:31.900]  He's always had this reputation before he really became, you know, certainly, you know,
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:37.220]  when he became CEO, he obviously became the much, much more public, but he spoke on stage
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:40.020]  a few times before that.
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:44.740]  But he was, you know, a lot more of a mystery before he took over as CEO.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.220]  But he had a reputation as being fearsome, a fearsome negotiator, the sort of person
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:53.340]  who in a meeting, you know, even if it's just within the company that, you know, you better
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.460]  be prepared when you show up for a meeting with him or he's going to hand you your hat.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:03.220]  You know, you don't see that when he's on stage talking about Apple's products.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:06.340]  When he's talking about the products, he's very, very genial.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:10.600]  There is this, you know, this very friendly, courtly southern demeanor that comes out.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:17.260]  And it's funny because when he talks about these social issues, which is a much more,
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:29.100]  you know, the actual topic is humane, that's when I can sense the fearsome person that
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.740]  he can be.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:35.980]  It's like his frustrations with these social issues around the world boil to the surface
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.080]  and he can't hide it.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.820]  It doesn't come across as genial at all.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:42.860]  It comes across as, wow, I can see why people are scared of this guy.
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:43.860]  Yeah.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.860]  Yeah.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:49.900]  I mean, I think, and it was a year ago, I mean, it was actually a year ago right after
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:56.620]  our conference that he had come out, you know, and that letter, you know, which truly had
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:59.700]  absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he was the CEO of Apple.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:00.700]  I mean, it did.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:06.820]  It had a lot about, of course, it had, you know, to do with who he was, but, you know,
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:10.980]  that letter was just so well written and so heartfelt.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:21.420]  And, you know, that's a, you got a vision of who he was and, you know, after many people
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:26.860]  thought or as many people try to still explain who Jobs was, this guy's just doing it.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.540]  You know, he's just, he's putting it all out there.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.540]  Yeah.
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:40.020]  So, like you say, that this sort of social, I don't know how best to put it, but there's
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:48.860]  a change at the very top of the Silicon Valley industry to be socially minded with, and end
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:52.540]  up, you know, put your money where your mouth is and actually do things like pledge 99%
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:55.060]  of your fortune to these causes.
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.980]  It made me laugh when I laughed a couple of minutes ago because I was thinking that the
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:07.820]  old way is like the Larry Ellison way, which is to buy an island in Hawaii like a James
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:08.820]  Bond villain.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:09.820]  Right.
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:10.820]  This is all mine.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:11.820]  Right.
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:14.340]  And also I have a sailboat.
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.340]  Right.
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:24.660]  I've pledged my fortune to America's cups, you know, $500 million, you know, racing yacht,
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:25.660]  which I will be watching.
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:26.660]  Right.
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:27.660]  This is my yacht and you can look at it.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:38.820]  Well, this is my racing yacht, which I observe from my, you know, yacht yacht.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:44.240]  You can peek at my yacht through your small little phone screen, but I peek at my many
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:50.100]  yachts through my major window above 10 other yachts.
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:55.600]  So the other thing that made me laugh though is when I saw that the Zuckerbergs were pledging
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:03.260]  to give away 99% of their fortune, I thought, A, I thought, would I do that if I were in
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:10.820]  his position, if I had somehow if, you know, if Daring Fireball were worth as much as Zuckerberg's
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:16.220]  stake in Facebook, would I be willing to pledge to give 99% of it away?
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:19.020]  I would like to think that I would.
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:20.700]  I'm not sure that I would.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:24.620]  I feel like nobody can really say what they would do unless they were actually in that
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.620]  position to do it.
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:26.620]  I don't know that I would.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:32.220]  But then my second thought turned to what if I was young Max and my father had this
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.220]  fortune.
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:39.740]  How would I feel about him pledging to give it all away before I was even old enough to
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.620]  maybe make a counter argument?
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:48.320]  Why couldn't you have waited until I was even just a teenager and I could maybe articulate
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:51.700]  an argument that maybe we should dial that number back a bit?
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:52.700]  Yeah.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:59.280]  In 15 years when Max is looking at this Facebook post through his holographic VR Oculus headset
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:09.580]  that Zuckerberg has also made another $98 billion off of, he'll be like, Dad, I'm going
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:10.580]  to need that money.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:18.220]  I'm sorry, I keep referring it to, yeah, I'd love the name Max for a girl, but it's hard.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.220]  I do too.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.180]  Yeah, it's a good name for it.
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:22.180]  It's a great name.
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:27.120]  But I really do feel like if my parents had that sort of fortune, I really would have
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.020]  wished that they would have waited until... I'm not saying don't do it.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:36.860]  I'm just saying maybe hear my side of it before we decide what percentage of the fortune to
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.380]  give away.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:47.700]  I'm sure she will have plenty of money to live comfortably very, very, very comfortably.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:53.700]  I totally realize that when you're talking about truly outsized fortunes like Zuckerberg's
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:52:02.580]  stake in Facebook and what Gates still owns in Microsoft, that 1% is truly still a monumental
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:03.980]  fortune.
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:10.340]  I'm just saying it may not be buy your own island in Hawaii from Larry Ellison's fortune,
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:13.660]  which I really do kind of see the appeal of.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.300]  Well, I think they live in Palo Alto.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.160]  God knows.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.380]  We don't know what will happen to the property value there.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:24.380]  Right.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.380]  You might need by the time-
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.380]  We just don't know.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:28.260]  Actually, we do know.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:35.620]  By the time Max Zuckerberg is an adult, she might need a billion or $2 to buy a regular
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:38.140]  sized house in Palo Alto.
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.500]  Probably.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:44.020]  Probably just a small little portion of a yard in Palo Alto.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:48.140]  I don't know enough about... Well, I do know enough about what's been going on in the San
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:51.260]  Francisco Valley real estate market.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:58.700]  But yeah, certainly, I know there's been a lot of scrutiny about the way he set it up.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:04.420]  It's an LLC versus it being actually a charitable organization or... I don't know.
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:09.260]  I know there's been scrutiny today, but I just kind of just thought it was great news
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.260]  yesterday.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:12.860]  Wait, what was the... Oh, the Zuckerberg news.
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:14.900]  Yeah, the Zuckerberg news.
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.500]  You know how our industry works.
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:18.500]  Right.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:24.240]  I'm actually not on that side of the industry where I cover really any of that, frankly,
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:27.620]  so I just read the articles and move on.
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:31.180]  Yeah, same here, and then I make jokes.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:32.180]  Right.
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.180]  About.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:42.020]  One last thing that is in the news is, before we sign off, is that there's so much news
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:46.020]  about it, so much speculation that it seems like it's going to happen that Yahoo is going
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:55.620]  to spin off and sell off a bunch of its units, and I can't help but think that's a good thing,
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:01.420]  but it really makes me think, just big picture, what is Yahoo?
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:04.140]  Like I don't... You know what I mean?
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:09.180]  It's so easy to compare it with Google or AKA Alphabet, which I still find difficult
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:13.720]  to wrap my head around, and I realize that that's not one thing, but I still... I kind
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:20.420]  of get the company, like I get it what Alphabet... I'm going to call them Google, the hell
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.140]  with it, but I get what Google does.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:28.560]  I get that they have this amazing search engine, which to me is still, arguably, it might be
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:32.780]  the greatest invention in the history of the industry, is Google web search.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.940]  I know that I give Google a lot of crap on Daring Fireball a lot of the time, and people
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:42.660]  think I'm sort of... Because I tend to like Apple stuff, and I tend to be a little bit
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:45.320]  more cynical about Google stuff.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:49.460]  When I just look at the broad picture of everything that we have at our fingertips today, like
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:54.660]  if you could go... If Ben Franklin time traveled and came here today, what's the first thing
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.660]  you would show him?
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:58.920]  I might show him Google, like that there's this box where you can just type whatever
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:04.060]  you want into, and maybe I have to explain typing to him first, but I think he'd get
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.060]  it.
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.060]  But that you can just print these-
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:10.420]  I think you'd have to explain the computer first, the phone.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:14.060]  The device first, that's so amazing to think about.
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:19.500]  But it's truly, from our childhoods, it's truly still a piece of science fiction that
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:24.380]  we have that you could just type natural language questions to and get the answer.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.620]  It's truly amazing.
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:30.300]  I get that they have this, and that they make money from it with the ads that they show
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:35.500]  on it, and that it's billions of people around the world using it, so therefore tons of money.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:42.280]  I get their moonshots in terms of that they're banking on things that might become huge.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:48.660]  If they have a self-driving car platform that can be to cars what Android is to phones,
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.940]  that's tremendous.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:51.940]  I get it.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:53.180]  I don't get Yahoo.
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:56.900]  I don't get what it... Why do people go to Yahoo anymore?
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:57.900]  I don't get it.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.900]  I don't think they do.
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:06.660]  I know they do, but they do because they're older and they know it, or it's already preloaded
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:09.580]  on their computers?
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:10.580]  That's why, right?
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:11.580]  I don't know.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.580]  Are there other reasons?
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.580]  I don't know.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.580]  I honestly- Are their email?
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.300]  Their email was there from many, many years ago?
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.980]  That's why people still go to AOL.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.420]  The side of it that you and I don't do, you're a product person.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:29.780]  You write from the, hey, how do you... What do you want to get?
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.060]  I'm a product person.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:32.620]  I write about how do you use this stuff.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620]  We don't write the business stuff.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.620]  I review services.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.140]  I do tons of services stuff.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:41.740]  I can't remember the last time I've recommended a Yahoo service.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:42.740]  That's what I mean.
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:43.740]  I've looked at them.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.740]  I've looked at them.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.780]  Even I gave Flickr a very... Flickr still has some great things.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:52.020]  I gave it a really fair shake in the photo comparisons earlier this year when it was
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:57.980]  Google Photos and Apple Photos and it wasn't as good.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:00.180]  People don't think about that anymore when they think Yahoo.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.180]  They don't think about the services on their phone.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:07.200]  It's covered as a business story, right?
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:13.460]  It's the business reporters talking about this and with Wall Street pressure on it and
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:18.940]  Kara Swisher has tremendous sources at Yahoo and it's the intrigue and speculation as to
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:23.800]  how much support does Marissa Mayer still have from the board and that sort of thing.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.980]  Looking at it from my perspective is just what's cool and what is good to use and what
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:35.180]  would I recommend to people who follow me and look to me for advice or something like
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:40.420]  that or what would be interesting for me to write about because it's such a cool thing.
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:45.860]  I can't remember the last time that anything that Yahoo was involved with even hit my whatever
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:50.940]  parts of my brain light up when I see something cool.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.340]  I guess the last time was when I...
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:58.820]  I mean, wasn't... Yahoo's not powering the weather anymore on the weather app in Iowa?
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.820]  No.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.460]  No, I don't think so.
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:07.580]  I think they switched to the weather channel because they got... I think I had better
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.980]  worldwide service or something.
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:11.620]  Yeah.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:19.420]  That would have been the only Yahoo service I probably used every day since whatever... since
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.100]  using Yahoo as a search engine 15 years ago.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:28.060]  The iOS stocks app still is based on Yahoo data.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:29.060]  Okay.
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:32.460]  I mean, so that's one thing they have on the phone.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:33.460]  That's something.
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:42.380]  They were really like, Yahoo picks up my videos.
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:51.460]  Yahoo... I get a lot of video views on Yahoo, so thank you for that Yahoo.
[01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:57.620]  I don't get it and I feel like... and again, maybe it's just me being obsessed with my
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:06.340]  perspective on things, but I just feel like all of this business side speculation on what
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.420]  Yahoo should do or whatever has got it all backwards and that it really has to start
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:11.780]  with products.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:16.820]  If there's anything I'm disappointed in Marissa Meyer for is I really kind of had hoped that
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:22.220] ... from what I knew of her beforehand, that she was product focused and I really thought
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:25.740]  that she would bring that to Yahoo, but it just doesn't seem like she has.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.660]  I think she did.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.420]  I think she really... I mean, if you think about when some of the big attention that
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:37.860]  she had gotten when she first started was a flicker, a big flicker redesign, she spoke
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:38.860]  at that.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:46.580]  I remember I interviewed her after the new flicker redesign and she introduced it and
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:51.120]  that was like a couple months after she took over and then there was a new email thing.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.120]  She was involved in that.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.900]  I remember that and then I don't remember anything else.
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:56.900]  Yeah.
[01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:01.060]  Or at least she tried to at first, but it's like as the years have gone on, it just doesn't
[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.060]  seem like that's happened.
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:03.060]  Yeah.
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.060]  I don't know if I could share the story.
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:05.060]  Maybe.
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:06.060]  Actually, this is funny.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.060]  I'm going to share it.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:08.060]  I got an email.
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:09.060]  I was always on this podcast.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:11.780]  I'm like, I feel... I mean, this is what's amazing about your podcast.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:15.860]  Feels like just talking to you and you really don't think about that hundreds of... you
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:18.780]  probably have thousands and thousands of viewers, listeners.
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:21.180]  I mean, I know you're-
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.180]  I haven't looked in a while.
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.180]  I probably should.
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:24.180]  I think it's somewhere around-
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.180]  There's a lot of them.
[02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:27.180] ... 70,000 to 80,000 to listen to most of those things.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:28.180]  Yeah.
[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.180]  That's crazy.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.180]  But I sometimes forget that they're old.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:31.180]  Yeah.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.180]  Says the woman who... wait.
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:36.660]  Says the woman who writes for a newspaper with a circulation of what?
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.660]  I mean, the journal's-
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.660]  Three million or something.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.660]  Yeah.
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:42.460]  I was going to say, the journal, the last I checked, has a daily circulation of three
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:43.460]  million.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:47.740]  Well, this just feels like we're more intimate here.
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.740]  They cut all my words.
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.820]  But the... so I got an email.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:58.900]  I had someone who used to work for me and they were applying for a job at Yahoo and
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:04.640]  they sent... they want me to give some feedback and reference stuff.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.820]  And in the email it said, Marissa Mayer is going to be looking over this.
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.900]  And I thought to myself, that is really sad.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:20.620]  Why is Marissa Mayer looking over a tech reporting position here?
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.720]  I don't have anything... I mean, I had a lot of nice things to say about this person
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:29.580]  who used to work with me, but I just thought... I wrote something really sarcastic back
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:36.020]  to the recruiter, too, and I wonder if Marissa Mayer ever did read my review of that single
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:39.940]  tech review where they were going to hire.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:40.940]  I don't know.
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:41.940]  Not a very interesting story.
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:44.300]  I don't know if I should have... I shared the story.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.300]  That's fine.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:47.380]  But she definitely has a reputation as a micromanager.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.380]  Right.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:57.820]  That's such an overused term, but as somebody who would do something like that and get involved
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:04.420]  in the wanting to approve... I've heard that story before.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:09.660]  I have heard that at Yahoo that she wanted approval over, I don't know, almost everybody
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:13.280]  who got hired anywhere that at some point... and it became like a gating factor because
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.260]  obviously she's busy and you want to hire somebody for a certain team and all of a sudden
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:24.460]  it's... it's almost like what developers go through with the app store where your app
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.920] ... you just want to fix a bug.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:28.740]  You just want to hire somebody to do this and in the meantime it's like a seven-day
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:35.340]  wait before it percolates to the top of her inbox and she can look at it.
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:42.940]  Yeah, I mean... and I know there was a big... she had a big focus on the new Yahoo news
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:49.500]  that was another big product launch that she was very involved in and that's actually a
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:52.780]  huge part of their operation and actually... this is really how I think of them when
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:55.700]  I think about it because I know a number of people in the media industry have gone to
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:56.700]  work for them.
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:03.180]  A lot of anchors, a lot of on-air talent from TV networks have gone to work for them.
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.580]  David Pogue.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.580]  David Pogue, of course, and they've built a good team over there.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:11.060]  Yeah, I guess that is...
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:14.580]  I don't think... but that's not enough.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:19.140]  Yeah, it's not enough to make them as big as they are.
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:28.260]  Right, or to be as in the ring with Google and Apple and Facebook and Microsoft.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:35.740]  Yeah, I totally agree, but yet somehow it feels to me like there's a potential there
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:37.740]  that they could be.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:39.740]  Yeah.
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:47.380]  But that's... again, when you think about... when I think about what's been going on
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:54.700]  with the big players in tech and products, Apple, Google, Microsoft, I don't really consider
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:55.700]  Facebook.
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:04:00.140]  Facebook's in there, obviously, and then the other big companies, but when you think about
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:08.900]  the year, a lot of it was... there wasn't necessarily anything majorly new.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:12.660]  Everyone's trying to compete to do a lot of the same things.
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:14.260]  Who can do it better?
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:18.540]  Who can also do it more securely and more private, give us more privacy?
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:22.140]  That was a big source of the competition this year.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:28.300]  Certainly Apple wanted to play to that, but when you think about where the real innovation
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:35.180]  or developments happened this year, it wasn't that kind of year, and what is going to be
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:39.300]  that sort of future for some of these companies?
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:41.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:44.460]  VR or VR is going to be an interesting one.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:52.940]  Yeah, this was the year of watches becoming a real thing.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:53.940]  Everybody is...
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:56.620]  But even then, was it a huge thing?
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:02.500]  I don't think so, not yet, but it's obviously... that's a real thing that they're racing
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.500]  to do.
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:08.940]  The next... I think VR is definitely the next big thing, because I think the technology
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:15.780]  is very close, and there's... unlike cars, there aren't regulatory and legal hurdles
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.780]  to be passed.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:22.500]  The cars thing, everybody is working on, but it's so complicated and requires laws to be
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:29.980]  rewritten, and just so much stuff that's going to have to happen in public that it's years
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:30.980]  out.
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:35.860]  The next year thing is probably a next year thing.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:39.620]  It was such a year of refinement, and it's not a bad thing.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:41.260]  I don't want to whine about it.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:44.080]  I don't want to be like, nothing happened.
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:49.140]  It was such a great year for products that were already good becoming great.
[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:54.700]  When I look at the iPhone, it was already such a near perfect phone.
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:59.620]  I think it could still be a little bit more perfect, as I wrote in my review, but this
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:04.540]  is the device, and our smartphones are the things that power so many of the other parts
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:06.640]  of our lives now.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.820]  They're just great.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:12.900]  That's what's happening with computing, too.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:19.220]  We want our computers and our laptops and our tablets to be even better and more like
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:22.220]  some of the mobile devices we've had.
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:25.180]  We want our mobile devices to be more like our PCs.
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:26.180]  Right.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:29.940]  It's just like a year of more refinement, I think.
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.540]  Again, I don't want to whine about it.
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:42.460]  I think that the fact that it's sort of like a refinement, it's created the thing that
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:51.180]  we talked about earlier, which is that it's made it harder to decide what to buy because
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:56.440]  now that you can buy something like the iPad Pro, which really can be more of a laptop,
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:01.580]  but now that you can buy a laptop like the regular MacBook that's as thin and light as
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:08.980]  an iPad or something like the Surface devices, it just blurs the line.
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:14.860]  The fact that different things are way better on a giant-sized iPad Pro, but other things
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:21.020]  are still better on an iPad Mini, but it really doesn't make sense to tell somebody, well,
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.820]  you should buy three iPads.
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.660]  I think you should live the John Gruber life.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:29.860]  Buy three iPads.
[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:33.180]  Live with three iPads and a small iPhone.
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:36.580]  One in every pocket and one in every compartment of your backpack.
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:40.220]  Okay, my last question to you, because I didn't ask you any.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:46.820]  What are you... Okay, I'm going to ask about the iPhone then because I think most excited
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:54.140]  about in 2016 for the iPhone.
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:56.080]  What am I most excited about?
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.080]  What am I hoping for?
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.780]  Yeah, I think what are you hoping for for the iPhone?
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.980]  I wasn't saying general for the next year, but I specifically want to ask you about the
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:05.100]  iPhone.
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:06.100]  It's interesting.
[02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:12.340]  I know that there's rumors that are already out, like the one last week about the no headphone
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:17.940]  jack, which it's weird if it comes true and it'll be a minor headache, but in the grand
[02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:19.620]  scheme of things, it's not a big deal.
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:23.440]  I find it interesting that there doesn't seem to be any specific rumors about what's coming
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.900]  yet.
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:35.620]  I guess my biggest hope is that it's a truly revolutionary upgrade on the camera, that
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:43.740]  it really takes a step towards being able to stand toe-to-toe with an SLR type camera,
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:45.140]  not just point and shoots.
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:55.840]  I feel like point and shoots have been taken out, but can we get an iPhone that stands
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:00.940]  up to a $1,000 standalone camera in terms of image quality and depth of field and stuff
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:04.300]  like that?
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:05.300]  Something like that.
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:10.620]  I heard a while back that, and I know Apple bought this, some company, or there's a patent
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:15.780]  that's out there or something, but these ideas of use, and other people are doing stuff like
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:22.220]  this, but having two camera lenses and side-by-side and that it can do some kind of magic when
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:29.140]  you take a picture by combining two images and that that's the way that a device as thin
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:36.340]  as an iPhone might be able to stand up to a truly big camera with a really big piece
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:40.900]  of glass as the lens and a significant distance.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:45.660]  That would be my biggest hope is that it's all about the camera, but I say that just
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.240]  purely from my own selfish what I hope they do.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:52.180]  This has nothing to do with anything that I have heard is coming.
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:53.180]  What about you?
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:56.020]  What would you hope for?
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:00.120]  I wrote this in my review of the 6S.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.820]  The thing that bothers me the most about my phone is battery life and having to worry
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.820]  about it.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:16.180]  I would be really happy if they started to discuss or work in wireless charging, but
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:22.420]  I just don't feel like the solutions out there right now are very Apple.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:26.020]  The biggest thing that people keep talking about with this and that ties into the removal
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:27.020]  of the headphone jack.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:30.420]  The biggest thing people are complaining about with that is that they frequently want to
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:35.540]  listen to audio while they charge their phone like you're sitting on the train or on an
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:40.820]  airplane or something like that and you have your phone is 40 percent.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:45.740]  If you can charge it, but you're sitting there on the train or wherever you are, my son does
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.740]  this all the time.
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:50.780]  Jonas is all of his devices are under 20 percent at all times.
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:57.700]  He's always watching YouTube with his headphones on while he's charging his device.
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:00.660]  If they went to wireless charging, that would solve it.
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:06.380]  If there was an Apple Watch type thing that could connect it to the Apple logo or something
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:10.700]  on the back of your phone, then it solves the problem where you have the lightning jack
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:14.780]  for your headphones and you can wirelessly charge.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:20.700]  The big problem with the wireless, I've tested a lot of these, I did this big piece on chargers
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.700]  last week.
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:24.940]  It was actually thrilling in a way.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:31.720]  I tested all these USB wall chargers, but it was that all these wireless solutions are
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.940]  just really slow.
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:37.980]  It takes a long time to go from zero to 50 percent with many of these.
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:38.980]  Right.
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:42.860]  The watch gets away with it because the watch has just a teeny tiny battery.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:43.860]  Exactly.
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:44.860]  Yeah.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:48.740]  It'll be interesting.
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:50.980]  I could see that.
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:58.260]  If there's a second thing that I would like to see, it would be a rejiggering of their
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:02.980]  priorities on how much battery life the phone should get.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:08.060]  It's very clear that what they've done, because the battery life doesn't get worse year to
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:11.740]  year with iPhone, but it stays the same unless you switch to the plus.
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:18.020]  They just keep making it thinner and using the efficiencies of their newer technology.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:21.740]  They keep making the device thinner and keeping the battery life the same.
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:30.180]  I would love it if they effectively decided to multiply the battery life you expect by
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:31.580]  one and a half.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:36.300]  And obviously this year they did a lot of it through iOS 9 and software improvements.
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:43.020]  Actually, watchOS 2, I've noticed the battery life being better on this thing, but it seems
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:45.980]  like that's only going to get them so far.
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:46.980]  Yeah.
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:54.460]  I would like to see them, like with the iPad, I almost said iPod there.
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:56.200]  They've long said 10 hours of battery life.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.260]  You get 10 hours of battery life from an iPad.
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:07.460]  I would love for them to just sort of really double or like 1.5 the number that they tell
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:11.700]  you you can get from an iPhone and then engineer it from there.
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:19.180]  Whether that means keeping the device as thin as it is now or using new technology or something
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:20.180]  like that.
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:21.860]  But I don't think that'll happen though.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.860]  I would bet against that.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:29.780]  I think Apple is very much interested in chasing down SLR quality photography.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:34.260]  So I feel like whether they'll do it next year or not, at least my hopes are in alignment
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:38.820]  with Apple's institutional priorities.
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:43.900]  My hope for battery life though, does not seem to be in alignment with their institutional
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:44.900]  priorities.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:48.820]  Their institutional priorities I think are still hyper-focused on thinness.
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:49.820]  Yeah.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:50.820]  Yeah.
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:51.820]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:54.820]  I agree with you there.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:57.140]  Well, we shall see.
[02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:58.140]  All right.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:00.140]  I'm going to go on vacation first.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:01.140]  That's great.
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.140]  I can't wait.
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:03.140]  Oh, no, wait.
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:04.140]  I'm not going.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.140]  You're not going.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.140]  Well, congratulations and enjoy your vacation.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:09.820]  Joanna Stern, thank you so much.
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:12.500]  Vacation to CES.
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:13.500]  I've never been.
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.820]  Have we ever talked about this?
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:17.540]  I think we did and I still can't believe it.
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.860]  How have you never been?
[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:19.860]  I love Vegas.
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:22.200]  I love gadgets and I've never been to CES.
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.100]  It's long story short, it's because-
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.100]  So we're opposite.
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:27.260]  I hate Vegas, but I love gadgets.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:28.260]  Right.
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:30.260]  Long story short, it's because-
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.220]  I really hate it there.
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:37.660]  It's because it used to be immediately after Mac World Expo and I did go to Mac World Expo
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:43.940]  and there was no way that I was going to do two of those things back-to-back.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:51.420]  So I just never ever developed any kind of tradition of going to CES.
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:55.400]  Any time it's ever occurred to me to maybe, maybe I should, maybe just one year I should
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:05.060]  go and write about and podcast what it's like for an Apple-focused person to go to this,
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:08.780]  more or less this consumer electronic show that is everything that's not Apple in the
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:09.780]  industry.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.780]  Here's what's coming.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:12.980]  But actually everything is around Apple.
[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:15.500]  It's, well, more and more.
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:16.500]  Yeah.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:22.060]  Well, I mean, you keep doing what you do best, which is comment on the non-Apple stuff, but
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:27.620]  always pretty much it has been the last couple of years, there's always some strong Apple
[02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:31.620]  rumor that seems to come out around CES.
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:34.580]  Yeah, it is true.
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:35.580]  Remember last year?
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:40.080]  Last year at CES there was this big rumor about what the MacBook was going to, the MacBook
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:46.820]  Air, what ultimately ended up being the MacBook with the Air successor was going to look like.
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:47.820]  Yeah.
[02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:49.540]  I don't know.
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:50.540]  Yeah.
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:54.260]  They always somehow try to take the Air out of whatever else is going on.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.260]  Right?
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:56.260]  Yeah.
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:58.860]  Or maybe the leaks just come around then, I don't know.
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:05.380]  So I would expect, here's my guess is that this year's CES is going to be, the story's
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:08.100]  going to be all about virtual reality, I think.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:09.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.100]  That's my guess.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:17.140]  And would it be shocking if a rumor leaked right before CES that Apple has a team working
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:18.140]  on VR?
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:19.140]  Yeah.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:20.140]  And that's it.
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:21.860]  There's nothing else except that.
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:32.980]  That would not surprise me one bit if a rumor like that was floated to say one of the reporters
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:36.060]  at the Wall Street Journal probably or something like that.
[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:38.060]  Wouldn't surprise me one bit.
[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:44.380]  But anyway, when it occurs to me that maybe I should go to CES, it's always too late.
[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:46.420]  Right now I think it's too late.
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:48.660]  All the hotels are booked up.
[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:54.300]  It's the sort of thing you have to plan in advance, and I'm not good at that.
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.300]  Right.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:56.300]  Yeah.
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:57.820]  Well, I would say you don't really need to come.
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.780]  I would love to podcast with you from there.
[02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:00.780]  Yeah.
[02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:03.860]  You could do a little video thing.
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:08.960]  It's pretty much... I love CES because it is this time of the year where everyone gets
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.460]  really excited about gadgets.
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:15.340]  And my favorite thing was Neelai last year wrote this piece, or they wrote a piece on
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:18.780]  The Verge where it was like, gadgets are back, and getting really people excited for CES.
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:23.260]  And it was like, that's what I do all year.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:25.260]  Good thing I have a job again this year.
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:32.780]  But it gets people really excited about what's going to come, and then actually it all tapers
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:36.500]  down and when you actually review the products that came out at CES, no one really cares.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:43.420]  But there is always the excitement around CES.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:49.640]  People can read your work at the Wall Street Journal.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:52.820]  That's the wsj.com.
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:57.860]  To get to the section that you guys do, what's the web address for that?
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:58.860]  wsjd.com.
[02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:05.980]  wsjd.com takes you right to the Wall Street Journal digital team.
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:10.620]  And on Twitter, you are at Joanna Stern.
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:14.000]  I am.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Thank you so much, Joanna.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.500]  It was good to be here.
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:20.500]  We finally made it work.
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:24.820]  We didn't talk about my favorite thing, the BlackBerry, but I will come back to talk about
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:25.820]  that the next time.
[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:26.820]  All right.
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.820]  Do you think they'll still be in business next time?
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:33.540]  Yes, they have the new Android phone, and I gave it a pretty decent review.
[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:40.660]  I well, we'll see.
[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:41.660]  We will see.
[02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:44.300]  I mean, what holds them back?
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:48.060]  They can just be another Android phone maker.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.060]  Maybe.
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.940]  I think that's I think that ship has sailed though.
[02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:54.940]  I think that they if they had done that, I think wasn't that what you wrote in your review?
[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:59.800]  I think that if they had shipped that phone four years ago.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:03.940]  Hopefully that is what I wrote in my review, but I am always holding on.
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.940]  Okay, third stand up thing going to go.
[02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:33.480]  Bye bye.
