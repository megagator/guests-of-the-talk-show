[00:00.000 --> 00:02.420]  Is this the show, this is the show?
[00:02.420 --> 00:03.260]  It could be.
[00:03.260 --> 00:04.100]  Whatever.
[00:04.100 --> 00:04.920]  I'm rolling.
[00:04.920 --> 00:05.760]  I think this is the show.
[00:05.760 --> 00:06.600]  Why not?
[00:08.220 --> 00:10.640]  It's just, it's the silly Apple season.
[00:10.640 --> 00:13.760]  And again, it feels like we've had
[00:13.760 --> 00:15.460]  a year's worth of news, right?
[00:15.460 --> 00:18.220]  And it's like, I don't know, there's more coming.
[00:18.220 --> 00:21.020]  Including clearly the two most interesting iPhones.
[00:21.020 --> 00:24.780]  Which, again, I have wrote a lot, a lot about the,
[00:24.780 --> 00:28.400]  I know it's bad, my iPhone reviews tend to be long.
[00:28.400 --> 00:32.700]  And I knew I had a lot to say about the event
[00:32.700 --> 00:35.120]  before I even wrote about the reviews.
[00:35.120 --> 00:36.700]  And my thoughts on the event
[00:36.700 --> 00:38.420]  and just the stuff that they announced.
[00:38.420 --> 00:40.880]  So it's like, and then when you get these review units,
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.440]  you have an embargo and you're not allowed
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.280]  to write about them until the embargo passes.
[00:44.280 --> 00:46.960]  And my thoughts on the event were taking me so long
[00:46.960 --> 00:49.960]  that I had already gotten the review units.
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.200]  And so I had to be careful that my,
[00:53.200 --> 00:56.220]  you know, because I don't think Apple's
[00:56.220 --> 00:58.220]  gonna take me to court.
[00:58.220 --> 01:00.800]  If like, information I could only know,
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.860]  could only glean from having started using them
[01:03.860 --> 01:08.860]  worked its way into, you know, the pre-embargo piece.
[01:08.880 --> 01:10.440]  But, you know, you wanna play by the rules,
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.000]  you know, it's being honest.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.960]  Yeah, you could maybe be informed by some of the things.
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.640]  Like, you could have it confirm a suspicion,
[01:17.640 --> 01:18.720]  but you can't go beyond that.
[01:18.720 --> 01:20.520]  Like, I didn't get the iPhones in advance,
[01:20.520 --> 01:21.680]  but I got the iPad Air in advance.
[01:21.680 --> 01:23.220]  And it was like, suffice it to say,
[01:23.220 --> 01:25.920]  I had some opinions about the A14
[01:25.920 --> 01:28.680]  that were informed by the fact that I had one, right?
[01:28.680 --> 01:31.680]  Even though I didn't have a phone, I had a device with it.
[01:31.680 --> 01:33.520]  But yeah, you wanna play fair with all of that.
[01:33.520 --> 01:36.240]  But I really wanted to get some stuff off my chest
[01:36.240 --> 01:38.440]  that you, I felt like I could write,
[01:38.440 --> 01:39.940]  I could write about the pricing.
[01:39.940 --> 01:42.320]  I had a lot of thoughts to say about the pricing.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.400]  And the charger being in the box,
[01:46.400 --> 01:48.440]  which is just sort of related to pricing,
[01:48.440 --> 01:49.560]  because let's face it, you know,
[01:49.560 --> 01:51.460]  everybody's making the same point that Apple says,
[01:51.460 --> 01:53.240]  hey, this is great for the environment.
[01:53.240 --> 01:54.360]  And a lot of people are saying,
[01:54.360 --> 01:57.920]  no, this is about cheaping out on the charger.
[01:57.920 --> 01:59.960]  And the truth is, it's both, right?
[01:59.960 --> 02:02.600]  It is both clearly cheaper.
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.500]  However much it costs Apple to make all the chargers
[02:06.500 --> 02:09.960]  that they put in a box and to make bigger boxes
[02:09.960 --> 02:11.920]  and to ship those boxes,
[02:11.920 --> 02:14.440]  it is clearly cheaper to do it without.
[02:14.440 --> 02:16.080]  But it's also better for the environment
[02:16.080 --> 02:18.500]  if people only buy chargers they actually need.
[02:18.500 --> 02:20.180]  So it's both true.
[02:20.180 --> 02:22.320]  But I wanted to get that out of the way
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.320]  before I actually wrote the official iPhone 12 review
[02:27.960 --> 02:30.160]  so that, because I knew I had so much to say.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.840]  And I know it's bad when I feel like,
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.420]  hey, I have a lot of thoughts about this.
[02:34.420 --> 02:37.280]  Because sometimes I think, hey, this one's gonna be short.
[02:37.280 --> 02:39.200]  And it's still long.
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.240]  When I feel like it's gonna be long when I start,
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.060]  I know it's gonna be trouble.
[02:43.060 --> 02:45.560]  And I kept thinking as I was trying to like
[02:45.560 --> 02:47.840]  bring it home and wrap it up,
[02:47.840 --> 02:50.320]  these are not the two most interesting iPhones of the year.
[02:50.320 --> 02:51.720]  These are the two that,
[02:51.720 --> 02:53.000]  not that they're not interesting,
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.060]  but they're not the most interesting.
[02:55.060 --> 02:55.900]  Yeah.
[02:55.900 --> 02:56.720]  No, I think you're right.
[02:56.720 --> 02:58.940]  The outliers, I got to the end of my review
[02:58.940 --> 03:01.720]  and it was like, to be continued almost.
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.740]  Because these are the,
[03:04.740 --> 03:07.400]  I would say the two models that we have
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.840]  are the ones that will sell the best.
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.820]  But they're also, not only are they kind of boring
[03:13.820 --> 03:16.880]  because they're so similar to what's come before
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.480]  and they're not the weird outliers
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.660]  that have fascinating quirks about them,
[03:21.660 --> 03:25.680]  but also they're so much like one another
[03:25.680 --> 03:28.720]  in a way that last year the 11 and 11 Pro weren't.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.980]  So that they're even more similar.
[03:30.980 --> 03:32.760]  So it's fascinating because I would say
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.560]  the 12 and the 12 Pro are the two most important iPhones.
[03:36.560 --> 03:38.640]  But are they the most interesting?
[03:38.640 --> 03:39.920]  No, they're not.
[03:39.920 --> 03:40.760]  They're not.
[03:40.760 --> 03:43.640]  And it's just a strange thing to have to deal with
[03:43.640 --> 03:44.480]  when you're writing about them.
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.880]  And we'll get to them later in the show
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.640]  in the official iPhone 12 segment.
[03:49.640 --> 03:50.480]  Okay.
[03:50.480 --> 03:53.440]  But I will say this just up front.
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.360]  Do you think strategically that Apple,
[03:58.360 --> 04:00.880]  how much of this timing of the release of these phones?
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.000]  I mean, clearly the whole thing is a little bit late
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  compared to usual because of all the delays from COVID-19.
[04:10.500 --> 04:11.980]  I mean, Apple has even said so, right?
[04:11.980 --> 04:15.040]  They said so in July or three months ago
[04:15.040 --> 04:16.160]  in the last earnings.
[04:16.160 --> 04:19.380]  They were like, look, our usual schedule's disrupted.
[04:19.380 --> 04:21.200]  New phones this year will be a little late.
[04:21.200 --> 04:23.960]  And it's extraordinary for them to even acknowledge
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.400]  what everybody expects to be true,
[04:25.400 --> 04:27.000]  that there are new phones, right?
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.340]  Like that's part of it.
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.600]  Everybody knows Apple's secretive.
[04:29.600 --> 04:31.520]  But they're so secretive and they're just tight.
[04:31.520 --> 04:32.360]  It's not even secretive.
[04:32.360 --> 04:35.000]  They're just so tight-lipped that officially
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.200]  they don't even acknowledge
[04:37.200 --> 04:40.480]  that they plan to release new phones.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.840]  Like the official Apple party line each year
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.520]  until invitations go out for the September event,
[04:49.520 --> 04:52.120]  until the moment that they send press invitations,
[04:52.120 --> 04:55.880]  their official line is last year's iPhones
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.640]  are our iPhones and they're our best iPhones ever.
[04:58.640 --> 04:59.480]  Yeah, you don't know.
[04:59.480 --> 05:01.200]  Maybe we have no more phones.
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.080]  Maybe this is it.
[05:02.080 --> 05:03.560]  Right.
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.040]  So how much of it do you think is like,
[05:08.920 --> 05:13.920]  I think that in 2017, the extreme delay of the iPhone 10
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.000]  was just that they were so pressing themselves
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.400]  on the limits of what they could make.
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.660]  Like their first OLED screen and first edge-to-edge thing
[05:24.660 --> 05:27.840]  and so many, and Face ID and all this new stuff.
[05:27.840 --> 05:30.480]  And it didn't ship until November,
[05:30.480 --> 05:32.600]  really late compared to the iPhone's 8,
[05:32.600 --> 05:35.560]  which were really just a very linear
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.400]  evolution of the iPhone 7,
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.360]  which is the iPhone 6 that's in the iPhone 6.
[05:42.360 --> 05:44.980]  The next year, it was the opposite,
[05:44.980 --> 05:49.440]  where the XS and XS Pro shipped
[05:49.440 --> 05:52.400]  more or less on what you would think is the usual schedule
[05:52.400 --> 05:54.320]  a couple of weeks after the event.
[05:54.320 --> 05:57.880]  And it was the iPhone XR that was late.
[05:57.880 --> 05:59.320]  Right.
[05:59.320 --> 06:03.840]  And then last year, they got their crap together
[06:03.840 --> 06:07.480]  and everything, the iPhone 11 and the 11's Pro
[06:07.480 --> 06:09.200]  all shipped on September 20th.
[06:09.200 --> 06:14.160]  So it's been different every year.
[06:14.160 --> 06:16.040]  This year, obviously, there's COVID.
[06:17.480 --> 06:20.440]  So barring the initial delay of COVID,
[06:20.440 --> 06:22.760]  do you think that they wanted to ship all four at once
[06:22.760 --> 06:25.760]  or they always planned, even if this year had 2020,
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.600]  if everybody thought,
[06:26.600 --> 06:30.860]  boy, 2020 is the most normal, boring year of mankind,
[06:31.960 --> 06:34.320]  do you think that they would have still shipped these
[06:34.320 --> 06:36.080]  on a delayed schedule?
[06:36.080 --> 06:41.080]  I don't, and that isn't me thinking that they don't want to.
[06:41.400 --> 06:43.200]  I think if they could wave a magic wand
[06:43.200 --> 06:46.520]  and announce and ship simultaneously all iPhone models,
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.000]  I think they would.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.080]  I think there are just some, it's not just COVID,
[06:51.080 --> 06:54.760]  I think there are production issues and logistics issues
[06:54.760 --> 06:57.720]  in having all of those units.
[06:57.720 --> 07:00.160]  And I think maybe in the case of this year,
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.840]  they're also prioritizing the ones
[07:01.840 --> 07:03.240]  that are gonna sell the most
[07:03.240 --> 07:05.620]  and loading as many of those, front-loading those,
[07:05.620 --> 07:08.040]  making more of them, shipping more of them
[07:08.040 --> 07:09.840]  so that they can get those out there
[07:09.840 --> 07:14.360]  because they're the biggest sellers, presumably.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.480]  You never know, but presumably.
[07:16.480 --> 07:18.260]  And then you follow with the others.
[07:18.260 --> 07:20.240]  But I think if they could,
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.640]  just all practicalities and logistics aside,
[07:24.640 --> 07:26.120]  plan the perfect rollout,
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.260]  I think they would probably want to roll them out
[07:28.260 --> 07:31.240]  all simultaneously just because from a customer perspective,
[07:31.240 --> 07:32.760]  and I do think they care about this,
[07:32.760 --> 07:34.000]  it would be a lot easier to say,
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.400]  go online and pick your phone
[07:35.400 --> 07:36.960]  and it'll show up on this date.
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.620]  And it doesn't matter which one you pick
[07:38.620 --> 07:40.860]  because you get in a situation where people are like,
[07:40.860 --> 07:42.040]  well, do I want a 12?
[07:42.040 --> 07:42.880]  Do I want the mini?
[07:42.880 --> 07:44.560]  I wanna try the mini, but I can't
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.160]  because it's not in the stores yet.
[07:46.160 --> 07:47.360]  And so I don't know.
[07:47.360 --> 07:48.960]  And it's a lot clearer,
[07:48.960 --> 07:50.640]  they just want you to buy a phone, right?
[07:50.640 --> 07:52.240]  So if you know about all four of them
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.960]  and you could go to the store and handle them
[07:53.960 --> 07:55.840]  if you wanted to, if your store is open,
[07:55.840 --> 07:59.080]  then that's gonna sell a phone to you.
[07:59.080 --> 08:01.260]  And instead you get this weird kind of in-between.
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.440]  So I don't think logistically they can do that is the thing.
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.360]  And that's besides COVID.
[08:07.360 --> 08:10.880]  I think it's just, I think it's probably their ideal.
[08:10.880 --> 08:12.000]  Their dream is to do that.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.820]  But they sell so many phones.
[08:14.820 --> 08:18.360]  The volumes are so amazing that I think that even Apple
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.360]  can't pack the supply chain that much at once.
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.040]  I think 2017 might've been the exception.
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.120]  And I think the iPhone 10 did ship so much later
[08:31.120 --> 08:34.440]  than the iPhone 8 because it was just harder to produce
[08:34.440 --> 08:36.000]  and it was just really.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.160]  I think it wasn't ready.
[08:37.160 --> 08:39.320]  But I think even if it had been ready,
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.800]  I think they might've staggered that one by two weeks
[08:42.800 --> 08:45.840]  so that the iPhone 8 didn't get lost in the shuffle.
[08:45.840 --> 08:48.280]  Like I think they still would've shipped the iPhone 8 first,
[08:48.280 --> 08:51.280]  but maybe shipped the iPhone 10 two weeks later
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.120]  so that the iPhone 8 got its moment in the sun
[08:55.120 --> 08:58.600]  because price-wise they just knew that that was more
[08:58.600 --> 09:00.640]  in the budget for most people.
[09:00.640 --> 09:02.000]  Right, it could be.
[09:02.000 --> 09:02.840]  Maybe.
[09:02.840 --> 09:03.660]  It could be.
[09:03.660 --> 09:06.440]  I think what's funny is there's a question
[09:06.440 --> 09:10.460]  of how you wanna market this, like literally market it.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.660]  Take it to market.
[09:11.660 --> 09:13.800]  And there's how do you wanna promote it?
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.300]  And they've shown, like literally they announced
[09:18.300 --> 09:21.640]  in September a product that shipped simultaneous
[09:21.640 --> 09:24.400]  with a product that they announced in October.
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.400]  Like which gave the iPad Air its due
[09:29.520 --> 09:31.720]  and its moment in the sun.
[09:31.720 --> 09:33.420]  And they staggered the review embargoes.
[09:33.420 --> 09:35.300]  So the phone embargo was on a Tuesday
[09:35.300 --> 09:37.440]  and the iPad embargo was on a Wednesday.
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.440]  Yes, the September products embargo was later
[09:39.440 --> 09:41.000]  than the October products, I don't know.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.660]  But so there was an argument to be made
[09:43.660 --> 09:45.600]  that staggering everything like that
[09:45.600 --> 09:48.400]  and doing multiple events is actually better
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.400]  because everything gets its moment in the sun,
[09:51.400 --> 09:54.220]  but you do risk sort of fatigue after a certain point.
[09:54.220 --> 09:57.740]  So it's a trick of like what's the sweet spot
[09:57.740 --> 10:01.580]  of simplicity in terms of ordering and availability
[10:01.580 --> 10:05.640]  and clarity in terms of what customers expect
[10:05.640 --> 10:08.820]  and also like how you, what's the sweet spot
[10:08.820 --> 10:12.680]  with the press where it's just enough to get the maximum,
[10:12.680 --> 10:14.920]  because they wanna maximize promotion
[10:14.920 --> 10:17.400]  through product reviews and how do you do that?
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.620]  How many events do you hold?
[10:18.620 --> 10:19.680]  Apparently three.
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.040]  How many products do you roll out one time?
[10:22.040 --> 10:25.360]  And they're probably experimenting a little bit too.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.520]  I mean, some of it is probably artificial
[10:27.520 --> 10:28.960]  where they're like,
[10:28.960 --> 10:32.520]  because they're gonna get two waves of iPhone reviews
[10:32.520 --> 10:34.600]  just like they did with the XR,
[10:34.600 --> 10:36.040]  just like they did with the X.
[10:36.040 --> 10:38.480]  So that's good, that's more press for them.
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.440]  Right, and yeah, so part of it makes me think
[10:43.440 --> 10:46.760]  that it's, three weeks isn't that long
[10:46.760 --> 10:48.500]  in the grand scheme of things.
[10:48.500 --> 10:52.300]  You know, it is for, the people I pity,
[10:52.300 --> 10:54.500]  and you know, they're listening to us right now.
[10:54.500 --> 10:58.100]  They're the enthusiasts who really do want to,
[10:58.100 --> 11:00.400]  if they're going to get a new phone,
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.900]  they really are most likely to wanna order right away.
[11:02.900 --> 11:04.580]  They're the people who know,
[11:04.580 --> 11:08.040]  they know that like when Apple's online orders start,
[11:08.040 --> 11:12.420]  it's like, what is it now, midnight Eastern time or?
[11:12.420 --> 11:14.580]  No, I think it's like 9 a.m. Eastern
[11:14.580 --> 11:16.260]  or 6 a.m. Eastern or something like that.
[11:16.260 --> 11:17.780]  It's like a good time for the East Coast
[11:17.780 --> 11:19.260]  and a bad time for the West Coast.
[11:19.260 --> 11:21.340]  And it used to be the other way around, right,
[11:21.340 --> 11:24.380]  where it was midnight West, that's what I'm thinking.
[11:24.380 --> 11:26.420]  Midnight used to be midnight West Coast
[11:26.420 --> 11:29.020]  and 3 a.m. East Coast, which was literally
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.020]  the middle of the night for most people.
[11:32.020 --> 11:35.020]  The people who know that are the people
[11:35.020 --> 11:39.060]  who most want to hear, like, although those
[11:39.060 --> 11:42.560]  early order times always happen before the reviews come out,
[11:42.560 --> 11:44.960]  but people who do that, they wanna hear,
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.860]  hey, is the Mini too small?
[11:46.860 --> 11:50.820]  You know, is this new camera sensor
[11:50.820 --> 11:55.060]  in the max worth having a phone
[11:55.060 --> 11:57.500]  that maybe I think is too big, but I take so many photos
[11:57.500 --> 12:00.420]  and it is my family's point-and-shoot camera
[12:00.420 --> 12:01.400]  that maybe it's worth it?
[12:01.400 --> 12:04.060]  They wanna know that and you don't get to wait.
[12:04.060 --> 12:07.220]  And then maybe when these reviews finally drop,
[12:07.220 --> 12:09.080]  eventually for those phones, they'll say,
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.020]  ah, I really do just want the regular iPhone 12.
[12:12.020 --> 12:14.540]  I could've ordered it three weeks ago, right?
[12:14.540 --> 12:17.840]  So I, you know, it's frustrating for the enthusiasts.
[12:18.700 --> 12:21.020]  By next, you know, by the middle of December,
[12:21.020 --> 12:24.260]  it's all in the past and it's just the new iPhone 12s.
[12:24.260 --> 12:26.780]  Most people will just drift into an Apple store again
[12:26.780 --> 12:30.620]  if their store is open and they can drift in in December
[12:30.620 --> 12:32.620]  and then throughout next year and they'll have
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.100]  all the phones and they'll just buy a phone.
[12:34.100 --> 12:35.180]  It's not that big a deal.
[12:35.180 --> 12:38.620]  It is more for the people who are super intense about it
[12:38.620 --> 12:41.500]  like we are for now, but it's an interesting question
[12:41.500 --> 12:43.500]  of like, if they could do anything,
[12:43.500 --> 12:44.740]  would they still choose to do it
[12:44.740 --> 12:45.820]  the way they're doing it now?
[12:45.820 --> 12:48.060]  And, you know, I think some stuff
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.620]  they would probably choose to do differently,
[12:49.620 --> 12:51.340]  but you work with what you've got.
[12:51.340 --> 12:54.580]  Like, and you do prioritize the most important products.
[12:54.580 --> 12:56.140]  Yeah.
[12:56.140 --> 12:59.660]  Well, let's just say the most important thing on the agenda
[12:59.660 --> 13:02.520]  is to congratulate the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[13:02.520 --> 13:04.360]  Mm, no.
[13:05.380 --> 13:07.340]  Actually, you know, okay, so you and I have a friend
[13:07.340 --> 13:09.200]  who's a big Dodger fan, Greg Noss.
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.880]  Poor guy, I feel like, I felt like he was gonna die.
[13:13.880 --> 13:15.520]  And the Dodgers have, let's just,
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.840]  sorry for the sports talk, everybody,
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.920]  but the Dodgers, let's just say,
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.480]  have probably had the best team in baseball
[13:19.480 --> 13:22.220]  for like five years now and they always lose in the playoffs
[13:22.220 --> 13:25.360]  and as a Giants fan, I take great delight
[13:25.360 --> 13:27.160]  in the failure of the Los Angeles Dodgers
[13:27.160 --> 13:29.400]  because they're our rival, right?
[13:29.400 --> 13:31.680]  And yet, I also feel really bad for their fans
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.320]  and for people like our friend, Greg.
[13:34.320 --> 13:37.600]  And you know, the moment for me,
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.640]  because there are 30 baseball teams, right?
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.360]  So the moment when it was 30 years
[13:41.360 --> 13:43.080]  since the Dodgers had won a World Series,
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.680]  I kind of said to myself, okay, like, you know, literally.
[13:47.680 --> 13:50.280]  You're not getting your due, right?
[13:50.280 --> 13:52.600]  Yeah, like literally, it's been 30 years.
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.440]  If you went one at a time, it would be your turn now
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.040]  after 30 to get one again and you've had,
[14:00.040 --> 14:01.600]  you've won the division eight years in a row
[14:01.600 --> 14:02.440]  and all that stuff.
[14:02.440 --> 14:05.400]  So on that level, I'm okay with it.
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.920]  I feel like they were a great team.
[14:06.920 --> 14:09.440]  Mookie Betts is an amazing player there.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.520]  If they weren't the Dodgers, I would be,
[14:11.520 --> 14:12.800]  they were so fun to watch.
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.720]  The Rays were fun to watch too.
[14:14.720 --> 14:18.000]  I thought a great World Series after such a weird season,
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.660]  I thought it was an entertaining post season, loved it.
[14:20.660 --> 14:22.480]  The Dodgers are never gonna be my favorite
[14:22.480 --> 14:25.120]  and that's an understatement, but I thought it was fine.
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.520]  And then also in the back of my mind
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.520]  is just a jerk who loves the Giants.
[14:28.520 --> 14:31.520]  I am amused by the fact that the year the Dodgers
[14:31.520 --> 14:33.480]  finally won it all, their fans didn't get to go
[14:33.480 --> 14:35.560]  to a single game at Dodger Stadium.
[14:35.560 --> 14:37.240]  And there's no parade.
[14:37.240 --> 14:38.560]  And there's no parade, yeah.
[14:38.560 --> 14:39.680]  Well, 2020, right?
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.000]  As a Giants fan, you're like, see, there it is, 2020,
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.160]  something else bad happened.
[14:43.160 --> 14:46.280]  But I'm happy for my friends who are the long suffering.
[14:46.280 --> 14:48.620]  Like, look, as a fan of the San Francisco Giants,
[14:48.620 --> 14:52.240]  the Giants until 2010 had never won a World Series
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.640]  in San Francisco and it had been more than 50 years.
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.600]  So I feel the pain of somebody who has for most
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.760]  or all of their life never seen their team win anything.
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.280]  And so I'm happy for them, even though I, you know,
[15:05.280 --> 15:07.360]  I was pulling for the Rays because, you know,
[15:07.360 --> 15:09.640]  not only do they have a pitcher named Snell,
[15:09.640 --> 15:10.840]  but they're not the Dodgers.
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.440]  But it's okay, I'm happy for Greg
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.000]  and all the other Dodger fans out there.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.360]  We were texting about Blake Snell,
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.600]  who is the biggest Snell.
[15:19.600 --> 15:21.520]  Cy Young Award winning starting pitcher
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.200]  for the Tampa Bay Rays.
[15:23.200 --> 15:27.440]  And the closest equivalent I have was a star third baseman
[15:27.440 --> 15:29.780]  for the Toronto Blue Jays while we were growing up
[15:29.780 --> 15:31.120]  named Kelly Gruber.
[15:31.120 --> 15:32.720]  Kelly Gruber, yeah, absolutely.
[15:32.720 --> 15:37.080]  Also one of only two male Kellys who I could think of.
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.500]  Because wasn't the guy in the Bad News Bears named Kelly?
[15:40.500 --> 15:41.340]  Yeah, that's right.
[15:41.340 --> 15:43.680]  Yeah, and I just grew, so I grew up thinking
[15:43.680 --> 15:46.960]  my first thought was Kelly, that's a girl's name.
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.680]  And then, and I associated with Kelly,
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.520]  that's a name somebody has to be a great baseball player.
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.840]  Kelly Gruber.
[15:54.840 --> 15:55.680]  Sure.
[15:55.680 --> 15:56.800]  But it always hurt me as a Yankees fan
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.160]  that like the best Gruber to play baseball
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.200]  was on the division rival Toronto Blue Jays.
[16:02.200 --> 16:07.200]  So who do you think is, so I kid you
[16:07.400 --> 16:09.920]  because I know how Giants and Dodgers fans
[16:09.920 --> 16:10.760]  feel about each other.
[16:10.760 --> 16:11.600]  Yeah, that's the beauty.
[16:11.600 --> 16:13.680]  It's like you're never gonna cheer the Red Sox winning,
[16:13.680 --> 16:15.120]  although when they did win the first time,
[16:15.120 --> 16:17.280]  you're like, okay, well, I'm happy for the fans.
[16:17.280 --> 16:19.200]  Maybe a little bit, but they're the enemy.
[16:19.200 --> 16:20.720]  And so you cheer against them.
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.760]  It's like reverse fandom there.
[16:22.760 --> 16:25.440]  Well, who do you think, this is my question,
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.120]  who do you think is a bigger rivalry,
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.320]  Dodgers, Giants, or Yankees Red Sox?
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.560]  I think it's probably Yankees Red Sox, honestly.
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.560]  And some of that is the, I think both fan bases.
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.760]  Well, there is a dynamic that's similar,
[16:43.760 --> 16:46.480]  which is that I think the Red Sox fans hate the Yankees
[16:46.480 --> 16:48.600]  more than the Yankees hate the Red Sox.
[16:48.600 --> 16:49.440]  That's very true.
[16:49.440 --> 16:50.600]  And I think the Giants hate the Dodgers
[16:50.600 --> 16:53.040]  more than the Dodgers hate the Giants, honestly.
[16:53.040 --> 16:55.520]  It's one of those things like people in San Francisco,
[16:55.520 --> 16:58.120]  you know, we chant beat LA and stuff like that, right?
[16:58.120 --> 16:59.360]  I don't think LA cares, right?
[16:59.360 --> 17:01.600]  Like, whatever, there's no beat SF chant, right?
[17:01.600 --> 17:03.720]  It is, they're the bigger city.
[17:03.720 --> 17:05.800]  They're the bigger region that, you know,
[17:05.800 --> 17:08.160]  and I think that there's that aspect of it,
[17:08.160 --> 17:10.840]  but they're both great rival, I love rivalries.
[17:10.840 --> 17:12.560]  I try to explain them to other people.
[17:12.560 --> 17:14.120]  This is actually what I love about rivalries
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.880]  is you try to explain it logically to somebody
[17:15.880 --> 17:17.040]  about why do you hate them?
[17:17.040 --> 17:18.000]  And there's no answer.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.600]  Like, I can't explain why.
[17:19.600 --> 17:23.040]  Why did, I'm a UC Berkeley, a Cal fan as well.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.680]  And it's like, I hate Stanford.
[17:24.680 --> 17:26.040]  Stanford is one of the finest
[17:26.040 --> 17:28.400]  educational institutions in the world.
[17:28.400 --> 17:29.240]  I hate them.
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.080]  Why do I hate them?
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.400]  I don't hate them for any reason
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.440]  other than they're Stanford, we're Cal.
[17:34.440 --> 17:35.520]  We hate them.
[17:35.520 --> 17:37.880]  There's no logic, don't look for logic in it.
[17:37.880 --> 17:38.720]  Try to agree.
[17:38.720 --> 17:42.480]  And, you know, it really does seem preposterous
[17:42.480 --> 17:45.000]  when you think of it as an institution of higher,
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  as a great institution of higher learning
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.880]  that's, you know, curing diseases
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.760]  and doing great work in computer science,
[17:52.760 --> 17:53.880]  et cetera, and so forth.
[17:53.880 --> 17:56.800]  And I think, I was thinking about this
[17:56.800 --> 17:58.240]  when I knew you were gonna be on the show.
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.480]  And my answer is I think that they're both maximum rivalries.
[18:01.480 --> 18:02.840]  There's like a maximum amount
[18:02.840 --> 18:04.680]  of sports rivalry you can have.
[18:04.680 --> 18:07.360]  And I think that the perceived differences
[18:07.360 --> 18:10.880]  are the differences between the East Coast and California,
[18:10.880 --> 18:12.000]  the West Coast.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.760]  And that Californians are just generally nicer people.
[18:15.760 --> 18:17.880]  And so like the maximum,
[18:17.880 --> 18:20.320]  like when San Francisco fans
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.440]  think they're being really mean to the Dodgers,
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.880]  it's just as mean as we,
[18:24.880 --> 18:27.400]  our meanness dial only goes up that far.
[18:27.400 --> 18:29.480]  So we think we've maxed it out for us.
[18:29.480 --> 18:32.160]  Boston fans and the East Coast fans are like,
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.160]  what, are you kidding me?
[18:33.160 --> 18:35.880]  That's like my kid's softball game, you know.
[18:37.080 --> 18:38.240]  That's fair, that's fair.
[18:38.240 --> 18:39.280]  I love a good rivalry though.
[18:39.280 --> 18:40.200]  I think it's great.
[18:40.200 --> 18:42.320]  And it seems mean and it's totally illogical,
[18:42.320 --> 18:44.960]  but I do think having grown up in the midst
[18:44.960 --> 18:46.200]  of a couple of them,
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.560]  I think it adds a whole level of kind of spice and delight.
[18:49.560 --> 18:52.400]  And when every, and I know on the outside, it seems weird.
[18:52.400 --> 18:55.080]  Like I read about Cubs fans and Cardinals fans
[18:55.080 --> 18:55.920]  and things like that.
[18:55.920 --> 18:58.320]  And I'm like, I don't get it, but I get it.
[18:58.320 --> 19:00.360]  Like, I don't see it because I find those teams,
[19:00.360 --> 19:01.680]  they're like, okay, they're teams.
[19:01.680 --> 19:04.000]  But if you're in it, it's just a magical thing.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.880]  You've got, if sports really is about tribalism,
[19:07.880 --> 19:09.600]  you gotta have a rival.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.880]  Otherwise, you know, that just,
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.040]  you gotta be fully tribal.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.000]  You have to have a rival.
[19:14.000 --> 19:14.840]  Come on.
[19:14.840 --> 19:17.440]  The subtext for me as a Yankee fan
[19:17.440 --> 19:20.320]  watching the World Series
[19:20.320 --> 19:25.320]  was the delight in the suffering of Red Sox fans
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.400]  watching Mookie Betts establish himself as clearly,
[19:31.960 --> 19:34.560]  the only, to me, I love Aaron Judge.
[19:34.560 --> 19:35.520]  I think Aaron Judge is great.
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.680]  I wouldn't trade him for anybody,
[19:37.680 --> 19:39.360]  including the two people I'm about to mention.
[19:39.360 --> 19:42.000]  But to me, even a casual fan has to admit
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.720]  that the argument for the best baseball player
[19:44.720 --> 19:47.840]  in the game right now is either Mike Trout or Mookie Betts.
[19:47.840 --> 19:49.720]  And there's really, to me,
[19:49.720 --> 19:51.840]  I don't see how you could argue for anybody else.
[19:51.840 --> 19:54.360]  Did you read, Joe Posnansky at The Athletic
[19:54.360 --> 19:56.640]  actually wrote an essay that he said,
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.280]  maybe Mookie Betts is a better player,
[19:58.280 --> 20:00.240]  the best player in baseball, and not Mike Trout.
[20:00.240 --> 20:02.840]  And his point was, let's argue about it
[20:02.840 --> 20:05.000]  because it feels like we could have an argument now.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.600]  And the tragedy, of course, for the Red Sox
[20:07.600 --> 20:10.040]  is that they knew how good he was,
[20:10.040 --> 20:13.160]  but apparently their team, who is owned by a billionaire
[20:13.160 --> 20:15.480]  who also owns like a Premier League soccer team,
[20:15.480 --> 20:18.880]  and like, they just decided they didn't wanna pay him
[20:18.880 --> 20:21.160]  even though he's the best player and young
[20:21.160 --> 20:23.400]  and could have been their star for the next 10 years.
[20:23.400 --> 20:25.120]  And so they just got rid of him, it's amazing.
[20:25.120 --> 20:27.040]  It wasn't like they underestimated him.
[20:27.040 --> 20:30.320]  It wasn't like, oh, he flourished after they traded him.
[20:30.320 --> 20:33.720]  It wasn't like they just didn't have the money,
[20:33.720 --> 20:36.520]  like they just can't come up with the dough.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.080]  They just didn't wanna spend the money.
[20:39.080 --> 20:40.800]  It's like Babe Ruth all over again.
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.560]  They sold off Babe Ruth to the Yankees
[20:42.560 --> 20:44.840]  because he was gonna cost too much money
[20:44.840 --> 20:46.600]  and they didn't wanna pay him.
[20:46.600 --> 20:51.320]  And he was just spectacularly good in World Series.
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.160]  It was-
[20:52.160 --> 20:53.000]  He was, he was.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.640]  He single-handedly, I think, won a couple of games
[20:55.640 --> 20:57.960]  in the post-season with his defensive plays
[20:57.960 --> 20:58.800]  and with his hitting.
[20:58.800 --> 21:01.880]  And it was delightful to watch even though he's a Dodger
[21:01.880 --> 21:04.240]  because he brings such joy to the field.
[21:04.240 --> 21:08.160]  And yeah, it's gotta be extra glee for a Yankee fan
[21:08.160 --> 21:09.360]  to see that all happen.
[21:09.360 --> 21:11.880]  Because literally, I don't think the Dodgers
[21:11.880 --> 21:14.400]  would have won the World Series without him.
[21:14.400 --> 21:15.240]  So-
[21:15.240 --> 21:16.080]  No, I don't think so either.
[21:16.080 --> 21:17.200]  Red Sox.
[21:17.200 --> 21:19.440]  Well, and they definitely would not have beaten the Braves.
[21:19.440 --> 21:20.520]  No way.
[21:20.520 --> 21:22.160]  There's no way they would have beaten the Braves
[21:22.160 --> 21:23.000]  to get there.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.400]  So, thank you to the Red Sox
[21:25.400 --> 21:28.200]  for the Dodgers World Series Championship
[21:28.200 --> 21:31.440]  and for getting Mookie Betts into the National League
[21:31.440 --> 21:32.600]  away from the Yankees.
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.720]  Thank you so much.
[21:34.800 --> 21:36.480]  But I will say this before we move on.
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.520]  Let me just say this.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.200]  In the run-up to this election,
[21:40.200 --> 21:42.960]  which is coming out a few days after this episode
[21:42.960 --> 21:45.400]  is gonna drop, it has also occurred to me
[21:45.400 --> 21:47.640]  a point you just made a few minutes ago
[21:47.640 --> 21:52.280]  that we as human beings like to have rivalries.
[21:52.280 --> 21:55.320]  And one of the reasons when people who don't like sports
[21:55.320 --> 21:56.600]  say, well, why do you like sports?
[21:56.600 --> 21:58.280]  It's just a game and it's nonsense.
[21:58.280 --> 22:03.280]  It is fun to invest yourself and to care about something
[22:03.680 --> 22:07.080]  where the stakes ultimately are nothing, right?
[22:07.080 --> 22:10.920]  There really is no...
[22:10.920 --> 22:14.080]  The fine people, the 12, 13, 14,
[22:14.080 --> 22:15.760]  how many fans there are down in Tampa
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.760]  who like to watch the baseball team,
[22:17.760 --> 22:20.200]  they're good people and they're like baseball,
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.080]  dozens and dozens of fans down there who like this team.
[22:24.080 --> 22:26.320]  I hear you and Paul Kefas is right down there
[22:26.320 --> 22:28.200]  on a little reconnoiter and discovered
[22:28.200 --> 22:30.080]  that there are at least 10 race fans.
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.160]  We got seats.
[22:32.160 --> 22:34.520]  It was hard to believe that we could get seats
[22:34.520 --> 22:36.680]  to watch that fine baseball team.
[22:36.680 --> 22:39.000]  But all right, their hearts are broken.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.600]  You've had a great season.
[22:40.600 --> 22:41.840]  Again, it's a fine young team.
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.600]  But there's no real harm came of it.
[22:44.600 --> 22:47.000]  Your team, a team you like lost a game.
[22:47.960 --> 22:50.000]  And these rivalries, you could say,
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.200]  you don't like the Dodgers.
[22:51.200 --> 22:54.200]  And I could certainly say, I don't like the Red Sox.
[22:54.200 --> 22:55.520]  I don't like their ballpark.
[22:55.520 --> 22:56.920]  I don't like the way it smells.
[22:56.920 --> 22:58.600]  I don't like the way it looks.
[22:58.600 --> 23:00.480]  I don't like the way that they-
[23:00.480 --> 23:02.400]  Dodger dogs aren't very good.
[23:02.400 --> 23:04.360]  Right, I don't like any of it.
[23:06.160 --> 23:07.240]  I don't like their accent.
[23:07.240 --> 23:09.040]  I don't like the way that they talk up there.
[23:09.040 --> 23:10.080]  I just don't like it.
[23:10.080 --> 23:12.400]  But in most cases, I mean, there are occasionally
[23:12.400 --> 23:14.000]  examples of fan violence that happen
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.640]  and those are stupid and they shouldn't happen.
[23:15.640 --> 23:19.120]  But in general, the stakes are almost nothing.
[23:19.120 --> 23:20.200]  It's not life and death.
[23:20.200 --> 23:21.480]  It's not people's livelihood
[23:21.480 --> 23:23.640]  or whether somebody can get married
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.400]  or get health insurance or anything like that.
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.280]  Which is why, although there definitely is tribalism
[23:30.280 --> 23:31.640]  in American politics, which is I think
[23:31.640 --> 23:33.040]  where you were going with this,
[23:33.040 --> 23:37.040]  it feels like, but we don't do it for fun.
[23:37.040 --> 23:40.720]  There are actual stakes and like the cliche says,
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.680]  elections matter.
[23:41.680 --> 23:42.600]  Right.
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.160]  Well, and that's my sentiment to anybody
[23:45.160 --> 23:47.680]  who's listening to this episode before Tuesday.
[23:47.680 --> 23:50.720]  And if you're thinking about voting, vote.
[23:50.720 --> 23:51.800]  It matters.
[23:51.800 --> 23:53.520]  It really does.
[23:53.520 --> 23:55.840]  In real life, which is what elections are about,
[23:55.840 --> 23:57.760]  we are all in this together.
[23:57.760 --> 24:00.080]  In baseball, we're not all in this together.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.080]  The Dodgers, somebody had to win the World Series
[24:03.080 --> 24:05.640]  and 29 other teams didn't.
[24:05.640 --> 24:07.880]  In real life, we're all in it together.
[24:07.880 --> 24:09.880]  And that's the thought I would like
[24:09.880 --> 24:12.200]  to encourage everybody to have going forward.
[24:13.200 --> 24:14.280]  Voting, if you haven't.
[24:14.280 --> 24:16.600]  I bet most people listening actually have voted,
[24:16.600 --> 24:19.560]  which is a nice change in this country.
[24:19.560 --> 24:21.560]  But anybody who's still listening
[24:21.560 --> 24:23.360]  and on the fence as to whether a vote matters,
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.280]  it really does matter.
[24:24.280 --> 24:27.680]  It's the strangest thing in the world
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.000]  that you could be one of a couple hundred million people
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  here in the country and your vote matters.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.880]  But it really does.
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.640]  It's hard to explain, but don't think it doesn't.
[24:38.640 --> 24:40.440]  That's my election message.
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.040]  Yep, amen.
[24:42.040 --> 24:43.280]  Ah, all right, let me take a break.
[24:43.280 --> 24:46.480]  Thank our first sponsor, a new sponsor.
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.600]  Oh, this is great.
[24:47.600 --> 24:50.640]  I love new sponsors, Stitch Fix.
[24:50.640 --> 24:51.960]  I was worried about getting that out.
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.680]  That seems like something I'd have trouble pronouncing.
[24:54.680 --> 24:56.840]  Wouldn't it be great if every clothing store
[24:56.840 --> 24:59.320]  you shopped at only had your size,
[24:59.320 --> 25:02.040]  the styles you like, the prices you want?
[25:02.040 --> 25:04.820]  Well, there is a company focused on making that happen
[25:04.820 --> 25:07.040]  in the world of clothes shopping.
[25:07.040 --> 25:09.440]  There are no consistent sizes.
[25:09.440 --> 25:12.020]  Why should we have to try to guess
[25:12.020 --> 25:14.000]  if a medium is really a medium
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.720]  or maybe have to return it and it's online
[25:17.720 --> 25:19.880]  and you gotta pack it back up and give it to the guy
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.160]  just to get a large because the medium was too small
[25:22.160 --> 25:24.120]  even though you usually take a medium.
[25:24.120 --> 25:26.700]  Stitch Fix is a personal styling company

[26:49.400 --> 26:52.300]  My thanks to Stitch Fix for sponsoring the show.
[26:52.300 --> 26:54.860]  Where to start?
[26:54.860 --> 26:56.720]  We got a lot to cover.
[26:56.720 --> 26:58.440]  I say we start with the Mac, though.
[26:58.440 --> 27:01.900]  I can't, because I feel like if I save the Mac
[27:01.900 --> 27:03.720]  till the end, we're gonna cut it short
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.900]  and me and you, how can we not talk about the Mac?
[27:07.900 --> 27:08.740]  Sounds good to me.
[27:08.740 --> 27:12.560]  I mean, I think this is one of the most exciting moments
[27:12.560 --> 27:14.080]  that the Mac has ever had.
[27:14.080 --> 27:19.080]  Short term, they just reported their Q4 financial year 2020
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.760]  but it's the July to September quarter, yesterday.
[27:24.900 --> 27:29.900]  And underreported in all of this, to me, not by you,
[27:31.040 --> 27:33.740]  you mentioned it, but by a lot of people,
[27:33.740 --> 27:37.860]  is that the Mac had its best Q4 ever.
[27:37.860 --> 27:40.060]  Was it the best quarter period ever?
[27:40.060 --> 27:44.340]  It was the best single Mac quarter ever
[27:44.340 --> 27:49.340]  and not by a little, by more than a billion dollars.
[27:50.480 --> 27:53.720]  That is, and if you look back,
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.100]  their good quarters for the Mac in recent years
[27:58.100 --> 28:02.360]  have been like 7.1, 7.2 billion dollars.
[28:02.360 --> 28:03.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:03.200 --> 28:05.640]  And this was over nine. This is nine.
[28:05.640 --> 28:07.440]  Nine billion and it broke the record
[28:07.440 --> 28:10.080]  for the best Mac quarter by 1.6.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.200]  So not even more than one.
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.040]  Right.
[28:12.040 --> 28:13.040]  More than one and a half billion.
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.040]  It was by far the best quarter in 30-odd years of the Mac.
[28:19.720 --> 28:22.360]  And this is the quarter.
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.360]  The one quarter, July through September of 2020,
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.060]  that is after the official announcement
[28:32.060 --> 28:33.920]  that they are moving the entire product line
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.800]  from Intel processors to their own,
[28:35.800 --> 28:38.140]  quote, unquote, Apple Silicon chips.
[28:38.140 --> 28:38.980]  Yep.
[28:38.980 --> 28:41.840]  Before the quarter, when we all believe
[28:41.840 --> 28:43.760]  and have every reason to continue believing
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.540]  they will initially start shipping those Macs,
[28:47.540 --> 28:52.540]  the one quarter in history between Intel and Apple Silicon
[28:54.740 --> 28:57.880]  is the one where they sold the most Macs ever.
[28:57.880 --> 29:02.880]  Which, again, for the people listening to the talk show
[29:02.960 --> 29:05.000]  is gotta be a bit of a head scratcher, right?
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.720]  Because I bet a lot of people who are listening to the show
[29:07.720 --> 29:08.560]  who have been thinking,
[29:08.560 --> 29:12.760]  I kinda need a new whatever, desktop, an iMac,
[29:12.760 --> 29:16.680]  a MacBook of some sort, are probably thinking,
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.880]  I'll make do with what I have
[29:18.880 --> 29:21.440]  and see what they come out with.
[29:21.440 --> 29:24.640]  And in the meantime, out in the real world,
[29:24.640 --> 29:27.880]  people bought way more Macs than ever before.
[29:27.880 --> 29:30.900]  To me, it's a testimony that as much as we think,
[29:30.900 --> 29:33.040]  oh, well, Apple's all about the iPhone now,
[29:33.040 --> 29:35.560]  the Mac is stronger than ever
[29:35.560 --> 29:38.560]  and more mainstream than ever.
[29:40.160 --> 29:41.000]  I think that's true.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.200]  That's what I take away from it,
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.960]  is that there are people who you could say to them,
[29:46.960 --> 29:49.020]  clearly a lot of people, more people than ever,
[29:49.020 --> 29:51.060]  bought a Mac in the last three months,
[29:51.060 --> 29:53.360]  and you could say to them, well, wait a minute,
[29:53.360 --> 29:54.820]  didn't you hear that they're moving
[29:54.820 --> 29:59.560]  from Intel's architecture of x86 to custom Apple Silicon?
[29:59.560 --> 30:00.920]  You might as well just say to them,
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.780]  didn't you hear that they're gonna flim-flam
[30:02.780 --> 30:06.400]  the flabber chatter and it's gonna go to 26 gigawatts,
[30:06.400 --> 30:09.080]  or, you know, you just make up terms
[30:09.080 --> 30:10.760]  and they'll be like, ah, yeah.
[30:10.760 --> 30:13.240]  Yeah, but I need a laptop now, right?
[30:13.240 --> 30:14.860]  That's because I think,
[30:14.860 --> 30:16.480]  because that's what is driving some of this,
[30:16.480 --> 30:19.160]  although to be fair, a lot of the analysts
[30:19.160 --> 30:24.160]  say to Tim Cook in these calls every quarter,
[30:24.280 --> 30:26.120]  are you just selling Macs that you would have sold
[30:26.120 --> 30:27.720]  over the next year because of COVID
[30:27.720 --> 30:29.680]  and then your Mac sales are gonna crash?
[30:29.680 --> 30:31.320]  And what they said this time is,
[30:31.320 --> 30:34.040]  we still think it'll be a double digit growth year again,
[30:34.040 --> 30:36.880]  or a double digit growth quarter again next quarter
[30:36.880 --> 30:37.880]  during the holiday quarter.
[30:37.880 --> 30:39.760]  So they're saying, no, they actually think
[30:39.760 --> 30:43.520]  that the Mac is going to continue showing growth.
[30:44.360 --> 30:48.000]  Although I do think that some of it is obviously,
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.080]  you know, you're working at home
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.760]  and you need to buy a new laptop,
[30:51.760 --> 30:54.880]  or your company puts everybody at home and they're like,
[30:54.880 --> 30:56.840]  okay, we need to give you guys new Macs
[30:56.840 --> 30:58.560]  because you don't have, your laptops are old
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.580]  and we're gonna do that.
[30:59.580 --> 31:03.040]  Or my kid is now going to online school
[31:03.040 --> 31:05.280]  and we're gonna buy them a new Mac laptop.
[31:05.280 --> 31:08.280]  And I think also, and not maybe as covered as widely,
[31:08.280 --> 31:11.560]  is we used to get by with two laptops
[31:11.560 --> 31:13.360]  or a laptop and a desktop in this house
[31:13.360 --> 31:15.480]  and now we have four people here,
[31:15.480 --> 31:18.060]  all of whom are doing work or school all the time
[31:18.060 --> 31:20.940]  and we can't share, so we have to buy.
[31:20.940 --> 31:25.060]  I think all of those scenarios are driving people to say,
[31:25.060 --> 31:29.800]  I need to upgrade or add a Mac to my life.
[31:29.800 --> 31:33.560]  Yeah, and I think they don't break, I don't think,
[31:33.560 --> 31:35.520]  they don't break it out by units anymore, right?
[31:35.520 --> 31:38.040]  They just do revenue. They don't, just cash.
[31:38.040 --> 31:41.320]  Right, and so remember the, oh, it was so sweet
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.640]  in the old days, they would even tell you
[31:42.640 --> 31:44.560]  desktop versus notebook.
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.720]  Oh yeah, I was just looking for my historical project
[31:48.720 --> 31:50.000]  that maybe we'll talk about in a little bit.
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.360]  I was looking at an early 2000s keynote
[31:54.360 --> 31:57.600]  and they mentioned that 75% of their sales were desktops
[31:57.600 --> 32:00.520]  and I just raised an eyebrow because within a decade
[32:00.520 --> 32:03.120]  it was 75% laptops, right?
[32:03.120 --> 32:06.840]  That flipped so fast, but in the early 2000s,
[32:06.840 --> 32:10.640]  they really did sell far more desktops than laptops.
[32:10.640 --> 32:13.220]  I think you're right that there are a whole multitude
[32:13.220 --> 32:16.440]  of reasons related to the current quarantine
[32:16.440 --> 32:18.620]  extended situation that could drive people
[32:18.620 --> 32:22.160]  to buy Mac hardware, but I think part of it too
[32:22.160 --> 32:25.720]  that's driving revenue up specifically is in the,
[32:25.720 --> 32:27.720]  I can't help but think in the professional market
[32:27.720 --> 32:29.720]  there's a lot of people who are recreating
[32:29.720 --> 32:32.160]  professional setups that some of them
[32:32.160 --> 32:33.600]  are higher margin systems.
[32:33.600 --> 32:38.560]  Even people who therefore are juiced in and know,
[32:38.560 --> 32:40.520]  hey, this Apple Silicon thing's happening,
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.120]  in theory I might wait, but I'm usually working at home,
[32:44.120 --> 32:46.480]  I'm doing video or I'm doing audio stuff
[32:46.480 --> 32:49.260]  and I'm really, or development, something that really,
[32:49.260 --> 32:52.160]  you really need the best computer you can get
[32:52.160 --> 32:53.840]  and it really saves you time and money
[32:53.840 --> 32:56.800]  to have a truly professional workstation in front of you.
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.200]  People are recreating those at home
[33:01.200 --> 33:03.560]  or just separate and just in new places
[33:03.560 --> 33:06.240]  and so I think it's driving high margin stuff
[33:06.240 --> 33:09.720]  which you might think would be like the one end
[33:09.720 --> 33:14.720]  that would suffer the most in the Osborn effect period
[33:15.560 --> 33:18.520]  between WWDC and the actual shipping of Apple Silicon.
[33:18.520 --> 33:21.440]  I think even there the quarantine situation
[33:21.440 --> 33:22.720]  is driving people to say, look,
[33:22.720 --> 33:27.720]  I need a Pro or iMac right now.
[33:27.800 --> 33:32.100]  Yeah, and I'm not, like I'm really bullish on Apple Silicon
[33:32.100 --> 33:35.000]  but the fact is it's gonna be completely new
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.040]  and I think that even among people who know
[33:39.040 --> 33:43.240]  that it's coming, it's not 100% clear
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.040]  that what you wanna do is wait and buy one, right?
[33:46.040 --> 33:47.640]  There's certainly a strong argument
[33:47.640 --> 33:50.200]  that what you wanna do if you need a computer right now
[33:50.200 --> 33:53.000]  is to buy the last Intel Mac
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.920]  and then let Apple Silicon shake out
[33:55.920 --> 33:59.740]  and so the next time you need a Mac, it'll all be fine
[33:59.740 --> 34:03.440]  but right now you've got tried and true Intel Mac technology
[34:03.440 --> 34:06.040]  like I think it's arguable either way
[34:06.040 --> 34:07.320]  but certainly it's not the case
[34:07.320 --> 34:09.900]  that everybody who knows that Apple Silicon is coming
[34:09.900 --> 34:11.800]  is waiting for it.
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[34:13.720 --> 34:15.800]  It's just, what an exciting time
[34:15.800 --> 34:20.280]  but it also shows that Apple is making this transition
[34:20.280 --> 34:22.280]  from a position of strength
[34:22.280 --> 34:26.400]  and what a contrast with the PowerPC to Intel transition,
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.400]  right, where it's not that the 2005 PowerPC Macs
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.400]  were horrible, right, or decrepit or just,
[34:37.080 --> 34:41.080]  you know, to go back to the, Steve Jobs even mentioned it,
[34:41.080 --> 34:42.600]  even though it wasn't a hardware transition,
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.720]  it was a software transition.
[34:43.720 --> 34:45.280]  When he announced the Intel transition,
[34:45.280 --> 34:47.640]  he said, look, we've been through a few major transitions
[34:47.640 --> 34:51.520]  and the one was, you know, classic Mac OS 9 to OS 10.
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.160]  There were serious computer science level
[34:55.160 --> 34:59.100]  operating system technical shortcomings
[34:59.100 --> 35:00.720]  with the classic Mac OS
[35:00.720 --> 35:03.300]  and not to belabor that point and do a whole thing about it
[35:03.300 --> 35:07.200]  but there were some really significant problems there
[35:07.200 --> 35:10.560]  and it's not just, oh, we'll just ship a new OS, you know,
[35:10.560 --> 35:12.640]  because you needed all the third party software
[35:12.640 --> 35:13.480]  to come along with it.
[35:13.480 --> 35:16.280]  It was complicated, it took years, you know.
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.240]  PowerPC wasn't quite in that bad of a space
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.160]  where it looked like, hey, if they don't do something,
[35:23.160 --> 35:24.000]  because there were a lot of people,
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.560]  I was one as skeptic, I'll admit I was wrong, you know,
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.040]  I didn't think they were gonna make the move.
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.480]  I just thought there were too many reasons
[35:29.480 --> 35:31.200]  that it would be too difficult.
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.040]  You know, most people before that announcement
[35:34.040 --> 35:37.040]  weren't thinking, oh my God, when is Apple gonna move?
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.800]  It was like, when are they gonna ship the G5, which.
[35:40.800 --> 35:43.520]  Yeah, and when are they gonna ship a G5 laptop,
[35:43.520 --> 35:44.360]  which never happened.
[35:44.360 --> 35:46.800]  Right, right, I guess that's what I meant.
[35:46.800 --> 35:49.160]  It was the three gigahertz G5,
[35:49.160 --> 35:52.400]  which was promised and never delivered and the G5 laptop
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.800]  and what was happening behind the scenes is
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.200]  IBM couldn't deliver and at some point,
[36:00.200 --> 36:02.160]  Apple and Steve Jobs basically said,
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.120]  we gotta flip the switch, we gotta get away from these guys
[36:05.120 --> 36:08.200]  because they're not, you know, our life depends on them
[36:08.200 --> 36:10.400]  and they're not focused on it.
[36:10.400 --> 36:12.880]  It's not their, their life doesn't
[36:12.880 --> 36:14.480]  and we gotta go to Intel.
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.520]  Yeah, so.
[36:15.520 --> 36:17.440]  But it was a moment of desperation.
[36:17.440 --> 36:19.120]  It was like, we gotta throw in with the other guys
[36:19.120 --> 36:21.120]  because otherwise we're gonna be left behind
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.840]  and it was not a power move, right?
[36:23.840 --> 36:26.320]  It was a power move only in the sense
[36:26.320 --> 36:29.880]  that they had the ability to walk away
[36:29.880 --> 36:33.960]  from a vendor in IBM that was not pleasing them,
[36:33.960 --> 36:36.520]  but they were walking into the arms of literally
[36:36.520 --> 36:40.080]  the supplier of every other computer's processors.
[36:40.080 --> 36:43.520]  Yeah, so the risks that they were taking were like,
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.920]  we had, you know, and there has been a quote unquote
[36:46.920 --> 36:49.240]  hackintosh market, you know, people have been able
[36:49.240 --> 36:52.440]  to get Mac OS X running on, you know, non-Apple hardware.
[36:52.440 --> 36:55.360]  It never turned into a significant problem for the company.
[36:55.360 --> 36:58.520]  Nobody in the entire run of the Intel Macs,
[36:58.520 --> 37:00.960]  it's never been, hey, Apple really screwed this up
[37:00.960 --> 37:03.520]  because people are just robbing the company blind
[37:03.520 --> 37:07.400]  by buying non-Apple computers and running Mac OS X
[37:07.400 --> 37:09.880]  quote unquote for free on them.
[37:09.880 --> 37:12.080]  That never really happened.
[37:12.080 --> 37:14.240]  But those were the sort of thoughts we had as,
[37:14.240 --> 37:15.960]  well, what are the risks, you know?
[37:15.960 --> 37:17.680]  And there were risks, you know, like, well,
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.240]  what if developers never put their software over,
[37:20.240 --> 37:23.080]  but Apple did such a good job with their developer tools
[37:23.080 --> 37:26.160]  that it really wasn't a rough transition software-wise.
[37:26.160 --> 37:28.840]  You know, most stuff, you know,
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.320]  shipped Intel native pretty soon and PowerPC stuff
[37:32.320 --> 37:34.900]  ran in emulation for enough years.
[37:36.200 --> 37:39.600]  Whereas this transition seems a little bit riskier
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.840]  in terms of they've gotta bring it with Apple Silicon
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.240]  because Intel Macs literally have never been more popular.
[37:46.240 --> 37:49.680]  That is not, that is not a hyperbole, right?
[37:49.680 --> 37:52.320]  That's the whole point of what these quarterly results are.
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.480]  Like, I find that so mind-boggling
[37:55.480 --> 37:58.280]  that Intel Macs have never been more popular.
[37:59.240 --> 38:02.040]  And now is when they're like, well, we're done with them.
[38:03.160 --> 38:06.040]  Yeah, it's echoes of the getting rid of the iPod Mini
[38:06.040 --> 38:07.480]  and replacing it with the iPod Nano
[38:07.480 --> 38:08.920]  when it was their most popular product
[38:08.920 --> 38:10.760]  and they killed it to replace it with something else.
[38:10.760 --> 38:13.600]  But I think when we talk about Apple Silicon,
[38:13.600 --> 38:16.760]  you know, I have people ask me, what do you think?
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.960]  Like, is it gonna be better or is it gonna be shaky?
[38:19.960 --> 38:22.920]  And my response is always,
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.060]  Apple completely controls when they make the move,
[38:27.060 --> 38:29.160]  completely, they choose the moment
[38:29.160 --> 38:31.080]  to switch to Apple Silicon.
[38:31.080 --> 38:33.160]  And it's their pride on the line,
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.000]  not just the quality of the Mac,
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.680]  but the quality of their processing power,
[38:38.680 --> 38:41.760]  their processor system that they are so proud of.
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.160]  They wouldn't make the move
[38:44.160 --> 38:45.760]  if it was gonna be disappointing.
[38:45.760 --> 38:47.180]  They're making it because they know
[38:47.180 --> 38:48.400]  it's gonna blow people away.
[38:48.400 --> 38:49.520]  They really do because,
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.320]  and I know that you can roll your eyes at that
[38:51.320 --> 38:52.740]  and be like, oh, well, you know, whatever,
[38:52.740 --> 38:53.640]  we'll see what it is.
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.540]  But if you're Apple and you're not gonna impress people,
[38:57.540 --> 38:58.380]  why would you do it?
[38:58.380 --> 39:01.560]  You just wait, wait until you can impress people.
[39:01.560 --> 39:03.680]  But what we've seen on the smartphone side is,
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.680]  Apple is more than a year ahead of Qualcomm, essentially,
[39:08.720 --> 39:10.860]  that when the new A14 comes out,
[39:10.860 --> 39:13.220]  the A13 is still the fastest smartphone chip
[39:13.220 --> 39:14.880]  until the moment the A14 comes out,
[39:14.880 --> 39:17.080]  that they've lapped the field, basically.
[39:18.080 --> 39:21.220]  And so they think they can do the same thing
[39:21.220 --> 39:22.740]  with Apple Silicon.
[39:22.740 --> 39:25.360]  And again, if it was gonna be lackluster,
[39:25.360 --> 39:28.040]  they wouldn't do it because it would make them look bad.
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.840]  Like, they're doing it because they know exactly
[39:31.840 --> 39:33.800]  how impressive it's gonna be compared
[39:33.800 --> 39:36.180]  to the existing Intel processors.
[39:37.980 --> 39:40.500]  I really agree with it.
[39:40.500 --> 39:42.480]  I need to write this for Daring Fireball,
[39:42.480 --> 39:44.240]  because, and I know,
[39:44.240 --> 39:46.560]  there's so many people who seem to be under the impression
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.920]  that like the first Apple Silicon Mac is going,
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.880]  definitely, they think, going to be like a return
[39:52.880 --> 39:55.800]  of the 12-inch MacBook, very small.
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.800]  Think, you know, like an iPad, super,
[39:58.800 --> 40:00.740]  I guess, sliver of a computer.
[40:00.740 --> 40:01.960]  A little 12-inch laptop.
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.400]  Right, and it'll have the A14X or the A14M for Mac
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.320]  or something like that, and that'll be it.
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.480]  And who knows when we'll see the next,
[40:11.480 --> 40:14.000]  it's like, it's just like dot, dot, dot,
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.680]  or yada, yada, yada.
[40:15.680 --> 40:18.240]  Well, who knows when we'll see the rest of the lineup.
[40:18.240 --> 40:21.840]  And I think that's just way too obvious.
[40:21.840 --> 40:23.220]  You're not thinking big enough.
[40:23.220 --> 40:28.220]  And I keep thinking back to the WWDC announcement of this
[40:28.220 --> 40:31.080]  when they cut to Johnny Srouji down in this,
[40:31.080 --> 40:32.660]  quote, unquote, secret lab,
[40:34.020 --> 40:36.520]  which I think might have actually been like,
[40:36.520 --> 40:38.320]  you know, like when they shoot in those places,
[40:38.320 --> 40:39.560]  those are like real rooms,
[40:39.560 --> 40:41.820]  and I know they set dress them,
[40:41.820 --> 40:45.780]  and people, I think, waste their time looking for like,
[40:45.780 --> 40:48.460]  unannounced hardware sitting in there, like.
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.800]  Yeah, it's a set.
[40:50.800 --> 40:52.520]  They don't just show up with a camera
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.580]  and just happen to shoot whatever's in these labs,
[40:55.580 --> 40:58.960]  but they are like, I think, where they actually shoot,
[40:58.960 --> 41:00.720]  you know, where they actually do some of this work
[41:00.720 --> 41:01.720]  in Apple Park.
[41:01.720 --> 41:02.880]  Right, I think so.
[41:02.880 --> 41:05.200]  You're right, they're set dressed, but real,
[41:05.200 --> 41:07.200]  and they are probably in Apple Park,
[41:07.200 --> 41:08.960]  although they might not be.
[41:08.960 --> 41:12.160]  Well, Srouji's team is in Apple Park.
[41:12.160 --> 41:14.000]  I think Apple Park is that whole campus,
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.400]  but Srouji's team famously has like
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.240]  their whole big secret building off to the side.
[41:19.240 --> 41:21.160]  They're outside the ring.
[41:21.160 --> 41:21.980]  Interesting.
[41:21.980 --> 41:23.880]  I don't know if that's where they shot that segment,
[41:23.880 --> 41:26.920]  but that whole chip team is sort of off to the side.
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.080]  But if you just listen to Srouji's segment,
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.240]  he, you know, it's very Apple-y
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.760]  where they want to pre-announce this.
[41:37.760 --> 41:40.500]  They wanna, you know, we gotta tell developers,
[41:40.500 --> 41:43.280]  we gotta have, you know, we're gonna ship, you know,
[41:43.280 --> 41:45.080]  this developer kit hardware.
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.040]  We wanna get native stuff on day one
[41:49.040 --> 41:50.680]  so we can have native software,
[41:50.680 --> 41:52.280]  even though we're gonna have emulation
[41:52.280 --> 41:54.160]  to keep stuff working for compatibility.
[41:54.160 --> 41:55.560]  That's not the point of this,
[41:56.760 --> 41:58.960]  but we don't wanna spill all the secrets, right?
[41:58.960 --> 42:01.400]  And so how do you navigate that?
[42:01.400 --> 42:04.240]  But when you listen to what Srouji said,
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.240]  he talked about the, and I think that the similarities
[42:09.400 --> 42:13.200]  between iPad and iPhone over the years,
[42:13.200 --> 42:16.400]  or the whole era of iPad has been taking,
[42:16.400 --> 42:19.440]  even though iPad had some stuff first,
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.440]  you know, had LTE first and had, I think,
[42:22.440 --> 42:25.640]  the first Apple Silicon with a number was in an iPad,
[42:25.640 --> 42:28.380]  I think like the A4 or whatever.
[42:28.380 --> 42:29.360]  I don't know, maybe. I don't know.
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.760]  But it's, you know, it's not like the iPad
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.520]  always comes second, but, and again, like you said earlier,
[42:35.520 --> 42:38.520]  the iPad Air got announced with the A14 first,
[42:38.520 --> 42:40.860]  even if, you know, it shipped at the same time.
[42:40.860 --> 42:45.260]  But, you know, they tend to, even with the iPad Pros,
[42:45.260 --> 42:49.720]  they just take the A11, add an X,
[42:49.720 --> 42:53.440]  and the X represents additional, like, GPU cores.
[42:54.360 --> 42:55.800]  Yeah, and processor cores.
[42:55.800 --> 42:58.940]  Right, processor cores and more graphics horsepower.
[42:58.940 --> 43:02.120]  But it's fundamentally, and like on single-core benchmarks,
[43:02.120 --> 43:05.640]  like Geekbench, it scores exactly the same
[43:05.640 --> 43:07.280]  because it really is the same chip
[43:08.760 --> 43:10.120]  for single-core processing.
[43:11.960 --> 43:14.000]  That's what they do with iPad,
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.600]  and it works great for iPad, right?
[43:15.600 --> 43:17.780]  It's not like anybody's looking at iPads
[43:17.780 --> 43:19.840]  and saying, boy, these iPads are slow, right?
[43:19.840 --> 43:21.340]  Nobody has ever said that, right?
[43:21.340 --> 43:24.260]  They've always been like, wow, this feels really fast.
[43:25.800 --> 43:27.360]  But when Suruchi talked about this,
[43:27.360 --> 43:29.360]  he talked about how they took their,
[43:29.360 --> 43:30.800]  when they made Apple Watch,
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.880]  and they took everything they know,
[43:32.880 --> 43:34.360]  but they had to shrink it down
[43:34.360 --> 43:36.960]  to fit in a tiny little thing on a wrist, right?
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.840]  They didn't take the A8 or whatever, A9,
[43:40.840 --> 43:43.200]  whatever year it was when the first Apple Watch came out
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.160]  and make like the A8W chip
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.200]  and have a big, big, by the watch standards,
[43:51.200 --> 43:53.980]  phone chip running on your wrist.
[43:53.980 --> 43:56.300]  They made something altogether new
[43:56.300 --> 44:00.400]  that could enable something to run all day on your wrist.
[44:00.400 --> 44:01.800]  And then it just more or less says
[44:01.800 --> 44:04.820]  that's what we're gonna do for pro workstations.
[44:04.820 --> 44:06.240]  And it's like, in other words, to me,
[44:06.240 --> 44:08.520]  the implication is as much smaller
[44:08.520 --> 44:10.880]  that the watch is than the phone,
[44:10.880 --> 44:13.120]  some of the stuff they're working on the Mac
[44:13.120 --> 44:15.600]  is gonna be that much bigger than what they do
[44:15.600 --> 44:16.440]  with the phone.
[44:16.440 --> 44:18.280]  Like to me, that was like goosebumps.
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.120]  That was like, yeah, this is what I want, man.
[44:21.120 --> 44:22.120]  And-
[44:22.120 --> 44:23.440]  I think so.
[44:23.440 --> 44:25.320]  We don't know for sure.
[44:25.320 --> 44:27.960]  There are rumors that are conflicting about it.
[44:27.960 --> 44:29.800]  We know that they said it's a two-year process.
[44:29.800 --> 44:33.320]  So I think that that means that all Intel Macs everywhere
[44:33.320 --> 44:34.740]  are not gonna be replaced for two years.
[44:34.740 --> 44:37.240]  It gives them, at most, two years.
[44:37.240 --> 44:38.360]  It gives them a little bit of a time.
[44:38.360 --> 44:40.080]  But I did a piece on six colors
[44:40.080 --> 44:42.240]  where I basically tried to extrapolate.
[44:42.240 --> 44:43.680]  This was before the A14 came out.
[44:43.680 --> 44:46.360]  So it's actually, I was a little conservative on the A14,
[44:46.360 --> 44:49.080]  so it's actually even more true, I think, now.
[44:49.080 --> 44:54.080]  But the idea that how fast would an A14X, an iPad class,
[44:54.560 --> 44:58.660]  so like four performance scores chip be
[44:58.660 --> 45:00.240]  in terms of like Geekbench scores,
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.380]  multi-threaded, multi-processing score?
[45:03.380 --> 45:05.080]  And the answer is,
[45:05.080 --> 45:07.560]  if you just took the iPad chip you're developing
[45:07.560 --> 45:09.740]  and put it in a MacBook, a 12-inch MacBook
[45:09.740 --> 45:12.680]  or something like that, a consumer Mac,
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.120]  it would be faster than the high-end MacBook Pro 16-inch
[45:16.120 --> 45:18.120]  that was announced last year,
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.400]  and almost as fast as the eight-core,
[45:20.400 --> 45:23.780]  top-of-the-line iMac that was announced earlier this year
[45:23.780 --> 45:25.680]  that's probably the last Intel iMac.
[45:25.680 --> 45:28.440]  And that's the iPad chip.
[45:28.440 --> 45:29.720]  And then if you do,
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.440]  and I think that this may be what they do,
[45:31.440 --> 45:34.120]  is they've got this A14X or whatever that is,
[45:34.120 --> 45:35.600]  that is something that they can put in iPads
[45:35.600 --> 45:37.520]  and they can put in low-end Macs
[45:37.520 --> 45:39.900]  or maybe a low-end Mac laptops, MacBook Air,
[45:39.900 --> 45:41.740]  MacBook, that kind of thing.
[45:41.740 --> 45:46.740]  I assume there's also a Mac-specific processor
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.120]  that is more powerful, that has more cores
[45:50.120 --> 45:53.340]  and is clocked up and has more interesting things
[45:53.340 --> 45:55.360]  going on with graphics and who knows what else
[45:55.360 --> 45:57.400]  that's made just for the Mac.
[45:57.400 --> 46:00.400]  And I just threw into my little spreadsheet,
[46:00.400 --> 46:02.360]  again, let's extrapolate that they add on
[46:02.360 --> 46:05.560]  because the rumors are that there is a Mac chip
[46:05.560 --> 46:08.600]  and it's got eight performance cores.
[46:08.600 --> 46:11.200]  And if that's true, then you just do the math
[46:11.200 --> 46:12.640]  and it's like, you're now in the zone
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.920]  where that Apple Silicon Mac chip that's the Pro Mac chip
[46:16.920 --> 46:19.560]  is roughly halfway in performance
[46:19.560 --> 46:20.960]  between the high-end iMac
[46:20.960 --> 46:23.920]  and the high-end 28-core Mac Pro.
[46:23.920 --> 46:26.760]  It's basically in Mac Pro territory,
[46:26.760 --> 46:29.000]  firmly in Mac Pro territory.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.840]  And you could have that in a MacBook Pro potentially.
[46:31.840 --> 46:34.040]  So this is why I said earlier
[46:34.040 --> 46:35.560]  that I'm bullish on Apple Silicon
[46:35.560 --> 46:38.040]  and I think that they are approaching this
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.800]  from a position of confidence that they know they can impress
[46:41.800 --> 46:44.480]  that if you extrapolate the speeds
[46:44.480 --> 46:46.720]  that they've got on the iPad and the iPhone,
[46:46.720 --> 46:49.600]  it's really clear that they can build this stuff
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.960]  and have it be way faster than any comparable Intel Mac.
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.280]  Yeah, it's almost undeniable.
[46:58.280 --> 46:59.280]  The other thing to keep in mind,
[46:59.280 --> 47:04.280]  they've never shipped a custom silicon CPU chip
[47:04.280 --> 47:09.280]  designed from the ground up to not be run off a battery.
[47:10.840 --> 47:12.840]  That everything they've ever done is run off.
[47:12.840 --> 47:17.080]  Now, there's Apple TV, which doesn't have a battery,
[47:17.080 --> 47:20.560]  but Apple TV is a product that has just sort of gotten,
[47:20.560 --> 47:23.200]  well, you could just take a two-year-old A-series chip
[47:23.200 --> 47:24.560]  and we'll just put it in there.
[47:24.560 --> 47:29.440]  But they don't design custom silicon for Apple TV.
[47:29.440 --> 47:32.040]  They've never had a device that is,
[47:32.040 --> 47:35.360]  well, when the chip team is like,
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.360]  well, what are we working with?
[47:37.360 --> 47:40.560]  And it's like, imagine that you've been on this team
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.480]  for like over a decade building these things
[47:43.480 --> 47:47.600]  where battery life is, if not the biggest concern,
[47:47.600 --> 47:48.720]  one of, right?
[47:48.720 --> 47:51.600]  No discussion, no day goes by
[47:51.600 --> 47:54.960]  where you're not taking into consideration battery life.
[47:55.880 --> 47:58.400]  And you say, oh no, you're designing a device
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.440]  that will always have power.
[48:00.440 --> 48:02.080]  It's like glorious, right?
[48:02.080 --> 48:04.760]  And sort of personal computing,
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.840]  the whole Intel architecture came the other way, right?
[48:07.840 --> 48:11.880]  It came from an era where laptops were exotic
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.160]  and sort of, they were just desktops running.
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.720]  And we talk about the Mac's history in that regard
[48:18.720 --> 48:21.960]  where you could literally just, they just took a Mac
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.720]  and put it in a suitcase, you know?
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.880]  Yep, it's a Mac portable now, enjoy.
[48:27.880 --> 48:30.480]  It is just a terribly, terribly exciting time
[48:30.480 --> 48:34.160]  to be a Mac enthusiast because the platform is thriving,
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.360]  it is popular, it clearly has the company's interest.
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.360]  And another way to look at it is in terms of,
[48:43.040 --> 48:45.440]  well, why do this now?
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.560]  If they were going to take the easy road,
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.920]  the easy road obviously is just to keep making Intel Macs.
[48:51.920 --> 48:53.360]  They've never been more popular
[48:53.360 --> 48:54.960]  and they don't have to do any,
[48:54.960 --> 48:56.040]  not that they don't have to do work.
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.680]  I'm not saying it's easy for the computer engineers at Apple
[48:59.680 --> 49:01.760]  to make the Macs they've been making
[49:01.760 --> 49:05.220]  for 14, 15 years with Intel systems.
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.040]  But it's easier than doing that
[49:09.040 --> 49:12.640]  plus designing your own chips, right?
[49:12.640 --> 49:14.120]  It's...
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.120]  Yeah, there was that pivotal moment
[49:16.120 --> 49:19.000]  and you, along with some other journalists, got invited
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.040]  to talk to Phil Schiller and some other people
[49:22.040 --> 49:23.440]  about the future of the Mac.
[49:23.440 --> 49:24.480]  And that was the announcement
[49:24.480 --> 49:25.920]  that there was going to be a new Mac Pro
[49:25.920 --> 49:27.840]  and that Apple was recommitting to Pro customers.
[49:27.840 --> 49:29.680]  And honestly, up until that moment,
[49:29.680 --> 49:31.600]  I felt like that's exactly where Apple was,
[49:31.600 --> 49:33.880]  that they had just decided the Mac is a legacy platform
[49:33.880 --> 49:35.480]  and we love it, but we're just not going to put
[49:35.480 --> 49:36.560]  a lot of effort into it.
[49:36.560 --> 49:38.120]  It's going to be what it's going to be.
[49:38.120 --> 49:39.200]  It's not going to really change.
[49:39.200 --> 49:40.800]  We'll use Intel's latest processors,
[49:40.800 --> 49:42.540]  we'll update it every year or two,
[49:42.540 --> 49:44.240]  and we'll just kind of let it motor on.
[49:44.240 --> 49:45.760]  And it would be fine.
[49:45.760 --> 49:47.960]  And at some point they said,
[49:47.960 --> 49:50.680]  no, okay, let's go the other way with the Mac.
[49:50.680 --> 49:51.560]  We're going to take the Mac
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.320]  and it's going to be part of our strategy.
[49:53.320 --> 49:55.680]  And that means the Mac has to change
[49:55.680 --> 49:57.640]  and that's going to ruffle some feathers
[49:57.640 --> 50:00.280]  of old school Mac users, but the Mac's going to change
[50:00.280 --> 50:02.240]  and we're going to take it into the future
[50:02.240 --> 50:03.560]  and we're going to use our processors
[50:03.560 --> 50:05.880]  and we're going to run iOS apps on it.
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.560]  And it's going to be a very different future for the Mac,
[50:09.560 --> 50:11.480]  but the Mac is going to be, you know,
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.680]  it's going to have this opportunity
[50:12.680 --> 50:14.720]  to become far more than it was.
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.360]  And that's that moment because it really was Apple saying,
[50:18.360 --> 50:19.920]  are we going to put effort into the Mac
[50:19.920 --> 50:22.440]  or are we just going to write it off as a legacy technology?
[50:22.440 --> 50:25.160]  And everything we've seen since then suggests
[50:25.160 --> 50:27.320]  that they have been slowly grinding up,
[50:27.320 --> 50:29.840]  cranking up all the gears to do that.
[50:29.840 --> 50:31.680]  And the Apple Silicon announcement
[50:31.680 --> 50:34.200]  combined with the fact that in that announcement,
[50:34.200 --> 50:35.960]  they said, yeah, you know,
[50:35.960 --> 50:38.560]  we're going to integrate iOS compatibility
[50:38.560 --> 50:41.760]  in Apple Silicon and macOS Big Sur.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.040]  Like that is, you know,
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.960]  if they were just putting them on life support,
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.560]  none of that would have happened.
[50:47.560 --> 50:50.400]  And it shows that Apple now considers the Mac.
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.640]  I mean, you could argue the Mac is the center point
[50:54.640 --> 50:57.560]  of Apple's product lineup now,
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.280]  or at least will be shortly,
[50:59.280 --> 51:02.480]  because it's going to run all the software
[51:02.480 --> 51:05.720]  on essentially all of its major, you know,
[51:05.720 --> 51:08.760]  non-watch, non-Apple TV platforms, right?
[51:08.760 --> 51:11.440]  And it becomes that iOS is a subset of Mac
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.800]  instead of being like the dominant platform in the Mac
[51:14.800 --> 51:16.200]  is this weird thing on the side.
[51:16.200 --> 51:19.040]  And that is, you know, it took them years to get there,
[51:19.040 --> 51:21.400]  but I feel like there must have been a moment internally
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.720]  where they decided,
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.400]  let's not treat the Mac as a legacy platform.
[51:25.400 --> 51:26.960]  And I'm all in for that.
[51:26.960 --> 51:28.920]  Cause I want the Mac to grow and thrive
[51:28.920 --> 51:32.440]  and not just kind of calcify and be a legacy platform.
[51:32.440 --> 51:34.560]  Cause that way lies death, you know,
[51:34.560 --> 51:37.360]  eventually it might motor on for a while.
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.440]  When I started at Mac user in the nineties,
[51:39.440 --> 51:41.560]  there was still an Apple II magazine that they put out
[51:41.560 --> 51:42.400]  upstairs, right?
[51:42.400 --> 51:44.400]  Like, I mean, it can do that for a while,
[51:44.400 --> 51:46.040]  but it's an end game.
[51:46.040 --> 51:48.240]  You know that it's just going to trail down and end
[51:48.240 --> 51:50.160]  and Apple decided not to do that with Mac.
[51:50.160 --> 51:52.120]  Yeah. And so it's terribly exciting,
[51:52.120 --> 51:55.080]  but what a quarter ahead.
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.280]  Yeah.
[51:57.280 --> 51:59.280]  Did you see, I don't even know what to make of this,
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.240]  that the Big Sur 11,
[52:03.240 --> 52:08.160]  Mac OS 11.0.1 beta is already out.
[52:08.160 --> 52:12.880]  But Mac OS 11.0 is not out,
[52:12.880 --> 52:16.400]  which the only reasonable explanation for this,
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.680]  this is not, this might just sound like,
[52:20.680 --> 52:23.480]  oh, they're just numbers you stick on operating systems,
[52:23.480 --> 52:25.920]  but to developers, this is meaningful, right?
[52:25.920 --> 52:29.160]  Like, cause now there's an operating system that they,
[52:29.160 --> 52:31.280]  their software might be needed,
[52:31.280 --> 52:33.960]  expected to work on that isn't out.
[52:33.960 --> 52:36.480]  It's, it is not, it is a big deal.
[52:36.480 --> 52:39.400]  It is a big WTF for Mac developers.
[52:39.400 --> 52:43.440]  Where is the final, the golden master of 11.0.0?
[52:43.440 --> 52:46.880]  And, you know, the best guess is it's on a bunch
[52:46.880 --> 52:49.760]  of Apple Silicon Macs that haven't been announced yet.
[52:49.760 --> 52:51.000]  Right.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.400]  That will presumably update to 11.0.1
[52:54.400 --> 52:55.680]  as soon as that comes out,
[52:55.680 --> 52:58.160]  perhaps the moment they get taken out of the box,
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.600]  who knows, but that they needed to lock it
[53:00.600 --> 53:02.720]  in order to write it to all the drives
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.160]  in order to ship all of those
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.960]  so that they can announce it and ship it.
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.680]  That's the best guess, but, you know,
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.920]  the developers would still like a golden master
[53:09.920 --> 53:13.760]  to test against, I suspect, on their developer kits,
[53:13.760 --> 53:16.120]  at least, and a final version of Xcode
[53:16.120 --> 53:17.440]  and all of those things too.
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.160]  Apple, they are one company, and in a lot of ways,
[53:22.160 --> 53:26.200]  they've never been more unified with hardware and software,
[53:26.200 --> 53:29.560]  you know, working together and teams working together
[53:29.560 --> 53:33.600]  and all of that, but it exemplifies how software
[53:33.600 --> 53:36.120]  and hardware are two very different things,
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.160]  and there's Apple, the hardware company
[53:38.160 --> 53:42.360]  that is keeping these Apple Silicon Macs under wrap
[53:42.360 --> 53:45.440]  and wants to have a big splashy debut,
[53:45.440 --> 53:47.560]  and then there's Apple, the company making
[53:47.560 --> 53:51.680]  a desktop professional workstation operating system
[53:51.680 --> 53:54.560]  who's doing something that makes absolutely no sense
[53:54.560 --> 53:57.560]  from the software, no other company in the world
[53:57.560 --> 54:00.960]  which starts distributing developer betas
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.960]  of a point one update to an operating system
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.360]  that still hasn't been out as the point O.
[54:09.360 --> 54:11.100]  Yeah, let's throw in the mix.
[54:11.100 --> 54:14.640]  This is something that I only thought about the other day,
[54:14.640 --> 54:19.200]  which is because Big Sur on Apple Silicon
[54:19.200 --> 54:23.960]  will run iOS apps, what that means is we are now
[54:23.960 --> 54:26.680]  at the point where shipping macOS requires you
[54:26.680 --> 54:30.440]  to ship essentially a version of iOS, right?
[54:30.440 --> 54:32.180]  They build together, they have to build together
[54:32.180 --> 54:35.840]  because they have to run iOS apps in macOS on Apple Silicon,
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.560]  which means essentially macOS is also,
[54:39.560 --> 54:44.240]  not only are Apple Silicon Macs a superset of iOS,
[54:44.240 --> 54:48.400]  but macOS is a superset of iOS, which means that,
[54:48.400 --> 54:50.840]  I think first off, it means that it will always have
[54:50.840 --> 54:53.760]  to ship either perfectly in parallel
[54:53.760 --> 54:58.040]  or more likely after iOS because you gotta have
[54:58.040 --> 55:01.120]  a stable thing and some compatibility among apps
[55:01.120 --> 55:03.160]  and all of that, but it does add that extra layer
[55:03.160 --> 55:05.640]  of complexity and I wonder if that factors in too, right?
[55:05.640 --> 55:07.600]  Because, so then there's an iOS update,
[55:07.600 --> 55:10.560]  you presumably need to do a macOS update at that point
[55:10.560 --> 55:12.760]  because you wanna bring the whole platform up.
[55:12.760 --> 55:14.960]  It's just, it's really complicated
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.480]  and they're also shipping this hardware
[55:16.480 --> 55:18.360]  that they're not yet announced
[55:18.360 --> 55:21.920]  and is not yet actually shipping and I don't envy them.
[55:21.920 --> 55:24.800]  It's a really high degree of difficulty,
[55:24.800 --> 55:26.280]  the stuff that they're working on.
[55:26.280 --> 55:28.400]  Right, because there's, you know, effectively,
[55:28.400 --> 55:30.840]  there's a baseline level of iOS.
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.840]  It's not like these apps are running in emulation
[55:35.940 --> 55:40.060]  in iOS on the Mac, but there's, you know,
[55:40.060 --> 55:40.900]  you gotta draw the line.
[55:40.900 --> 55:43.920]  They're calling all of the iOS APIs, though, to run, right?
[55:43.920 --> 55:46.320]  So there's, yeah, exactly, so there's gotta be a line,
[55:46.320 --> 55:49.560]  you say, and say, these are the APIs that we're supporting
[55:49.560 --> 55:53.720]  and when some of them are new, they have to ship
[55:53.720 --> 55:57.080]  before the Mac can come out and-
[55:57.080 --> 55:59.360]  Yeah, do you turn on the App Store with Big Sur
[55:59.360 --> 56:02.440]  and try on an Apple Silicon Mac and try to download an app
[56:02.440 --> 56:03.960]  and it says, sorry, it's not convert,
[56:03.960 --> 56:06.800]  it's not compatible with your version of iOS
[56:06.800 --> 56:08.600]  and you're like, wait a second, I'm not running iOS,
[56:08.600 --> 56:10.780]  I'm running macOS and you said I could download it,
[56:10.780 --> 56:11.620]  so why can't I?
[56:11.620 --> 56:13.160]  And like, they have to,
[56:13.160 --> 56:15.320]  that's part of the launch of Apple Silicon
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.640]  is that like, what's the App Store experience like?
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.000]  Because presumably, some degree of those apps
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.260]  are either opted in or auto-opted in or something
[56:24.260 --> 56:26.740]  and you can see them and you can just run those iOS apps
[56:26.740 --> 56:28.240]  and they need to run.
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.600]  They need to be presumably on a one-to-one
[56:31.600 --> 56:34.080]  with what the release version of iOS is
[56:34.080 --> 56:35.240]  in terms of compatibility.
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.320]  Yeah, so it has gotten a lot more complicated.
[56:38.320 --> 56:39.800]  And they're all-
[56:39.800 --> 56:40.840]  But exciting, right?
[56:40.840 --> 56:43.360]  It's like, I can't believe, you know,
[56:43.360 --> 56:45.000]  if you had told me five years ago
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.840]  that this was gonna happen, I would have said, pinch me.
[56:46.840 --> 56:48.240]  Like, I don't believe you.
[56:48.240 --> 56:49.440]  We'll see how it goes, right?
[56:49.440 --> 56:51.440]  We'll see what the, there'll be issues
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.960]  and it'll be complicated and it'll be weird.
[56:52.960 --> 56:56.120]  But like, I just wouldn't believe
[56:56.120 --> 56:58.560]  that Apple would try something quite this.
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.240]  That moment when they said it's gonna run iOS apps,
[57:00.240 --> 57:01.440]  I'm like, really?
[57:01.440 --> 57:02.280]  Really?
[57:02.280 --> 57:04.540]  It's like, yeah, they're going all the way.
[57:04.540 --> 57:07.580]  Yeah, well, we'll find out soon enough.
[57:07.580 --> 57:10.080]  But the last thing, before we move on from the Mac,
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.000]  I do wanna tell you, what better time to talk about it
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.820]  than now is your 20 Macs for 2020 podcast,
[57:17.820 --> 57:19.240]  limited run podcast.
[57:19.240 --> 57:21.320]  I think is a fair way to describe it.
[57:21.320 --> 57:26.080]  It's, what would be the Netflix equivalent limited series?
[57:26.080 --> 57:28.240]  I don't know, it's a limited series, it's a miniseries.
[57:28.240 --> 57:29.080]  It's a miniseries.
[57:31.080 --> 57:33.440]  How would you, what's the description?
[57:34.440 --> 57:35.920]  It's been going on for months,
[57:35.920 --> 57:39.020]  but for people, if they've missed it.
[57:39.020 --> 57:43.320]  Yeah, so I decided to give myself a project for 2020
[57:43.320 --> 57:46.780]  because working for myself in my office by myself,
[57:46.780 --> 57:48.760]  I wanted to have some structure.
[57:48.760 --> 57:50.240]  And I thought, well, this would be a fun thing.
[57:50.240 --> 57:53.600]  Why don't I make a top 20 list of notable Macs
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.160]  and write essays about each one
[57:55.160 --> 57:56.600]  and I'll roll it out over 20 weeks
[57:56.600 --> 57:58.060]  and that'll be kind of a fun project.
[57:58.060 --> 57:59.700]  And people like Liszt and Joe Pisnanski,
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.180]  who I mentioned earlier, the sports writer,
[58:01.180 --> 58:03.600]  he did a baseball 100 about the hundred greatest players
[58:03.600 --> 58:05.960]  in baseball history and I thought it was a fun idea.
[58:05.960 --> 58:08.040]  And also my friend, Simon Jerry,
[58:08.040 --> 58:10.360]  who was the editor in chief at Macworld UK for a long time,
[58:10.360 --> 58:12.520]  had a series called Apple A to Zed,
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.720]  where he wrote like, over 26 months in Macworld UK,
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.080]  he wrote his column was from A to Z.
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.920]  And I thought, this is a long-term project that's fun.
[58:22.920 --> 58:27.440]  I picked top 20 Macs because most of them
[58:27.440 --> 58:29.600]  I've either had are covered
[58:29.600 --> 58:33.460]  and in the expanse of Apple history.
[58:33.460 --> 58:35.540]  And honestly, if it had been 20 essays,
[58:35.540 --> 58:37.820]  it would have been a pretty easy project
[58:37.820 --> 58:39.160]  and I would be done with it by now.
[58:39.160 --> 58:40.720]  But at some point I said to myself,
[58:40.720 --> 58:44.680]  well, if I'm gonna do this, shouldn't there be a video
[58:44.680 --> 58:47.840]  and shouldn't there be a podcast?
[58:47.840 --> 58:52.440]  Which was my fail mistake because the podcast especially
[58:52.440 --> 58:55.280]  has been an awful lot of work because I ended up,
[58:55.280 --> 58:58.800]  the idea was that my essays are my kind of just take on this.
[58:58.800 --> 59:01.000]  I made the list and then I explained the list to you.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.500]  And I thought, well, a lot of other people
[59:03.500 --> 59:05.360]  have opinions about these systems
[59:05.360 --> 59:08.160]  and these Macs through history and they're personal
[59:08.160 --> 59:11.240]  and also sort of analytical about it.
[59:11.240 --> 59:13.640]  And I know a lot of people who have opinions about this.
[59:13.640 --> 59:17.880]  Why don't I talk to them and do a companion podcast
[59:17.880 --> 59:19.900]  that sort of is not just my voice,
[59:19.900 --> 59:23.280]  but is their voices about these systems that I've picked,
[59:23.280 --> 59:25.260]  these notable Macs.
[59:25.260 --> 59:26.840]  And so that's what it is.
[59:26.840 --> 59:28.680]  And you have been one of the participants in that.
[59:28.680 --> 59:30.440]  I just edited one for next week
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.960]  that has a whole little like place where the podcast stops
[59:34.960 --> 59:36.700]  because you have a theory
[59:36.700 --> 59:39.160]  about why a particular product failed
[59:39.160 --> 59:42.540]  and for about two minutes, it's like, okay, follow me here.
[59:42.540 --> 59:44.680]  And then it's John Gruber's gonna tell you
[59:44.680 --> 59:45.840]  why this product failed.
[59:45.840 --> 59:47.240]  And it's just been a lot of fun to do
[59:47.240 --> 59:49.400]  and I've gotten a lot of interesting people involved,
[59:49.400 --> 59:52.440]  people that you recognize from podcasts like you
[59:52.440 --> 59:55.560]  and Stephen Hackett and John Syracuse,
[59:55.560 --> 59:59.280]  but also some people I worked with way back in the day,
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.480]  like Shelley Brisbane, who I worked with at Mac User
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.160]  and Rick LaPage, who was the editor at Mac Week.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.320]  And along the way, there were a couple of times
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.840]  where I didn't actually know the history
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.320]  and talked to people who were involved,
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.880]  especially with a Mac clone era,
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.200]  because that was such a strange era.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.540]  And it's been a fun project
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.760]  and I'm really proud of the result.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.240]  It was a good creative challenge for me
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.120]  to learn a totally different kind of podcast.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.680]  It's not a conversational show like this.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.060]  It really is like I did interviews with all these people
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.340]  and I wrote a script and I put it all together
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.600]  and you hear all the different voices coming in and out.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.800]  And like, it's a whole, I'm pretty proud of it.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.320]  And so it's on Relay FM and they're releasing weekly
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.000]  and it's been a lot of fun.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.880]  It's been a lot of work,
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.920]  but that's why it is a limited series, right?
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.840]  I know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.400]  but at the end of the year, the project is over.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.280]  And that makes me happy too,
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.480]  because it's been a lot of work.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.080]  Again, if I just stuck to essays, I would have been fine,
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.720]  but I raised the bar for myself a little bit.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.460]  I love it.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.980]  I love my participation in it,
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.320]  but I also really love,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.060]  and behind the scenes, a bit of it is
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.800]  you invited me very kindly and very graciously,
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.560]  and I'm super happy to accept.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.640]  And so I'd be heartbroken if you didn't.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.480]  I really would.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.560]  I'd be so upset.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.680]  I'd be so mad.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.040]  Like if you and I had had some falling out at some point,
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.080]  I'd be like, I never should have pissed Jason Snell off,
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.720]  because I would still like to be on this series.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.840]  Really a thrill to be part of it.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.460]  But the part that's awesome is that you're like,
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.960]  look, you made the list, right?
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.520]  There was no voting.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.920]  You didn't send out polls.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.240]  This is Jason Snell's list of 20 max.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.640]  And it is what it is,
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.320]  and you're a nicer guy than I am
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.880]  in terms of how you broke that to people.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.720]  But,
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.360]  but it's a good,
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.440]  I think you did it exactly right.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.400]  I think it's brilliantly conceived in that way.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.720]  But then it's like, look, here are my picks.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.680]  Here are the, you know,
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.780]  which ones would you like to talk about?
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.840]  Which ones do you have strong opinions about?
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.400]  And there are some that I have
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.160]  extremely strong opinions about,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.520]  and there are some that I don't at all.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.560]  And so it's not like I had to make up stuff
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.900]  that I don't have a strong opinion about.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.600]  But I have found listening to those episodes to be,
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.640]  I love them.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.000]  I love the ones that I was like,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.640]  I don't care about that Mac.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.180]  But now I'm listening to it,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.120]  and I'm hearing stories,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.720]  and I'm like, huh, this is great.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.000]  And I forget which one it was.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.100]  I wish I remember.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.080]  I remember where I was in Philadelphia.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.680]  I was right around,
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.500]  literally, this is the way my mind works.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.600]  I remember I was right around 18th and Sansom Street
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.720]  here in Philadelphia.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.000]  And I'm listening to an episode.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.200]  Don't remember which Mac it was.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.140]  And I was so upset.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.680]  I was like, why didn't I tell Jason
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.800]  I wanted to talk about this one?
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.620]  These people are all,
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.460]  and then all of a sudden,
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.880]  and here's John Gruber.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.040]  And I'm like, oh, thank God.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.140]  I did talk about this.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.560]  And I made the exact point that I wanted,
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.880]  that I was thinking.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.120]  And I was like, oh yeah, yeah.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.200]  Thank God I was there to make those points.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.700]  I had that same location memory with podcasts
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.120]  where I can remember very specifically where I was
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.640]  if I was out walking around
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.800]  when I heard a particular thing.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.160]  It's a weird, weird thing.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.120]  But I'm glad you like it.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.740]  That is, I think that is a perfect moment.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.180]  Anybody who's edited podcasts,
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.880]  you have that moment where you think,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.180]  oh, I would make this joke here.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.400]  Or I would say this thing here.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.520]  And then you listen back and that's what you did.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.240]  I'm like, how do we get 10 minutes
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.280]  into talking about this Mac
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.960]  and nobody has brought up X, Y, and Z?
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.800]  And then there I am.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.600]  And it's like, ah, it's just great.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.640]  I think people who listen to,
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.760]  who enjoy listening to us talk,
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.080]  really, if you haven't been following,
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.200]  you should jump on it.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.120]  It is a great, great thing.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.480]  And I can only imagine how much work
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.680]  has gone into editing this,
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.800]  but it comes across so tight.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.160]  And it's just a delight to listen to.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.000]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.200]  It's been a lot of fun to do
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.840]  and a fun creative challenge.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.960]  I've been using this app called Descript,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.820]  which basically does speech-to-text transcription
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.440]  of all the audio files you give it.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.120]  And then you can actually edit your audio
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.700]  like a word processor.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.800]  So I get all of the Power Mac G5,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.680]  let's say, audio from every person I talk to
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.680]  and I paste it all into one document.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.920]  And then I kind of copy and paste
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.960]  and I move it around and then write some stuff.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.440]  And that's how those episodes get edited,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.160]  which is such a different approach
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.820]  from normal podcast editing.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.720]  But it is like editing,
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.740]  it's actually a lot like editing
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.400]  that report card thing I do every year
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.700]  where I'm taking downloads from people in emails
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.800]  and I'm kind of getting the best bits
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.200]  and organizing them together.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200]  It's a very similar thing,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.440]  except at the end you press a button
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.000]  and audio comes out, which is pretty amazing.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.160]  And there's a little more work you have to do,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.680]  but it's been fun to do that.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.880]  And the funniest thing
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.700]  is all of those interviews are separate, right?
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.400]  So you riff on something
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.040]  and John Syracuse riffs on something
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.920]  and James Thompson riffs on something.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.800]  And then I'm going through it
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.680]  and then like all of a sudden
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.160]  you're all riffing on it together.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.240]  Cause you all are talking about the same things
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.640]  with slightly different perspectives.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640]  And sometimes those are really magical
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.300]  where it's like you guys
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.560]  are finishing each other's sentences.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.200]  It's been a lot of fun to do.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.480]  So I'll be happy when it's over
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.320]  cause it's a lot of work,
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.900]  but I'm really enjoying the fact
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.740]  that we're in the top 10
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.480]  and we're counting down to number one
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.600]  because the Macs just get more interesting to me at least
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.280]  cause I made the list as we go.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.720]  You started this before Apple officially said
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.120]  that Apple Silicon Macs were coming, right?
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:28.960]  And-
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.740]  Yeah, I always started this list in December
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.660]  because I thought 2020 was just gonna be
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.280]  a perfectly normal year.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.880]  And we've been speculating about this for years.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.460]  You don't have to have any insiders telling you
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.600]  that they're working on it
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.600]  to just look at the numbers
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.780]  and think about Apple's desire
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.640]  for controlling their own stuff
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.800]  to think that Apple would be at least looking
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.420]  at making its own silicon.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.760]  But then there were rumors
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.480]  and Mark Gurman in particular has had some,
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.020]  I don't know, it was pretty much on the nose
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.020]  that this would be the year when they finally do it.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.980]  But it wasn't certain, right?
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.740]  I mean, I predicted it at least,
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.980]  I was at least two years early.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.340]  I thought they would do it by 2018.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.620]  John, I have been predicting Apple Silicon Macs
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.220]  for like three years in a row, something like that.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.100]  I do that at the end of the year for Mac world.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.220]  I write these prediction pieces
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.540]  are sort of like wish casting slash prediction.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.940]  And every year I do one that's like, how did I do?
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.620]  And for the last two or three years,
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.860]  it's been, well, no Macs running on ARM.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.060]  That still hasn't happened.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.380]  So I guess this year maybe we'll get it right.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.140]  But it's just so interesting
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.420]  because listening to the 20 for 20,
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.940]  part of what makes it so great
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.000]  is that there's such this vibrant history of oddball Macs.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.740]  And I say that not oddball like they were weird or bad,
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.880]  but like ones that just stick out.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.620]  It's just like a model.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.980]  I mean, the G3 first iMac,
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.580]  just everybody remembers it.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.500]  It just looks so different and so new.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:10.220]  And sure it had successors and the Dalmatian colors
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.640]  and there was some goofy stuff in there,
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.280]  but flower power, flower power.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.060]  But that first one really sticks out like, boom,
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.820]  this is new.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.480]  And there was a stretch where Apple,
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.040]  part of that malaise before their sort of,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.080]  that summit you referenced where they're like,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.580]  look, we've been thinking about this,
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.820]  backed ourselves into a thermal corner
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.780]  on the Mac Pro in particular,
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.780]  but we've also been working on a pro iMac,
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.940]  which we now know is the iMac Pro.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.980]  But there was sort of an undercurrent of that summit
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980]  that was sort of like,
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.060]  we've been rethinking the whole platform.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.700]  It's not just about the trashcan Mac Pro.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.860]  And I think that's what's gotten us here.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.660]  And they have come out with some models
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.220]  in the last few years
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.260]  that will be memorable historically.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.340]  10, 15 years from now,
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:11.340]  we will remember the first retina MacBook Air, right?
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.660]  Because we waited for it for so long
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.220]  and it was really good and popular
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.700]  and it had a bad keyboard.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.200]  We will remember that.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.580]  But there was a stretch there
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.260]  and I think the MacBook Air exemplifies that stretch
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.180]  of stagnant hardware,
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.780]  where before it went retina,
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.780]  when the $999 entry model MacBook Air
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.680]  looked exactly the same
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.060]  and had the exact same non-retina display
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:47.100]  seemingly for like a decade, which wasn't true,
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.940]  but it just felt like, man,
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.540]  this is like we were wearing bell bottoms
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.620]  and had sideburns back when this thing came out.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.260]  I mean, this was a long time ago.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.860]  And they came out with the iMac Pro
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.340]  and the new Mac Pros on Intel and launched last year.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.380]  And they've had some landmark Macs,
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.100]  but there's just no doubt in my mind,
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.060]  landmark Macs are coming.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:13.060]  Ones that when we do 30 for 30 in 10 years
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.740]  that we'll be talking about.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.900]  I think that's true.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.940]  I think it's gonna take,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.900]  it takes a little time to understand.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.260]  And I don't have a lot of very recent models on my list
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.960]  because I do think it takes a little time
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.900]  to understand quite why they were important
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.020]  and where they fit in kind of the sweep
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.320]  of 36 plus years of Mac history.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.140]  But I do think it's gotta be, right?
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.580]  Like they're gonna be some really remarkable things
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.740]  as a part of this transition.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.740]  And so, yeah, for 25 for 25 or 30 for 30, we'll revisit
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.540]  and I can rejigger my dumb list.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.940]  It's like when people come out with a list
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.980]  of the best 100 movies or 50 movies or something like that.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.500]  When you're 19, 20, 21 years old
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.620]  and you first feel like,
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.620]  oh, now I have an adult taste in cinema
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.260]  and I know what a real good movie is.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.660]  And those lists come out and you're like,
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:05.120]  why isn't these great movies from the last five years?
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.500]  Well, I can't believe they're not on the list.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.800]  You're biased by recent stuff.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.420]  It's like you kind of,
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.340]  when then you get a little bit older.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.700]  You don't have to be old, old,
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.420]  but you just, you get a little bit older
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.340]  and you realize you need to be a little biased
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.620]  against the newer stuff when you make these lists.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.940]  You gotta let them solidify in history.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.500]  And their story hasn't been told, right?
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.420]  Like you could argue that like,
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.780]  take the MacBook Air, right?
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.660]  That we now have that retina MacBook Air
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.660]  and you talked about how stale the old MacBook Air is,
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.660]  but that old MacBook Air
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.060]  was a hugely influential computer.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.380]  But until the retina MacBook Air came out,
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.800]  its story kind of wasn't over.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.660]  Like where does it fit?
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.940]  And then they did a new MacBook Air
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.780]  and you're like, oh, well,
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.900]  maybe the story of the MacBook Air continues.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.500]  Like it takes a little time.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.300]  Some of these things that I picked,
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.140]  it's very much like they have a beginning and an end.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.460]  And there are Macs that are boring in their success,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.060]  that they were obvious and they sold a lot
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.060]  and they survived for a decade or more.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.300]  But they're not particularly notable to me
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.460]  because it's just sort of a,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.620]  it's just a success story.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:16.420]  And I'm looking for interesting stories to tell.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.380]  That is part of what I'm going at with my list.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.660]  But I think that it's also true
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:23.300]  that you need to know how the story ends before
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.380]  and place it in context.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.300]  And that does take a little bit of time.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.100]  That I had a couple of people say,
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.780]  well, I'm sure you'll have the first Apple Silicon Mac
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.540]  on your list, I hope you left room for it.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.580]  And it's like, well, no, call me in five years
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.620]  when we know what the story of Apple Silicon was.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.180]  And I'll pick the one that tells the story the best.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.540]  But right now we just don't know.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.220]  Like I've got an iMac Pro, you mentioned it right here.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.960]  Is this a one-off?
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.940]  If it is, it might be notable in the sense
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.380]  that it represents a product designed for a future
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.660]  where the Mac was gonna get parked
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.260]  and then they changed their mind.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.300]  But right now I'm not comfortable saying that it's notable
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.500]  because I don't really know what that story is yet.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.880]  It's coming into focus,
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.860]  but it's gonna take a little bit of time.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.080]  So, yeah, give it a little, give it a little,
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.100]  put it in the bin, let it age a little,
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.580]  and we'll check back in five or 10 years
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.180]  and have a better idea.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.060]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.020]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.620]  Oh, it's my good friends.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.300]  I mean this sincerely because they keep my website going.

[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.980]  and they're just good people
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.080]  and they really, really know their stuff.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.100]  In addition to their shared and dedicated compute instances,
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.080]  you can use your $100 in credit
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.920]  on their S3 compatible object storage,
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.540]  managed Kubernetes,
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.900]  I don't even know how you pronounce this word,
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.280]  Kubernetes, Kuberneets, Kubernetes, and more.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.780]  Whatever, if you know what it is,
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.100]  you know how to pronounce it.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.140]  I've seen it, but you can apply your $100 in credit to it.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.340]  Let's say Kubernetes.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.460]  Kubernetes.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.700]  I don't know, I just made that up.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.700]  I have no idea how to say it.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.740]  Yeah, whatever.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.860]  If you, I don't know, how best can I mispronounce it?
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.460]  Kubernetes, Kubernetes.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:27.300]  Sounds like an island.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.940]  Kubernetes is like an Italian restaurant
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.900]  you go to with your parents.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.500]  It's exactly, it sounds like a good red sauce place.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.340]  Anyway, go to linode.com, L-I-N-O-D-E,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.600]  linode.com slash the talk show,
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.000]  and click on the Create Free Account button to get started,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.600]  and it gets you $100 in credit.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.380]  It's just a great company, great service.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.220]  I love them.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.540]  All right, before we move on, let me just say this.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.820]  20 for 20, these are all,
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.940]  is it true?
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.480]  Did you pick Good Max?
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.700]  Is that sort of the?
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.060]  No, oh no.
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.500]  They're landmark Max, right?
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.420]  It's 20 most notable is the weasel word I used,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.860]  because I didn't, I thought a best Max list
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.700]  would be boring.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.380]  Also, you could argue that the latest Max
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.740]  are always gonna be the best,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.700]  because, or you have to start doing like moneyball stuff
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.180]  where you're like, well, if we calculate out
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.980]  which one was the most effective per dollar
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.740]  in that era or whatever,
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.660]  and it gets really weird really fast.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.780]  So I want it to be completely subjective.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:31.420]  And again, kind of want it to be notable
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.780]  really means like has an interesting story to tell
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.860]  and fits, is important in the larger story
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.780]  of the history of the Mac, I guess I would say about it.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.740]  So some of them are, especially lower down on the list,
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.300]  are spectacular failures.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:50.300]  And some of them, some of the failures are failures
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.700]  despite the fact that they have brilliance in them.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:53.540]  The Mac portable.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.980]  And some of them, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.140]  Some of them are just failures, right?
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.220]  And the Mac portable is just kind of a failure.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.820]  The 20th anniversary Macintosh,
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.660]  as weird and interesting as it is, was also a flop.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.980]  I found out that as a part, I didn't do a lot of reporting,
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.300]  but I did a little bit of reporting
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:12.300]  for some of these stories that Gil Amelio
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.460]  just wanted them to ship it.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.860]  He thought it would be his legacy as a visionary.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.300]  And it was, so they picked this thing off
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.260]  of the Johnny Ives concept lineup,
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.380]  and they said, let's ship it.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.900]  And then they're like, everybody at Apple was like,
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:29.340]  ah, but how are we gonna do that?
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.500]  And they're like, well, go to Bose
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.060]  and attach a speaker to it,
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.140]  and at least it'll sound good, and stuff like that.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.780]  Literally what happened.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.020]  And then I found out in the podcast portion of this
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.060]  from my old boss, Rick LePage,
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.940]  who worked at Mac Week at the time,
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.060]  that apparently Gil Amelio had it
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.100]  in his severance agreement,
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.500]  that one of the things he would get
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.820]  beyond his golden parachute
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.940]  was a 20th anniversary Mac of his own.
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.820]  So even then he was like, this shall be my legacy.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.100]  And that's just a bad product
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.500]  that should never have been shipped as a product.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.220]  I'm glad it escaped because it's so fun,
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.660]  but it should never have been a product.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.580]  And that's on the list,
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.900]  because I feel like it says things about the Amelio era,
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.620]  right when Steve Jobs came back,
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.980]  and sort of like the brilliance
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.380]  of Apple's internal design lab,
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.780]  but the fact that products should not escape from it.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.700]  And so it's on the list, because it's super notable.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.580]  Like, how can you tell the story of the Mac
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.140]  and not mention, get a load of this thing that they did
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.660]  for the 20th anniversary of Apple, not the Mac,
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.820]  and released it on basically the 21st anniversary of Apple,
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.060]  so they didn't even get that right.
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.340]  I mean, how can I not tell that story?
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.380]  One of the little things that was so wrong about it
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.660]  is that, famously, to Mac fans,
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.860]  because this was a time, the show aired
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:46.420]  in a time when the Mac was sort of beleaguered,
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.540]  as we like to say.
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.260]  Jerry Seinfeld always had a Mac on his desk
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.540]  in the back of his living room,
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.700]  a section of the set that never really featured
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.340]  into the plot, but it was just sort of set dressing.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:03.100]  And at one point, he had a 20th anniversary Mac,
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.580]  which was so incongruous,
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:09.140]  because the Macs that he had there before were like,
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.060]  yeah, of course, the Jerry Seinfeld character
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.540]  in the show Seinfeld, of course he would have a Mac,
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.780]  because he likes nice things and he's fussy.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.380]  And the Mac is, even in the 90s,
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.980]  when the Mac maybe wasn't doing so well overall
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.580]  in the market, Jerry Seinfeld would be a Mac user.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.820]  Everybody who was a Mac user at the time knows
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:32.060]  that Seinfeld had a Mac on the show,
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.300]  but he would never have a 20th anniversary Mac.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:39.940]  A, the character Jerry Seinfeld was not a gazillionaire,
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.620]  but even the real life Jerry Seinfeld,
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:47.620]  who was the 20 million dollar a year star
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.100]  of the biggest show on network television,
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:54.220]  would know, no, no, this is not,
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.400]  I don't know what this is, this is ridiculous, right?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.220]  It was so incongruous.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.940]  But Apple couldn't get rid of them fast enough,
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.820]  and so they unloaded them all on movies and TV shows
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.380]  and the set dresser obviously thought
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.700]  that this was really interesting.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.420]  It looked cool, it looked like it was from the future,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.140]  but the Seinfeld show was not sci-fi, it was,
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.300]  all right, how about this, before we move on?
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.340]  How about, pick a not, I'm gonna put you on the spot,
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.620]  pick a not notable Mac.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:26.240]  Pick a Mac that was never going to make 20 for 20.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.260]  I have one.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.140]  Okay, this is, okay, I'm gonna give you mine.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.980]  All right.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.960]  The iMac G5, because if you think about it,
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.200]  the iMac G4 with the flower petal design and all of that,
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.600]  like the flower petal design and all of that,
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.800]  and that was my pick this week, right?
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.800]  Number nine is a brilliant piece of design.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.160]  It belongs in a museum.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.140]  I think it is in a museum.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.120]  I have one in my office here.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.480]  I love it, it's just gorgeous.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.680]  And when they announced it, Apple was like,
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.780]  LCDs are gonna transform computers,
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.420]  and this is gonna be the next 10 years of desktop design,
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.120]  is this thing where it floats on an arm.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.320]  And in two years it was dead.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.800]  And its replacement was the iMac G5,
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.680]  which was everything that Steve Jobs
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.440]  in the launch of the iMac G4 had said,
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.960]  here's what we're not gonna do.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.360]  We're not just gonna stick a computer on the back of it,
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.140]  because that would be, what good would that be?
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.320]  We want it to be thin and light.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.160]  And then literally that's what they did.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.440]  And the reason that it wouldn't make my list
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.920]  is because I think it's important.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.280]  In fact, it really is still what the iMac is today.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.200]  Like literally, he said set up for the next decade
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.760]  with the G4, and it turned out that iMac G5
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.000]  set them up for the next decade and a half and counting.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.920]  But it's super boring and it's successful,
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.640]  but like, what's the story?
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.240]  The story is really the failure of the beautiful Mac,
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.440]  not the success of the boring Mac.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.840]  And they didn't, it's like Apple giving up
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.760]  and realizing they have to sort of go back to reality
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.140]  and make something that's more boring, but more practical.
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.440]  And like, that's not a fun story to tell.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.320]  So that's my, one of my suggestions of something
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.640]  that didn't make the list, even though I think
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.360]  it's actually very interesting and I could tell
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.920]  a story about it, because what's the story in the end?
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.800]  It's sort of like, Apple didn't want to build it,
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.760]  but they had to, and now we still have them.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.580]  That's it.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.420]  Here's my pick.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:30.180]  My pick is 1993's Macintosh Color Classic.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.800]  That's a good one.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.240]  That's a good one.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.760]  Which is, I think for a lot of people,
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.960]  even if you were around at the time,
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.760]  you're like, wait, was that a real thing?
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.720]  And it was, it was a real thing.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.160]  And when, I gotta put this in the show notes.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.860]  It got everything wrong.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.060]  Yep, it got everything wrong,
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:57.160]  because they picked the worst aspects.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.140]  This is a machine that came out in 1993.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.320]  It had, you think, oh, it was basically
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.620]  the classic Mac form factor that reached a pinnacle
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:10.620]  with the SE30, which came out in 1989.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.800]  But that was the end of the era,
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.880]  and those black and white screens had their advantages.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.240]  They really were sharp.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.240]  They were sharp in a way that color CRTs weren't.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.820]  Right.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.000]  And there was just no reason to have a nine inch,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.800]  512 pixel wide color display.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.840]  There was just no reason.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.280]  Nobody wanted a small display.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.880]  And you know that that was some sales guy at Apple
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.320]  in the channel who was like,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.920]  look, we're getting killed on color.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.140]  Just the color in it.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.440]  People loved the classic Mac form factor
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440]  for many reasons.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.200]  People have fond memories of it,
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.160]  but they loved it despite the fact
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.200]  that it had a nine inch, 512 pixel wide,
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.480]  512 by 384 display.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.840]  Like, it was like, that was the pressing the limits
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.020]  of a bitmap display technology for the 80s
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.800]  in the consumer level pricing,
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.960]  which in the 80s was like thousands of dollars.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.980]  In 1993, nobody wanted this.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.960]  And then they vaguely made it look like a Mac,
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.060]  but they used the modern beige colors
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:19.120]  and sort of perform a styling and dots.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.680]  And it's like, I'm looking at a picture of it right now.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.720]  And it's so much uglier than I remember.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.560]  And-
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.300]  Yeah, it is big and weird and unpleasant.
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.900]  I don't like the classic line at all.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.160]  And I know that there are a lot of people
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.200]  of a certain age where that's the first Mac that they got,
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.640]  because it was, in some ways,
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.880]  the most affordable Mac was that original classic
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.720]  and then the classic two, which was basically,
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.640]  the classic was the SE and the classic two was the SE 30.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.640]  But I hate those, because first off, they were old.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.200]  It really is just repackaging old tech.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.840]  And they took that really nice,
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.400]  it's called the Snow White design language.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.800]  There are a couple of episodes that touch on it
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.080]  in the 20 Mac series.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.960]  And they replaced it with what I view as like
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.920]  this weird simulacrum of what the original Mac looked like,
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.180]  but like done from memory of like what popular memory
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.460]  of what the Mac looks like,
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.080]  but it doesn't actually look like it.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.520]  So they're weird and kind of featureless and drab
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.080]  and I hate them.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.200]  So it's a great, and the color classic then distorts it
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.320]  beyond even recognition.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.320]  Now it's just a very strange, big blob of an all-in-one.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.240]  It's not good.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.520]  All the limitations of the classic Macs that people loved
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.360]  and none of the charm, it was bizarre.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.840]  Which could it be notable?
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.080]  I guess it could, but yeah, I'm with you where I feel like
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.120]  it's just sort of a sad footnote in history.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.320]  And if your first Mac was a color classic, I'm sorry,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.460]  nostalgia is a powerful thing here.
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.600]  It's not a computer that I'm nostalgic for at all.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.680]  Yeah, and the most, and again, my memory was,
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.180]  if you had asked me before I looked it up here,
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.240]  what year did it come out?
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.680]  I would have thought, I'm not sure,
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.080]  but I would guess around 1993.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.400]  And it's not because I remember it came out in 1993.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.560]  I'm like, that 1993 seems like when Apple's leadership
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.880]  would think that's something we should ship, right?
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.100]  And it was a dead canary in the coal mine of,
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.200]  hey, we're going the wrong way.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.640]  This company is going the wrong way here.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.360]  I think there's gas at the mine.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.960]  We should turn around.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.320]  Anyway, we have new stuff to talk about.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.160]  Okay, sure.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.960]  iPad Air, and you reviewed it, I reviewed it.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.880]  I think this is a very interesting device.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.360]  I loved your lead for it, which was basically
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.880]  that Apple is so confident in where the iPad is
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.920]  and where the iPad Pro is that they just took
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.020]  everything great about it, except for Face ID,
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.760]  and said, okay, now this is the iPad Air.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.760]  This is like the mainstream iPad for people.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.540]  It's a great product.
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:01.540]  I'm not quite sure where it is right now price-wise,
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:06.980]  but going forward, I think this is great for the lineup.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.060]  Yeah, it's a weird product because it's the case
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.300]  where there's definitely another shoe to drop.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:18.060]  It is so close, and if you equalize the storage,
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.620]  it's only like 150 bucks cheaper at the higher storage point
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.020]  than the iPad Pro that's 11 inches that uses
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.860]  the same accessories, and that's too close.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.420]  It's too close, and it's taken too many features
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.980]  from the iPad Pros.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.820]  For there not to be an iPad Pro update coming,
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.940]  that is gonna have a bunch of new features
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.720]  that separate these two products, and I realized
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.060]  as I was writing this review, probably also raising
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.980]  the price of the iPad Pro, that's probably happening too.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:48.380]  I don't think we're gonna see a 799 base model iPad Pro.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.780]  It will probably go up, and that'll be, again,
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.920]  part of the differentiator, but what Apple will be able
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:57.920]  to say is, yes, but, starting at 599, we have the iPad Air,
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:01.940]  which has, at this point, almost all the features
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.340]  that were introduced in 2018 in the iPad Pro.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.760]  It doesn't have Face ID, which obviously
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.460]  that TrueDepth sensor costs, and it was a way for them
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.860]  to save some money, although they did build
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.300]  that new, nifty Touch ID sensor, but it's got
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.340]  Apple Pencil 2, it supports the Magic Keyboard,
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.420]  which means that technically, Apple's cheapest laptop now,
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:24.500]  you could argue, is the iPad Air with the Magic Keyboard,
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:29.500]  899, 898, but it's great, like, the product is great,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.780]  and the price, especially the entry price,
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.800]  if you're storing stuff in the cloud and 64 gigs is fine,
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.740]  like, you get access to all of this really nice tech
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.780]  for a much lower price than the iPad Pro ever provided.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.380]  The question is, but what about the iPad Pro?
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.820]  And the answer is 2021, I think.
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:55.060]  Clearly, the next step is for them to spread the iPads
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.060]  back out by having a brand new Pro that is even more,
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.600]  you know, advanced and pushes away from the iPad Air,
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.020]  but that product doesn't exist, so in the meantime,
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.740]  the Air and the 11-inch Pro are really close together.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.460]  Yeah, and I think that it'll make a lot more sense,
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.040]  like you said, it's another shoe to drop,
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.940]  which is the next generation iPad Pro.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.500]  I do think price is going up and, you know, that's, you know.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.020]  Never bet against Apple raising prices, John, never.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.860]  Exactly.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.900]  Always round up, always add on a little something.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.500]  You're never gonna go broke
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.140]  betting that Apple raises prices.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.740]  Sometimes they don't, but like, if they can, they will.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:36.220]  Yeah, are they gonna lower the prices significantly,
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.640]  notably by 50 bucks, 25 bucks,
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.460]  if they take the power adapters out of the iPhone box?
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.340]  No, probably not.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.620]  Probably not.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.060]  And you can't look at the iPad Air and say,
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.380]  well, maybe they'll lower the price
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.300]  of the base model iPad Pros.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.820]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:54.000]  There's an outside shot that they'll keep it the same,
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.260]  but probably they'll raise it,
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.500]  and maybe they won't have an 11-inch.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.940]  Maybe it'll be larger that they'll start out or something,
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:03.180]  but like, clearly, there's another story going on here
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.180]  because you can't have this high-end Pro iPad,
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:11.020]  but the only differences are like ProMotion
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.440]  and Face ID.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.740]  Like, it's not, I feel like it's not enough,
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.920]  and that's the confidence part that you mentioned
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.980]  that I put in my story is, this is a product that,
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.500]  the iPad Air is a product that's released by a company
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.820]  that has such confidence in how they're rolling
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.300]  in terms of bringing out new iPad features
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.500]  that they can release this now
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.680]  because they know they're gonna beat it
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.780]  with a new Pro model that's gonna clearly differentiate,
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:35.980]  and so they can afford to pull those features down
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:39.500]  and pull the Apple Pencil 2 down into this product.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:43.460]  One of the interesting things, to me,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.300]  more interesting, I'm glad I noted it, I almost didn't,
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.860]  and I thought, ah, it's so weird I gotta note it,
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:53.860]  but to upgrade for the same storage on the iPad,
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.140]  it's usually a very consistent price
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.300]  to go from a Wi-Fi-only model to cellular,
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.340]  and I thought it jumped out at me that with this new iPad Air
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.300]  whatever you wanna get, let's say it's 100,
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.020]  or I guess there isn't a 128, 256.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.780]  You get 256 gigabytes, it costs 130 bucks
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.940]  to get the same thing with cellular.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:17.220]  With the iPad Air, it's 150 bucks to upgrade
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:20.780]  to get the same storage but with cellular networking,
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.380]  and that seemed weird to me,
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.640]  and a couple people pointed out that the way that,
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.220]  I don't know if it's a Qualcomm thing specifically,
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.800]  I don't know what it is, but there's licenses
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.300]  for cellular networking where the license cost
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.180]  is related to the price of the product.
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:41.180]  It's like a percentage of the price of the product,
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:45.620]  and I'm not quite sure, I can't vouch and say that's why,
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:50.840]  and I'm not quite sure also if that's true,
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:54.340]  how it's, why you don't have to pay a higher premium
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:59.340]  for a one terabyte, 13-inch iPad Pro
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:04.340]  that costs like $1,300 as opposed to a $900,
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.940]  smaller iPad Pro, that's a significant difference.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.940]  Maybe they just average it, maybe it's like,
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:15.940]  okay, it's the average price of an iPad Pro is blank,
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:20.140]  and therefore the licensing fee for cellular is here,
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:22.440]  and because it's higher, they have to charge more
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.520]  for the iPad Pro than the iPad Air,
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.220]  but the interesting thing about this theory
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.540]  that it's related to the average price
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.700]  is it makes me wonder if that's part,
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:35.220]  a big part of the answer to why we haven't seen
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.180]  cellular built in to Macs.
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.840]  Yep, could be.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.760]  Because that's- Could be,
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.000]  if it's a huge hit, right?
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.020]  That's a question that we've been asking.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.700]  That's one, and it's like we really have been asking
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.860]  for a very long time.
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:53.860]  I would say ever since the iPad came out with cellular
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:58.060]  is this is great, it is great to have a device like this
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.600]  with cellular networking built in.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.900]  I love it for travel.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.020]  I use it in the park where there is no Wi-Fi.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.980]  I use it in hotels where I would rather not use the Wi-Fi.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.700]  Boy, I would like to do this with my Mac,
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:18.180]  and it, to me personally, I mean, number one for 2020,
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.500]  I haven't left my house much,
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.100]  so hasn't been that much of an issue,
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:27.180]  but in recent years, tethering to iPhones
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:32.180]  has been so good and so easy to do from the Mac
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.020]  that I don't even know if I would buy
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.220]  a cellular equipped MacBook Pro.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:38.500]  I probably wouldn't.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.240]  I know that that's one of the things people are wondering
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.980]  if Apple's been holding for the Apple Silicon models,
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.460]  whether it's just easier for them to do it
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.980]  based on the same architecture
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:51.880]  that they've been building iPads on and iPhones,
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.220]  which obviously have cellular,
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.980]  or if it's just like, this is a thing we're gonna wait
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:00.020]  so that we can make this big splash with.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.860]  It's not just Apple Silicon,
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.740]  which doesn't really mean much to non-technical people,
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.900]  but cellular does.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.820]  They understand, hey, this is something
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.700]  you can use in the park.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.320]  I'm assuming that it's gonna happen
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.340]  when they have their own cellular modems, right,
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.020]  because they bought Intel's cellular business,
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.720]  and right now they're shipping Qualcomm modems
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.140]  in the 5G phones,
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.580]  but once they have their own,
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.100]  that's the moment where I think
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.340]  that they would put it in the Mac,
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.760]  because then it's their own tech.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.420]  They're not paying a licensing fee to include that,
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:33.580]  and then turn it on when you,
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:37.960]  obviously they'll do something to upcharge people for it,
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.060]  but they won't have to pay that to Qualcomm,
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.300]  or Intel, or anybody, it'll be their money.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.120]  Well, but there might be,
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.380]  I think there's patents, though,
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.700]  that are licensed by a cost,
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.540]  so they might still have to.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.260]  Yeah, probably some patents.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.340]  Yeah, I mean, there's something,
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:54.300]  but I think it's more plausible, at least, than,
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:58.140]  but yeah, I'm now an iPad, cellular iPad believer,
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.100]  and so I get it now, where I'm like,
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.820]  yeah, I could see why you'd want that in a laptop,
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:03.980]  just because then you don't have to worry about,
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.460]  for an extra whatever, $10 a month
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.440]  to add it to your existing cellular plan,
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.940]  you don't, I was in a,
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:12.620]  we were taking my daughter up to college,
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.700]  and I'm sitting in the car, looking at my iPhone,
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.940]  and I realize, oh, I could just get my iPad out,
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:21.260]  because I'm just sitting in the passenger seat,
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.900]  and it doesn't, they're both cellular devices,
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.460]  so I don't, and it's just habit
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.500]  of that I don't usually have my iPad with me,
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.100]  but it's such a nice thing to be like,
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:33.300]  oh, you know, anywhere I am, my iPad is on the internet,
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.700]  so I would love to have that on a laptop eventually.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:40.620]  Yeah, and I, so I still, I believe it's coming,
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.960]  but I, to me, the interesting thing to file away
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.100]  for future reference is, you know,
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.260]  will it be like $130 upgrade for MacBook Airs,
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:51.360]  or whatever they call it, if they stick with the names,
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.380]  who knows if they even, if that's how big a change
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.380]  Apple Silicon's gonna bring,
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:56.260]  but the equivalent of MacBook Airs
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.720]  be cheaper to get a cellular model than MacBook Pros,
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.020]  and then, to me, that would say,
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.420]  hey, part of this might have been just licensing costs,
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.600]  but we shall see.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.420]  Otherwise, the other big notable thing about the iPad Air,
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:15.060]  the new one, is the touch ID sensor on the power button,
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.060]  which is new, and, you know,
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.900]  I think everybody who said they were hoping for it
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:24.860]  on the iPhones knew that that was just, you know,
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.140]  you know, it's like wishing that you hit the lottery.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.660]  It wasn't gonna happen this year.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:30.500]  Just, we-
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:31.900]  I think it's an interesting data point
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:35.220]  in that we talk about Apple spending years on these things,
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:37.260]  and they're working a year or two ahead,
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.860]  but like, with COVID, we got,
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.060]  it's an interesting data point,
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.940]  because we know that they have this technology,
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.180]  and they knew at some point
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:46.100]  that everybody was wearing masks,
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.620]  and so we could draw a line there and say, okay,
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.100]  this appears to be beyond Apple's capability to change,
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:56.040]  because I think if, in May,
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.740]  they could have swapped in the iPad Air,
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.540]  a version of the iPad Air technology,
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.400]  into the iPhone, they would have.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.980]  I really do think that if they could have, they would have,
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:08.000]  because they have the technology,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.780]  and they could have prioritized it,
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.180]  because they know that Face ID is suddenly less valuable
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:16.860]  than it used to be, but, you know,
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.420]  and I assume that they at least had a conversation about it,
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.720]  but that tells us something, right?
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.260]  It tells us that whatever the window is
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:26.440]  to do a last-minute change to add or change something,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.860]  not to remove necessarily,
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.860]  but to change something on the iPhone,
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:35.220]  COVID-19 clearly being an issue was out of the window.
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.700]  It took them longer than that.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.340]  Well, and I think another interesting way to think about it
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:42.820]  is think about the iPhone event from a couple weeks ago.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.180]  Do you recall them even mentioning Face ID?
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.380]  I don't think they did, and if they did,
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:52.460]  it was maybe like a bullet point on a slide somewhere.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.580]  I mean, they didn't talk like,
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.260]  hey, it's faster than ever, who knows?
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.860]  They just don't talk about it,
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:00.940]  because it's awkward at this point to ship devices
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.980]  whose login method is this thing that doesn't work
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.340]  when you're outside because of a thing
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.280]  that they don't really wanna talk about
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.700]  because it's unpleasant, right?
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.380]  The whole pandemic is not exactly a pleasant term,
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.480]  and it's not a pleasant situation.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.860]  And just from a product marketing standpoint,
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.440]  it's just not a great time
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.140]  to launch face-driven authentication.
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:25.720]  It really is bad timing historically,
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.740]  because this pandemic could have hit at any time.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.420]  It could have hit four years ago,
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:34.220]  could have hit 10 years ago, could hit 10 years from now.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:39.220]  It just happened to hit right when Face ID was new.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.880]  I know, I remember getting emails
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.960]  from daring Fireball readers
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.720]  and probably listeners of the show.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.920]  Couple of them who are medical professionals
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.320]  who wear masks because they, and they're unrelated to COVID.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.280]  This is starting from the iPhone 10,
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.240]  that this was a pain for them.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.220]  This was annoying because they wear masks,
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.300]  and they have to if they're surgeons and stuff like that.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.320]  You might think, well, why are you touching your phone
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.560]  at all if you're scrubbed up or whatever?
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:15.280]  But it's not like they're touching their phone
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:17.200]  while they're doing surgery, right?
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.040]  I mean, they're surgeons, they're professional,
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.780]  but they don't wanna take their mask off.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:24.160]  They can't in some cases.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.480]  Then this is a real thing.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.320]  And Touch ID worked, and Face ID doesn't,
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.360]  and there are doctors who regretted upgrading to Face ID
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.440]  phones before this even happened.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.160]  So this is something Apple knew about.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.560]  I'm sure Apple is aware that there are people
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.320]  for whom Face ID didn't work.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.400]  And I also heard from people who,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:46.520]  my readership is largely,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.040]  and certainly the feedback I get is all in English
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.560]  because it's the only language I can read,
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.640]  but people who go to Asia and wear a face mask wearing
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.080]  in cold and flu season is very common,
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.720]  and it's just considered a courtesy.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.480]  Who knows how long it's,
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.880]  this might be a lasting change now throughout the world
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.600]  that when you have a cold, you'll politely wear a face mask
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.040]  to keep from spreading germs to other people.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:14.040]  Now that we've broken this taboo on doing what it was,
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.500]  and let's face it, it was weird at first.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:19.680]  It's still weird, but it was really weird at first.
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.720]  They knew about it, but now that it's hit home,
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.640]  and everybody's dealing with it,
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.400]  I'm sure if they were thinking,
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.880]  yeah, there's something where we integrate Touch ID
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.000]  as a secondary biometric authentication,
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.200]  sure, we could look at that.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.080]  It has to be a higher priority.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.680]  Yeah, and also I'm curious what investigation they've done
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.680]  in terms of training the existing Face ID sensor staff
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.320]  to train on an alternate method of recognition
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.640]  that might not be as quite as accurate or as secure,
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.580]  but would be better than nothing.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.800]  So you could optionally turn on,
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.320]  also recognize me with a face covering
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.560]  or something like that.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.800]  I don't know whether they have investigated that
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.760]  and decided that it's just not possible,
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.480]  or whether that's something
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.080]  that they are actively investigating,
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.440]  because that would be the other way to go, right?
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.000]  Is maybe we don't need Touch ID,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.480]  maybe what we need is Face ID that works above the mask.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.480]  Is there enough data above the mask for us to make a guess
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.840]  about whether this is the person or not?
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.200]  And maybe the answer is no,
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.440]  but I think that's, I would imagine
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.160]  that all these conversations have happened at Apple,
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.960]  because they do want their product
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.360]  to be useful to their customers,
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.260]  and it was built with some assumptions
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.640]  that are probably no longer true.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.080]  Yeah, and they're definitely living it themselves,
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.560]  which helps, and I mean that in a non-pejorative sense.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.800]  I will pejoratively hold it against them
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.420]  that they seemingly design every product they make
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.720]  without the knowledge that some places it rains.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.480]  I just posted a screenshot yesterday
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.720]  of the rain complication.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.020]  If it's 100% chance of rain, it doesn't fit.
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.800]  Yeah, one, zero, dot, dot, dot, yeah.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.200]  It's like, yeah, and then-
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.120]  Well, that's the story about how Apple Mail
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.760]  has always been bad on slow connections,
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.880]  on slow internet connections,
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.200]  but until they started doing Wi-Fi on airplanes,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.440]  nobody at Apple ever noticed.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.080]  Right, and then all of a sudden, they're like,
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.520]  yeah, we gotta fix this, and we're like,
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.480]  yeah, we've been telling you, you know.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.360]  So I'm sure they're looking at it.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.920]  I don't know if they'll be able to fix it by now.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.240]  I don't know what the answer is.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:31.240]  And in theory, it's clearly possible eventually
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.080]  for Face ID to get good enough to recognize this
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.000]  with a mask, because I know that if I ran into you
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.960]  on the street, I would know, hey, that's Jason,
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.380]  if you were wearing a mask.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:42.520]  I know you well enough.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:46.280]  And humans, my God, we are so good at recognizing faces.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.920]  I mean, but that's the gold standard, right?
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.720]  I mean, the gold standard is the human brain
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.800]  and eye system at recognizing people we know, right?
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.640]  We're so good at it.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.680]  And pattern matching, that's what we're best at,
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:41:59.520]  is pattern matching.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.680]  Right, and everybody knows it's a common thing
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.880]  where you recognize somebody,
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.980]  but you know you know them because of their face.
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.200]  You have no idea what their name is.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.680]  Oh my God, what's that woman's name?
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.780]  Oh, or you might know, like, oh my God,
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.440]  that's that one kid's parent from school.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.120]  Ugh, I don't even remember the kid's name.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.400]  But I know I know them, you know it.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.040]  And you're like, I gotta go the other way
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.880]  because I don't wanna, you know, embarrass myself
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.000]  by not remembering who they are.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.480]  Your brain certainly remembers their face.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.280]  So if we can do it, computers can do it,
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.200]  but whether that's like a, oh, we can fix the existing tech
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.500]  or no, we need the whole face, like, to get this,
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.200]  we need the whole face and we are nowhere near doing it
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.920]  just from what's exposed, you know,
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.080]  between like somebody wearing a hoodie with a face mask,
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.780]  forget it, you know, I don't know.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:51.500]  Yeah, and then there are, I mean,
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.820]  if they're writing things on a whiteboard,
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.220]  you throw things in there like,
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.600]  could I do it based on location?
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.920]  Could I have a different authentication
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.660]  that's available in certain circumstances?
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:02.260]  Could I set up a geofence that when I go to the store,
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.920]  when I'm in the supermarket,
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.840]  please let me just put in a code then,
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.300]  but the rest of the time, I wanna use face ID
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.260]  and I don't wanna toggle that setting or,
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:14.060]  you know, there are things that are kinda like outliers.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.500]  They may also be talking about, yeah,
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.620]  could we change the face ID sensor stack
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.540]  so that it's, the camera in there is like an infrared camera
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.200]  and then we can map to the infrared underneath,
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.740]  we can see underneath the mask.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:26.680]  I don't know, this is why those people get paid
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.340]  a lot of money to think about this all day,
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:29.800]  but like, it's clearly something
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.460]  that they've gotta be grappling with
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.260]  and I don't think this is going away.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:34.940]  To your point, I think you've gotta make a bet
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.420]  that we know that in certain cultures,
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.860]  mask wearing is already an issue
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.740]  and certain occupations, it's an issue
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.540]  and I would probably make the bet
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:45.260]  that the prevalence of mask wearing in society
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:48.620]  for the next 10 years is gonna be pretty high.
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.880]  Even if it's not what it is right now,
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.560]  I think it's gonna stay around
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.980]  and that Apple needs to plan for that
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.480]  because they built a technology that doesn't work with it.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.160]  Yeah, and you know, humans, we're just weird.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.660]  We're weird, we're not computers, we're so,
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:04.780]  we're not Spock, we are not logical
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.860]  and you know, now that we've broken the seal on this,
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:12.100]  I mean, these sort of coronavirus type things,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:14.300]  we've had outbreaks, there were like four of them
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:15.920]  during the Obama administration
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.540]  and not to get into which administration handled
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.360]  which thing, I mean, this is obviously worse
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.700]  and no matter what the US, you know,
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:26.340]  every government, every country around the world
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.400]  has had a worse outbreak of this,
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.380]  way worse than any of these other things
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.900]  so this one was different
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:36.200]  but I think the fact that we know,
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.620]  we just know that even if we get this one under control,
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.360]  three with four years from now,
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.460]  there's gonna be another one
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:44.780]  and hopefully it'll be like, you know,
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:48.700]  H1N1 was the swine flu and it just won't be that big a deal
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:52.140]  but when that happens, I think we're all gonna mask up
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.940]  on airplanes and stuff like that, right?
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:56.100]  Like even when it's not a pandemic
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:58.100]  that we're shutting down and spreading,
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.340]  I think when it's like, hey, there's a new virus
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.980]  spreading out of Asia and it's, you know,
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.980]  this could be bad, airlines will just say,
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:07.940]  yeah, we're gonna, you know,
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.180]  we're gonna save masks on for flights, you know?
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:14.780]  Yeah, or if there's a really bad flu outbreak, right?
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.740]  Just say, everybody has the wherewithal now
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.960]  to be like, oh, I have masks, I can wear a mask,
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.800]  I know how to do that.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.120]  This is how, you know, after 100 years
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.380]  of having a worldwide pandemic, everybody forgets
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:29.040]  but we haven't been through it now.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.020]  I was talking about this with my wife
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.140]  because she works at a library
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.420]  and like when the pandemic happened,
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:34.700]  they're like, well, what do we do?
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.820]  And then they shut down
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.620]  and then they sort of slowly figured it out
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:41.580]  but the difference is now they know like what to do
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.380]  and I think every business has sort of done that.
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.860]  So if something happens again,
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.400]  you don't have to like look around and be like,
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.240]  oh no, what do we do?
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.020]  They're like, execute plan A, right?
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:53.980]  Like we already did this, we know what we need to do
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.220]  and whether that's mask wearing or it's like,
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.520]  we're gonna go to takeout only for a month
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.700]  and then we'll come back.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:02.580]  Like we know all of us had had to figure that out
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.420]  and now the society has figured it out.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.220]  So I agree with you.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:09.100]  I think that you're gonna find that certain cultures
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.700]  and certain societies are gonna have a much more easy way
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:15.000]  to flip a switch to say, oh, something is spreading.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.780]  Let's put a cap on it by doing these five things
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.900]  for public health, including more people wearing masks.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.580]  And yeah, so the net result may be
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.980]  that like flu seasons aren't as bad
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.040]  and other things that are spreading don't spread as readily
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.040]  because we've all kind of learned for now our lesson
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.100]  about how to handle this one.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:37.260]  Yeah, I mean, honestly, I think like 30, 40 years ago,
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:39.180]  if you went back and just said, hey, and by the way,
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.700]  every year they're just gonna, it's good advice,
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.660]  like going to the dentist once a year,
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.420]  you should get a flu shot and people would be like,
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.120]  what, what the hell are you talking about, flu shot?
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.180]  You just learn to adapt to little things
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:54.240]  and I think, I just really, really feel, I'm not certain,
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:57.200]  but I just feel like it's very likely
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:00.460]  that occasional bits of mask wearing
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:04.580]  are gonna be common henceforth, even without pandemics.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:07.280]  Just, hey, there's a thing going around.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.120]  Everybody should wear a mask.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.060]  Yeah.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.380]  So we'll see how that works out.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:15.140]  Anything else on the iPad Air before we move on?
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:16.400]  Nope.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.540]  All right, well, let me take this opportunity
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.520]  to thank our third and final sponsor of this episode,
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:24.800]  our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.060]  Hey, Squarespace is the all-in-one platform
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:31.140]  where you can build a new website,
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.260]  take an existing website and update it.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.420]  Anything you need to do on the web,
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:36.640]  you can do it at Squarespace
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.740]  and it literally is soup to nuts.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.700]  Domain name registration, templates,
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.100]  templates that start and cover all sorts,
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.140]  the whole gamut of screen sizes from phones to desktops,
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:50.740]  online store, a portfolio,
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:53.660]  something where you wanna show off a gallery of photos
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.340]  and work and stuff like that,
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.980]  or a CMS type thing where you wanna host a blog
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.820]  or you wanna host a podcast,
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.220]  you can do it all at Squarespace.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.940]  Everything is right there.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.820]  Great analytics, great technical support
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:08.420]  if and when you need it.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:10.480]  Everything you need right there at Squarespace.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:13.280]  And I always emphasize this, such a great thing.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.100]  It's great if you're technically minded
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.860]  and you know HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:20.420]  and you know web hosting and you know stuff like that.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:23.960]  It's also great if because you know stuff like that,
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.740]  you're the person people who don't know it come to
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.300]  when they need a website, send them to Squarespace.
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:30.500]  It is the best thing to do.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:33.380]  And it's not just like, oh, you're shoving them off
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:34.860]  on a thing so that they're out of your hair.
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.500]  It's actually the best thing for them
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.140]  because now they can take control of it
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:40.160]  and do it themselves and empower them
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.260]  with this thing that they can totally understand.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:44.940]  It is a great service for non-technical users
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.760]  and technical users alike.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.460]  And I know that that is a real,
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:49.780]  I hear from people all the time,
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:51.980]  you always mention that and that's exactly it.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:53.360]  I don't have a Squarespace account,
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.500]  but I just told so-and-so who runs a restaurant
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.920]  who I know to use Squarespace and they love it.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.200]  Keep it in mind and remember my URL.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.200]  You can send them there and I'll get credit.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:05.040]  So where do you go?
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.460]  Go to squarespace.com and remember the code.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.220]  Squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.620]  That's the code.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.700]  Just told you to remember it.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:16.780]  I should tell it to you.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:18.940]  And remember that offer code, talk show.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.340]  No the, just talk show.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.580]  And when you pay and you can wait 30 days,
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.780]  get a free trial, pay afterwards,
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.500]  you get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.460]  And you can use it to pay for up to a year.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:33.220]  So remember that code, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:37.300]  All right, iPhone 12.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:38.340]  I wrote a lot.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:40.280]  You wrote a lot.
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.340]  I don't know how much more,
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:43.780]  how much more is there to say?
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:44.640]  I don't know.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.180]  I thought that one of the things I was reading your review
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.780]  and it, I always feel this way.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:51.780]  I always feel like I have a strong opinion about this,
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:53.420]  but this feels like off.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.240]  I feel like my opinion here
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.420]  maybe isn't what I'm supposed to have.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.700]  And then when I read other people say the same thing,
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.260]  I'm like, okay, I'm not nuts.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:05.760]  And my, okay, I'm not nuts when I read your review
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.760]  is I think the iPhone 12 is a nicer thing in hand
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.520]  than the iPhone 12 Pro.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.900]  Yeah, I was immediately taken back
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.220]  to the moment I unboxed.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.860]  I remember where I was.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:25.660]  It was in my office at Mac world, unbox the iPhone five,
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:28.100]  which was the one where they had the black model
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:30.480]  that was like all black.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.000]  And I took the iPhone 12, which my review unit was black.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.100]  Didn't ask, that's just what they said.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.060]  And I, cause I'm sort of intrigued by the blue,
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:42.220]  but I got a black one and I took it out and I was like, oh,
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:45.240]  like I just got that feeling like the matte sides,
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.380]  which don't pick up fingerprints.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.100]  And again, everybody's got their own take on it,
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.780]  but I had that moment where I thought it's lighter,
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:56.060]  it's grippier, the metal looks nicer because it's matte
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:58.120]  and doesn't pick up fingerprints.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:02.940]  And so like leading aside, do you want a telephoto camera?
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.960]  And like, there are reasons to get the pro model,
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.100]  but I thought it was really funny
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.980]  that the cheaper model felt nicer to me.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.580]  And I don't know how I'm gonna feel about the mini,
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.940]  but if I were to buy one of these two models today,
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:16.920]  I would buy the 12.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.440]  I would forego the telephoto.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.820]  I would forego the 60 frame HDR video.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.260]  And I would go, you know, I would forego the raw,
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.300]  Apple pro raw.
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.100]  I would forego that stuff because although it's nice,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.540]  I'm probably not gonna really use it that much.
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.240]  And not only would I save a little money,
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:38.020]  but like just bottom line just feels nicer.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:38.940]  And that's weird, right?
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.280]  That the cheaper phone feels nicer,
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.980]  but to me at least it feels nicer.
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:48.440]  And there were parts of the iPhone 11 and the XR
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.540]  that I thought were nice and maybe nicer.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:53.340]  I like the glossy glass back better.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.380]  I'm convinced of it.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:57.260]  I just, and whether it's just, it is subjective,
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.320]  but I just like it better.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.180]  And so I liked that part of the XR
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:03.920]  and the 11 non-pro better than the pro models.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.380]  Oh no, I guess with the XR,
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:11.380]  the iPhone XS still had a glass back, a glossy back.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:13.340]  They were both sort of shiny backs.
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:14.940]  It was just last year, I just.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:18.220]  The 11 and the 11 pro were inverted.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.540]  So the 11 got the shiny glass back
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:25.420]  with the matte in the glass on the camera sensor
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.220]  and the inverse on the pro.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.660]  I just liked the feel of it.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:31.500]  It's like, and I stick with my description
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.460]  that it's just tacky in a way
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.140]  that shoes on a clean basketball court that squeak are,
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.380]  and it just gives you that grip.
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:39.220]  I just like it.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.860]  Well, you run your finger on a clean pane of glass
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.700]  and it's gonna grab the finger.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:45.400]  And if you run it on a textured piece of glass,
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.240]  it's gonna slide.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.140]  Like it's, that's just what it is.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.820]  It's grabbing onto your finger there.
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:53.100]  So yeah, I remember thinking last year
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:55.060]  with the 11 versus the 11 pro,
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:58.540]  I like aspects of this 11 more.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:00.700]  I like this glossy back.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:03.540]  I really liked that part of the X and XS,
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:06.860]  and I don't like this matte finish.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:10.540]  I don't hate it, but I just, it doesn't feel better to me.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:13.900]  And just practically, it just feels more slippery.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.260]  And I don't really think it looks better either.
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:18.080]  It kind of looks plain.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:24.420]  Yeah, I mean, look, aesthetics are very personal.
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.140]  And I said that in my review.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.020]  It's like, all I can tell you is how I feel about this.
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:30.620]  But my feeling is one,
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:34.280]  that I think the 12 feels nicer than the pro.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.900]  And that's just for reasons.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.140]  I have reasons, but you could disagree with me,
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.340]  and that's fine.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:42.940]  And the other thing is that I'm getting kind of tired
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:45.940]  of Apple deciding that pro means boring.
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:48.660]  And I feel like Apple believes that pro is boring.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.860]  And that's, you know, having boring color
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:54.340]  as an option is good,
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.700]  because you don't wanna,
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.560]  like this is your device that you're gonna have everywhere,
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:00.460]  but it only comes in bright green or bright pink,
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:01.820]  and you have to choose.
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:04.140]  Yeah, I mean, I get it.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:07.460]  But the pro colors are like, you know,
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.820]  gray and lighter silvery gray,
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:13.220]  and sort of a tanny gold.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:16.420]  And then the blue, that's a very dark blue
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:18.540]  that is really kind of a gray blue.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:21.420]  Just like last year, they had the gray green.
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:23.140]  And then you look at the 12s,
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:26.180]  and they're like, bright blue, bright red.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.100]  Yeah, so I did not ask for colors either.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:32.260]  They sent me the two in blue, and I unpack them.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:36.780]  And instantly, I thought, I like the regular 12 blue better.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:40.060]  I mean, I normally buy everything in black
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.740]  if it comes in black person.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:42.580]  Yep, me too.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.620]  But I also have opinions on what I like better
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.580]  if I were to buy it in color.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.420]  And I was like, if I were gonna buy one of these
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:52.700]  on color alone, I would buy the blue blue,
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:54.360]  plain blue, whatever we wanna call it,
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.780]  of the iPhone 12 than the Pacific blue.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.540]  And my wife and son concurred.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:01.940]  And the three of us, three's a good number,
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:04.460]  because somebody has to break the tie.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.060]  Usually, color in particular,
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.940]  our family has very strong opinions on color.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:12.380]  All three of us, everybody agreed
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.720]  that the regular iPhone 12 blue is just nicer.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:17.620]  It's just cooler.
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.940]  Anything you could say like, is it more fun?
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:22.000]  Is it just looks better?
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:22.900]  Is it look nicer?
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:24.340]  Is it look more premium?
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:25.900]  All of those things, right?
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:27.620]  And it's very interesting to me.
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.780]  I think my term was that it somehow looks,
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.980]  it looks fun without seeming frivolous or silly.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:37.020]  Maybe in a way that red does.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.860]  Again, not like the red looks bad.
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:40.940]  I haven't seen, that's the other weird thing
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.820]  about this year with no hands-on area.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.180]  And no, you can't just pop into an Apple store.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.220]  I don't know what, all I know is what it looks like
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:49.820]  in pictures.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:53.620]  But red seems a little more what I'm talking about
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.820]  where it just seems not childish.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:56.780]  I don't think it's bad.
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:57.780]  It's just not for me.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.780]  But the blue seems like even if you are sort of
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:05.580]  not looking for like a teenager's looking phone,
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:08.340]  this blue for the iPhone 12, it just pops
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:11.340]  and it just looks deep and nice.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.180]  And again.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.280]  Apple does anodization of aluminum so well.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.120]  That's the thing.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.220]  It's like they have the surgical stainless steel
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.580]  in case you need to operate on somebody
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.900]  with the edge of your iPhone, I guess, on the Pro.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:24.380]  Surgical grade.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.740]  Yeah, it's a premium material.
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:26.580]  It's great.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.420]  But Apple's really good at aluminum.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.900]  Like really good.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.460]  And they seem to have done a very good job
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:37.360]  with the aluminum edges of the 12.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.580]  But again, everybody can have their take on it.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:41.980]  But I was taken aback.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.200]  I did not expect to feel this way.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.460]  I mean, I've been poking Apple a while about color
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:50.100]  because I feel like they're way too conservative with color.
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:51.820]  And so having this other line
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:54.900]  where they are not as conservative is great.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:59.540]  But it does make me laugh that if you want the Pro phone,
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:00.940]  you gotta be like that.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.340]  The graphite is what I got.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:03.780]  I got black and graphite.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:05.460]  Because I think they sent all the reviewers
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.820]  sort of paired up if they could.
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.020]  I got black and graphite.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:11.580]  And that graphite phone is the most boring phone.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.420]  It's just, it's like space gray.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.540]  It's like all their grays.
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.480]  It is this kind of dark silver.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.760]  It is just a gray thing.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.080]  And if you don't want anybody to notice your phone,
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.460]  and I heard from a couple of people who said,
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.860]  I love the gray because it's boring.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.820]  I don't want anybody to even know that I have a phone.
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.980]  Like, I just don't care, then great.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:32.300]  I mean, I guess.
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:36.900]  But I think it's sad that among the options for the Pro,
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.480]  there isn't what I would consider sort of a fun color.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:43.620]  There's just, the gold band is apparently very pretty.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.740]  But at least the gray one that I got,
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.740]  it's just kind of a boring phone.
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:49.420]  And I'm comparing it to black.
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:51.460]  I'm not even comparing it to red or blue.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.080]  I'm literally comparing it to black.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.540]  And it's, the black is more exciting.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.700]  I had an interesting moment a month earlier
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.500]  where when they sent me the review unit
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:04.500]  for the Series 6 watch, they sent it with a iPhone 11
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:09.340]  that I guess I could pair with it.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.380]  And I just, I never, I didn't even use it.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.340]  I was like, ah, I'll just pair it with one of my,
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.220]  the last thing I need is another frigging iPhone, right?
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.920]  And again, it's just like, oh, this just feels ridiculous
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:23.060]  that I've just got this brand new iPhone in a box
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:25.260]  that I'm just gonna send back to Apple in a couple of weeks
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:26.580]  without ever having really used it.
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.740]  But I did, so I was like, all right,
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.580]  well, I'll open it up and look at it.
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.660]  And it was black.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:31.420]  It was just a black iPhone 11.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.660]  And I didn't even try, I never,
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:36.420]  I've still not powered it on even.
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.460]  It was just there for me to pair
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.860]  with this Apple Watch for review.
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.880]  Because I guess the reason they did this
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.380]  and they don't do that with most,
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.700]  in fact, I don't think they've ever done it
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.020]  with Apple Watch before,
[01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:49.520]  but it was the fact that you needed iOS 14
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.540]  to pair with the Series 7 Watch.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.020]  And they don't wanna assume
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:56.060]  that you were going to personally upgrade your iPhone
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.420]  to iOS 14 yet.
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:58:59.580]  I think that's what they're thinking.
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.860]  They don't, Apple doesn't explain themselves.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.600]  But anyway, I had this black iPhone 11
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:09.600]  and I was like, damn, that is a nice looking phone.
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:12.140]  And just never turned it on.
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.520]  And I own the Graphite 11 Pro.
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.580]  And I was like, and I took it out.
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:18.420]  And I'm like looking at it.
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:22.580]  And unsurprisingly, given that most of the time
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:25.300]  I've owned the 11 Pro has been in 2020,
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:28.760]  my 11 Pro is in near mint condition.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:31.980]  Very, very good condition.
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.740]  Usually my phones are in good condition.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:38.420]  But this one is very, I like the black iPhone 11.
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.380]  It's just better looking to me.
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.420]  It just looks cooler in a way.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:43.260]  I don't know.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:47.260]  Yeah, my review unit at the 11 last year was white.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.000]  And it's nice.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.020]  My 10 R review unit was coral.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:53.700]  And I thought it was gorgeous.
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:56.180]  That orangey reddish kind of color.
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:58.300]  I thought it looked really good.
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.540]  And I was like, oh, look at this fun iPhone.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:03.140]  And when my daughter went off to college last year,
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.660]  one of the things that I did as a parent
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.180]  who's trying to take care of their kid
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.540]  is I bought her an iPhone 11.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.940]  She'd always been using hand-me-downs.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:13.760]  I bought her an iPhone 11 in purple.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:16.860]  And it's a little more pastel-y than I would like.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.940]  I think brighter would have been better, but it's gorgeous.
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:20.860]  It really is.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.380]  It looks great.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:24.100]  And she was very happy with it.
[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:29.100]  And I thought, see, these phones can look fun and be fun.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.600]  And I think should be.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.820]  I think that they're part of us
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.380]  and part of our personality and part of our lives.
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:36.580]  And I don't wanna force fun on people who don't want fun,
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:37.540]  but I do think it's a shame
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:40.420]  that there aren't more fun options.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:42.980]  And I criticize Apple for this in the pro line,
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:44.100]  but I should say I'm so happy
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:46.380]  that Apple has made another line of iPhones
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:48.520]  and they are doing fun colors.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.500]  Because if you look at the Mac,
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:56.100]  your color options on the Mac are sort of a silver
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.980]  and a somewhat darker silver
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:01.980]  and occasionally a goldish metallic.
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:02.820]  And that's it.
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.780]  And only a handful of low-end models.
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.500]  And that's it.
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.780]  Would you like the space gray or would you like the silver,
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:14.420]  which is almost out of context, you can't tell them apart.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:15.620]  You'd have to be next to each other.
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:17.460]  The iMac and the iMac Pro.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.420]  And I was like, oh, look,
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:20.020]  the iMac Pro is a little bit darker.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:25.020]  But like I would love a blue MacBook Air, right?
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:26.980]  Like I think go for it.
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.820]  Anodize that aluminum, do it.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:31.160]  But I'm happy that with the iPhone
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.300]  that they finally have gotten back
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:34.320]  some of that spirit of the iPods back in the day,
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.780]  which is fun colors,
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.340]  because they are expressions of our,
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.580]  whether it's expressions of our personality for others
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:42.380]  or whether it's just a little jolt of kind of fun
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.300]  of like you look at it and you're like,
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.780]  oh, look at that blue or look at that black.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:47.820]  It's a nice thing.
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:49.100]  So I'm glad that exists.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.500]  It's just that I'm a little befuddled
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.700]  about why the Pro model,
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:55.180]  like the Pro model with color,
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:57.660]  it's this pretty drab color.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:58.820]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:02.500]  Totally, this is objective, not subjective.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.780]  The Pro ones, the polished stainless steel flat sides
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:08.060]  are fingerprint magnets.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:10.860]  I don't know that I read a review that didn't mention it.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:14.700]  And if I did, it was an oddball.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:15.680]  Everybody mentioned it.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:17.740]  I remember when I first started noticing it,
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:19.260]  I was like, is there something wrong?
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.340]  Do I need to wash my hands?
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:23.420]  I like washed my hands really good and dried them.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:25.360]  And then it's like two minutes later,
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.660]  covered with fingerprints.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.700]  And it reminds me of,
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.380]  I'm pretty sure that it was a couple of years
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.380]  into the iPhone when I learned the word oleophobic.
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:42.140]  Oleophobic coating.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:44.540]  And it was like, oh yes, thank you.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.000]  This has been driving me nuts
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.960]  because my iPhone was constantly covered with fingerprints.
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.780]  And it's like, oh, this actually works.
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:53.500]  This is amazing, this is great.
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:56.180]  If there's an oleophobic coating
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:00.100]  on the stainless steel side of the iPhone 12 Pro,
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:01.760]  then Apple should get their money back for it
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.580]  because it doesn't work.
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:04.940]  It is a fingerprint magnet.
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:07.200]  And that's, to me, there's no way.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.460]  This one, you see fingerprints all the time.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:11.980]  This other one, you never see fingerprints.
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:13.540]  That is better to me.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:16.980]  That is objectively better in and of itself,
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:19.460]  the aluminum side of the regular 12.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.620]  The other thing, I switched.
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:27.620]  So part of the very nice, unbelievably lucky thing
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:29.740]  about being somebody who gets these things to review,
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:31.200]  and they send you both of them,
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.420]  is you get to use them both.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:35.060]  And so instead of just being in a store
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.900]  and spending 15 minutes side by side saying,
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:39.860]  oh, a little bit of this one, a little bit of that one,
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:41.540]  okay, and now I'm gonna buy, I have to make a choice,
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:44.160]  I gotta buy one, I get to use them both.
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:48.620]  The way I did the review is I used both, I set up both,
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:51.300]  but I spent most of my time with the 12 Pro
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:54.820]  because it had more, and it felt like more likely
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.100]  the one I would be interested in.
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:58.200]  I'm used to having the three cameras now.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.260]  Wanted to try the things like the Dolby 60 frames per second
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:06.140]  you know, might as well spend more time
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:07.260]  with the one that does more.
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.940]  Because everything else, they apply.
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.780]  You know, anything, everything the 12 Pro can do,
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.600]  the 12 can do.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:18.140]  But I forget how many days ago, I guess I should,
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:19.480]  I guess I can look it up somehow.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.940]  But I don't know, four, five, six days ago,
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:25.460]  four or five days ago, I switched and I redid
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:28.660]  the regular 12 and I've been living on it
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:30.260]  for the last four or five days.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.900]  Now that I'm living on it as my main iPhone,
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.800]  I like it even more.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:40.320]  And my thinking, hey, I think that this being,
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:42.700]  you know, 20 grams lighter or whatever the difference
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:44.880]  in weight is, this is nicer too.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.140]  Now when I pick up the 12 Pro, I'm like, why is this,
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.820]  this thing is like a brick.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.540]  Like the-
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.460]  I didn't think it would be noticeable.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:53.820]  It is super noticeable.
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.540]  Like you get used to it, I'm sure.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:57.800]  But like when I pick up one and then the other,
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.060]  it's like, oh yeah, this is like, no, it's lighter.
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:00.880]  You can tell.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.620]  It's not one of those things that you have to trick yourself
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.020]  into thinking is a difference.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:04.860]  It's a difference.
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.860]  It feels more noticeable to me.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.420]  When I was using the 12 Pro as my main phone,
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:13.500]  every time I picked up the 12, I was like, oh my God,
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.500]  this is so much lighter.
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:15.340]  It's nicer.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.760]  Now that I'm using the 12 as my main phone,
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.420]  when I pick up the 12 Pro, it's more,
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.260]  because it's worse.
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:24.740]  And it's like, this is so much heavier.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:28.780]  And it's not just for the camera lens and LIDAR, right?
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:30.180]  These little tiny cameras don't weigh that.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.240]  It's the steel.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:34.560]  The stainless steel weighs more.
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.560]  I've been using the stainless steel phone
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:39.400]  since the iPhone X.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:40.240]  They are nice.
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.880]  There's nice things to be said about them.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.840]  But aluminum being lighter and not having fingerprints
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:50.640]  and having a matte texture that is really nice to the touch
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.920]  and picks up these wonderful anodized colors,
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:56.160]  this is great.
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:58.520]  I mean, and it's good news for everybody out there.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:02.640]  You can save $130 or whatever the price difference is
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.920]  and get a more fun, better phone
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.480]  that doesn't have fingerprints on this side.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:09.800]  Yeah, and unlike the 11, where it was also a larger phone,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.960]  so people who are sort of turned off by that would be like,
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:14.060]  all right, well, I'm gonna get the 11 Pro
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:16.680]  because I don't want the bigger phone in my hand.
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.980]  It's a little bit too big.
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:19.920]  Now they're the same size in the hand.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:23.780]  And so really it's a matter of a few features
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:26.560]  that are on the Pro model and style
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:28.040]  and personal style preference.
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:31.640]  And that's, yeah, I found myself surprised at discovering
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:34.880]  that my personal preference would be the lower end model
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:37.880]  because usually it's like, oh, well, I'm a nerd.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.240]  I care about the details.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.340]  I'm gonna get the higher end model.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.040]  And I was like, no, I prefer the lower end model.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:46.440]  That's weird as that is because it just feels nicer to me
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.360]  and everybody's taste is different again.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.760]  But it was very clear.
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.160]  I have a very clear preference for that, the 12.
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.120]  It's really good.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:58.120]  And Apple, again, Apple is the world's single best company
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.540]  when it comes to aluminum, as far as I can tell.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:04.560]  They are the experts on what you do with aluminum.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:09.560]  And that aluminum on the edges of the 12, it's great.
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:10.880]  It's well done.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.840]  Just it's a tiny little thing,
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.180]  but I feel like even the mute switch feels better
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:17.800]  in aluminum than steel.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.680]  And I only really noticed this when I went to the 12
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:23.360]  as my main phone and I went back to the 12 Pro
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.520]  and I'm like, you know what, it feels sharp.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.600]  It's too sharp on the 12 Pro.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.320]  And maybe now at this point, it's like the placebo effect
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:33.620]  and I'm finding things to like about the 12
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:37.120]  than the 12 Pro, but the buttons, they just feel better.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:38.640]  I don't know, I really like it
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:43.640]  and just feel like the stainless steel is needlessly.
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:46.900]  And I just wonder, and I wonder how much of it carries over
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:49.600]  from the watch, like with the watch, I get it.
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:54.600]  Steel is nicer for a watch and they use it, it's famously,
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:00.160]  it's been used for wristwatches for 100 years.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.800]  Stainless steel is a very nice material
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:03.880]  to make a premium watch out of.
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:08.960]  And I like having the heavier watches.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.460]  I'm used to it with my regular watches,
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:15.860]  but aluminum is great.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:16.960]  It's also a great material.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.880]  And most people who aren't wristwatch wearers
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.840]  like having a lighter watch.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:24.400]  So it's like the fact that the aluminum Apple watches
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.600]  are cheaper than the stainless steel ones is like,
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.840]  it's very similar to me to this distinction
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:31.120]  between the phones where it's like, oh,
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.920]  you get all the same features and sensors
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.880]  and it's lighter too?
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:36.600]  Oh, sign me up.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.000]  Yeah.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:39.840]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.920]  One other thing on this front.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.680]  Oh, the screens being brighter,
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.400]  that the tech specs say the iPhone 12 Pro
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.500]  has HDR content, they have the same maximum brightness,
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:58.200]  but for typical use for non HDR content,
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:02.500]  there's like a 800 versus 600 nit typical brightness.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:05.600]  I don't see any difference in brightness
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:06.800]  between these things at all.
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:10.800]  And I'd spent too long trying to find it.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.880]  I was like, why am I wasting all this time on this?
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.320]  I didn't even wind up, you know,
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.440]  different to go down those routes
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.280]  when you're like doing the side by side.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.040]  And it's like, wait, I just blew 90 minutes
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.600]  trying to figure out why, if this is brighter or not.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.440]  And it's like-
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.260]  And ended up with nothing.
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:25.980]  Well, I ended up with like my one minute,
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:27.960]  my one minute into it opinion.
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.320]  These, you know, I set both to about, you know,
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.360]  whatever I would set them at as a user
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.640]  up in control center as brightness,
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:37.400]  look at them side by side on the same webpage,
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.160]  look at some photos, they look exactly the same.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.280]  Exactly.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.840]  I don't know what the difference is
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.400]  that would justify putting that in the tech specs.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.840]  I tried to ask Apple and,
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:53.720]  not that they, they didn't give me a straight answer,
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.760]  but basically they said I'm not crazy
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.840]  that I think that it's the same brightness.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.040]  I think that what they're doing but won't say
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:05.920]  is that they are the same components.
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:06.760]  It's not like they're,
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:08.800]  oh, they're using a different manufacturer or it's,
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:11.240]  you know, if you take it out and put it under a microscope,
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:13.560]  you'd see, oh, this is a totally different screen technology
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:15.400]  in the 12 and 12 Pro.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.320]  I think that like as they're coming off,
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:20.200]  the ones that test better, they put in the Pro models
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.800]  because they're spec for higher brightness
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.520]  and that their screens are such an organic
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.000]  manufacturing thing that there is some natural,
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.240]  minor variability between like your iPhone 12
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:33.720]  and my iPhone 12.
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.880]  But basically that is definitely,
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:40.000]  that is not a reason to get an iPhone 12 Pro.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.840]  There is no noticeable day-to-day brightness difference.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:44.480]  It's not like, oh, well, when you go outside,
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.320]  you'll see it in Sunday.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.040]  No, that's not a thing.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.960]  Yeah, yeah, they're very close.
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:51.800]  They're very similar.
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.320]  In fact, this is an interesting area
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:55.560]  where Apple probably could have done,
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.640]  made a greater effort to separate them than it did.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:01.400]  And I like that it didn't because it means
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.880]  that you really have some very specific choices.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.880]  And if you want to go with a lower end phone
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.760]  for style reasons or whatever, you can do that.
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.520]  You mentioned in passing, I just wanted to say,
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:13.400]  I love the iPhone 5.
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:17.640]  I also never used a case on the iPhone 5 or 5s.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.880]  And I've been using the 12 without a case.
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.000]  And I always had a case on the 6 and up
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.400]  because it had the curved edges
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.080]  and I always felt like it was precarious.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:33.280]  And I currently have,
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.480]  I still, my plan is to not wear a case on it
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.200]  because it is, it just, it feels more safe in my hand
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.600]  and maybe it's not and I'll drop it
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.080]  and I'll regret everything, but it feels safer in my hand.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.520]  And that makes it so much smaller and lighter too,
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.600]  just not having the case stuck on it.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:52.720]  Even though I typically don't wear the other one
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:55.160]  with the case either, but I put in the case on it.
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.040]  Yeah, I went to a leather case for those and it's fine,
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:00.400]  but I am so happy to not have to have a case on it
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.880]  and feel like it's safe enough.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:02.880]  How cool is it?
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.000]  I love this little detail.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.560]  I didn't pick up on it, that there's like an NFC chip
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.160]  in the Apple's cases and when you put it in a case
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:11.840]  and the MagSafe indicator shows up on screen,
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:14.040]  it's color coordinated with your case,
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.160]  if it's an Apple case.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.120]  I read about that and it sounds really cool.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.160]  I have a black case for my black phone.
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.320]  So it doesn't really do anything.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.160]  I excuse myself for not noticing
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.240]  because I picked Apple's default blue wallpapers.
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:32.240]  There's like default special press to the screen
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:35.560]  and they're these wallpapers that you only get specific
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.600]  to the model phone you have.
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:38.760]  And I picked them to make it easy for me
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:40.080]  to tell which phone I'm using
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.680]  so I can remember while I'm using it.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:45.160]  But those wallpapers that I've chosen are blue
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:46.800]  and the case they sent me was blue
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:47.640]  because the phone's blue.
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.040]  It's like blue is, let's send John blue everything.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.320]  So I just thought the blue was
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.840]  because my wallpaper was blue.
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.760]  And then they also did send me the clear case
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.520]  and the clear case, of course,
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.280]  the color coordination is gray
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:04.040]  and I just didn't notice the difference.
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:07.680]  But that is a cool feature and that is the little bits
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.320]  of what do we call it, whimsy,
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:12.000]  that we wonder if Apple has lost.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.240]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:15.680]  The idea that your phone knows exactly what color it is
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:17.880]  and what color its case is, I love that.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.160]  Yeah, that's very fun.
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:23.160]  5G, I wrote about it.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:26.480]  I know you didn't get any 5G service.
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:31.000]  Yeah, I have a 5G SIM here that AT&T claims will let me see
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.320]  the 5G that's apparently at the end of my block
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:35.480]  and I can find out whether it's actually any faster or not.
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:37.520]  I haven't driven into San Francisco
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:39.760]  where they have the 5G-
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.280]  Ultra wide band.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.120]  The ultra wide band stuff.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:44.160]  I haven't done that.
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.720]  I'm an AT&T person.
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.160]  We don't even have Verizon.
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.520]  People with Verizon phones who come to my house say,
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.720]  why do I have no service?
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:52.400]  Because it's like that here.
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:56.160]  But did you see where I wrote about 5G in my article?
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.920]  I'm a little bit proud of it.
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:58.960]  Yes, I did.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.120]  It's the footnote at the end after the period
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.880]  at the end of the last sentence of the review.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:06.200]  And it literally says 5G isn't that relevant
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.320]  for most people.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:10.960]  And it's basically a footnote when it comes to these phones.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:12.920]  Cause I was like, staring at my review and being like,
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.200]  oh God, I haven't even talked about 5G, but what do I say?
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.040]  I don't have it.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:16.960]  I haven't seen it.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:18.880]  I also have thoughts to the last year plus
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.920]  that it's really kind of a marketing scam.
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:23.640]  Like it will matter to some people sometime,
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.680]  but right now everybody's just picking it up
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:28.360]  and running with it because it's a way to sell people
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.920]  on more expensive plans and new phones.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.640]  And like, let's just get to it.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.760]  Tim Cook in the analyst call was like,
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.200]  it's a once in a decade opportunity
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:37.880]  to market a new wireless thing.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:39.720]  And it's like, yeah, it's an opportunity,
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.720]  but most people, it's not as exciting
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.520]  as they're making it out to be.
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:49.040]  And I realized I had nothing.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.720]  I like, I literally have nothing to say.
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.200]  I've written about the first 5G iPhone
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.400]  and I have literally nothing to say about 5G.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:59.040]  I got, I do have ultra wide here
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.040]  in certain parts of center city, Philadelphia,
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.080]  not super close to my house, but easily an easy walk.
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.720]  And I got it and I got extraordinary speeds.
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:08.560]  I saw that.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.800]  4,000 megabits per second is the theoretical maximum.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:15.920]  I got up to 2,700, which is really close,
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:20.160]  2.7 gigahertz networking over the air on a cell network.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:24.040]  And I described it as holy shit fast.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.080]  And it's fun.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:26.200]  I didn't know how to write it,
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.760]  but I also don't think it's a reason to buy the phone
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.200]  and don't think it's practical.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:34.280]  And subsequent to my review,
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.000]  went somewhere where I did go indoors
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.160]  and outside the door of the establishment,
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.040]  I was getting 5G ultra wide.
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:46.120]  I quick ran a speed test to make sure it was really fast.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:46.960]  And I forget what I got.
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:49.520]  It wasn't quite 20 some,
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.400]  it wasn't over 2,000 megabits per second,
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.820]  but it was over 1,000, which is really fast.
[02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:56.440]  It was gigabit, it's like me being disappointed
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.360]  that I'm only getting gigabit speeds.
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  As soon as I went inside, right to LTE.
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.000]  So the idea that ultra wide is this thing
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.920]  that doesn't even go through glass is true.
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.120]  And again, sporting arenas
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.560]  and the idea that it deals with congestion,
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.000]  that you're, oh, you could be at a concert
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.200]  and you'll still be able to post to Instagram,
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.160]  because that's great.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.480]  We're not going there now.
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:26.600]  But the ultra wide, so for the congestion, that is great.
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:29.660]  The ultra wide only working outdoors,
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.400]  when is that actually practical?
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:33.520]  Like I am amazed technically.
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.700]  And my sparring partner on Twitter, Mark Gurman,
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.520]  called me out on it, that I had written before
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:43.560]  that I don't really think this is a reason
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:47.240]  to be excited about these phones,
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:48.320]  because I don't see,
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.720]  this isn't the main thing people are complaining of.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:52.300]  This is even on the top of their list
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:54.440]  of what their complaints are with their phones,
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:58.080]  is LTE speeds, and I still believe that.
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.640]  But I also got truly amazing speeds with 5G ultra wide.
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:06.120]  It does work, it is amazing, it is worth noting,
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.920]  but I still stand by my point of when am I ever
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.840]  gonna take advantage of this?
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:15.040]  This thing that only works on my phone, only outdoors.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.560]  Like at a ballpark or if you're working
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:18.520]  in a park or something.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.280]  But yeah, the fact that when you go inside,
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:22.320]  I mean, it's like a Wi-Fi hotspot too,
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:23.960]  the range isn't particularly great.
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.400]  Block by block, in some parts of Philadelphia,
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.120]  I would describe it as a half a block,
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.960]  half of a city block has it and half doesn't,
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:33.260]  and it just immediately goes away.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:36.960]  If you told me that 5G coverage would hit my house
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.800]  with something that would give me gigabit speeds
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:40.640]  at my house over wireless,
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.760]  that's potentially life changing,
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:46.460]  because you could cancel your cable internet
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:48.860]  and just buy an unlimited wireless plan.
[02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:52.720]  But it's not that, and then also let's keep in mind,
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:54.760]  most people still don't have 5G phones.
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.920]  Right, yeah, and who knows what it's gonna be like
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.520]  when you do. You know what happened with LTE?
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.480]  I remember when I got my first LTE phone,
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:05.600]  I remember when I first had the iPhone
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:08.800]  that did the fake 4G on AT&T, if you remember that.
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:11.480]  Before they had fake 5G, they had fake 4G.
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:13.080]  They always have a fake, they always have,
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:17.040]  you leave it to AT&T to always have fake next gen.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.760]  So every time you flip over, you're like,
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.000]  oh my God, it's so fast, but then you wait six months
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.280]  and everybody's on the network and it's not fast anymore,
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:27.400]  because now you're sharing with everybody else.
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:30.360]  So there's also that kind of illusion of 5G speed,
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.280]  and I know that that is theoretically there,
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.480]  but even if, it will be great if I go
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:38.040]  to a college football game next year
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:39.760]  at California Memorial Stadium,
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:44.400]  and they're in front of, you know, with 70,000 people
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:46.000]  and we're booing Stanford,
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  and I can actually like take a picture and tweet it,
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:56.640]  and it goes right out, or it goes on Instagram or whatever.
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.160]  Thanks to 5G, I'll be like, awesome, 5G, good job.
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.840]  But what's probably not gonna happen
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:05.680]  is I'm probably not gonna get like a gigabit down.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.560]  Why would you, how would you notice?
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:08.920]  Like what do you, how would you?
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:11.800]  Well, that's true, I have to download a movie right now,
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:13.800]  but like I'm just saying with 70,000 people around,
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:16.360]  if it's more reliable, that will be a nice feature,
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:20.520]  but that's probably it, and that's good.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:22.240]  The biggest thing we pulled down
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.400]  is 4K streaming video, right?
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:27.040]  That's the biggest thing most people need to download, right?
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:27.880]  I mean, what are you doing?
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.880]  Are you downloading Xcode, you know,
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.560]  11 gigabyte download through your cellular connection?
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.800]  I was thinking, I mean, you could come up with scenarios
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.760]  like I'm about to go on the plane,
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.880]  and I've got this fast, I'm on a plane, imagine,
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:43.120]  and I wanna download a movie before I go,
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:45.520]  and like it downloads almost instantaneously.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:48.560]  It's like, great, okay, that's a very, very narrow case.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.640]  And that is like once a year, maybe, if you forgot, you know?
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:55.880]  And honestly, I'm more likely to download like some music,
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:58.800]  and I've done that on LTE or a TV show or a movie,
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.480]  and it goes pretty fast already, right?
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:03.680]  That's the thing is typical LTE speeds
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:06.400]  for the typical things you actually download and upload
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:07.400]  are actually pretty good,
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.760]  and the problems are congestion and data caps, right?
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.560]  Like I had to upgrade my Verizon plan
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:16.280]  to get all this to work, because the old unlimited plan,
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:18.280]  one of the limits of the unlimited plan
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:19.640]  was it didn't include 5G,
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:21.800]  which is why I wasn't getting 5G service.
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.520]  Well, it was an old three-year-old plan, Jason,
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:25.360]  you wouldn't know, what do you expect?
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.960]  Old plan, old plan, got it.
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:30.960]  But, you know, you upgrade the plan,
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.120]  and it still has data caps, and the data caps are now,
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:35.920]  it's like, well, you couldn't theory reach it
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:38.440]  in, you know, five minutes.
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.920]  You know, I would much rather have LTE speeds
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.080]  and truly unlimited, like my cable service at home
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.000]  where you could just use it as your internet
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.080]  all day every day and not run into a limit.
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:54.880]  I'd rather have LTE service with literally true no limit,
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:58.240]  no asterisk, no footnote, unlimited,
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:01.960]  than 5G service with a 20 gigabyte monthly limit.
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.520]  I think it's more practical.
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.000]  But anyway, it certainly has gotten,
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.960]  I think you've, to bring it back to sports,
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:15.360]  the three major carriers, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:18.760]  here in the United States are promoting the hell
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:21.120]  out of the iPhone 12 because it's 5G.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:24.080]  And I'm not cynical.
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.200]  I think it's, you know, again,
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.760]  if you're gonna buy a phone to use for years,
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:27.880]  5G will be a thing.
[02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:28.720]  It's good to have it.
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:31.560]  It is a little unusual for Apple to be early
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.360]  as opposed to late on this.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:35.280]  And I know there have been 5G phones before,
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:38.520]  but nobody has really made like a mainstream,
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.560]  not this, everything else has always been
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:41.920]  like a special edition.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:45.720]  Here's the Samsung Galaxy S20, and here's the 5G edition.
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:47.800]  Now, this is just the main iPhone 12.
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:48.760]  It has 5G.
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:49.960]  It's great 5G.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.760]  It's the same 5G in all of the iPhone 12s.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:56.960]  But boy, oh boy, are the carriers online with it.
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:59.640]  That to me is the reason Apple maybe was aggressive
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:02.480]  at rolling this out is it's gotten the carriers
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.560]  to be as enthusiastic advertising the iPhone 12
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:06.400]  as Apple is.
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:11.000]  Yeah, I get why they do it.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.600]  And I don't wanna say 5G is worthless,
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:14.440]  because it's not.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:17.320]  It's just, if you're buying a phone today,
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:19.080]  like is it like I wouldn't upgrade,
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:20.800]  but now I'm going to upgrade because of 5G,
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:22.160]  I just don't think it's a good enough reason.
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:23.200]  No. And that's all.
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:24.040]  And I will say-
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.720]  It will be, eventually it'll be everywhere
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:27.160]  and it'll be better and that'll be fine.
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:29.680]  But like, I don't, the way it's marketed,
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:31.400]  and I get why you wanna market it this way,
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:34.040]  is, oh my God, 5G, you've gotta get 5G.
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:36.000]  And that's just, it's just not really true.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.280]  And pandemic isolation in my house aside,
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.840]  the fact that I don't really get regular 5G
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.800]  anywhere I go in Philadelphia,
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:47.560]  so I have LTE just about everywhere,
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:51.040]  except for these narrow pockets and street corners
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.120]  where the 5G ultra wide is,
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:54.880]  day to day, it doesn't make any difference.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:59.040]  It makes no difference to me what my life is like
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:02.280]  out and about using my phone on cellular networking,
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:04.200]  LTE compared to 5G.
[02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.180]  It just doesn't.
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.120]  I'm glad it's there,
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:10.640]  but this is not like going from 3G to LTE.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:14.600]  And there's nothing like going from edge to 3G was.
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:16.000]  Yeah, no, it's true.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:16.840]  It's true.
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:17.660]  And the applications for it,
[02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:18.960]  I mean, we've gone back and forth about this,
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.200]  but like the applications for it,
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:21.400]  there are lots of stories to tell
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:24.480]  about why 5G will be better in this area or that area.
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.800]  And that's great.
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:27.940]  But like, if you're just a person with a phone
[02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:29.640]  that's a year or two old and you're thinking,
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.480]  well, do I really need 5G?
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:32.820]  Is it gonna really change my life
[02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:35.080]  if I upgrade a little bit faster?
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.160]  The answer is no.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:39.040]  The answer is no, unless you,
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.120]  and if it's yes, it's because somebody has said,
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:43.820]  doctor, we're gonna do telemedicine
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.360]  and you need a 5G, whatever.
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:48.220]  But like, if you're just a random person,
[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:51.120]  I just, you know, get it when it comes,
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:53.320]  when it's next in your buying cycle.
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:56.240]  Buy the iPhone 12 because you want a new iPhone
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:57.460]  and they're really nice.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:58.640]  Not because I got 5G,
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:00.040]  because it's like, that's why it's a footnote.
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:02.560]  It's because it's not a reason to buy a phone.
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:03.600]  There are better reasons.
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.360]  I would buy it for the flat sides before the 5G.
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:07.720]  For sure.
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:11.000]  For sure, if you want a pretty color, absolutely.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.160]  You'll notice it more.
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:15.600]  Anyway, it wouldn't be Jason Snell on the talk show
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:17.960]  if we didn't run way over two hours.
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:18.800]  I know.
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:20.240]  But we've already run way over two hours.
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.280]  And talked about baseball.
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:22.240]  And talked about baseball.
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:23.880]  Check in the boxes, aren't we?
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:25.120]  Have you been watching the Letterman
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:30.120]  on the My Next Guest Needs No Introduction?
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:31.440]  I'll never get that.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.880]  It does not roll off the tongue.
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.000]  I think I've seen them all now.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:34.840]  I think I watched,
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.340]  so there were only four because they did two
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.720]  and then the pandemic hit and they did two more
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.920]  sort of in unusual locations.
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:44.560]  But I've seen them all.
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.240]  I'm not trying to brag.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.280]  I'm not trying to make you jealous,
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:48.920]  but I haven't watched them yet.
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:50.280]  So I've got them all ahead of me.
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:51.120]  I'm so happy.
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:52.720]  I saw Dave on Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:53.700]  I think it was two nights ago,
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:54.680]  but I watched last night
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:59.160]  and he was, even over Zoom or whatever they were using,
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:01.920]  he still is not just my favorite talk show host.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:03.880]  He's the best guest.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:07.480]  So you have now had spoiled for you
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:09.880]  the David Letterman iPhone case.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.040]  Yes.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:11.880]  Yes.
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.540]  Which looks like it's made out of cardboard and duct tape.
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.400]  And it's with the one that he takes
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:17.960]  and he showed it on Jimmy Kimmel,
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:20.760]  but it's the one that he takes into CBS with Kim Kardashian
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.080]  because that's a whole bit.
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.200]  I'm telling you, Jon, you haven't seen it yet.
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:25.560]  It's one of those moments that's like,
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.800]  oh, this is the Letterman who would,
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:29.880]  back when he could,
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:32.760]  he'd like go out on the street and interview people
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.160]  and he was just so good at that.
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:37.040]  And this is literally, what if David Letterman,
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:40.100]  so David Letterman and Kim Kardashian walk into a CBS,
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:42.100]  start of a joke.
[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:43.500]  And then that's what it is,
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:45.440]  is just nonsense in the CBS,
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.680]  including this phone that is like,
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:51.520]  he's trying to Instagram to make something go viral.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.280]  And it's in this ridiculous duct tape phone thing
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:56.360]  that he has.
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:59.640]  And yeah, I find it funny
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:03.460]  that a guy who's been on TV for 40 years,
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:08.320]  and yet I think you can look at season one, two, and three
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.880]  of My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.880]  and you can see him getting better at the format.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:16.760]  Yeah.
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.400]  I think that this season,
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.560]  he is way more comfortable with the format,
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:24.160]  even when the format changes because of COVID,
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:26.320]  and his Dave Chappelle interview is outside,
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:28.600]  basically like at Dave Chappelle's house
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.540]  in front of an audience,
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:32.560]  but they're all socially distanced and outside, right?
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.300]  Even in weird circumstances,
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:40.300]  I feel like he had internalized the clock of network TV.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.760]  And with this season,
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.920]  I feel like maybe he's finally let it all go,
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:46.880]  where he knows what this interview is,
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:48.640]  he knows what the show is gonna be,
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:49.800]  he knows they're gonna have some bits
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.640]  that they cut back and forth between,
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.640]  but he seems more relaxed and a better interviewer.
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:01.080]  And also I think maybe has learned to deal with the fact
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:03.760]  that the people he's interviewing now are younger,
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.220]  and therefore he's more almost legendary to them.
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:09.560]  And that I don't think he knew how to deal with that.
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  And I think now he's kind of figured out
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:12.680]  how to be self-effacing,
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:15.700]  but also not let it get him off his game
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:16.680]  when they praise him.
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.000]  And be like, I appreciate it, that's very nice.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.280]  I wanna talk about you.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.600]  But I think, so as weird as it is,
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:24.640]  40, 50 years into this guy's career,
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:27.680]  I feel like he's finally figured out his own show
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:28.520]  for this show.
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:30.600]  I'm so looking forward to it.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:31.680]  That's music to my ears
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:33.780]  that you think the new season's better than the others.
[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:35.400]  And that would be very typically Dave.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:37.800]  My only regret with that is that I just feel,
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:39.760]  I always wanted Carson to do something
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:41.200]  like that post tonight show.
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.360]  Something just-
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:43.720]  He said on this last episode,
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:46.080]  he said, I hope when I bring back something,
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:46.920]  you'll like it.
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:47.740]  And he never came back.
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:48.580]  Right.
[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:49.420]  Yeah.
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:50.240]  Except on Letterman.
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:51.080]  Yeah.
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:51.920]  Yeah.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:52.760]  But Letterman did this thing.
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.520]  And I think it's an interesting combination
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.680]  of his sort of like skills,
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:00.000]  but also not exactly the same.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.560]  And like following his interests a little bit
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.120]  in terms of who he picks
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:07.000]  and in terms of sort of like going to their houses
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  and like talking to them and stuff,
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.960]  or taking Kim Kardashian to CVS.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:13.360]  Like it's a good way for him to do something
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.760]  that honestly the last five or 10 years he was on Blade Show,
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.560]  I don't think he was particularly engaged with it.
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.000]  He was just sort of going through the motions
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.640]  to a certain degree.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:23.400]  And he's engaged with this stuff.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:25.000]  And I like that about it.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.760]  I'm curious, not to bring this
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.120]  to another Apple related thing,
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:31.160]  but I'm curious what Jon Stewart's show
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:33.160]  on Apple TP Plus is gonna look like.
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:34.000]  Yeah, me too.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.640]  Because that was a deal that has been reported,
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:38.120]  not announced but reported
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:41.100]  that Jon Stewart's gonna do a current events show,
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:44.760]  not weekly, hour long single subject.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:46.560]  And I started to think it's gonna be,
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:48.240]  how much is it gonna be like Letterman
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:50.920]  where he does five of them a year?
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:53.220]  Or is it gonna be one a month?
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:54.060]  I don't know.
[02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:55.920]  But like, I feel like Jon Stewart's gonna have
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:57.320]  the same challenge as Letterman,
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.000]  which is like, this isn't the daily grind of a show.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.520]  So what do I do?
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:05.240]  And like, what do I want it to be?
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:06.480]  What am I good at?
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.000]  And like for somebody who has been wildly successful,
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.380]  both of these guys, they're trying something different
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:13.680]  and they have to actually think like,
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:15.880]  oh, I need to reinvent myself a little bit.
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:16.880]  What's that gonna be like?
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:19.200]  So I'm looking forward to seeing what Jon Stewart does
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:20.320]  because I think he's gonna have to go through
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:22.120]  the same process that Letterman has had to go through
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:23.000]  with this Netflix show.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.120]  Right, and it's the same old argument
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:26.280]  that every artist goes through
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:29.560]  where constraints lead to creativity
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.760]  and a daily four times a week talk show
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:36.440]  or a daily four or five times a week,
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:40.240]  fake news, 30 minute at a desk show
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:42.680]  have these severe constraints of form
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.080]  that they just mastered within these constraints.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:49.200]  And now they've got, oh, there are very few constraints,
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:50.840]  almost none.
[02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:52.040]  Right, and so you have to decide,
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.680]  like, what do I want my format to be?
[02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:57.480]  What did I like out of the constraints
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:00.240]  that I wanna place on myself?
[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:01.840]  I wanna constrain myself again.
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:06.200]  Yeah, it's kind of a fascinating thing to watch.
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:09.360]  But I'm so happy that we've gotten this
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:11.920]  next act for Letterman.
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:13.920]  We talked when he retired
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:16.280]  about Johnny Carson never coming back.
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:18.320]  And at the time I felt like
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.240]  Letterman's gonna do a streaming something.
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:21.920]  He's gonna just, he's something.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:23.960]  Like the world is so different now
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:25.560]  that he doesn't have to go back to NBC
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:27.000]  with a package of things
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.760]  like Johnny Carson would have had to do.
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.040]  He can just do whatever.
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:32.480]  He could do a, I think what I said was
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:34.200]  he could do a Seinfeld-like thing,
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:36.120]  like the comedians in Cars Getting Coffee
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:38.360]  thing, which is also now on Netflix.
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:39.400]  He could do something like that.
[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.280]  And My Next Guest Needs No Introduction
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:44.760]  is kind of that except bigger,
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:47.560]  the fewer episodes and then kind of a broader remit.
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:49.160]  But it's a similar kind of thing.
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.400]  So I'm glad we get more of him
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:53.400]  because he didn't,
[02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:55.560]  he could just go off to his ranch in Montana
[02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:57.320]  and never be seen again.
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:01.160]  Instead we get him going to CVS with Kim Kardashian.
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:02.000]  It's great.
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.080]  I can't wait.
[02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:05.520]  Everybody knows where they can find your stuff.
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:07.400]  I don't even feel like I need to pitch it.
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:10.400]  But of course, sixcolors.com.
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:13.040]  Spell colors whichever way you want.
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:14.040]  Yep.
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:17.000]  And we just talked about the 2420 Podcast,
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.760]  which is on Relay FM.
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:23.280]  Upgrade your other podcast
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.920]  or one of your 30 podcasts.
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:26.760]  Many, yeah.
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:29.120]  You did host that one with Mike Hurley, The Incomparable,
[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:32.200]  which is a parent network of 40 different podcasts.
[02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:33.960]  Thousand different shows, yeah.
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:36.920]  But if you just go to Six Colors
[02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:39.200]  and you'll find it all there.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:40.120]  My thanks to you, Jason.
[02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:42.760]  Good to talk to you, as always.
[02:31:42.760 --> 02:32:07.360]  Always a pleasure, Jon.
