[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  Did you watch the Oscars?
[00:01.840 --> 00:03.600]  I watched the end of the Oscars.
[00:03.600 --> 00:06.200]  So I caught right at the end when everything went totally wrong.
[00:06.200 --> 00:09.240]  So you were watching live when it happened?
[00:09.240 --> 00:10.000]  Yeah.
[00:10.000 --> 00:10.920]  We were not.
[00:10.920 --> 00:12.640]  I've kind of given up on award shows.
[00:12.640 --> 00:15.640]  I find that they're just too damn tedious.
[00:15.640 --> 00:18.400]  But I got a news alert from The New York Times.
[00:18.400 --> 00:22.120]  And so we immediately switched over and quick rewound and watch it.
[00:22.120 --> 00:24.320]  But it's so totally different knowing.
[00:24.320 --> 00:28.240]  The news alert was like, holy hell, they announced the wrong winner of the best
[00:28.240 --> 00:31.200]  picture, go watch this fiasco live.
[00:31.200 --> 00:35.600]  Whereas if you're watching live, it's got to be more of what the hell is going on?
[00:35.600 --> 00:37.400]  Yeah, it was very unscripted.
[00:37.400 --> 00:40.680]  So the funny thing is, of course, I was driving home from Canada.
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.080]  So when I say watching live, what I really mean was I had my iPhone open.
[00:46.080 --> 00:49.160]  And I was listening to it.
[00:49.160 --> 00:52.680]  So I didn't see the facial expressions that everybody was talking about.
[00:52.680 --> 00:56.240]  I just heard this long, really awkward pause.
[00:56.240 --> 01:00.600]  And I'm like, well, that's like and some shuffling in the microphone.
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.280]  And I'm like, that doesn't that's not usually how you build suspense.
[01:04.280 --> 01:07.520]  It's not like, you know, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.000]  Everything's you know, everything's fine here.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.040]  We're all fine.
[01:11.040 --> 01:12.640]  How are you?
[01:12.640 --> 01:14.120]  Yeah, it was just it was odd.
[01:14.120 --> 01:21.480]  And then the resulting commotion, I almost like I didn't pull over the car,
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.920]  but I almost wanted to pull over the car and be like, I actually want to watch this
[01:24.920 --> 01:27.760]  because this seems kind of ridiculous.
[01:27.760 --> 01:33.520]  So I didn't actually get to watch the video of it until I got home in front of,
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.240]  you know, and probably I don't think the net until the next day,
[01:37.240 --> 01:43.160]  sitting down in front of my computer being like, OK, what actually happened during this nonsense?
[01:43.160 --> 01:52.560]  And then watching like Warren Beatty just look completely confounded and be like,
[01:52.560 --> 01:56.040]  let's let's maybe not announce this.
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.960]  And then I forget who's who's his co-anchor, his co-presenter, Faye Dunaway.
[02:00.960 --> 02:02.000]  There we go.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.600]  For some reason, her name wasn't coming to me.
[02:04.600 --> 02:07.760]  But yeah, Faye Dunaway just being like, all right, it's La La Land.
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.880]  And everybody, you could just see like his face crystallized and oh, my God, we've made a huge mistake.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.760]  I don't know that we should have done that, right?
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18.520 --> 02:21.000]  Even though it's live TV, but the show must go on, right?
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.520]  And I mean, it's funny, too, because to my memory, and I guess I don't really watch award shows anymore,
[02:26.520 --> 02:32.840]  but it seems to me that in my mind that the Oscars is the one that's only that's most bragged over the years
[02:32.840 --> 02:38.760]  about the fidelity of the vote counting process and the secrecy and, you know,
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.360]  the very ostentatious mentions of their partnership with Price Waterhouse,
[02:44.360 --> 02:49.880]  or now it's Price Waterhouse Coopers, you know, and give a special briefcase, right?
[02:49.880 --> 02:56.240]  And that the two briefcase carriers have become, even before this, now they're much better known,
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.280]  but they were part of the red carpet ceremony, you know, where they're dressed up
[03:01.280 --> 03:09.760]  and they're ostentatiously bringing, you know, they're carrying these briefcases full of the winning envelopes.
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.120]  That they're the show that, you know, like other awards shows, I don't remember that,
[03:14.120 --> 03:20.440]  you know, any kind of exposure to the integrity of the process.
[03:20.440 --> 03:26.040]  No, exactly. I mean, it's also the history of the award show, right?
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.240]  Where you look at the Golden Globes and you look at the Emmys, and to a much lesser extent, the Tonys.
[03:31.240 --> 03:36.160]  The Tonys are more on the Oscar levels, but especially if you look at the Golden Globes and the Emmys,
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.840]  they're very much more of a like, let's sit down and have a boozy lunch
[03:40.840 --> 03:48.880]  and acknowledge that these are probably, you know, probably win awards that are won by massive marketing campaigns,
[03:48.880 --> 03:51.240]  but also let's feel good about ourselves.
[03:51.240 --> 03:56.120]  Whereas the Oscars, for as long as I've been alive and much more than that,
[03:56.120 --> 04:03.480]  was raised as the like, this is the pinnacle of, you know, achievement as an actor or an actress or a director.
[04:03.480 --> 04:09.480]  And, you know, once you're recognized at the Oscars, then you have become a legitimate star.
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.840]  And that was the thing. It's like, if you want to become big, you have to get an Academy Award nomination.
[04:14.840 --> 04:18.840]  Forget the Golden Globes or the Emmys or anything, you know, along those lines.
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.280]  Those don't matter as much as the Oscars because the Oscars are voted on by us.
[04:24.280 --> 04:27.080]  And we, you know, we have this proud tradition.
[04:27.080 --> 04:36.120]  And like you said, PricewaterhouseCoopers, I'm pretty sure that's the only accounting firm I knew by name growing up.
[04:36.120 --> 04:41.800]  You know, you don't, when you ask little kids, like seven-year-olds, like, how many accounting firms can you name?
[04:41.800 --> 04:47.320]  And I'm pretty sure that at least growing up in LA, the only thing people would have been able to like,
[04:47.320 --> 04:50.120]  oh yeah, PricewaterhouseCoopers, they do the Oscars.
[04:50.120 --> 04:55.640]  Like, they're the people who look a little bit nerdy in really fancy suits and dresses,
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.280]  holding giant briefcases that remind you of nuclear football.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.240]  They take care of us and they make sure that the integrity of the Oscar stays intact, dammit.
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.320]  Hey, let me take a moment here and do my own Warren Beatty.
[05:09.320 --> 05:11.160]  Just let me double check that we're okay here.
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.280]  Can you double check that you're using the right mic in Skype?
[05:14.280 --> 05:17.880]  Yeah, I absolutely can.
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.040]  Because like, you sound pretty good, but you sound ever so slightly tinny.
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.120]  Is that good? Can you hear me tapping on that?
[05:24.120 --> 05:25.160]  Yeah, yes.
[05:25.160 --> 05:25.480]  Yeah.
[05:25.480 --> 05:25.960]  All right, you're sorry?
[05:25.960 --> 05:27.000]  I'm using the right microphone.
[05:27.000 --> 05:27.720]  All right, you're good.
[05:27.720 --> 05:30.200]  All right, I just wanted to double check.
[05:30.200 --> 05:32.600]  But I figured out why, hold on.
[05:32.600 --> 05:35.560]  I'm using the right microphone, but the wrong side of it.
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.760]  Oh, now you sound much better.
[05:37.320 --> 05:38.360]  Yeah, okay.
[05:38.920 --> 05:45.000]  Well, now now we've proven that podcasting on an afternoon.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.080]  Yeah, we're done.
[05:47.720 --> 05:48.280]  Show's done.
[05:48.280 --> 05:49.320]  Show's over, everybody.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.280]  It's not La La Land.
[05:52.520 --> 05:53.320]  That's good.
[05:53.320 --> 05:54.280]  I'm glad.
[05:54.280 --> 05:56.840]  I definitely don't want to sound tinny on the talk show.
[05:59.080 --> 06:00.360]  That's so funny.
[06:00.360 --> 06:03.240]  I'm so glad I said something now rather than two hours from now.
[06:03.880 --> 06:04.360]  Me too.
[06:06.120 --> 06:09.640]  So I found this so interesting because it really was the worst possible.
[06:09.640 --> 06:10.680]  It was the biggest award.
[06:12.040 --> 06:13.080]  The end of the night.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.840]  So they couldn't cut to commercial.
[06:14.840 --> 06:19.720]  And it's like, no offense, no offense at all to the nominees for best sound editing,
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.360]  because it is the biggest award that they can win.
[06:22.360 --> 06:26.360]  And I understand that these are professional, you know, like in a way that like,
[06:26.360 --> 06:30.600]  you and I work in a niche area of journalism, right?
[06:30.600 --> 06:32.840]  Like, I understand what that's like.
[06:32.840 --> 06:37.720]  And that Europe, they're obsessed with sound that I'm not trying to diminish the embarrassment
[06:37.720 --> 06:41.960]  that it would have caused if the same mistake had happened two hours earlier when the best
[06:41.960 --> 06:43.240]  sound editing award was given out.
[06:43.240 --> 06:47.560]  But it would have been so much less publicity the next day, right?
[06:48.280 --> 06:49.560]  Yeah, you wouldn't.
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.640]  And also, honestly, the best the winner of best sound editing, chances are they would
[06:53.640 --> 06:58.120]  have gotten up and then before reading their speech, they probably would have looked down
[06:58.120 --> 07:04.200]  at the card and been like, hmm, this has nothing to do with sound editing, although maybe they
[07:04.200 --> 07:10.840]  wouldn't because as the article you were sharing with me earlier about typography, once I got
[07:10.840 --> 07:17.640]  a chance to look at the winner cards that they were distributing, who puts the name
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.800]  of the category in 10 point font at the bottom of a card?
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.840]  Yeah, because that would have been the other thing if the same mistake had been made with
[07:26.840 --> 07:31.880]  an earlier award, it's also possible that the person reading it wouldn't have made the
[07:31.880 --> 07:37.560]  mistake of reading it because part of what made the series of unfortunate events that
[07:37.560 --> 07:45.880]  made this possible is that the name of the movie of the previous winner, what happened
[07:45.880 --> 07:49.560]  is for anybody who isn't sure of the details of this, the second to last award was given
[07:49.560 --> 07:54.120]  for best actress and it was Emma Stone in the movie La La Land and that they keep two
[07:54.120 --> 07:56.440]  copies of these cards on both sides of the stage.
[07:56.440 --> 08:00.200]  And when they came out, when he was supposed to give him the last card of the night, he
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.800]  gave Warren Beatty the second to last, which was the one that was just announced.
[08:04.440 --> 08:08.440]  So the second to last award was for Emma Stone, La La Land, and he gave Warren Beatty a card
[08:08.440 --> 08:12.120]  that said the exact same thing, but it just so happened that La La Land was one of the
[08:12.120 --> 08:15.880]  nominees for best picture and was highly favored to win it.
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.280]  So it was no surprise. And so when Faye Dunaway looked at the card, it said Emma Stone, La
[08:20.280 --> 08:24.200]  La Land, and she just sort of like, well, I don't know why they put Emma Stone there,
[08:24.200 --> 08:31.320]  but I see La La Land, so I'll say La La Land, which was in hindsight a mistake, but it's
[08:31.320 --> 08:33.080]  kind of reasonable, you know?
[08:33.080 --> 08:38.360]  Yeah. It's not like, you know, the card said, I don't know, Zootopia.
[08:39.320 --> 08:40.840]  And you're like, yeah, that makes sense.
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.840]  If the same, I gave the guy, the guy got the wrong card from the previous award, was halfway
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.240]  through the show, there's a good chance that none of the movies that are up for the current
[08:51.240 --> 08:57.400]  one were in the one that was previously announced. And then they'd be like, I don't, you know,
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.720]  they'd have to say, like, maybe that would dawn on them. Like, holy, holy heck, they
[09:01.720 --> 09:02.600]  gave me the wrong card.
[09:03.480 --> 09:04.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:04.280 --> 09:12.280]  So, A, the whole procedure, this whole procedure of having two sets of cards seems like a massive
[09:12.280 --> 09:13.000]  mistake to me.
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.800]  Oh, my gosh. So the way I understand it, and I may be totally wrong, and things have changed
[09:19.800 --> 09:23.880]  since then. So if there's a listener out there who has inside info on the Academy Awards
[09:23.880 --> 09:27.800]  and wants to correct me if I'm wrong, go for it. But the way I understand it is this is
[09:27.800 --> 09:36.280]  leftover from an older tradition, pre, you know, I don't even know, maybe even pre, like,
[09:36.840 --> 09:43.080]  backstage handlers, with the idea being that in order to make the show run smoothly, and
[09:43.080 --> 09:47.560]  to make things interesting, because it is, after all, a stage show and a show that is
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.360]  being produced for television, people are going to come in from opposite sides of the
[09:52.360 --> 09:58.760]  stage. But because there are, you know, as time has gone on, there are, like, big numbers
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.480]  and things have to change at the last minute, a presenter may have been originally scheduled
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.880]  to come on from stage left, and then abruptly needs to come on from stage right. And rather
[10:09.880 --> 10:15.240]  than having to, you know, send a runner in black, like, zipping around the back of the
[10:15.240 --> 10:18.680]  stage and maybe running into, you know, the best actress nominee or something.
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.720]  Well, and also, and also that would violate the idea, the rule that the only two people
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.040]  who have these envelopes before they're announced are the two representatives of Price
[10:28.040 --> 10:28.600]  Waterhouse.
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.360]  Exactly. And that also takes away the secrecy. So the thought is, well, we'll just put one
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.880]  briefcase carrier stage left and one briefcase carrier stage right. They each have a copy
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.680]  of all of the awards. So no matter what happens, the presenter, no matter where they end up
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.680]  having to enter from, they will always be right next to the envelope necessary for their
[10:50.680 --> 10:58.840]  entrance, which is a lovely idea in theory. And, you know, 80 some odd years until now
[10:58.840 --> 11:00.200]  worked okay.
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.160]  Yeah. And even if you want to stick with it, it's clear that the procedure should have
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.800]  been that it should have been with a very strict, you know, like, double checking. If
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.200]  you're off stage on the other side. And so in other words, your colleague, like, let's
[11:16.200 --> 11:20.200]  say you and I are the two people giving out these awards. If it's your turn to give out
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.560]  best actress in a leading role, I'm going to have my copy of that exact envelope in
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.160]  my hand. And then I'm going to watch the presenters go out on stage, or I guess, who
[11:31.160 --> 11:38.600]  was it? It was Leo DiCaprio comes out on stage, reads it and hands Emma Stone the Oscar. And
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.800]  then at that point, I'm going to take my copy of that card and put it in a different
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.600]  pocket, you know?
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.200]  Right, like, not in the not in the hand that I'm about to, you know, give to the next
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.160]  presenter.
[11:51.160 --> 11:58.760]  I'm going to systematically do that at each, you know, for each of the awards to at least
[11:58.760 --> 12:01.640]  it doesn't quite make it impossible that I could do it because I you know, you'd have
[12:01.640 --> 12:03.000]  to like destroy it or something.
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.960]  Yeah. And people want it for memorabilia and the like, but still,
[12:07.960 --> 12:13.560]  they had photos of the guy backstage, you know, this poor fellow who is responsible
[12:13.560 --> 12:19.960]  for taking a photo of Emma Stone right moments before he's goofing around on Twitter with
[12:19.960 --> 12:26.440]  his iPhone, taking pictures of Emma Stone. And then there's photos of him holding two
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.560]  envelopes, like he's still got two envelopes in his hand, the best actress one that he
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.920]  should have put into a different pile. And presumably the the best picture one that he
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.160]  needed to give to Warren Beatty in a minute, and he just gave him the wrong one, which
[12:41.160 --> 12:42.040]  is insane.
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.840]  But when you look at the envelopes, like Andy, it's funny because the tweet that got that
[12:46.840 --> 12:52.360]  got sent around the world with the like the most popular tweet showing how hard the envelopes
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.880]  are to read was a freeze frame of from his TiVo that Andy Anotko friend of the show,
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.120]  Andy Anotko posted to Twitter.
[13:00.120 --> 13:08.040]  And and yeah, it's like a deep red envelope with very small on gold, no gold on burgundy,
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.240]  which I think is worse.
[13:09.240 --> 13:10.040]  It's Oh, that's right.
[13:10.040 --> 13:10.600]  That's right.
[13:10.600 --> 13:11.000]  Yeah.
[13:11.000 --> 13:11.320]  All right.
[13:11.320 --> 13:12.360]  No, it is much worse.
[13:13.240 --> 13:13.740]  Yeah.
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.480]  Light text on dark paper in general is a bad idea when you're trying to read, especially
[13:19.480 --> 13:21.320]  in bright lights on a stage.
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.680]  And there's tons of people who are backstage backstage where it's dark and everybody involved
[13:28.680 --> 13:31.240]  is 50 or older.
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.040]  And so I can I can vouch as a 40 almost 44 year old that yeah, reading in the dark is
[13:38.040 --> 13:40.840]  a real problem after the age of 40.
[13:40.840 --> 13:49.480]  And like small type, it's just incomprehensible that that would be the design, especially
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.920]  given the system, you know, that that there are two sets, you would just think that designing
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.000]  to make sure that we always give the right envelope would be there.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.440]  Maybe it's a little bit clearer on what this envelope is for.
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.080]  And again, I don't understand the the need to write it in such tiny text.
[14:07.080 --> 14:12.600]  I mean, if you look at Andy's photo, it can't be bigger than 12 or 14 point font.
[14:12.600 --> 14:13.080]  No.
[14:13.080 --> 14:19.880]  And that in gold, like, and I understand the concept of Oh, well, we want to write best
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.320]  actress in a leading role versus best actress in a supporting role.
[14:23.320 --> 14:31.080]  But can't you write best actress or best picture in big honking like 36 point font?
[14:31.880 --> 14:35.640]  Maybe you know, in legible fonts.
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.440]  That's crazy.
[14:36.440 --> 14:37.080]  You've got it.
[14:37.080 --> 14:37.800]  You've got it.
[14:37.800 --> 14:42.120]  I mean, there's just no excuse for not doing it in dark textile, light background.
[14:42.760 --> 14:43.560]  I know.
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.360]  It's frustrating.
[14:45.960 --> 14:48.760]  It just it's just so funny.
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.440]  Anyway, I had a couple of links this week to the critique of the design.
[14:52.440 --> 14:59.000]  And it's I think the other thing the other the other angle is the psychology of it, which
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.600]  is that it totally makes sense to me that it didn't even occur to Warren Beatty or Faye
[15:06.600 --> 15:08.920]  Dunaway that we might be given the wrong on.
[15:09.800 --> 15:10.120]  Right.
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.000]  No, of course not.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.680]  The Oscars are always right.
[15:13.320 --> 15:18.120]  Like, I think that if you're the guy from Price Waterhouse, I would be thinking I really
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.760]  would even if this was like my 20th year doing it and it feels familiar or whatever.
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.840]  I'm still thinking, oh, my God, I cannot screw this up on every single envelope.
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.480]  This is the year.
[15:29.480 --> 15:31.960]  This is the year that terrible things will happen.
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.320]  Somebody said that it is literally it could not be.
[15:37.320 --> 15:39.720]  There's never been a better example of that phrase.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.680]  You had one job.
[15:43.880 --> 15:44.380]  Yep.
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.520]  Oh, gosh.
[15:46.520 --> 15:47.000]  Yeah.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.200]  I do feel kind of sorry for that for that poor guy.
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.280]  Just, you know, just I wouldn't want to be the person to be like, so what did you do
[15:56.280 --> 15:57.160]  at your last job?
[15:57.720 --> 16:00.120]  Well, I inadvertently screwed up the Oscars.
[16:02.040 --> 16:02.680]  Best picture.
[16:03.480 --> 16:03.980]  Yeah.
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.240]  Oh, boy.
[16:07.240 --> 16:07.400]  All right.
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.360]  Let me take a break before we get into the nerdy stuff and and thank our good friends
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.240]  at Squarespace.
[16:13.240 --> 16:19.560]  Next time you make a big move, you need a new website, make your next move with Squarespace.
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.120]  You can get a beautiful website from Squarespace, any type of website you need.
[16:24.120 --> 16:24.760]  You need a store.
[16:24.760 --> 16:25.560]  Is that your idea?
[16:25.560 --> 16:27.400]  They can make they have templates for stores.
[16:27.400 --> 16:28.120]  Is it a blog?
[16:28.120 --> 16:29.400]  They have templates for blogs.
[16:30.520 --> 16:31.080]  Podcasts.
[16:31.080 --> 16:31.800]  You want to make a podcast?
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.280]  Guess what?
[16:32.280 --> 16:33.880]  Squarespace can help you with that.
[16:35.560 --> 16:41.880]  And even if you've just got the idea, you can start by getting your own domain name.
[16:41.880 --> 16:47.320]  Through Squarespace and get it held for you while you work on the idea, everything you
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.680]  want to do with a website from the domain name to the hosting, to the analytics and
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.120]  stats as you see what people are doing and what they're doing at the website, all of
[16:58.120 --> 17:00.040]  it goes through squarespace.com.
[17:00.040 --> 17:05.400]  Everything you do is set up visually, drag and drop, click and drag, that sort of thing.
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.960]  If you want to and listeners of the show, it's very likely if you have the capability
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.880]  if you know what you're doing, if you've got a bit of a web development nerd angle
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.960]  to your abilities, you could drop in and put custom JavaScript in.
[17:17.960 --> 17:20.840]  You can modify the CSS if you want to, stuff like that.
[17:20.840 --> 17:22.840]  So if you want to get nerdy and look at the code, you can do it.
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.680]  But if you don't, you don't have to.
[17:24.680 --> 17:29.960]  And it's really a very app-like experience of the way that you can just drag stuff around
[17:29.960 --> 17:35.160]  and have a professionally designed website no matter what your skill level is, technically.
[17:35.160 --> 17:39.160]  Where do you go to get a free trial?
[17:39.160 --> 17:41.160]  Go to squarespace.com.
[17:41.160 --> 17:43.160]  Just go there.
[17:43.160 --> 17:45.160]  You get a free trial.
[17:45.160 --> 17:47.160]  You don't even need a code or anything like that.
[17:47.160 --> 17:51.160]  The thing you want to remember is when you do sign up, remember this code, Gruber, my
[17:51.160 --> 17:57.160]  last name, G-R-U-B-E-R, and you'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.160]  Squarespace.
[17:59.160 --> 18:01.160]  Make your next move with Squarespace.
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.160]  I thought we'd start.
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.160]  Did you see this thing where the Apple shareholder meeting was earlier this week?
[18:09.160 --> 18:11.160]  Yes.
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.160]  Good old Apple shareholder meeting.
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.160]  We used to, when I worked at Macworld, we used to send somebody down there to just take
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.160]  notes, and it was usually very boring, and there was always one person who was like,
[18:21.160 --> 18:25.160]  let's divest all the company of all of X and Y.
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.160]  But this year, it was a little bit different.
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.160]  This year's a little bit interesting.
[18:31.160 --> 18:35.160]  It's like the bylaws of a public corporation are such that a crackpot with one share of
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.160]  Apple stock can get the microphone if they so choose.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.160]  I had no idea until this year.
[18:42.160 --> 18:44.160]  I've never been to it.
[18:44.160 --> 18:50.160]  It's never been something that I've thought that saw the need to cover firsthand.
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.160]  I had no idea that they held them at Town Hall.
[18:54.160 --> 19:04.160]  I thought it was some big thing where a thousand Apple diehards love to go.
[19:04.160 --> 19:12.160]  They buy a share and hold onto it forever just so that they can go, like a Macworld keynote or something.
[19:12.160 --> 19:14.160]  Yeah.
[19:14.160 --> 19:21.160]  I just don't think that that many people either realize what the annual shareholder meeting is,
[19:21.160 --> 19:29.160]  or they don't really think that, oh, yeah, this is my chance to be within 10 feet of Tim Cook.
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.160]  This is going to be great.
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.160]  It's really just like 100 people who show up.
[19:32.160 --> 19:33.160]  Yeah.
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.160]  Because Town Hall is tiny.
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.160]  Yeah, there's really not a lot of space.
[19:38.160 --> 19:45.160]  And I do think, I can't remember how it goes, but I feel like there's some kind of priority system,
[19:45.160 --> 19:47.160]  but I may be wrong on that.
[19:47.160 --> 19:50.160]  Where you have to RSVP or something like that.
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:51.160 --> 19:54.160]  So they actually have enough space.
[19:54.160 --> 19:57.160]  So the news that came out of it was somebody asked a question.
[19:57.160 --> 20:00.160]  This is from a report at 9to5Mac.
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.160]  It's not on video or anything like that, so who knows what the greater context is.
[20:04.160 --> 20:09.160]  But the news that came out was that Tim Cook said something about the pro area again.
[20:09.160 --> 20:13.160]  And I'll just read from 9to5Mac's story, and I will put it in the show note, I promise.
[20:13.160 --> 20:21.160]  Cook also hinted at Apple's product pipeline by promising Apple will, quote, do more in the pro area, end quote.
[20:21.160 --> 20:28.160]  Cook called out the creative field as especially important to Apple while pushing back against the notion that Apple is too consumer focused now.
[20:28.160 --> 20:39.160]  Quote, don't think that something we've done or something we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere, end quote.
[20:39.160 --> 20:46.160]  That's about as little as you can actually say specifically.
[20:46.160 --> 20:54.160]  I don't expect him to reveal anything specific in response to a shareholder question.
[20:54.160 --> 20:58.160]  But he literally didn't even mention, at least in the quote.
[20:58.160 --> 21:05.160]  I don't know, again, it's selective quotes from, let's see who wrote this at 9to5Mac, Zach Hall at 9to5Mac.
[21:05.160 --> 21:10.160]  But at least from what he quoted, it doesn't even mention whether it has anything to do with the Mac or not.
[21:10.160 --> 21:18.160]  Because they have the iPad Pro, which is, I don't know if you could tell, but given the name, they consider a device pro.
[21:18.160 --> 21:21.160]  For professionals, yeah.
[21:21.160 --> 21:30.160]  Well, I do think, though, I do think that in Apple marketing speak, pro doesn't necessarily mean professional user.
[21:30.160 --> 21:33.160]  It means something a little more nebulous.
[21:33.160 --> 21:49.160]  It's sort of more like what in other contexts would be like deluxe or premium, just nicer and more expensive is sort of what they mean by pro.
[21:49.160 --> 21:58.160]  And the iPad Pro in particular exemplifies that, in my opinion, because, for example, the MacBook Pros definitely look different than the regular MacBooks.
[21:58.160 --> 22:00.160]  They're thicker and heavier.
[22:00.160 --> 22:02.160]  And in a way, that's not as nice, right?
[22:02.160 --> 22:08.160]  Like if you just, in terms of which one's nicer to carry around all day, a MacBook is better than a MacBook Pro because it's thinner and lighter.
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.160]  For sure.
[22:09.160 --> 22:24.160]  It's that tradeoff of we'll make it thicker so we can put faster, heavier components in there and a bigger battery and stuff is, in a lot of ways, leads towards literally professional use cases.
[22:24.160 --> 22:30.160]  Whereas the iPad Pro versus the iPad Air, it's really just a nicer iPad.
[22:30.160 --> 22:34.160]  Yeah, well, but you could also argue the same concept, right?
[22:34.160 --> 22:41.160]  Where you have the 12.9 and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, they're the only iPads that can use Apple Pencils.
[22:41.160 --> 22:52.160]  So that basically limits, like creative professionals, if you want to use an iPad as a proper sketching tool, the only thing to get is an Apple Pencil and an iPad Pro.
[22:52.160 --> 22:58.160]  There's not even any point using a third-party stylus anymore because it's just so much of a better experience on that.
[22:58.160 --> 23:07.160]  And you could argue that, again, the processing power on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the True Tone screen on the 9.7, like they are nicer features.
[23:07.160 --> 23:19.160]  But specifically for people who spend a lot of time staring at a tablet screen, a True Tone screen is going to be nicer for them, especially doing proofreading or typography correction or any of the above.
[23:19.160 --> 23:22.160]  It's going to be a better workspace.
[23:22.160 --> 23:30.160]  Yeah, there's overlap. There's clearly overlap between Apple's definition of Pro and actual lowercase p professional use cases.
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.160]  There's a lot of overlap in some cases, but it's not like a one-to-one mapping.
[23:34.160 --> 23:36.160]  No, it's not the way that it used to be, right?
[23:36.160 --> 23:47.160]  Where when Apple said this is our Pro computer, what they really meant is this is the computer that the top 2% of the market is going to buy for professional use cases.
[23:47.160 --> 23:50.160]  So who knows what he means? We're going to do more in a Pro area.
[23:50.160 --> 24:13.160]  I'm not saying it's bad. I think it's better that he said something than that he said nothing in terms of, let's just say, the broader context of the concern that Apple is losing interest in high-performance computing professional Mac uses, which is a broad area.
[24:13.160 --> 24:36.160]  But the areas I'm thinking about, developers who have code that takes a long time to compile, video editors, people who do computer graphics and areas like that, researchers, people who do AI research and have these huge data sets.
[24:36.160 --> 24:45.160]  Obviously, artificial intelligence has never not been an interest, but it's exploding in practical uses where it's really starting to become a consumer thing.
[24:45.160 --> 24:57.160]  There's all sorts of super high-performance computing that people who are working on that need to do.
[24:57.160 --> 25:03.160]  The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 1100 days.
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.160]  Yeah, it is overdue by just a few years, just a while.
[25:09.160 --> 25:21.160]  I don't know. It's funny to me having transcribed many, many things that Tim Cook has said over the years, usually at financial calls when he's, again, speaking off the cuff.
[25:21.160 --> 25:39.160]  And the sentence phrasing, it may not be an exact transcription, but the don't think that something we've done or something that we're doing isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere, that is very classic Tim Cook being like, what do you mean we're not doing things for pros?
[25:39.160 --> 25:51.160]  It's him being, at least from, again, my reading, it's him being slightly defensive and slightly confused as the, you know, why aren't you guys patient and just trust that we know what we're doing?
[25:51.160 --> 26:01.160]  Which, you know, you can be that way as the CEO of a major company, but like you say, John, the Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 1100 days.
[26:01.160 --> 26:11.160]  It's not like people are throwing their hands up in the air and saying, oh, pro users, you know, you guys were just catered to six months ago. You never, you know, don't worry about it.
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.160]  Like there are some valid concerns in this space.
[26:14.160 --> 26:31.160]  It's sort of like the graph of how much anxiety it causes as the Mac Pro goes un-updated. I'm not going to say it's logarithmic, but it increases over time. It's not linear.
[26:31.160 --> 26:51.160]  It's as time goes on, it gets scarier and scarier because it seems all the more preposterous, you know, so a couple of weeks ago, sometime somewhat recently, I linked to a story about a guy who works from a guy who works in the professional video industry.
[26:51.160 --> 27:04.160]  And it was just talking about how he expects he's going to have to switch from Mac Pros to Windows machine soon because he's dependent on these cutting edge.
[27:04.160 --> 27:25.160]  The work he's doing needs GPUs and these NVIDIA boxes are coming out with all these parallel GPUs. And it really is so much of where Moore's law still applies is in the, you know, year over year improvements to GPUs and the parallelism.
[27:25.160 --> 27:40.160]  And, you know, it's just where performance computing is going. And, you know, I don't know that anybody was really thinking that even when the Mac Pro was brand new 1100 days ago, it wasn't like the world's fastest GPU.
[27:40.160 --> 27:50.160]  And now it's unchanged over 1100 days. So I got some pushback on that from people saying, hey, you know, you just link to this now.
[27:50.160 --> 28:03.160]  But that was from May. That was like May 2016. It's old news. And I actually didn't notice that. It was like, and I hate, it's like one of the mistakes I make, I don't know, a couple times a year during Fireball is I'll link to something thinking it's new.
[28:03.160 --> 28:11.160]  And my comment makes it seem as though it's new. And it's not. It's, you know, I don't know, however many months or even a year out of date.
[28:11.160 --> 28:23.160]  And it's just, it's somehow I have a blind spot for double checking the date on a post because sometimes it's like what happens is I'll see somebody linked to it on Twitter or something. And the link on Twitter is under the guys that it's new.
[28:23.160 --> 28:33.160]  So I click brand new. Yeah. And, you know, in some templates and on a blog or something like that, the date might not be prominent. It might be at the bottom or something like that.
[28:33.160 --> 28:42.160]  And I don't, I just hate when I make that mistake. But in this particular case, I actually feel like the mistake, you know, lends itself to your argument.
[28:42.160 --> 28:49.160]  Right. I updated the post then to say that he wrote it in May of 2016 so that everybody, everybody who subsequently read it would know it.
[28:49.160 --> 28:55.160]  But the fact that the Mac hasn't been updated, Mac Pro hasn't been updated since then just makes his arguments all the more relevant.
[28:55.160 --> 29:17.160]  Absolutely. And, you know, he's not shouting in a vacuum. I have friends who work at visual design agencies who actually a close friend of mine was really sort of wrestling with herself whether or not to get one of the new MacBook Pros this year to replace basically an aging 2009 era MacBook Pro.
[29:17.160 --> 29:26.160]  Because she needs, you know, she needs the power and she wants, she wants an updated portable workspace. But the MacBook Pro is essentially for her to buy it.
[29:26.160 --> 29:33.160]  She would be compromising on the kind of things that she would need for running Cinema 4D and the like.
[29:33.160 --> 29:44.160]  And it's really like, yes, video editors and graphics professionals are a niche audience and certainly more niche for Apple than they were a decade or even two decades ago.
[29:44.160 --> 30:00.160]  But they're still, you know, that's, that's still a segment that can move some, some product, you know, video professionals don't usually, especially big production houses, you know, they're buying 20, 30, 40 computers for their, for their workforce.
[30:00.160 --> 30:15.160]  And if those computers are all tricked out Mac Pros so that they can process footage, like, that's not a like, yeah, it's a drop in the bucket compared to iPhone sales, but it's still a pretty hefty chunk of Mac sales.
[30:15.160 --> 30:25.160]  And for them to just be like, yeah, we're just going to give up and hand this to Windows because we don't care enough about that market anymore. That market isn't interesting enough to us anymore.
[30:25.160 --> 30:38.160]  And I, part of me as a former film person, it really kind of is like a stab in the gut because I don't, you know, like so many of my film friends and myself included, like, we don't enjoy Premiere.
[30:38.160 --> 30:43.160]  We don't enjoy, you know, working with Cinema 4D or Adobe's products.
[30:43.160 --> 30:53.160]  Like the whole, one of the whole excitements about getting into this industry was working with tools like Motion and Final Cut and, and Shake before it got discontinued.
[30:53.160 --> 31:09.160]  And for Apple to basically be like, yeah, this is not an interest to us anymore. Apple can do this, but they're essentially, you know, they're essentially telling people who've based their entire livelihoods on working on a Mac and building up a software platform on the Mac.
[31:09.160 --> 31:21.160]  Eh, sorry, you're going to have to go learn another platform or go switch to another operating system because you're, you know, our bottom line does no longer includes this segment of the population.
[31:21.160 --> 31:43.160]  I, it, what occurred to me in that wake of the, the cooks, you know, more or less stay tuned again, a response to this question at the shareholders meeting is that Apple's culture of secrecy about products works fine when the company is functional.
[31:43.160 --> 31:56.160]  There are trade-offs, you know, like, and you know, people have, this is one of those ever, evergreen topics about Apple is what if they were more open and, you know, in a ways that in the Tim Cook era, they are a little bit more open in some areas.
[31:56.160 --> 32:11.160]  There are trade-offs between secrecy and openness in terms of maintaining a surprise, in terms of not over promising, being able to over promise and under promise and over deliver as opposed to the other way around.
[32:11.160 --> 32:21.160]  For example, one of the things, you know, in a lot of companies adhere to is not talking about release dates of products because if you never talk about the release date of a product, it won't be late.
[32:21.160 --> 32:26.160]  Whereas if you do and you're late, then you're late.
[32:26.160 --> 32:44.160]  So the trade-off, their culture of secrecy has trade-offs when their product development is functional and those trade-offs, I think Apple has long believed work in the company's favor, but when they're not functional, the culture of secrecy just completely breaks down.
[32:44.160 --> 32:56.160]  I mean, and clearly the Mac Pro is a dysfunctional product at this point because they haven't, you know, like, if they had canceled it a year ago, if they had just said at WWDC that, you know, you know, the time for these...
[32:56.160 --> 32:57.160]  The Mac Pro is done.
[32:57.160 --> 33:01.160]  Right. And, you know, the iMac is our pro desktop.
[33:01.160 --> 33:11.160]  Obviously, it would not have gone over well with a certain audience who, you know, wants higher, you know, the highest performance they can get.
[33:11.160 --> 33:18.160]  But at least you couldn't say that it's dysfunctional. I mean, that's a rational decision and then people can plan accordingly.
[33:18.160 --> 33:23.160]  Well, and one year later, we wouldn't be talking about it still. It just would have happened.
[33:23.160 --> 33:39.160]  Right. I just feel for me, the last year, like from WWDC through today, is the period where for me, at least, it's gone from the Mac Pro is overdue to the Mac Pro is ridiculous.
[33:39.160 --> 33:45.160]  And the fact that Apple is still selling it, isn't saying anything is...
[33:45.160 --> 33:50.160]  I don't know if the company is in denial about it or if they're...
[33:50.160 --> 33:58.160]  I don't know. But it's, to me, and again, I don't... I'm not saying they need to because need is the wrong word.
[33:58.160 --> 34:07.160]  But they ought to, if it's true that they're going to have some kind of event this month to announce, you know, the rumors are rampant that they're going to have new iPad Pros.
[34:07.160 --> 34:20.160]  And we can talk about that in a moment. But iPad, new iPads, maybe like updated iPhone SE, maybe red iPhone 7s, maybe even a new iMac.
[34:20.160 --> 34:23.160]  Although I don't... There's not as much smoke to that.
[34:23.160 --> 34:24.160]  Chatter, yeah.
[34:24.160 --> 34:36.160]  Fire. But on the other hand, iMacs often don't get the attention in the supply chain, Asian supply chain rumor chain that iOS products do.
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.160]  So maybe it's just that. But I haven't heard anything about new Mac Pros.
[34:40.160 --> 34:44.160]  No, aside from people complaining that they're not here.
[34:44.160 --> 34:56.160]  Right. But I really think Apple ought to... And it wouldn't be comfortable, but I really think that Apple ought to somehow address that elephant in the room at the event, even if they have nothing to say.
[34:56.160 --> 35:11.160]  And I don't know exactly, because I don't know exactly what their plans are. I don't know, you know, but they really ought to say something more than, you know, they should let Mac Pro users know what the heck is going on.
[35:11.160 --> 35:15.160]  And acknowledge the fact that this is ridiculous.
[35:15.160 --> 35:26.160]  The thing that really frustrates me, and I kind of forget about it until it gets brought up again, is the fact that they're still currently selling the very, very out of date Mac Pro.
[35:26.160 --> 35:27.160]  Right.
[35:27.160 --> 35:36.160]  And not at a discount either. It's just full price for a, what, four and a half year old computer?
[35:36.160 --> 35:47.160]  Right. And that's another policy that has trade-offs, but makes sense from Apple's perspective. This policy of that they don't cut product prices as the life goes on.
[35:47.160 --> 36:01.160]  Like, so if they come out with a Mac Book, and it doesn't get updated for 15 months, in that 14th month, when the old Mac Books have only one month, but they haven't been replaced yet, they still sell at the same price.
[36:01.160 --> 36:14.160]  Whereas Dell, you go to Dell, the laptops, it's like buying commodities, you know, like every month they go up and down in price based on, you know, where the RAM market is and SSD components dropping, you know.
[36:14.160 --> 36:22.160]  And they come up with weird prices, like you configure your Dell computer and it's $867 or something like that instead of $899.
[36:22.160 --> 36:23.160]  And weird sales too.
[36:23.160 --> 36:32.160]  Right. And Apple picks prices that are, that are, the price is part of the marketing where they have nice even, you know, it's $2499 and it's going to stay $2499.
[36:32.160 --> 36:41.160]  And part of the reason they don't drop it to $2299 14 months after it came out is so that when the next one comes out, they can use the same price point.
[36:41.160 --> 36:49.160]  And so clearly that's what they're doing with the Mac Pro is maintaining these price points so that when the replacements come out, it doesn't look like the prices went up by $2,000.
[36:49.160 --> 36:55.160]  Of course. But it only works when the product development is functional and it comes out on a regular basis.
[36:55.160 --> 37:03.160]  Like you can sell an 11 month old computer at the same price and you're only asking for a small premium.
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.160]  You can do it on a, let's say it's an 18 month development cycle.
[37:07.160 --> 37:16.160]  You can do it at the 17th month and expect that informed consumers know, oh, this is not the time to buy a Mac Pro at 17 months old.
[37:16.160 --> 37:18.160]  There's probably a new one coming.
[37:18.160 --> 37:23.160]  But to do it with a three year old computer is it's embarrassing.
[37:23.160 --> 37:25.160]  It's insulting a little bit.
[37:25.160 --> 37:34.160]  And it's like you said, because there's no new product and they're just parading the fact, you know, the latest and greatest software.
[37:34.160 --> 37:45.160]  I forget a while back, someone posted to Twitter, you know, the Mac Pro with the latest and greatest software, including Aperture, something that's been sunset.
[37:45.160 --> 37:47.160]  Is that still on the website?
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.160]  I actually don't know.
[37:49.160 --> 37:56.160]  I wouldn't be surprised if it still was because that's the problem is that it just doesn't feel like the Mac Pro is a priority.
[37:56.160 --> 38:09.160]  And honestly, even if it was just, I don't know, I would much rather they pull the product off the market and say coming soon and just, you know, you want to make it nebulous.
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.160]  Just say we have, you know, do the do the nebulous Apple store thing.
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.160]  We have something great in store for you.
[38:15.160 --> 38:16.160]  And then just leave it like that.
[38:16.160 --> 38:27.160]  And I'd rather be speculating about, oh, well, they have something in the pipeline and who knows if it will come out in 2017 or 2019, but they still have something in the pipeline.
[38:27.160 --> 38:33.160]  Whereas right now, they're basically saying that by not discontinuing the Mac Pro.
[38:33.160 --> 38:40.160]  But every year that the old Mac Pro still stays on sale, it's just it's frustrating.
[38:40.160 --> 38:45.160]  And it's also it's one of those things where, yeah, you can sell an 11 month old computer.
[38:45.160 --> 38:47.160]  You can even sell an 18 month old computer.
[38:47.160 --> 38:56.160]  But once you start selling a computer that's been on the market longer than it's covered by Apple Care or that like people would actively use it.
[38:56.160 --> 38:59.160]  That's when I start getting a little bit uncomfortable.
[38:59.160 --> 39:00.160]  Yeah.
[39:00.160 --> 39:13.160]  And one of the weird things when I published that piece, the recent piece about the video guy who's getting out of it, I got some amazing emails from some some during Fireball readers, most of them in the video industry specifically.
[39:13.160 --> 39:21.160]  Although one guy was like an AI researcher, which is where I got that idea earlier before where his team was going to.
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.160]  I forget what exactly area they're working, but more or less, they just wanted to have massive amounts of computing to throw this at.
[39:27.160 --> 39:40.160]  And in years past, because they work on Mac OS 10 and prefer the Mac as a development environment, just would have gone to Apple and just bought gobs of Mac pros and hooked them together for parallel processing,
[39:40.160 --> 39:45.160]  but instead built their own little network out of Linux boxes, which none of them had previous experience.
[39:45.160 --> 39:57.160]  The reason they would have rather gone with the Mac Pro is they know the Mac Pro and they wouldn't have had to do a bunch of learning about Linux before they got to the AI work that they really wanted to do.
[39:57.160 --> 40:01.160]  They had to do more work upfront to learn how to even set it up.
[40:01.160 --> 40:04.160]  But then it was worth it because it was so much faster.
[40:04.160 --> 40:08.160]  And now we can just buy these boxes and just throw them at the thing.
[40:08.160 --> 40:14.160]  But I heard from a bunch of video pros in the movie industry, including somebody who was working on a super...
[40:14.160 --> 40:22.160]  I'm not going to say the name because I just treat emails confidentially, but let's just say a movie with a $150 million budget.
[40:22.160 --> 40:26.160]  That's an upcoming summer blockbuster.
[40:26.160 --> 40:34.160]  And that they're still doing editing for dailies on the 2012 Mac Pro.
[40:34.160 --> 40:48.160]  I think the version number is 5,1, but the last cheese grater Mac Pros, they had seven of them on location for editing dailies and stuff.
[40:48.160 --> 40:56.160]  Which is ridiculous. That's unbelievable that not only is the Mac Pro as they're selling it three years old,
[40:56.160 --> 41:06.160]  but that there are industry professionals where money is clearly not the problem who just prefer to work on a five-year-old computer.
[41:06.160 --> 41:19.160]  And part of it with this movie is we want to use what we're familiar with, but that the writing's on the wall and that the next big thing might be on Windows.
[41:19.160 --> 41:21.160]  Which is heartbreaking.
[41:21.160 --> 41:28.160]  It is. It's very frustrating. As I said, if you've spent 12 years learning your craft...
[41:28.160 --> 41:36.160]  And yes, if you're in the digital video industry, your craft is constantly changing and it's your job to keep abreast of all of those changes.
[41:36.160 --> 41:47.160]  But at the same time, if you put 12 years of work into mastering Final Cut Pro and you're an expert at Final Cut and you're an expert at the compressor and the various workflows,
[41:47.160 --> 41:53.160]  and then they're essentially like, yeah, well, but Apple's just given up on it. So now we have to move away.
[41:53.160 --> 42:03.160]  Like, I don't know if you ever did any graphics illustration, but I remember, you know, back when free, when Macromedia Freehand was a thing,
[42:03.160 --> 42:16.160]  back in the 90s, people like professionals and students clung to Freehand for God knows, like 10 years after it was discontinued because they had their workflows.
[42:16.160 --> 42:25.160]  And they had like the ability to work through it, like work in it. But unfortunately, illustration, you know, 2D illustration is vastly different than 3D modeling.
[42:25.160 --> 42:34.160]  You have to be using latest and greatest software and hardware in order to be doing that and to have your stuff look like it belongs in a modern film.
[42:34.160 --> 42:42.160]  You can't get away with using, you know, or you can really only get away with using older equipment for so long before it just explodes in your face.
[42:42.160 --> 42:51.160]  No, I remember those days. Well, I never did much illustration, but I, you know, I was more of a layout person, so I was QuarkXPress was my jam, as they say.
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  Oh, PageMaker.
[42:53.160 --> 43:02.160]  But there was the, yeah, the graphic, if you worked in graphic design and print, you needed a layout program, which is probably either Quark or PageMaker.
[43:02.160 --> 43:10.160]  I was on the Quark side. You needed an image editor, which is probably Photoshop, and then you needed a vector illustration app.
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.160]  And that's the one where it was the hardest fought, where there was Freehand and Illustrator.
[43:15.160 --> 43:28.160]  And I always found I didn't really do much illustration. Usually for me, it would be like editing something or something as basic as like, let's make, we can't ship this font for some reason.
[43:28.160 --> 43:37.160]  So let's make a little graphic and convert to outlines. We don't have to ship the font, you know, for some context where you couldn't send somebody you really want to font.
[43:37.160 --> 43:45.160]  Yeah, you really wanted to just send them just an EPS. I was always, Freehand made sense to me.
[43:45.160 --> 43:55.160]  And I think people who like it, even though they weren't from the same company, there's a, in my experience, a huge correlation between people who liked QuarkXPress and people who liked Freehand.
[43:55.160 --> 44:07.160]  Quark and Freehand, even though they're from different companies, worked in people's brains the same way. And I know people who hung on to Freehand for, like you said, like so many years after the war was over.
[44:07.160 --> 44:32.160]  Mm hmm. Running it in Rosetta way past the, yeah. God. Yeah, I think it was what, did Mountain Lion get rid of Rosetta or Lion? It was something along those lines where I had a colleague who literally used Freehand up until the point that it could no longer be supported on their Mac, at which point they finally grudgingly switched Illustrator.
[44:32.160 --> 44:42.160]  So anyway, I don't know. I, I, I feel like this pro question is not going to go away. And I, at this point, I feel like Tim Cook's say nothing answer is no longer.
[44:42.160 --> 44:51.160]  Again, I'm not going to say it's not acceptable. It's not like anything bad is going to come of Apple if they keep pretending like this is normal, but I think it makes them look bad.
[44:51.160 --> 44:59.160]  And it does. And I think that they, I just, based on my email anecdotally, they've, they've passed the point where they're starting to lose customers.
[44:59.160 --> 45:10.160]  Yeah, I would agree with that. Well, it's, it's hit that point where their customers have to switch. They basically, you know, they have to fish or cut bait at this point.
[45:10.160 --> 45:21.160]  They can't just be wading around in the water hoping that, you know, Apple will deliver them a giant fish on a plate ready to run a CUDA system for their graphics needs.
[45:21.160 --> 45:33.160]  And, you know, a beautiful, you know, the sad thing, the really sad thing is Final Cut Pro 10. A lot of people made a lot of fuss about it when it first switched over.
[45:33.160 --> 45:43.160]  And for good reason, you know, it was a fairly limited program. But the people on the software side for Final Cut have actually been doing some really fantastic and smart work.
[45:43.160 --> 45:56.160]  And like the newest version of Final Cut, their latest update, which was released, I think, a couple months ago, is really like it's a dramatic, a dramatic improvement on, on, on that workflow.
[45:56.160 --> 46:09.160]  And so it hurts, it hurts my film editor soul a little bit, that Apple wouldn't give its users the technology to really take advantage of this software that they're developed.
[46:09.160 --> 46:17.160]  They're also developing in house. Like you're, you're letting down your Final Cut Pro team by not giving people the kind of hardware they need to run it.
[46:17.160 --> 46:43.160]  I guess there's some small chance that that in this supposed upcoming event in March that they might answer this, I don't think they're gonna, I don't think there's any chance that they're going to answer it by announcing a new Mac Pro, but maybe they'll maybe they'll have like a new iMac that they'll say is whether they call it the iMac Pro or just say that this is a professionally specced machine and give strong enough hints that yes, this is our answer.
[46:43.160 --> 46:51.160]  And maybe then take the Mac Pros off the market or lower them in price or hide them on apple.com.
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.160]  Take away the aperture mention.
[46:53.160 --> 46:54.160]  Right.
[46:54.160 --> 46:55.160]  Yeah.
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.160]  There's a chance.
[46:56.160 --> 46:59.160]  Yeah. I mean, honestly, I could see that happening.
[46:59.160 --> 47:14.160]  If Apple essentially just said, hey, we made an, we made a way for you to have an external graphics card and have it work properly on the Mac, I think that would actually, that would solve a lot of graphics professionals problems.
[47:14.160 --> 47:25.160]  Because the main issue right now, and then there, there are a couple of third party, third party boxes that'll do this where you can plug an Nvidia CUDA card and then try and, you know, run it off.
[47:25.160 --> 47:32.160]  But there's always going to be latency, right? Because it's not, it's not built to the same specs and it's not built in internally to Apple.
[47:32.160 --> 47:36.160]  But the question is really is Apple, you know, does Apple care about that?
[47:36.160 --> 47:43.160]  Does Apple care about the small niche of users who are going to want a CUDA card when editing graphics?
[47:43.160 --> 47:44.160]  Yeah.
[47:44.160 --> 47:45.160]  I don't know what to say.
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.160]  We could talk about the other rumors about the upcoming event in a moment.
[47:49.160 --> 47:51.160]  The less depressing.
[47:51.160 --> 47:54.160]  Yeah, it's the ones that'll make us happy.
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.160]  But in the meantime, I'm going to take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[47:57.160 --> 47:59.160]  It's our good friends at Harry's.
[47:59.160 --> 48:03.160]  Harry's makes terrific shaving products.
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.160]  We started by two guys, Jeff and Andy, who were fed up with being overcharged for razors.
[48:07.160 --> 48:23.160]  Literally the one day one of them was in the drugstore buying replacement razor blades and had to wait for someone to come over and unlock the case because they're like frequently shoplifted items and then bought them and then realized that it's like it's a lot of money per blade.
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.160]  For a product that's no fun to buy.
[48:26.160 --> 48:27.160]  So they came up with this idea.
[48:27.160 --> 48:28.160]  Let's make our own blades.
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.160]  We'll sell them direct and we'll undercut the big name brands on prices.
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.160]  They literally bought their own factory.
[48:35.160 --> 48:40.160]  A hundred year old blade making factory in Germany.
[48:40.160 --> 48:41.160]  They make these blades.
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.160]  They sell them directly online and they ship them to you for half the price of the leading brand.
[48:46.160 --> 48:47.160]  I did one of my favorite things.
[48:47.160 --> 48:49.160]  They've been sponsoring this show for years.
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.160]  When they first started sponsoring, they sent me a kit with a razor and it had like a chrome handle.
[48:54.160 --> 49:07.160]  I had it for years and then a couple months ago they came out with like a new slightly updated version and they sent me another one that has like a more of a rubbery handle, which I actually kind of like because to me it's not slippery.
[49:07.160 --> 49:11.160]  But I looked at my chrome one that was like three or four years old and it still looked brand new.
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.160]  It's absolutely crazy how well you couldn't tell which one was the new one and which one was the old one.
[49:16.160 --> 49:19.160]  Their product design is really, really great.
[49:19.160 --> 49:22.160]  Their packaging design is really, really great.
[49:22.160 --> 49:23.160]  I said this before. I'll say it again.
[49:23.160 --> 49:29.160]  I always feel bad when I like finish a pack of blades from Harry's because it doesn't look like the type of box you throw away.
[49:29.160 --> 49:30.160]  It looks like the type of box you keep.
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.160]  But that's you know, that's that way lights an appearance on the hoarders show.
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.160]  So I do throw them away.
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.160]  But it always there's always a pang of guilt that I'm throwing away such a nice, nice box.
[49:42.160 --> 49:47.160]  All this for two dollars a blade, more or less compared to the four dollars or more.
[49:47.160 --> 49:50.160]  You will pay at the drugstore for a big name brand.
[49:50.160 --> 49:57.160]  They are so confident in the quality of their blades that they want you to try their most popular trial set for free.
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.160]  It comes with a razor handle of your choice, five blade cartridge and shaving gel.
[50:01.160 --> 50:03.160]  It's free when you sign up.
[50:03.160 --> 50:06.160]  You just pay a small fee for shipping.
[50:06.160 --> 50:08.160]  That's it. Redeem your free trial offer.
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.160]  Go to Harry's dot com slash talk show right now.
[50:12.160 --> 50:20.160]  Harry's h a r r y s dot com slash talk show.
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.160]  All right. Does this this rampant rumor that there's going to be three new iPad pros,
[50:25.160 --> 50:29.160]  nine point seven that I guess it's just a faster version of the nine point seven we have now.
[50:29.160 --> 50:33.160]  Twelve point nine. It's like a faster, better version of the one we have right now.
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.160]  And a ten point five inch diagonal screen that goes edge to edge.
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.160]  Does this make any sense to you?
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.160]  I wanted to.
[50:45.160 --> 51:00.160]  I don't know. I I can see how they've been staggering iPad updates over the last 18 months where, you know, they they started with a twelve point nine in the pro and put all of their latest and greatest new features into that.
[51:00.160 --> 51:11.160]  And then the next spring, they had the nine point seven inch iPad pro and they had almost all of the features from the twelve point nine and some new stuff like true tone and threw it into that.
[51:11.160 --> 51:19.160]  And I guess I guess I could see them throwing a third option into the mix and saying, let's let's see if this sticks.
[51:19.160 --> 51:21.160]  Let's see if this is better.
[51:21.160 --> 51:27.160]  But I I just don't understand why they wouldn't update the line at once.
[51:27.160 --> 51:37.160]  Right. Like if they're going to ship a new edge to edge design that takes out the chin and forehead or greatly reduces them, why wouldn't you do it in two sizes?
[51:37.160 --> 51:49.160]  Mm hmm. Exactly. Like, I understand why they launched the twelve nine and then launched the nine seven because they were still working on trying to put the technology of the twelve nine in the screen into the nine seven.
[51:49.160 --> 51:56.160]  I get that part. But if you're going to launch a ten five, like the smaller one is the harder one.
[51:56.160 --> 52:09.160]  So presumably, why wouldn't you launch the ten five and then also launch that that version in the twelve nine and then keep the nine seven as that's your that's your new iPad Air version.
[52:09.160 --> 52:18.160]  Basically, that's the old iPad Pro nine point seven is now just a regular old iPad Air and these two, the ten point five and the whatever the twelve point nine becomes.
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.160]  These are your really awesome iPads.
[52:22.160 --> 52:23.160]  Right.
[52:23.160 --> 52:33.160]  To just throw in like one in the middle. It's just it feels kind of like taking a dartboard out and like being like, maybe they'll like this.
[52:33.160 --> 52:39.160]  The only way it makes any sense to me is if this the new one with the edge to edge design is also a lot more expensive.
[52:39.160 --> 52:45.160]  Like, yes, it's I don't know, fifteen hundred dollars or something, you know, so that you say, oh, I get it.
[52:45.160 --> 52:58.160]  If I just want to pay what I'm used to paying for an iPad Pro, I'll get the new nine point seven, which would be, you know, like a year better specs, but at the same prices as last year, maybe with more storage or something, you know.
[52:58.160 --> 53:02.160]  But it's typical year over year Apple upgrade of a product.
[53:02.160 --> 53:10.160]  But if I'm if I want to spend a lot more money, I can get this one that's amazing because then it's an easy decision.
[53:10.160 --> 53:17.160]  But if the price range if the prices are like comparable, it doesn't make any sense to me that those products would exist alongside each other.
[53:17.160 --> 53:24.160]  I can see switching to a new design, but then they would take the old design and keep it unchanged and just lower the price.
[53:24.160 --> 53:25.160]  That's what Apple does.
[53:25.160 --> 53:28.160]  Yep. It would be last year's model.
[53:28.160 --> 53:39.160]  The I mean, I could see them getting rid of the twelve nine two and just being like, here's our you know, like what they did with the 17 inch MacBook Pro when they switched to the new design of MacBook Pro.
[53:39.160 --> 53:40.160]  Right.
[53:40.160 --> 53:47.160]  Where they're like, OK, this was a good this was a good thing, like this was a nice idea, but we want to, you know, go with this this design.
[53:47.160 --> 53:51.160]  But that's doesn't seem to be happening, according to the rumors.
[53:51.160 --> 54:03.160]  The only other thing that I can think of is, yes, their their goal is to eventually position the nine point seven as the entry level and then the ten point five is the first pro machine.
[54:03.160 --> 54:09.160]  And eventually they're going to make a version of the twelve point nine that looks like the ten point five.
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.160]  Pause for dog barking.
[54:14.160 --> 54:15.160]  Sorry, one second.
[54:15.160 --> 54:16.160]  That's all right.
[54:16.160 --> 54:18.160]  I just don't think he likes this iPad rumor.
[54:18.160 --> 54:19.160]  Enough.
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.160]  No, she she's like iPads.
[54:23.160 --> 54:25.160]  Yeah, that's OK.
[54:25.160 --> 54:31.160]  She has a she has a very masculine bark, so I understand the confusion.
[54:31.160 --> 54:48.160]  Yeah, but my thought is, all right, so the only way I can see this making sense is if they've tried to make the twelve nine in this new configuration and either the battery life is not what they want or the heaviness is not what they want.
[54:48.160 --> 54:53.160]  Because if you look at the twelve nine right now, the twelve nine is still a pretty big compromise.
[54:53.160 --> 55:02.160]  Like I switched to the nine seven almost instantly after it became available and I thought I would hate it because I'd gotten so used to the wide screen of the twelve nine.
[55:02.160 --> 55:18.160]  But it was just so much lighter and more portable, even with an art like with with the Logitech create case that it just felt like the no brainer option, especially if I still wanted a Mac laptop around, which I need for for some for some tasks.
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.160]  Whereas the twelve nine, you know, is it's it's on the edge of three pounds.
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.160]  Yeah, I know all of it. It's pretty terrible.
[55:25.160 --> 55:30.160]  It's not it's not the best portable machine for people.
[55:30.160 --> 55:36.160]  So I could see Apple being like, well, we don't want to sell it unless it's good.
[55:36.160 --> 55:39.160]  But especially with Apple sales low lagging.
[55:39.160 --> 55:45.160]  I don't know. There's something about this three three iPad product thing that this doesn't make any sense to me.
[55:45.160 --> 55:53.160]  And I can't help but feel that that there's there's a large chunk of it to be to come that.
[55:53.160 --> 55:57.160]  And then we'll say, oh, OK, now I see it makes sense.
[55:57.160 --> 56:01.160]  Yeah, I'm trying to connect the dots here because I'm sure it exists.
[56:01.160 --> 56:06.160]  I'm sure, as you said, that if if this is a real rumor.
[56:06.160 --> 56:09.160]  I'm sure that there's a way to to connect it all.
[56:09.160 --> 56:14.160]  All of is disagreeing with me.
[56:14.160 --> 56:21.160]  Did you see in terms of like the way that people do are doing work on iPads?
[56:21.160 --> 56:30.160]  There was a great thread on Twitter this week where a friend of the show and I'm known to me more as like an illustrator.
[56:30.160 --> 56:43.160]  Louis Mantia is working on a typeface design and sent it to Jonathan Heffler of Heffler and Company fame on Twitter.
[56:43.160 --> 56:49.160]  And just said, hey, do you have any thoughts? And Jonathan Heffler took it and like mocked up.
[56:49.160 --> 57:00.160]  It's like it was a PDF of the whole alphabet that he had drawn and mark this up with all of these little notes about places where maybe the curves could be different in the radio.
[57:00.160 --> 57:07.160]  It could be different. And letters, you know, like here, take this. You did a great thing here with the lowercase d.
[57:07.160 --> 57:12.160]  But you should do the same thing with the lowercase b. And I'll put links in the show notes.
[57:12.160 --> 57:17.160]  I've got them got them here in the notes already. But I looked at it as a type nerd.
[57:17.160 --> 57:21.160]  It was super fascinating to see this feedback and it all made sense to me.
[57:21.160 --> 57:30.160]  And I was like, wow, that I do I can see how that would be better. But then I instantly thought, like, I want to know how he how he did this marking up.
[57:30.160 --> 57:43.160]  And so I asked and it was it was with an Apple pencil it in an app called Notability, which I have heard of for the iPad.
[57:43.160 --> 57:48.160]  But it's a PDF. You know, you can import PDFs and then you can draw right on top of them.
[57:48.160 --> 57:55.160]  And it seems like it's really it's been around for a while, but it seems like it's really embraced the pencil.
[57:55.160 --> 58:04.160]  And it said to me that with the 12 years was tweet with with the twelve point nine inch iPad and the Apple pencil and Notability,
[58:04.160 --> 58:10.160]  they moved all of their proofing workflow from paper to screens in the last year.
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.160]  And they're saving thirty six thousand pages of printed paper a year.
[58:16.160 --> 58:22.160]  And I found that fascinating, like, and I can totally see and to me what it's just been an idea.
[58:22.160 --> 58:29.160]  I mean, everybody talks about it, but this whole idea of iPads for work and what's the future of work computing.
[58:29.160 --> 58:37.160]  And that to me, it comes down to it largely comes down to form factors and that iPads and iOS have.
[58:37.160 --> 58:48.160]  It's not so much that they're replacing traditional notebooks and Macs, but that they're they're good for work in areas that Macs never were like.
[58:48.160 --> 58:56.160]  I don't think it ever even occurred to Jonathan Heffler to do to to to do their their proofing.
[58:56.160 --> 59:05.160]  On a Mac before I mean, you could you could take if you had a Cintiq tablet or even on an Intuos from Wacom,
[59:05.160 --> 59:11.160]  you could absolutely hook it up to your Mac and write on the typeface or write on the PDF.
[59:11.160 --> 59:18.160]  But it it's just such a it was a clunkier experience and the Cintiq was definitely not a you know, it's not a portable machine.
[59:18.160 --> 59:19.160]  You're still kind of stuck at your desktop.
[59:19.160 --> 59:28.160]  And I think he would have found it even found it unpleasant compared to his existing workflow, just printing thirty six thousand sheets of paper a year, marking them up with an actual red pen.
[59:28.160 --> 59:34.160]  Well, the fun thing about critique, right, is that you actually get a chance to step away from your desk.
[59:34.160 --> 59:52.160]  It's I remember back when we were putting together e-books for Macworld, one of my favorite things was to get our proof and then to make the final edits to go like sit up on our on the terrace at our at our old space and just, you know, grab a can of Coke and my proofs and go through them with an old school red pen.
[59:52.160 --> 01:00:01.160]  And yeah, I could have like I could have done those on an iPad, probably an iPad Air originally, but at the time when we were when we were doing that.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.160]  But it just wasn't as tactile sense, like satisfying.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.160]  You couldn't really write with the styluses that were available at that point.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.160]  And the iPad Air screen just wasn't good enough.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:19.160]  Whereas you take the iPad Pro, you take the the retina display combined with the true tone display.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.160]  So it's actually easier to to work in all spaces.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:28.160]  And then the pencil, which, you know, in the right app feels like writing with pen.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:37.160]  You know, it may not have the tactile sensation on the glass, but you're still getting the right approximation of what you want to draw and how you want to draw it.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.160]  And that's really, really important for doing things like that.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.160]  But it's it is fascinating to me.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160]  You know, I don't know if you saw it.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:59.160]  I was doing this iPad Pros experiment where I essentially put a call out on Twitter and via iMore just being like, hey, I really want to know what what everybody's using their iPad Pro for when it comes to work.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160]  Like, just send me an email.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.160]  Give me the gist of like what you're doing.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.160]  And, you know, if it's cool, I'll shoot you an email and we'll do some interviews.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:16.160]  And the amount of responses that I got in 24 hours really kind of blew me away.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.160]  And it wasn't just like here are the three industries where the iPad Pro is being used.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:37.160]  It was across the board, like all kinds of crazy things like we I had a there's a large number of people in IT who use the iPad for, you know, running around on the go because it's easier to carry with them than like a little Chromebook.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:56.160]  The one of the cooler ones that I found out about is there's someone who's getting their Ph.D. at Harvard in ancient writing who uses the iPad to help recreate and scan and analyze this, you know, ancient, you know, pre-Roman handwriting.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:05.160]  There's Kyle Lambert, of course, who drew the poster for Stranger Things almost entirely on his iPad, the one that, you know, that Netflix used.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:14.160]  And that's like that's the traditional thing you think of is like Hoeffler, you know, doing annotation with the pencil or drawing with the pencil.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:32.160]  But there are so many other industries and weird use cases that I just don't think people really realize are being filled by the iPad in, like you said, in environments where it just either didn't make sense to have a Mac or a computer
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:39.160]  or something where maybe a Mac or a computer was filling this gap, but not as well as it could have been.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:50.160]  I also think and there's obviously some legacy aspects to PDFs and eight and a half by eleven paper or for our friends on the other side of the pond, a four dimension paper.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:03:06.160]  And so there's some legacy aspects to that where if you're in an industry like the law or something like that, where things get published in there, if you don't deal with it on paper, you are dealing it with a PDF that assumes that it's printed on eight and a half by eleven paper
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:21.160]  where the nine point seven inch iPad screen is a little too small. It's readable and you know, but it's it's just shrunk down enough that it's it's there's a reason why that's not the size of the paper we use for sure.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:35.160]  Whereas on the twelve point nine it is. But then there's other areas like it's just nicer artistically to have a bigger canvas, you know, and I think with Hoeffler, you know, like I don't think there was any reason that they had to stick.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:45.160]  You know, I think he went with the twelve point nine, not because it was a legacy process. If they moved their whole workflow from from paper to screens, they could abandon the size.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.160]  I just think that artistically it's just better to look at them bigger and to be able to zoom up and to have a bigger canvas.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:04:12.160]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, it's it's one of those things where if I was doing illustration on a regular basis, I think the twelve point nine would be my daily carry without question, because it really is there's something really wonderful being able to work at that larger screen size, especially when you're sketching.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:28.160]  I don't know if you've ever taken like a life drawing class or anything where you're being asked to make like big giant strokes with your pencil and taking your entire arm into the process, not just like sketching with your wrist, that kind of those kind of big movements.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:40.160]  Traditionally, in an in an illustration class, you really can only get by working on, you know, big canvas paper, because if you work on an eight and a half by eleven, you're just going to strike, you know, strike the thing off of the screen.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:51.160]  But the twelve point nine inch iPad is one of the first where I actually felt like you could do life drawing sketches on it and not feel like you were drawing, you know, essentially on a post it note.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:05:14.160]  I feel like we as there's a part of us, anybody, whether you like Apple stuff or like, you know, or you don't, but where you feel like it's there seems like there's a rational part of your brain that sees owning an iPad and a MacBook or just a tablet and a notebook.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:32.160]  If you have other operating systems as wasteful, that you've got two things that are basically the same size, 10 to 15 inches and the same thing, a computer with an LCD screen in some way to set up a keyboard and maybe touch, et cetera.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:40.160]  And you just feel like, well, there should only be one. And so there's a logical argument to the surface book movement.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:54.160]  Right. But I can't I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I just, you know, I think it really just depends on the type of work that you do and that there are certain tasks.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:22.160]  And it's certainly the ones that computers got good personal computers got good at first in the last few decades that basically involve you sitting down at a table or a desk with your palms flat on a keyboard that's flat with some sort of pointing device, a mouse or a track pad right next to it that you use to deal with the screen that is more or less horizontal in front of you.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.160]  There's a whole bunch of tasks where that form factor is terrific.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.160]  And if that's the type of work you do, like let's just say you get you have a job where you have just lots of emails that you have to answer every day.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:43.160]  So you're typing a lot, not just reading. It's a terrific form factor. And you can see why.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:53.160]  Like with the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros, where the displays have gotten ever thinner than before, so thin that they can't even light up the apple anymore.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:07:06.160]  It's the hinge is so great. It is so much easier to put a Mac set up a MacBook at a desk in front of you like in a coffee shop than to set up an iPad with a keyboard.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:15.160]  And again, what are we talking about? Ten seconds? Is it five, ten seconds to just do the little foldy thing with your keyboard and get it in?
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:22.160]  It's not long, but it adds up, right? It's like the little things. It's just not optimized for it if that's your main point of work.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.160]  And then when you close it, it's even more work, right?
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.160]  Because you have to unfold all of that.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:46.160]  Right. And I'm not denying that for some people that there's tons of people who just love writing on their iPads and that's a trade off they're willing to accept, but I don't see how anybody could deny that an iPad set up in laptop configuration, no matter which brand keyboard you're using, is like it's backwards.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:08:02.160]  It's top heavy. The screen is the heavy part with the battery and the keyboard is the light part, whereas a MacBook is oriented the right way where there's a heavy base and a super light screen.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:11.160]  And I just think more and more, but it's just taking a long time to find it. We're finding these other contexts, whether it's the actual task you want to do, like illustration.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:21.160]  Like if you actually want to, you know, you're drawing something on a screen to mark it up, or if it's just about where you are, that you're not at a desk.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  You know, like you said, like these sysadmins who are walking around and maybe want to be doing stuff on screen while they're standing, where an iPad is better and has nothing to do with iOS.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:42.160]  I think we've all collectively spent too much time worrying about the differences between iOS and macOS, not that they don't matter, but that a large part of it is just the human form factor of where you are.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.160]  Are you standing? Are you sitting? Are you actually typing? That matter more.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:09:08.160]  Absolutely. Well, I think about, just going back to illustration, I think about how many different sketchbooks I had in college, right? And granted, a sketchbook is a little bit cheaper than a full-size computer, but still, you know, I was spending quite a lot of money on six, seven, eight different sizes of paper.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:20.160]  Because, you know, in some cases, a notebook is going to make sense. In other cases, a Post-it's going to make sense. In other cases, you know, a 36-inch canvas is going to make sense.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:27.160]  It's all about finding the right tool and the right product that works for you.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  And in the case of the iPad and everything that goes around it, what's really important is how those things all fit together, right?
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:49.160]  If I'm going to use my iPad, actually, one of the reasons I got my very first iPad back in 2010 was, yes, I wanted to sketch with it, and I was really excited about that.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:10:02.160]  But at the time, I was doing a job in a online t-shirt manufacturing company, and I was indexing what t-shirts we had in stock.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:17.160]  And before the iPad, that meant manually going down all of the aisles of the t-shirts with a tiny little out-of-date Windows laptop on a cart where you'd just be pulling it over this factory floor.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:24.160]  As we went box by box to count how many sizes of smalls, how many sizes of mediums, how many sizes of large.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:36.160]  And once we got the iPad, we could very easily enter that into our online inventory just by carrying the iPad around and selecting, okay, this has three smalls, great.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:45.160]  And we no longer had to use the little cart or the heavy laptop or worry about knocking it over to the ground, which happened, I think, on multiple occasions.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.160]  Those are the things.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:11:07.160]  In broad strokes, the notebook computer, the traditional one that doesn't have a detachable screen that turns into a tablet halfway, tries to do both, is duplicating the form factor of the typewriter and of the adding machine and of other things that people have done at desks for a long, long time, way before their computers.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:17.160]  The iPad, in some ways, like in your story there, is duplicating a clipboard, which, again, is a long-standing form factor for getting work done.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.160]  It's just a different kind of work.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160]  Right.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  But it's largely based on the context of where you are, and it's not so much just purely an argument or even less, really, purely an argument about operating systems.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:39.160]  Yeah, the operating system could be, you know, going back to Steve Jobs' original comment about the iPad, like, it's a blank slate.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.160]  All the operating system really needs to do is get out of the way so that you can do your work.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  Whether or not that operating system lets you run one app at a time or 20 apps at a time, what the real question should be, is this easier to do my work on than the thing I had before?
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.160]  And if the answer is yes, then you get it.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.160]  Then it becomes part of your workflow.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.160]  I mean, obviously, assuming you have the money and all of that, but, like, that's how it fits in.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:18.160]  You know, I carry a 9.7-inch iPad Pro and a MacBook Pro not because, oh, I want to, you know, duplicate the writing functionality on both and, oh, that's going to be so clunky, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:33.160]  I carry it on the iPad Pro because there are times when I want to sketch something out or there are times that I want to write freehand, and the iPad Pro has essentially replaced my old-school, like, big Moleskine sketchbook that I used to carry around with my MacBook Pro.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:41.160]  I guess I could do that as a convertible tablet if I really wanted to, but then we get into battery life talks.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:48.160]  You know, that's honestly my big thing about multiple, you know, convertible devices.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  If I want to sketch, I'm probably going to want to sketch for, like, you know, six, seven hours or have that, you know, have that ability to just kind of pull this iPad out whenever and just sketch on it, whereas my laptop is the big, you know, that's the thing that you carry around and do your powerhouse work on when you're not at your desk.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:26.160]  And if you have a convertible where it's like, oh, well, you turn it into tablet mode and then you kill most of your battery sketching on the train, for instance, and then you actually get to a point where you want to use it to do normal work, then you have five percent battery and you have to plug in, at which point it's a desk computer again.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:37.160]  Did you see the, there's a new Windows 10, I forget what they call these things, the dual systems, what do they call them? The convertible laptops?
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:46.160]  Yeah, so a new one from Porsche Design, which was, it's not out yet, but it was announced at the mobile web conference.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160]  At MWC?
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:14:04.160]  At MWC, which, and it looks nice, it does, I'd like to see one, but even though it looks nice, and I think the hinge looks much nicer than Microsoft's surface hinge, which doesn't, you know, like the, it doesn't.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.160]  The little, it looks like it belongs in an Alien movie or something.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.160]  Yeah, and it means that the two pieces don't sit flat, there's like a gap between them.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.160]  They only, I don't know, that would bother me a little bit.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:28.160]  But with the Porsche Design one, you can see though that both halves of the, when it's in laptop mode, both halves are about the same thickness. The base is about as thick as the display.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:43.160]  So it's a really thick tablet as compared to an iPad. Like to me, that design, and it, you know, it's never going to be the best laptop design and never going to be the best tablet design.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:15:09.160]  But maybe if they're right, and I'm wrong, maybe, you know, optimizing for the middle is a good idea. But I can't help but think though that I would always much rather have an ideal laptop design, or an ideal tablet design that can be put into a laptop that's maybe not as nice when in laptop mode as this, you know, the dual design.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.160]  But at least when I'm using it in one way, it's as good as it can be.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:25.160]  Yeah, I would rather carry two devices and have each device be the best it possibly can be at that specific task than try and carry something that does all of those things.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:32.160]  Like I don't need a Swiss Army knife for my electronics. I need smart, you know, dedicated electronics.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  Right. And there's just some weird context switching that I don't think I would ever get used to there where you're using a lower powered processor when you're in tablet mode.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:51.160]  And like one of the big trade offs with tablet mode is this Porsche design thing is only advertised as getting three hours of battery life when separated.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:59.160]  Oh, yeah. Well, it's the same problem with the Surface Book as well, where it just doesn't have the tablet does not have great battery life at all.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:11.160]  Right. It's just so many trade offs involved. It's so middling product both ways. And yeah, I do see them. I mean, and and part of this.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  Just a friend made the I mean, you know, it's one anecdote, but I, you know, it meshes sort of what I see.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.160]  But that friend was in a coffee shop recently and counted like, you know, a lot of people doing work.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:37.160]  Or seemingly doing work. And it was like nine MacBooks of various ages, like one regular Windows notebook and two like Surface Books.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:44.160]  And no iPads, nobody using an iPad at you know, at all.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.160]  And I guess I can see why some people buy them.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.160]  And I think that like, you know, I know who knows what these people are doing. But if it's a university students or something, it does probably a lot of writing.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.160]  It's like I said, I think if you're doing a lot of writing, it makes sense to be doing it on a MacBook.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.160]  And that, you know, Macs are more popular for that sort of thing.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160]  Mm hmm.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.160]  But I don't know, I can see why Apple isn't going that way.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:18.160]  Yeah, and I don't think Apple would go that way unless they found the perfect way to blend it, right? You know, we didn't get the iPhone before it was ready.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.160]  Just because they wanted to cram, well, unless you count the Motorola Rocker.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:36.160]  You don't really, we didn't get a product that was like, let's turn the iPod and the mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device into one thing and have it be half-assed and not great.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:43.160]  Like if they're going to do it, they're going to do it well. Otherwise, they're just not going to do it. It's going to sit in some development lab somewhere and never exist.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:48.160]  Right. But it just doesn't make sense to me for either device, you know, not that it doesn't make sense.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:58.160]  I see why they came to that middling just, you know, well, we've got a little bit of battery in this top part that you can take off, but most of the batteries in the base and stuff like that.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:05.160]  It makes more sense to me to do it the iPad way where the iPad is the computer and the keyboard is just a dumb keyboard.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:13.160]  The keyboard is easy and low power and just works when it needs to work and doesn't work when it doesn't.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:22.160]  I feel like there's some kind of win that Apple and or a third party, but probably Apple, because I think it would require something even better, a better smart connector on the iPad.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  But I feel like there's there's got to be some way to make the hinge better, you know, and just make the make the take it from here it is closed coming out of my backpack to set up in front of me on this table as a laptop.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.160]  It's got to be a way to make that better, I think.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:47.160]  Yeah, the the Logitech create is pretty good, except for the part where it's only one position.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:58.160]  And if it was like if the Logitech create, they could find a way to build a smart connector that hinged and didn't immediately disconnect when you moved a lot moved it like a little bit backwards or a little bit forwards.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:04.160]  Like they found a way to make a Logitech create that had a hinged backing, but still connected via the smart connector.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.160]  That would be the that would be the ultimate convertible if you really wanted a convertible tablet.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:18.160]  If you didn't need a laptop to do hardcore writing or or multitasking on and you just wanted to switch to iPad, like that's what you'd want.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:31.160]  Because that to me is a perfect example of one of the ways that I that's why I for me for me, obviously, I mean, I'm you know, when I'm other than the podcast, my work is writing.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:47.160]  And so for me, I'd for what I do is work and, you know, ignoring email. But if I decide not not to ignore my email, I'm writing there to the laptop form factor is so much more conducive to my you know, it's so much nicer for me for my work.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.160]  I'm not denying that it's the other way around for other people, but it is.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:59.160]  But one of those things that's so nice, especially if I'm away, not at my regular desk where everything is already set up, just so is that I can adjust the screen infinitely.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:13.160]  Right. And so if there's a weird light that's giving me a glare or whatever, or I'm sitting with a different posture, or it's a weird height table or chair, you could just sit there and twist it, you know, and get it perfect.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.160]  And with iPad solutions, you can't.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:23.160]  No, not unless you want to keep it flat on the table and work on the virtual keyboard, which sounds terrible.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.160]  Well, and again, no, there's no configuration or flatten the table is flatten the table.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:37.160]  Yeah, well, I mean, you do flatten a table and then you have an adjustable stand like I'm using an adjustable stand right now from elevation lab, I think that a like a drafting stand that adjusts multiple levels.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:45.160]  Right. But that's still not a great configuration because then you have to fiddle and it's it's not as easy as the laptop just like bam open done.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160]  Right. Ready to ready to write.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.160]  So anyway, that's my rant on form factors.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our third sponsor.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.160]  It's our good friends. What a great company.

[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:58.160]  But there was a story this week in the Wall Street Journal that came out that got a lot of publicity where it wasn't 100 percent clearly written.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:07.160]  But it the way it was written could best be interpreted that the iPhone, this year's iPhone,
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:17.160]  the fancy rumored new iPhone with the curved OLED screen was going to switch from the lightning adapter to a USB-C port.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:29.160]  Not another cable switch. Oh, no. They said Apple. This is from the story by Takashi Mochizuki for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:42.160]  This is their their sources familiar with their plans. They said Apple would introduce other updates, including a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company's original lightning connector.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:52.160]  These models would also do away with the physical home button, they said. These updates would give the iPhone features already available on other smartphones.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.160]  I would just say with that last sentence that no other smartphone has a lightning connector.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.160]  So if they kept the lightning connector, they'd have a feature that's not available on other smartphones.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:18.160]  This seems weird. That seemed weird to me. And my guess and again, nobody told me a damn thing. I don't have any little birdies, but my guess is if there's some kind of supply chain thing that this reporter got, it's that they're going to switch to it.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  I think the iPad Pro works like this already. It's a USB-C power brick and you plug USB-C into the power brick and then it goes to lightning on the other end for plugging into the device.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.160]  Yep. And you get what, 29 watts and supercharged.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.160]  Right now, I don't know if the iPhone is going to ship with the 29 watt charger.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]  Probably not.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:48.160]  Probably not, but it could ship with a higher wattage charger that charges more quickly.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:59.160]  And does USB 3 data speeds if you need that, although I kind of feel like data speeds over anything other than the network are sort of old.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:12.160]  But, you know, there's some professional contexts like for video or film or, you know, and photography and stuff like that where you might want to, you know, that extra speed could be useful in an iPhone. I don't know.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.160]  But the charging speed is the big one. If you can charge faster, that's better.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:33.160]  Charging faster is better. The other reason why it would be good for, you know, for photographers, especially now that Apple has allowed you to use the USB connector with the iPhone with photos.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:51.160]  You can offload your raw images direct to your, you know, 128 gig iPhone rather than having to carry around an iPad Pro if you want to do some just quick, you know, quick proofing or if you want to post something to social media very quickly while you're in the midst of something.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160]  Like a live Apple event or something like that.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:08.160]  Yeah, but I it just did not ring true to me because I do not think Apple as I just don't think they're ever going to ship iOS devices with USB ports. I know they could.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:24.160]  I know there's some people who are sort of hoping that they do because it would it would simplify the universe in some ways, like where everybody's phone everybody's phone bought within the last X months or years can now use the same chargers.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:35.160]  But I don't think it makes sense from Apple's perspective and there are plenty of like the sort of people who are wishing for that are enlarged.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:43.160]  I think largely sort of the nerdy type people who have, you know, Android and iOS devices around the house.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:27:00.160]  And I think there's untold tens of millions of people who just already have an iPhone and other people who they live in the house have iPhones and when they buy a new iPhone, it would be nice if they could just keep using the same lightning ports that are already around the house.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  Yeah, I don't want to have to switch my port.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.160]  Right, and from those people's perspectives, the switch from 30 pin to lightning just happened.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  Yes, exactly.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160]  Despite it being what, four years ago?
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.160]  It was months, it was just a few weeks ago.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:18.160]  It's still so fresh, I still have 30 pin connectors in my home.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  Right, and I don't think Apple, I think I don't think Apple was at least bit surprised by the people who were upset by that change.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:37.160]  But I also, I also and I don't think it gave them any pause, but I do think they're fully aware of, you know, it would be worse to do it again.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  Yes, the nonsense, the nonsense could potentially be terrible.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:28:06.160]  Yeah, when you, you said that you wanted to talk about this, this definitely gave me and Renee pause when we first saw it as well, because it's, you know, we've seen stuff going on in the UK and in Europe where, you know, Apple has to ship adapters in the box to make sure that everything's standardized with, with the EU Commission on charging devices and making it easy for everybody.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:19.160]  But by and large, it just, I don't, it doesn't make sense to me to swap out the Lightning port when the Lightning port still does proprietary things that Apple wants it to.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:34.160]  You know, they swap out from Lightning to USB-C, I guess you could still do made for iPhone USB-C devices, but I don't know how that licensing would work if they're on top of that also licensing USB-C for a port.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:47.160]  I don't know if that increases their, you know, their component costs in terms of using a developed port like that, or whether they're just paying a flat fee to use USB in general from the consortium.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.160]  I'm not really sure the behind the scenes aspect in that.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:59.160]  What I do know is we're eventually going to have to have USB-C on one end, because that is where the computers are going.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:16.160]  And from that aspect, the rumor that USB-C will be involved in a capacity, like you said, as a charging capacity on the other end of that cord, that makes sense to me as like encouraged consumers to hurry it up with the switching.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:35.160]  Yeah, there's other things that Apple can do with Lightning that people, I mean, and again, let's just get it out of the way, there is a very selfish, they get the made for iPhone licensing thing makes the company money and gives them control and limits what other companies can do with iPhone peripherals.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  And that's just in Apple's own selfish interest to maintain that.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:54.160]  The angle that's good for iPhone users is really just, it's that mass market, look, you've already got these cords all over your house, and you can just keep using them for years to come.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:04.160]  But there's little things too, like the fact that because Lightning is completely Apple's proprietary thing, they can change it in software.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:17.160]  And a big part of Lightning's design is that it's changeable in software. So for example, that's why the Lightning headphones that they started shipping last year required you to update to iOS 10.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:27.160]  Like if you plug them into an iOS 9 device, you got an error message that said you have to update this device to iOS 10 to use this peripheral, because it was a software change that enabled them to work.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:38.160]  And they can't do that if they switch to an industry proprietary. I mean, maybe there's a way to do proprietary stuff over the standard, but I don't think it's as easy.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:48.160]  So I think that the change, and it surprised me which people piped up on Twitter, and you seem to think that this was reasonable.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:31:03.160]  And again, it's not the most ridiculous thing in the world. If it turns out that this is true, if I'm wrong, and there were Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI, the famed super well-sourced analyst over there,
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:12.160]  came out with a report like a day or two after the Wall Street Journal report, not calling him out by name, but coming about as close as he could because the entire report was more or less,
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:21.160]  because these new phones are still going to have lightning. But they might have USB-C on the power brick side. And he even talked about fast charging and stuff like that.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:33.160]  So if he's wrong, if I'm wrong, and they really do ship a new iPhone in September and it has USB-C, I wouldn't find it shocking. I would just find it mildly surprising.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:44.160]  To play devil's advocate here, let's say that Apple decides to go the USB-C route because it makes more sense to them from a consortium perspective.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:56.160]  Maybe they're getting pressured in the EU. Maybe it just makes more sense as they continue to expand globally to just have one universal port and not have to worry about adapters or dongles or anything like that.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:07.160]  I could see them switching and just being like, hey, guys, this is the new normal. You know, our MacBook Pros have USB-C now. Now your iPhones have USB-C.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:22.160]  Soon the new iMacs are going to have USB-C. And this is our new standard charging port. However, I just don't think it's good business sense for the company because of all the reasons that we've mentioned before.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:38.160]  It makes more sense for them to have control. And also, if you look at the rest of their peripherals, including the Lightning-based headphones that if they change the Lightning port, it'll only be there for a year.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:56.160]  They just released brand new, you know, the AirPods and the Beats X, you know, have Lightning connectors and then the older Beats headphones, you know, the Solo and the PowerBeats both still charge via mini USB or micro USB.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:16.160]  So, it's one of those things where if USB-C standardization was coming down the pipeline as this is going to be our charging port now and forever, you know, so help us God, you'd think that they would start it with the AirPods and the Beats X and all of their accessories that start to have these things.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:27.160]  The fact that all the Apple Pencils would essentially be made useless down the line because they use Lightning as well. And could you charge an Apple Pencil via USB-C? That's a good question.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:47.160]  You know, they're, they're, it's, it's a, I, yeah, the rumor makes my head hurt, honestly. Yeah, I think that the, the analogy to the headphone port is, is exactly right.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:34:03.160]  Except that you should ignore the fact that for now they're shipping the iPhones without a headphone port with Lightning headphones. The Lightning headphones are a stopgap and the real transition is to wireless.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:15.160]  And it's just the fact that they're at this point, it costs, you know, 150 bucks or so for them to sell the wireless ones that meet their, you know, that are as good as they think the experience should be.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:26.160]  I think we just have to wait a few years for the price of those to come down. But that in hindsight, five, six, seven years ago, we look back and we don't really remember the Lightning headphones error so much.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:36.160]  We, we they, in our memories, it'll be, we used to plug in headphones via the hundred year old headphone jack and now we use wireless headphones.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:55.160]  Yeah, no one's going to really think about it. And I think that's exactly what's going to happen with charging is that Lightning is the charging port for all of these devices, except for Max, until some sort of no port charging is the standard.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:08.160]  By which I mean, I have this whole rant that I've been meaning to go on about calling conductive or inductive charging, whatever it is, but when you have to still be in physical contact calling that wireless charging, because that's not, that's not wireless.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:16.160]  No, it's just, it's, well, I mean, it's, it's wireless from the phone to the pad, but the pad is still wired.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:25.160]  Apple is actually pretty careful about it. Like Apple does not describe the Apple watch as having wireless charging because it doesn't, it's inductive charging. Right.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:44.160]  So I don't know where we're going with that. I don't know if like the next step is going to be inductive charging for these devices or if it'll be a true wireless thing where it doesn't actually have to be in physical contact and you can just have it in general proximity and it'll magically shoot power over the air and not make us full of cancer.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:48.160]  Yeah. I think that's the big problem there right now.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  Well, you know, I mean, wifi hasn't killed us yet, so.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.160]  It's true.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.160]  I'm optimistic. It just sounds weird though.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.160]  20 years and counting.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:07.160]  Right. It's like when we first started using wifi, it really weirded me out. It's like, this seems like it should be impossible. This, I mean, and then you just think like these razor, these waves are shooting through me right now.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  My body is full of gigabytes.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.160]  And let's not even talk about cell phones, all of these memes inside me.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:23.160]  Right. But, you know, until we can do that, until they can get, they're, Apple wants to get rid of ports, not replace ports with one from another.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]  Agreed.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:34.160]  And they don't give two craps about proprietary over, or they give a crap, but they're, you know, they see proprietary as a strength, not as a weakness.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160]  Correct.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:42.160]  And I do think it's super telling that the AirPods have a lightning adapter.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:49.160]  They could, they could have had USB-C. They absolutely could have shipped with a USB-C charging brick and they chose not to.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.160]  Right. And it would have been a big tell, I think.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:37:02.160]  I still think it's weird. It is. It's funny. I understand why the pencil works the way that it does.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:16.160]  And in terms of having a male lightning, instead of a female lightning, so that it, it's less convenient if you just want to plug your pencil into something you already have laying around your house.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  But it's more importantly, it's, whenever you want to use a pencil, you must have an iPad Pro nearby to use it on.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:30.160]  And if the pencil is out, you can just plug it into the iPad for 30 seconds and get a usable charge out of it.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:41.160]  It's not elegant. It looks silly. It's not elegant, but it's a very, it's practicality winning out over elegance.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:57.160]  Whereas the AirPods in comparison are one of the most, it's, it's just, I can't stop raving about how I love every single aspect of it, including the fact that to charge it, you can just plug it into any iPhone charger you have laying around for a couple of minutes once a week or so.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  Exactly. You don't have to worry about it. And if your buds ever go dark, you just pop them in the case and it's, it's very seamless.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:10.160]  Honestly, can I tell you my biggest wish for the rumored iPads?
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160]  Yes.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:22.160]  I want, I want wireless charging, real wireless charging, area charging for the pencil built into this mythical 10.5 inch iPad, right?
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.160]  Where if you're in Bluetooth proximity, you're going to charge it.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  Which I just think would be amazing because then that way the pencil never dies.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.160]  It just, it charges it whenever, you know, it's nearby.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  And if you have to make contact, then maybe they figure out some way to like induct a charge through the, through the display, right?
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.160]  Where whenever you're drawing on it, it's actually sending a tiny charge through the tip into the pencil.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:58.160]  I don't, I know nothing about engineering, so all this may sound like crazy talk and it probably is, but that is my dream scenario.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.160]  Is it possible for them to announce that right now in March 2017? I don't know either. I don't know.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.160]  I have no idea.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:13.160]  But if it is, boy, that would be a huge selling point. And I can't, I would imagine that that's the sort of thing that would get people who bought a pencil a year ago to buy a new one.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.160]  Oh yeah. In a heartbeat and a new iPad because you need the new iPad.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:26.160]  Because it gets rid of the awkward lightning. It gets rid of that. Right? So let's presume, and then I think they could get rid of the cap.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.160]  Yeah. And then you could, you could add a eraser if you really wanted.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.160]  The cap is a huge, you know, if people complain about the cap because the cap is easily lost.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:43.160]  So you get rid of the cap. It's entirely self-contained. So then it's, it's, that's super Apple-like, right? No input, no output.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  And it really is. I was just talking with a friend the other day about how like his biggest gripe with the, well, I'll tell you who it is. Ben Thompson.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.160]  This mysterious source.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.160]  But he loves the pencil, but he doesn't use it all the time.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:07.160]  But if it's in range of your iPad, when your iPad's on there, they communicate with each other so that it's ready for you to use.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.160]  But it's always in range of his iPad when his iPad is on because he's taking it out of the same bag.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.160]  Right. He's got a bag. He's got a bag that he keeps his pencil and his iPad in.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:23.160]  And so even when he's not using the pencil and just reading on the iPad, it's slowly draining the pencil because it has a communication.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.160]  And then when he does go to use the pencil, it's always dead.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:39.160]  Yeah, exactly. The pencil is always at five percent because the pencil doesn't quite understand the difference between I'm sitting in your bag ready to be used and I'm being drawn with actively and need battery life.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:46.160]  Right. And the reason that this is mildly annoying is instead of like infuriating is because it doesn't take that long to give the pencil a usable charge.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:49.160]  But still, it happens every time. And if your idea
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.160]  It's still annoying.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.160]  Your idea would solve this problem.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.160]  Yeah. Well, it's a step further from what they already do with the smart connector, right?
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:08.160]  Where the smart connector, to me, feels like this in-betweener stage because it has solved the need for Bluetooth keyboards, at least the Bluetooth keyboards, the keyboards that use the smart connector.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.160]  It solved that need for those keyboards to constantly be charged separately.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160]  Right.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.160]  It's just, do I want to use a keyboard with my iPad today? Cool. I'm just going to set it up.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.160]  And because of the way that the smart connector connects, like, hooks into the keyboard, it's good.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:30.160]  And if they figured out a way to wirelessly charge devices, then we could have variable stand keyboards too.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.160]  Right.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.160]  Which would also be really cool.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.160]  That would be cool.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:44.160]  And it's definitely I think it's a definite situation, circling back to what I said before, where there's an awful lot of people who only use their iPad with a keyboard sometimes.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:53.160]  Because the whole point of why they're using an iPad is they're often using the iPad in these contexts where you either don't want a keyboard or don't need a keyboard.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:56.160]  It's just not that important that you have a hardware keyboard.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.160]  And you do that, do that, do that, do that.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:04.160]  And the thing that's great about the smart connector is then when you do need a keyboard, you don't have to worry if it's charged.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:10.160]  Yep. Exactly. You just throw it on, use it, and then put it away. And then you can forget about it for another three months.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.160]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea. I hope you're right.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.160]  I hope I'm right too.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.160]  You want to talk about Uber quickly?
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160]  Yeah. Let's talk about Uber.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.160]  Boy, I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to confess something. I'm going to be honest.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:36.160]  It's straightforward. Because I feel guilty otherwise. And I feel guilty about what I'm about to say.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.160]  I'm going to confess. I have not deleted the Uber app from my phone.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.160]  I also have not deleted the Uber app from my phone, despite the fact that I think the company is despicable.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.160]  Right.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.160]  I haven't used it since then.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.160]  I have.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.160]  But I also haven't deleted it.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.160]  I have used Uber.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:59.160]  Because they're the only one that can get a black car in Philadelphia. And the black cars have SUVs.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:08.160]  And sometimes I went out to dinner with some friends, and we needed to fit five adults in a car.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:17.160]  So I still use it. And I justify it in my head as, well, I know they're losing money on every ride they give.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.160]  I'm robbing some poor defenseless VC.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.160]  Right.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:29.160]  But I feel terrible about it. And I don't know. At some point, it's, you know, I don't know.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:35.160]  What I want is I want Lyft to connect to these black car drivers. And the black car drivers, I think, would jump at it.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:43.160]  Yeah. I mean, I don't think at this point anybody is like, yes, I love working for Uber. I am proud to work.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.160]  Maybe Travis wants his face.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.160]  Well, the drivers aren't.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:56.160]  Yeah. No. But that's what I'm saying. I'm like, I think the drivers are, you know, looking for other options if they can.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.160]  They still want to, you know, they want to drive in the car sharing economy because it's a good way right now to make money.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:14.160]  At least until the bottom falls out. But I don't think any of them is like, yes, I feel so loyal to Uber and Uber has stood right by me because Uber has not really stood right by anybody.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.160]  They've kind of been huge dicks.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:26.160]  There's got to be a way. And I know that. And I understand that my argument that I know that they're losing money on every ride, that that's actually their plan.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.160]  And it's, you know, that the basic idea, it's not really a secret, is that they want to monopolize the market.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:39.160]  And then once they have the monopoly in the market, they can raise the rates to where it's profitable.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:47.160]  I'm not quite sure how they ever get there, because at the point where they raise the rates, I don't see how new competitors don't pop up.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:54.160]  Like, I don't see how they have a real path to to a monopoly.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:59.160]  Because then their whole argument is, is they're destroying the existing regulations.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:06.160]  It's not like they're going to get new regulations put in place that that say that in the city of Philadelphia, Uber is the only ride sharing app available.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:14.160]  Yeah, they're not going to benefit Uber, they're going to benefit all ride sharing companies, of which, you know, 17 might pop up.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.160]  I can see them getting to monopoly status by taking down the cabs.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:26.160]  If the cabs don't form up and create their own rival company, which some have already done, I can see them getting to that point.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:36.160]  But like you said, at the issue where they start having to raise rates, then it becomes, okay, well, who has the cheapest service?
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:38.160]  It's a race to the bottom a little bit.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:47.160]  And it honestly depends on whether or not VCs are willing to take that risk and be like, yeah, I'm going to fund this company because Uber needs to be taken down.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:51.160]  It's gotten too big, too big, you know, too, too violent.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:46:02.160]  Or does it turn into the thing where the VCs are kind of like, well, we're just not going to fund new transportation startups because no one's figured out how to make them profitable without price gouging consumers?
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:20.160]  Right. And I want to, you know, there's so many, Uber is sort of like Silicon Valley's version of the Trump administration, where there's like, there's a new scandal every day, or even by the hour, you know, it's like, you really like a daily list of the scandals doesn't keep up with the fact, you know what I mean?
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:35.160]  Like, if you only paid attention once a day, it's like, like, we're recording this on Friday, March 3, like on Thursday, March 2, if you only paid attention at noon, the news was President Trump says Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not need to recuse himself.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.160]  But by six o'clock in the night, he recused himself.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.160]  It's like, you have to check every three hours to see what's going on.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:53.160]  And it's the same with Uber. But like, like there was a thing this week where an Uber driver had taped. Yeah, he recognized that he had Travis Kalanick as his passenger in a car, and he videotaped it.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.160]  And Kalanick had said some somewhat embarrassing things to the driver.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.160]  Somewhat. Yeah.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.160]  But I didn't, I didn't think it was outrageous.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:10.160]  You know what I mean? And I'm just, I'm vaguely uncomfortable with the idea that he taped them in the first place.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:17.160]  And I don't think what he said was all that outrageous. It was a little rude, but it, I thought the driver was sort of nutty too.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:25.160]  Yeah, the problem is that there's already the narrative, right? There's already the narrative that he's a jerk and a horrible person.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:28.160]  So you get him caught on tape doing anything jerkish.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.160]  Yeah.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.160]  And it, and it blows up even further.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  Right. Exactly. I think that's serenity. I think that's exactly what happened where it's like everybody knows that this Travis Kalanick is, is at least a bit of a jerk and that he's been, him and his company have been caught doing really jerky, exceptionally jerky things lately.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:50.160]  And you hear, and he's secretly taped saying something. And what he said is at least somewhere on the jerky spectrum.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:57.160]  And then you just jump to the worst conclusion. Whereas I think if I actually watched the video and I was like, this isn't that big.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:07.160]  Yeah, it's not, it's not that big. And speaking, speaking of how it just seems like a new Uber story pops up every day, literally while we're recording this.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.160]  The Verge.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  Dateline 30 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:26.160]  The New York Times via, The Verge via the New York Times reports that Uber has a secret worldwide program called Grayball to hide from government employees looking to catch Uber cars operating in violation of local regulations.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  Because, yeah, I don't even know what to say about this because it's just, it's literally as we're saying, hey, Uber just keeps on getting caught doing really horrible stuff.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:49:02.160]  Now there's another, I don't know. Yeah, like this is, this sounds like something that a mildly shady company would go for. Be like, yeah, let's run some software to make sure you don't pick up passengers who might be government employees because we're breaking labor practices in certain cities.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.160]  There's a, there's a whole lot to unpack there.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  So it looks like what they did is when they were in, in municipalities where Uber was deemed to be contrary to the local regulations, Uber would appoint somebody to figure out where the regulators offices were and then look for anybody opening the Uber app on a frequent basis from those locations.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.160]  And then I guess not, not pick them up.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:40.160]  Show fake cars. They'd also check the credit card information to see if the card was tied to a police credit union.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:41.160]  Wow.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:50:02.160]  But unknown to Mr. England and other authorities, I think this was the guy from Portland, some of the digital cars they saw in the app did not represent actual vehicles and the Uber drivers they were able to hail also quickly canceled. That was because Uber had tagged Mr. England and his colleagues, essentially gray balling them as city officials based on data collected from the app and in other ways.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:04.160]  So yeah, not a good company.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.160]  No, not a, not having a great week as far as PR goes.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:24.160]  But the thing that I wanted to bring up was that, uh, among this, you know, avalanche of these things, some of the, the one story that to me is the sun to the planets of, of these, these other scandals or a series of planets.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:38.160]  But the one at the center of it is Susan Fowler, Rigetti's story of her year long employment, which to me is, is different because I I've reread her entire piece, like at least three times.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:52.160]  It's extraordinarily well written and I'm guessing that you've noticed the ways that it's well written because it's well written on like three different levels where, where she makes her case extremely well.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  She obviously had her wits about her for the entire year that she worked right from the beginning when at first she first started to be harassed, but she, she documented it and she kept emails and screenshots of chats.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  Uh, and it's so clear from her writing that she could back it all up.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:30.160]  Um, but also the tone that she took in the article is it, it, it, it's not necessary is not the right word, but it, it was taken from a way that, that she couldn't be easily dismissed.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:40.160]  And, and it's the sort of tonal tap dancing that a woman has to take that a man doesn't even have to think about.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:52:04.160]  Yeah, it was written, you're absolutely right in terms of the, I'm trying to think of the right word here. It was written in a very level platform where she's basically like, here are all these accusations that I'm laying out, but I'm not laying them out in a way that makes me sound especially angry or especially vindictive towards the company.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:25.160]  Right. She was, she basically laid it out almost factually, almost like a lawyer would lay out here, here are the things that happened to me on this date, this happened on this date, this happened, um, but not written so drolly that, you know, you can't read between the lines and actually get a good picture of what's happening.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  Uh, the, the, the specific nature of the harassment that she experienced is very specific to being a woman in a largely male company where male on female harassment is clearly tolerated at an institutional level.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:53:01.160]  And it's, so as you can't just say if the tables returned and it was reversed because there's no such equivalent, there is no, there's no company in the world that's like the Uber for women where men at a 50 to one ratio as engineers get harassed.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:17.160]  But if a man had suffered the moral equivalent of, of this wrongdoing at, you know, in some other than sexual harassment or some other way, just, but just something that everybody would agree was equally wrong on the moral spectrum.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:42.160]  A man would document it in a way where I don't think he would have to even think about hiding his anger at what had gone on and what was tolerated, whereas she did not hide, but, but like tap dance between coming across as angry and not crossing the line into acting like it's a joke or it's not serious.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  Yeah, she had to pitch it very much, as you said, between the lines because of retribution. I mean, we've all been following the stories and the fact that Uber has gone, you know, potentially sent lawyers after her this week.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:03.160]  And I don't know, you know, the fact how factual that is or where the, where that stands right now beyond her claims.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:15.160]  But the mere fact that like, she had to write this in such a way because she was worried about retribution from a company that arguably she has a pretty darn good lawsuit against to begin with.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:41.160]  Whereas, as you said, a man could very easily just write the angriest of angry medium rats and just be, you know, like, this has happened to me and how dare this company and this is a disgusting, you know, violation of human rights and, and my rights as a human, like my rights and personally and, you know, I can't even write in that tone because it just makes me want to vomit.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:53.160]  But it's, yeah, and also, honestly, in comparison, I believe you, you linked to a Medium article by one other woman who wrote about her Uber experiences.
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:55:16.160]  And hers were also very chilling and very bothersome, but she wrote it in a much, in a much vaguer, more not quite salacious style, but it was definitely written as more of a story and more of a, you know, here's, here's a peek into my life, whereas Susan Fowler's was very much, you know, removed, emotionally removed.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:19.160]  It was written very analytically.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:36.160]  And it, you know, there's, the truth is that an angry woman is going to be dismissed by X percent of people who read her, mostly men, but also some women, you know, it's, there's a woman who's angry in public is, is gets a very different reaction.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:50.160]  And very different adjectives are used to describe her emotional state than a man with the equivalent amount of anger. And I'm, you know, I, I feel certain about that statement.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:56:10.160]  I also feel like even though I'm certain of it and I'm incredibly sympathetic to it, I don't even feel, I feel like part of the reason that that's the case is that, you know, I'm not in a position to even judge it. Right? Like it's, like I can judge what, what they did to Susan Fowler.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:20.160]  But I'm not, I feel like as a man, especially, you know, with every privilege you could possibly, possibly have in this country.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:38.160]  I'm not in a, I'm not in a position to judge just how, how, how, how widespread that unfairness is in terms of how we see deal with things like angry, people who are rightfully angry in a professional context.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.160]  But she obviously is very well, very familiar with it.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:57:00.160]  Well, you know, you know, the verbal gymnastics that you need to thread, especially working in a company like that, you know, she had a year of experience having to dance through clearly the insanity of the HR process and her higher ups.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:18.160]  Coming out of that, you know, you're going to know, like the second that you write a piece like that, unfortunately, the second that a woman writes a piece like that, the first thing that a certain subsection of the internet is going to do is try and find ways of proving that she's crazy or she was arrested or she's...
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:23.160]  That some small aspect of it isn't true and therefore the whole thing is in question.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.160]  The whole thing is null and void. Exactly.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.160]  Oh, she cheated on a test when she was in the seventh grade. So she's untrustworthy, you know.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:40.160]  Or she claims this one thing happened on, you know, the first Monday of July 2015. But guess what? That was a federal holiday. That was Independence Day. Uber was closed.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:44.160]  Yeah, exactly. It actually happened July 3rd.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:57.160]  But she lied. Therefore, the entire thing is called into question. Yeah, it's, unfortunately, there is a certain subsection of the population that delights in trying to poke holes in stories like these.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:09.160]  And I don't think that, you know, we should take everything at face value. Obviously, there is value to be had in fact checking and not believing stories, you know, without doing some digging.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:20.160]  But there's a difference between independent verification and, you know, and just going after somebody because they're saying something that you don't want to be true.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:25.160]  So you immediately jump into attacking the first possible opportunity.
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:40.160]  It would occur to me, too, and I just can't say it enough, and it sounds trite, but just how courageous it was for her to publish this because she didn't have a name under her name, which it gives it.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:47.160]  You know, I'm not saying it's necessarily like the other article that I linked to that you mentioned that was published under a pseudonym and she admitted it up front.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:51.160]  She said, I'm not comfortable sharing my name. This is a pseudonym. So there's no misdirection there.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:59:07.160]  But, you know, and again, I'm not saying that that wasn't useful and courageous in and of itself, but doing it under her own name is more courageous and it leaves more credence to it because she clearly knew to expect a backlash.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:24.160]  And I think it's obvious that you read the story and the part that to me where you just the part of her story where you just go, whoa, was the part where many months into her employment at Uber.
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:30.160]  I mean, and the other reason why I should say this is that she now works at Stripe. She hasn't she's already landed another job.
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.160]  She doesn't have to you know, she's not like she has to worry about her employability.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:38.160]  She's got a great job at a great company. So it'd be easy to just say, you know what, now I have a great job at a great company.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:47.160]  Thank God that's over and let it go. But by coming public and, you know, it's obviously the most well-known she's ever been.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:57.160]  You know, she's a published author at O'Reilly. But so I'm not saying that it's not like she hasn't had a, you know, stuff in the public eye before.
[01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:20.160]  It's a different kind of notoriety. Right. The whole the part of the story where you really just go, I just went, whoa, was the part where she and some other women engineers at Uber months later talking amongst themselves, realized they all had problems with the same guy, a manager above them.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:41.160]  And several of them had reported their incidents to Uber's HR department. And all of them were told the same thing that, well, this is we, you know, thank you for reporting it, but we're uncomfortable taking any action against him at this time because it's his first offense and he's a high performer.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:58.160]  Yeah. And it's like, whoa. So they just say that and you realize, well, how did they think that they were going to get away with it? How would they, you know, how did they think that eventually some of these women would figure this out in a company?
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:13.160]  Because no one wants to talk about this stuff. It's all based on the assumption that even if they do, they'll get the message that, you know, let, you know, this stuff is okay for high performers. And yeah, let sleeping dogs lie.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:33.160]  What are they going to do? Go public? That they seem like at a certain, whether it was, you know, stated or just unconscious between the HR people who made the decision to deal with it this way. HR clearly assumed at Uber, clearly assumed that these women would, none of these women would go public.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:48.160]  Yeah. Well, because it's, it's too much of a risk. It's a, you know, again, we go back to the, it's the credibility issue. You may never land a job again if you're, if you don't have your facts and your story and things to back things up, you know, to back your evidence up.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:02:03.160]  Like there's Susan Fowler Getty by going public under her own name and with as much scathing detail as she did, was willing to do something that a company valued at $70 billion was willing to bet she wouldn't.
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:18.160]  Which is amazing. Yeah. And you talk about courageous, you know, people have been saying under the radar, don't go work for Uber, don't go work for Uber, don't go work for Uber, especially if you're a woman, but just in general, it's just not a good culture.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  But there really hasn't been somebody standing up on a chair and yelling, no, don't go work for Uber because you will be sorry until Fowler. Like there's just, there wasn't that kind of like damning public, like I won't even invent like skatery, new word.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:51.160]  Because that's, but no, it's such a scathing critique of not only the HR department, I don't know how the people who work in that HR department have spines or stomachs at that point.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:03:02.160]  Like I wonder how many people have quit in that department specifically over the years. And also I forget from the story, but I wonder the gender of the HR department liaisons too.
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:26.160]  I think she said that some of them were women. Yeah. Which just, that's an even bigger punch. I don't even know. Yeah. That strikes me just as such a betrayal to have to say to somebody's face, sorry, we're not going to do anything about your, you know, your emotional or physical harassment, despite the fact that it could happen to anybody.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  You know, we're just, we're just going to look in your face and say, no, it, yeah, that's the kind of thing that makes me want to never use their service again.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:45.160]  And it's just like, I commend everybody who's deleted the app and burned it. And it's, yeah.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.160]  All right. I got to delete the app.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:51.160]  Yeah, you got to, it's gone.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:04:04.160]  I will say it just in terms of people who've been outspoken critics, I've long followed. I'm sure, I don't know if you know her, but I'm sure you're aware of her. Sarah Lacey, founder of pando.com.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:12.160]  And she has been on the, Uber is actually a terrible company beat for years now.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:25.160]  And so the difference I would say is that she's always been from the, she's been a journalist her whole career. She's been writing about it from the outside as a journalist, observing the company, not as an insider.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  That's the difference between her and Fowler.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  Yeah. She can only get, you know, anonymous quotes and, you know, hopefully people wanting to go on the record, but it's not going to, it's ultimately all the scoops in the world are not going to help you in contrast with someone just coming straight out and telling their story.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.160]  So anyway, I feel like we had to talk about it. Glad we did.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.160]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.160]  Anything else you want to mention before we wrap up?
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.160]  Gosh, I think we, we kind of ran the gamut.
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:05:00.160]  I know we caught up. I feel like I kind of caught up to the news, although who knows God almighty, there's probably like another Uber scam.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.160]  In the next, the last 30 minutes.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:11.160]  In the 24 hours, it usually takes for shows to get published. We'll never make it. There's going to be something, something will break.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:19.160]  Undoubtedly. This news cycle. That's, that's what I'd like to talk about. I'd like to talk about a pause button. Could someone make me a homekit pause button for the news cycle?
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.160]  Please. No news.
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:29.160]  Everybody can read Serenity's fine work at iMore.com.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:33.160]  And on Twitter, your Twitter name is, I forget. What's your Twitter name?

[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.160]  Yes.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:43.160]  That's a fine follow on Twitter. Anything else you want to mention or pitch?
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:51.160]  Oh, gosh. Other than the, we're doing a lot of work on, on iPad pros, specifically people who are doing real world iPad examples.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:06:04.160]  So if you have, if you're using your iPad for work, especially if it's something outside the norm that you think is pretty awesome, please hit me up on Twitter or on email at Serenity at iMore, because I'd love to hear your story.
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:06.160]  We're collecting some really good ones.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:11.160]  All right. I will definitely put a link into the series iPad pros over at iMore, but I think it's great.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:20.160]  I think it's, I think it's really interesting to think about it in terms of context where these, where and what these people are doing, not just, oh, they're doing the same things they used to do.
