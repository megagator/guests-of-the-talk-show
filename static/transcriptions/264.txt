[00:00.000 --> 00:02.720]  Ah, it's the end of a busy week, Joanna.
[00:03.620 --> 00:05.880]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:05.880 --> 00:07.540]  You didn't even do Apple Watch, did you?
[00:07.540 --> 00:08.380]  Or did I?
[00:08.380 --> 00:09.200]  No.
[00:09.200 --> 00:10.040]  I was gonna say,
[00:10.040 --> 00:10.880]  because if you did, I missed it.
[00:10.880 --> 00:13.760]  And on the most incompetent podcasts of all time.
[00:14.960 --> 00:17.880]  No, I physically could not do it.
[00:17.880 --> 00:20.760]  Physically, it would not be possible with what I did.
[00:20.760 --> 00:23.280]  And I'm not gonna say I phoned it in,
[00:23.280 --> 00:26.160]  but it was like a grand relief to me
[00:26.160 --> 00:29.920]  that to me, my take of the Apple Watch Series 5
[00:29.920 --> 00:31.360]  was very, very simple.
[00:31.360 --> 00:34.120]  And now that we have some technical information,
[00:34.120 --> 00:36.000]  like developers have hooked it up to Xcode
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.520]  and found out the CPU and GPU are the same, et cetera,
[00:39.520 --> 00:43.120]  that it really is, it's last year's Apple Watch
[00:43.120 --> 00:44.960]  with the always on screen,
[00:44.960 --> 00:47.000]  which to me is a huge, huge deal,
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.060]  and the compass, which is not as huge a deal.
[00:51.060 --> 00:55.720]  Because you're usually lost in downtown Philadelphia.
[00:55.720 --> 00:57.080]  Well, I wrote in my review
[00:57.080 --> 00:59.320]  that I don't think I've ever needed a compass in my life.
[00:59.320 --> 01:01.800]  Like I've never been like a boy scout type.
[01:04.080 --> 01:06.360]  But I realized that for walking direction.
[01:06.360 --> 01:09.320]  So I did go back and add a sentence
[01:09.320 --> 01:10.420]  in the next day in my review
[01:10.420 --> 01:13.940]  that it should be a huge boon for walking directions.
[01:15.720 --> 01:16.560]  But-
[01:16.560 --> 01:17.760]  Yeah, I see that.
[01:17.760 --> 01:20.540]  Yeah, and that makes sense, right?
[01:20.540 --> 01:23.560]  It's like sometimes it's like, I don't know,
[01:23.560 --> 01:26.040]  you get into a city you're not familiar with.
[01:26.040 --> 01:27.800]  I mean, I'm pretty familiar with New York even,
[01:27.800 --> 01:29.440]  but every once in a while I'll come out of a building
[01:29.440 --> 01:31.640]  in New York and if it's like noon
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.120]  and there's no sun to guide by,
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.400]  it's like, wait, wait, which way is this?
[01:34.400 --> 01:36.640]  Like uptown, downtown, where the hell am I?
[01:36.640 --> 01:38.760]  You know what, I actually haven't even thought about that.
[01:38.760 --> 01:41.720]  Like it really would help me to know which is west and east.
[01:41.720 --> 01:43.160]  When I come out of a subway station
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.200]  and I'm like, walk a block across
[01:45.200 --> 01:47.200]  and I'm like, why is this not Fifth Avenue?
[01:47.200 --> 01:48.440]  I thought it was Fifth Avenue.
[01:48.440 --> 01:51.520]  Right, or for me, like downtown,
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.680]  like I'm way more familiar with midtown
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.320]  because I'm just touristy, my familiarity with New York
[01:58.320 --> 02:01.520]  is very touristy, you know, like stay in a midtown hotel
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.000]  and go to a Yankees game or go see museums or whatever.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.800]  Like when I go downtown, like where Apple has stuff now,
[02:07.800 --> 02:10.920]  like at that big mansion where they sometimes hold events,
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.880]  the streets aren't quite so grid-like,
[02:13.880 --> 02:15.900]  you know, there's diagonal streets running around
[02:15.900 --> 02:18.280]  and you get off the subway and I do get spun around
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.760]  sometimes like, where's east, west, what's,
[02:21.760 --> 02:22.840]  so the watch would definitely,
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.000]  the compass would definitely help with that.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.600]  So I don't wanna belittle it,
[02:25.600 --> 02:27.880]  but it really was a pretty easy review for me.
[02:27.880 --> 02:29.600]  It's like the always on screen makes,
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.240]  it's like a huge game changer, sign me up, I'm buying one.
[02:33.240 --> 02:35.120]  You're buying one from a series four to this?
[02:35.120 --> 02:36.680]  No, I didn't buy series four last year.
[02:36.680 --> 02:38.760]  Okay, so my big take is that like,
[02:38.760 --> 02:40.440]  I mean, it's not really big take, it's just like,
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.400]  like you said, it's the same thing as a series four.
[02:42.400 --> 02:43.240]  If you had a series four,
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.760]  there's no reason to upgrade here,
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.720]  though it is really cool that you have this screen
[02:46.720 --> 02:48.600]  that's always on and probably should have, you know,
[02:48.600 --> 02:51.160]  you wish it was there from the start, like you wrote,
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.600]  but I think if you've got a series three or series two,
[02:55.600 --> 02:56.960]  certainly, and you're upgrading,
[02:56.960 --> 02:59.200]  this is gonna make a ton of sense.
[02:59.200 --> 03:00.440]  The other thing that Apple told me
[03:00.440 --> 03:02.360]  when they briefed me on it was that
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.480]  the compass should help with indoor navigation,
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.760]  like when you're in a train station
[03:09.760 --> 03:12.760]  or you know how they have like airports mapped out now.
[03:12.760 --> 03:15.720]  And so instead of just sort of getting you that GPS,
[03:15.720 --> 03:18.480]  you're within 10 meters or five meters or whatever,
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.840]  and it's like, all they know is you're like in terminal C,
[03:21.840 --> 03:23.120]  somewhere in the middle, you know,
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.920]  now they can tell you turn left
[03:24.920 --> 03:27.240]  and you'll see the coffee place you're looking for
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.800]  or whatever.
[03:28.800 --> 03:30.160]  I don't, you know, but that's not a huge deal.
[03:30.160 --> 03:32.160]  I would never tell anybody to upgrade the watch
[03:32.160 --> 03:33.000]  just for the compass.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.720]  They're always on screen is a big deal.
[03:35.720 --> 03:37.200]  Yeah, I mean, I loved how you wrote,
[03:37.200 --> 03:39.200]  like this was the thing you had always wanted.
[03:39.200 --> 03:40.840]  And I think for me,
[03:40.840 --> 03:43.640]  there are some of these still little remaining things
[03:43.640 --> 03:45.120]  that like they're the things I've always wanted
[03:45.120 --> 03:46.120]  that Apple just hasn't done.
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.280]  I mean, sleep tracking for me
[03:47.280 --> 03:49.040]  was a huge disappointment at the event
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.640]  when they didn't announce that.
[03:51.560 --> 03:53.160]  And I know we were tweeting about it before
[03:53.160 --> 03:55.200]  and you were suggesting some of the apps
[03:55.200 --> 03:57.760]  and I've been using some of the apps and they're not bad.
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.520]  They're really not bad, but like they're not Apple.
[04:00.520 --> 04:02.600]  It's not the same thing as having it built in.
[04:02.600 --> 04:04.560]  That's very true.
[04:04.560 --> 04:06.720]  I'm curious about that rumor too.
[04:06.720 --> 04:08.440]  And it's funny the rumors this year,
[04:08.440 --> 04:12.280]  there were a lot of busts and some of them,
[04:12.280 --> 04:13.600]  you know, like the tile tracker thing,
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.120]  that's probably not a bust.
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.840]  That's probably just coming soon.
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.480]  Yeah, I think that's like a month or two delayed.
[04:20.480 --> 04:22.080]  But I think the sleep tracking thing,
[04:22.080 --> 04:24.240]  I don't think that's gonna come in a software update.
[04:24.240 --> 04:26.200]  I think if they were gonna do it, they would do it.
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.200]  And using the series five watch with the always on display
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.600]  and you know, the battery life is probably a little bit less
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.520]  than I was getting with my series three.
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.800]  So my personal watches, Apple watches that I've bought
[04:43.800 --> 04:46.160]  at John Gruber has bought and used and owned
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.640]  are the original way back in 2015.
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.200]  I didn't buy a series two.
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.440]  Then I bought a series three when they added the cellular,
[04:57.360 --> 04:58.840]  which I still like having.
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.000]  It's like, I like the peace of mind,
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.080]  but I almost never use.
[05:01.080 --> 05:03.240]  And every time I look, I'm one of those people,
[05:03.240 --> 05:05.480]  I do look at my Verizon bill every month
[05:05.480 --> 05:07.440]  and I'm like, why is this $240?
[05:07.440 --> 05:09.680]  And I'm like, oh, well, I guess so, yeah.
[05:09.680 --> 05:10.960]  You've just been paying for it?
[05:10.960 --> 05:12.400]  Yeah, like 10 bucks a month.
[05:12.400 --> 05:14.160]  And it's like, I'd never use it
[05:14.160 --> 05:16.600]  or like I use it like once a year.
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.760]  It's a lot of money to spend for like one time a year,
[05:18.760 --> 05:20.320]  but I kinda like the peace of mind
[05:20.320 --> 05:21.320]  that I could just run out
[05:21.320 --> 05:24.840]  and if I needed to make a call or something, I could do it.
[05:24.840 --> 05:26.440]  I probably exaggerate a little bit there.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.920]  I probably used it more than once a year,
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.920]  but I probably don't use it $120 a year enough.
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.680]  But I skipped series four last year.
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.640]  I really liked the way series four looked last year,
[05:37.640 --> 05:40.920]  but I didn't like it enough to upgrade year over year.
[05:40.920 --> 05:43.720]  And now I bought the series five.
[05:43.720 --> 05:46.440]  So I will say, and I'm doing the sleep tracking thing
[05:46.440 --> 05:47.760]  with the third party apps too.
[05:47.760 --> 05:49.360]  So I wear it when I go to sleep.
[05:50.960 --> 05:53.920]  I will say battery life is a little bit less
[05:53.920 --> 05:56.200]  than my series three was getting.
[05:56.200 --> 06:00.960]  So keeping the screen on in a low power mode every day.
[06:00.960 --> 06:03.360]  Usually when I wake up in the morning for the last week,
[06:03.360 --> 06:07.600]  I'm around 15 to 20% on the watch.
[06:07.600 --> 06:10.400]  And I could charge it while I shower.
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.240]  I usually charge it.
[06:11.240 --> 06:12.480]  I have a charger in the kitchen.
[06:12.480 --> 06:15.240]  I charge it while I make coffee, get my day started.
[06:15.240 --> 06:18.520]  And usually, I need a little bit over an hour.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.880]  I've got to find some time during the day
[06:19.880 --> 06:22.080]  to get the watch back up and then put it back on,
[06:22.080 --> 06:23.440]  keep it on all day.
[06:23.440 --> 06:25.160]  And then with my series three
[06:25.160 --> 06:27.240]  that I had been wearing for a long time,
[06:27.240 --> 06:30.440]  usually I was more at like 30 to 40%
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.760]  when I wake up in the morning.
[06:32.760 --> 06:34.080]  But that's a trade off I'm willing to make
[06:34.080 --> 06:35.160]  for the always on display.
[06:35.160 --> 06:38.600]  That is a very fair trade off because I really love it.
[06:38.600 --> 06:43.600]  But given that I'm only waking up with 17% in the morning,
[06:47.040 --> 06:49.080]  it's not that easy to find.
[06:49.080 --> 06:50.880]  If you want to wear your watch all day
[06:50.880 --> 06:53.400]  and you want to track your stand time and all that stuff,
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.680]  it's not that easy to find an hour to an hour and a half
[06:57.680 --> 06:58.640]  to charge it throughout the day.
[06:58.640 --> 07:01.480]  So I can kind of see why Apple didn't do sleep tracking.
[07:01.480 --> 07:05.160]  Well, so I bought the series four last year
[07:05.160 --> 07:08.800]  and I have tried sleep tracking a couple of nights.
[07:08.800 --> 07:11.040]  Similar kind of percentage to you.
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.440]  I think I wake up with probably like closer to 20 or 30%.
[07:14.440 --> 07:17.520]  Is that what you said on the three?
[07:17.520 --> 07:20.200]  No, I usually wake up with more like 30 to 40
[07:20.200 --> 07:24.600]  but I've got the 40, the larger 42 millimeter size
[07:24.600 --> 07:26.400]  and I'm guessing you have the 38 millimeter
[07:26.400 --> 07:29.080]  or the 40 millimeter now.
[07:29.080 --> 07:31.880]  And I find that that makes sense.
[07:31.880 --> 07:33.800]  So I find that it takes shorter charging time.
[07:33.800 --> 07:35.520]  Like I'm good at an hour, right?
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.760]  It's like, great.
[07:38.080 --> 07:40.600]  And then the other big thing
[07:40.600 --> 07:43.200]  that I'm sort of thinking through is that,
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.040]  well, two things.
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.560]  One, I'm going through the settings right now
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.160]  and Apple told me this would be possible.
[07:48.160 --> 07:52.760]  Can you turn off the always on display?
[07:52.760 --> 07:53.760]  Yes.
[07:53.760 --> 07:54.720]  Where is that?
[07:54.720 --> 07:58.200]  So in the watch, you go to settings.
[07:58.200 --> 07:59.920]  I think you can do it right on the watch.
[07:59.920 --> 08:00.760]  Settings.
[08:00.760 --> 08:02.520]  My watch is upstairs.
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.840]  All right, I'm in the app.
[08:03.840 --> 08:04.680]  I'll talk you through it.
[08:04.680 --> 08:05.520]  Settings.
[08:07.680 --> 08:09.960]  Display and brightness.
[08:09.960 --> 08:12.240]  And always on, on.
[08:12.240 --> 08:14.400]  And you can type always on and turn it off.
[08:16.120 --> 08:18.040]  Yeah, I'm on the phone right now.
[08:18.040 --> 08:19.200]  But you can definitely do it.
[08:19.200 --> 08:22.680]  And then as a tip to those listening,
[08:23.600 --> 08:26.800]  in that same section for the always on display,
[08:26.800 --> 08:30.480]  there is also a preference which is off by default
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.360]  called hide sensitive complications.
[08:33.360 --> 08:35.360]  Sensitive complications contain data
[08:35.360 --> 08:37.200]  such as your calendar appointments,
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.360]  mail messages, heart rate.
[08:39.360 --> 08:40.880]  And if you turn that on,
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.760]  then those won't be visible in the always on mode either.
[08:44.760 --> 08:46.720]  But that is off by default.
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.920]  So let's just say the calendar complication.
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.040]  If you're holding the wrist strap on the subway,
[08:54.040 --> 08:56.440]  somebody who looks at your watch in theory
[08:56.440 --> 08:58.440]  might be able to see your next calendar appointment.
[08:58.440 --> 09:00.560]  But you can turn that off.
[09:00.560 --> 09:02.600]  That's been like one of the top questions
[09:02.600 --> 09:05.160]  that I've been asked from daring firewall readers.
[09:05.160 --> 09:06.440]  People are very concerned about,
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.960]  rightly so, about the privacy implications
[09:08.960 --> 09:10.640]  of the always on display.
[09:10.640 --> 09:12.200]  Yeah, I don't have that much on there,
[09:12.200 --> 09:13.680]  so I don't really care.
[09:13.680 --> 09:16.920]  But my thought is, well, first of all, I wanna try this.
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.480]  I'm gonna try no, turning off always on
[09:21.480 --> 09:23.880]  and seeing how the battery life goes.
[09:23.880 --> 09:26.920]  Because you could see one, turning it off
[09:26.920 --> 09:29.400]  when you're sleeping or turning it off in general.
[09:29.400 --> 09:33.520]  I like it a lot, but I don't find that it's a game.
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.000]  I don't know, I'm kind of mixed.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.400]  There's only a couple of times in the day
[09:37.400 --> 09:38.240]  where I look at it and I'm like,
[09:38.240 --> 09:40.040]  okay, that's nice that I didn't have to shake my arm
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.160]  really hard to see this.
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.920]  Were you a wristwatch wearer before Apple Watch?
[09:45.800 --> 09:48.920]  Not in the immediate years before,
[09:48.920 --> 09:50.720]  but I grew up wearing watches.
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.720]  I think that's the big factor.
[09:53.720 --> 09:56.480]  I've had a watch on my left wrist
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.600]  since I was 14 or 15.
[10:00.520 --> 10:03.240]  It's like I even said in my review this week,
[10:03.240 --> 10:05.360]  looking back at my original Apple Watch review,
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.680]  I spent several hundred words complaining
[10:08.680 --> 10:10.800]  about the lack of an always on display
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.920]  and all the scenarios where I was annoyed by it.
[10:13.920 --> 10:15.560]  It's just muscle memory.
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.880]  As I've been wearing it this week, I'm like,
[10:16.880 --> 10:18.760]  oh yeah, right, I don't need to tap it,
[10:18.760 --> 10:20.400]  or I don't need to touch the side,
[10:20.400 --> 10:22.440]  or I don't need to shake my arm.
[10:22.440 --> 10:23.960]  I feel like it's now muscle memory
[10:23.960 --> 10:26.360]  to try to turn that screen on.
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.080]  The funny one for me is wearing it to sleep now,
[10:31.080 --> 10:32.840]  which I've been doing for months.
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.400]  It never really wakes up for me in bed,
[10:36.400 --> 10:38.320]  like my Series 3, right?
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.120]  This is not the new, the one I've been wearing for months.
[10:41.120 --> 10:43.000]  So I go to bed with it, it's dark,
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.520]  it's the middle of the night, and I wake up,
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.400]  and I'm just like, oh, how close to the morning is it?
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.280]  And I look at the watch, it doesn't turn on,
[10:48.280 --> 10:50.360]  and there's not really anything I can do to make it turn on,
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.960]  and I do the same thing every time.
[10:51.960 --> 10:54.200]  I bring it up and tap it with my nose.
[10:54.200 --> 10:57.960]  And then it wakes up, because the other thing is,
[10:57.960 --> 10:58.920]  like, in the middle of the night,
[10:58.920 --> 11:00.480]  without contacts or glasses on,
[11:00.480 --> 11:02.320]  I really do kind of have to hold it close to see it.
[11:02.320 --> 11:04.040]  So I bring it up, tap my nose,
[11:04.040 --> 11:05.440]  and then I can check the time.
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.640]  It is so nice not to have to do that anymore.
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.520]  That was one of the best A-heads.
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.400]  We have these front page stories at the Journal
[11:13.400 --> 11:15.000]  that are kind of quirky and funny.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.360]  One of the best A-heads ever written
[11:16.360 --> 11:18.800]  was one of our old Apple reporter,
[11:18.800 --> 11:20.480]  now works at the Times, Dai,
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.760]  wrote about how people were using their nose
[11:22.760 --> 11:25.120]  and tapping the Apple Watches
[11:25.120 --> 11:27.720]  when they were in airports and no hands were free.
[11:28.880 --> 11:30.120]  So yeah, I mean.
[11:30.120 --> 11:31.320]  That is a great story.
[11:31.320 --> 11:32.600]  I remember when he wrote that.
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.440]  That is, because there's a lot of people
[11:37.440 --> 11:38.560]  who don't have an Apple Watch who are like,
[11:38.560 --> 11:39.640]  what a bunch of goofs.
[11:39.640 --> 11:41.320]  And then there's all the people with Apple Watches
[11:41.320 --> 11:42.680]  who are like, yeah, me too.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.200]  Right?
[11:44.200 --> 11:45.960]  I used to do it all the time when walking the dog
[11:45.960 --> 11:47.560]  and holding a coffee or something.
[11:47.560 --> 11:48.400]  Oh, definitely.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.240]  All the time.
[11:49.240 --> 11:51.880]  I'd be like, I look ridiculous on the street.
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.080]  So yeah, I'm generally just feeling like
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.560]  the sleep tracking would be that final health feature
[11:57.560 --> 11:58.720]  that I'd be into.
[11:58.720 --> 12:01.040]  Sometimes I'm not really fully sure why I want it so badly
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.320]  because when I do track my sleep,
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.040]  I'm like, don't learn a ton,
[12:04.040 --> 12:05.840]  but it does make me feel better.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.480]  But yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.880]  A lot of it too feels like this.
[12:09.880 --> 12:11.360]  I think you sort of wrote this,
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.360]  that this is the time that the watch has hit its stride.
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.640]  This is it, right?
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.840]  Like sort of when the iPhone hit its stride
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.160]  and like, this is what it was supposed to be.
[12:22.160 --> 12:23.400]  And I kind of feel that way.
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.560]  I felt that way reviewing the series four last year.
[12:25.560 --> 12:27.040]  I just said, this is the time.
[12:27.040 --> 12:29.360]  I have very little complaints now about this.
[12:29.360 --> 12:31.280]  And if you had been holding off,
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.520]  now's the time to buy one,
[12:32.520 --> 12:35.040]  is to try one, to buy it for somebody as a gift.
[12:36.440 --> 12:38.120]  I'm sure there are more things they will do
[12:38.120 --> 12:39.200]  in these next generations,
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.440]  but this kind of feels like this is what it was meant to be.
[12:42.440 --> 12:43.280]  Yeah.
[12:43.280 --> 12:45.080]  Some of the things I can think of,
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.240]  and it's not a bad idea for Riffin on the show,
[12:48.240 --> 12:49.080]  is what else?
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.480]  All right, so I say it's hit its stride.
[12:50.480 --> 12:51.480]  That doesn't mean it's done.
[12:51.480 --> 12:54.920]  Just like my ballpark estimation
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.280]  for when the iPhone hit its stride
[12:56.280 --> 12:59.840]  was probably like the iPhone 4S, I said, or so.
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.280]  That's probably what I would say.
[13:01.280 --> 13:03.320]  You know, maybe even the iPhone 4.
[13:03.320 --> 13:05.320]  The iPhone 4 is the asterisk
[13:05.320 --> 13:07.240]  because of the whole antenna gate thing.
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.240]  And the big thing is put aside whether antenna gate
[13:12.440 --> 13:14.960]  was a real technical problem or not.
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.120]  The reason it stands out
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.320]  was that the phone was still AT&T only, right?
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.800]  It's at least in the US,
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.120]  and that was solved with the 4S
[13:27.120 --> 13:29.040]  because they came out with the Verizon one
[13:29.040 --> 13:30.400]  like six months in between.
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.320]  And by the 4S, that's why I say
[13:32.320 --> 13:34.080]  that's when the iPhone really hit its stride
[13:34.080 --> 13:36.160]  because then with the 4S,
[13:36.160 --> 13:39.920]  they were on both types of cellular networks,
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.160]  the CDMA and whatever the other one is, GSM.
[13:44.160 --> 13:45.880]  GSM, yeah.
[13:45.880 --> 13:48.440]  And to me, that was a huge part of saying,
[13:48.440 --> 13:51.000]  hey, this thing is sort of fundamentally done, right?
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.440]  Because that was a huge missing hole
[13:52.440 --> 13:56.440]  is like if you live in somewhere with crummy Verizon
[13:56.440 --> 13:59.720]  or AT&T coverage, it's a real problem.
[13:59.720 --> 14:02.040]  Or if you live in a country that doesn't have,
[14:03.440 --> 14:05.760]  or I guess GSM was more worldwide,
[14:05.760 --> 14:06.960]  so that wasn't as much of a problem.
[14:06.960 --> 14:09.320]  But anyway, it was definitely necessary
[14:09.320 --> 14:11.640]  to get Verizon support, at least here in the US.
[14:11.640 --> 14:13.480]  So that's why I say the 4S.
[14:13.480 --> 14:15.560]  That doesn't mean the iPhone 4S was done.
[14:15.560 --> 14:18.600]  I mean, we've seen an awful lot of improvements
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.320]  from the iPhone 4S,
[14:20.320 --> 14:22.680]  and I'm sure we'll see a lot of improvements for the watch,
[14:22.680 --> 14:25.760]  but I just feel like the big ones, the big,
[14:25.760 --> 14:27.640]  ah, here's what I wish it could do are done.
[14:27.640 --> 14:29.480]  But what else are we looking to see
[14:29.480 --> 14:30.760]  in the future from Apple Watch?
[14:30.760 --> 14:33.960]  One of them I can think of is I'd still like to see it
[14:33.960 --> 14:36.640]  become more independent from the iPhone
[14:36.640 --> 14:39.400]  so that both for first-party stuff
[14:39.400 --> 14:40.760]  and especially third-party,
[14:40.760 --> 14:42.840]  like it is still,
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.240]  and it's like poor Marco Arment making his podcast player,
[14:46.240 --> 14:49.840]  I think is going insane
[14:49.840 --> 14:51.480]  and has been going insane for years
[14:51.480 --> 14:53.720]  trying to get a good watch app
[14:53.720 --> 14:57.240]  so that you can go out with AirPods and your Apple Watch
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.720]  and just listen to podcasts.
[14:58.720 --> 15:00.960]  And if you have the cellular one,
[15:00.960 --> 15:02.280]  since you're, like I was just saying,
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.520]  since you're paying good money to have that cellular thing,
[15:04.520 --> 15:06.400]  wouldn't it be nice to be able to download podcasts
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.720]  right to your watch?
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.560]  And none of that stuff really works well at the moment.
[15:10.560 --> 15:13.120]  Yeah, I still struggle with just running
[15:13.120 --> 15:14.680]  with the watch and AirPods.
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.840]  The syncing, the Bluetooth, all of it is still,
[15:18.840 --> 15:19.880]  it's kind of annoying.
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.400]  I do it, but I like build in another 10 minutes
[15:23.400 --> 15:24.480]  to get ready for a run.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.600]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[15:27.960 --> 15:28.880]  It's a warmup.
[15:28.880 --> 15:31.040]  You have to be prepared for the fact that not...
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.800]  I'm gonna make a warmup video,
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.320]  a warmup with your Apple Watch running video
[15:35.320 --> 15:36.720]  with Joanna Stern.
[15:36.720 --> 15:38.880]  And you just, that's the warmup.
[15:38.880 --> 15:40.640]  You're just pairing, you do some stretching
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.040]  as you're pairing.
[15:42.040 --> 15:44.560]  You just have to be prepared for absolutely nothing
[15:44.560 --> 15:46.640]  to be ready for you to leave.
[15:46.640 --> 15:48.160]  No, nothing's ever ready.
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.440]  I'm like, okay.
[15:49.440 --> 15:50.400]  And then I'm like, you know what?
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.960]  I'm just gonna run with my giant iPhone.
[15:52.960 --> 15:53.800]  Yeah.
[15:55.240 --> 15:57.280]  So there's one I can think of.
[15:58.680 --> 15:59.840]  I'm trying to think, what else?
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.720]  Yeah, I mean, I'm still super bought in
[16:02.720 --> 16:04.120]  with this as a health device.
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.200]  And I had mixed reactions to the video.
[16:07.200 --> 16:08.560]  I talked about this in the live blog,
[16:08.560 --> 16:11.200]  the video that they played at the event.
[16:11.200 --> 16:13.680]  And there was actually been more chatter about it
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.320]  on Twitter the next day about people crying
[16:17.320 --> 16:18.160]  during that video.
[16:18.160 --> 16:20.680]  And I even said, I will admit,
[16:20.680 --> 16:22.960]  I felt like crying during this video.
[16:22.960 --> 16:25.400]  And actually you described the video
[16:25.400 --> 16:27.840]  because I feel like I'll cry if I just describe it.
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.720]  Well, it was really interesting in a couple of ways,
[16:32.720 --> 16:34.880]  but it was Tim Cook introduced it.
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.880]  And he was just talking about the people
[16:38.880 --> 16:41.160]  who've reached out to Apple,
[16:41.160 --> 16:43.400]  I guess not just in the last year,
[16:43.400 --> 16:48.400]  cause it wasn't just people with EKG monitoring,
[16:48.840 --> 16:50.040]  which is new to series four.
[16:50.040 --> 16:52.200]  It was other health problems too.
[16:52.200 --> 16:57.200]  But people who had incidents where wearing an Apple watch
[16:58.320 --> 17:00.000]  may or may not have saved their lives
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.160]  or at the very least help them in an emergency situation.
[17:04.160 --> 17:05.320]  There was a woman who said,
[17:05.320 --> 17:06.800]  hey, her watch all of a sudden said
[17:06.800 --> 17:08.200]  her heartbeat was irregular.
[17:08.200 --> 17:09.520]  And she was like, oh, that's weird.
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.800]  And then it like said it again.
[17:10.800 --> 17:12.720]  And she like got her husband
[17:12.720 --> 17:13.920]  to take her to the emergency room.
[17:13.920 --> 17:16.440]  And they were like, oh yeah, you were about to die.
[17:16.440 --> 17:19.320]  And it's, but it was told first person.
[17:19.320 --> 17:21.040]  And it was people who I guess
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.520]  were sending these videos to Apple,
[17:22.520 --> 17:24.720]  but a lot of them were just shot on FaceTime.
[17:24.720 --> 17:25.560]  You know, like people-
[17:25.560 --> 17:27.480]  Yeah, no, I mean, I figure what happened
[17:27.480 --> 17:29.080]  and I actually thought a lot about this during things
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.280]  that Apple got notes and then Apple called them
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.280]  the producers of this video who are very good producers.
[17:35.280 --> 17:36.320]  I was just watching it and I was like,
[17:36.320 --> 17:38.920]  wow, this is a really well produced video
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.880]  down to like the music track changes.
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.520]  And then probably got in touch with them
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.800]  and asked them to recount those moments.
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.840]  Cause like how it was that clever moment
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.560]  where the pregnant, she was pregnant,
[17:50.560 --> 17:52.320]  but the baby gets handed to her
[17:52.320 --> 17:54.280]  and that kind of like had to be somewhat staged.
[17:54.280 --> 17:56.680]  And then the husband is going out
[17:56.680 --> 17:58.600]  to go mow the lawn or whatnot.
[17:58.600 --> 18:00.960]  Anyway, my reason for bringing this up is that,
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.640]  well, two, there was this reaction from some people,
[18:03.640 --> 18:06.120]  I think it was Charlie Morzell in the Times
[18:06.120 --> 18:07.800]  who wrote that, you know, they should stop these events.
[18:07.800 --> 18:10.560]  And then somebody said there were some bloggers crying
[18:10.560 --> 18:14.360]  or somebody cried and I felt somewhat,
[18:14.360 --> 18:16.080]  I don't know, not ashamed that I cried,
[18:16.080 --> 18:18.320]  but I mean, I didn't want to publicly admit
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.640]  that I cried anyway, but it was this very emotional video.
[18:22.640 --> 18:25.480]  And I thought to myself, one, it really hits home for me
[18:25.480 --> 18:28.880]  because I have heard from so many readers in the last year
[18:28.880 --> 18:31.080]  since doing my Apple Watch Series 4 review
[18:31.080 --> 18:32.920]  about the falling feature.
[18:32.920 --> 18:37.440]  I have tons of emails from elderly readers saying,
[18:37.440 --> 18:40.160]  I bought this and I'm so happy that you tested this
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.920]  cause now I can feel a little bit more certain
[18:41.920 --> 18:44.040]  about buying it for this feature.
[18:44.040 --> 18:46.040]  I have people who have written to me saying,
[18:46.040 --> 18:47.600]  I did fall and it did catch it
[18:47.600 --> 18:50.480]  and I could text someone to tell them and I fell.
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.520]  So that's one reason.
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.760]  And then the second reason I had sort of just this reaction
[18:54.760 --> 18:57.400]  was too, it's like, it's always odd that Apple,
[18:57.400 --> 19:01.280]  it's odd when a company is sort of selling something
[19:01.280 --> 19:02.720]  that's life or death, right?
[19:02.720 --> 19:05.520]  And I think for me, I had this reaction like,
[19:05.520 --> 19:08.000]  so you buy the Apple Watch or you die?
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.960]  Like, is that what Apple's saying here?
[19:09.960 --> 19:13.560]  Like, is that like, you know, the marketing play here?
[19:13.560 --> 19:16.000]  And it was done really,
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.040]  I think it was done really tactfully, the video.
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.080]  And I'm not sure they actually would play it on TV
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.280]  as like a, as a commercial spot.
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.000]  I'm sure it's on their YouTube channel,
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.080]  but it definitely just got me this,
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.240]  like it's a little bit of an icky place to be
[19:30.240 --> 19:31.480]  when selling gadgets, right?
[19:31.480 --> 19:34.600]  Like, is it, it's also a liability for them
[19:34.600 --> 19:37.120]  if like somebody buys one and it doesn't save their life.
[19:37.120 --> 19:38.360]  But it's also like this other weird thing,
[19:38.360 --> 19:41.960]  it's like spend $200 more on the more expensive version
[19:41.960 --> 19:43.320]  cause it'll save your life.
[19:44.280 --> 19:45.280]  Yeah, it is touchy.
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.000]  I talked to somebody at Apple about it last year
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.880]  when series four came out
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.760]  and it was sort of a delicate balance to present it on stage
[19:55.760 --> 19:58.560]  because they had like some typical Apple,
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.920]  here's a video we wanna show you.
[19:59.920 --> 20:02.800]  And they showed like an older woman,
[20:02.800 --> 20:05.720]  like, you know, clearly you could surmise
[20:05.720 --> 20:06.920]  she was like the grandmother
[20:06.920 --> 20:09.160]  and she was in her kitchen using a stool
[20:09.160 --> 20:10.320]  to reach a high shelf.
[20:10.320 --> 20:14.120]  And then her grandson was like ramming around the house
[20:14.120 --> 20:16.640]  coming by and you could see she was worried
[20:16.640 --> 20:19.240]  he might kick the stool out from under her or something.
[20:19.240 --> 20:21.160]  You know, and, but they didn't show that.
[20:21.160 --> 20:23.720]  They didn't show her having a fall, right?
[20:23.720 --> 20:25.840]  It was like, they just showed like a scenario
[20:25.840 --> 20:27.560]  where somebody might fall.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.640]  And then when they actually showed the falls
[20:29.640 --> 20:31.920]  and they were like, and I think it was Jeff Williams
[20:31.920 --> 20:35.720]  was doing the narrate, you know, the stage presence
[20:35.720 --> 20:37.560]  was saying, you know, and there's different ways to fall.
[20:37.560 --> 20:39.400]  You can fall forward, you can fall backward
[20:39.400 --> 20:43.280]  and it's totally different algorithms to detect those falls.
[20:43.280 --> 20:46.320]  They showed stick figures falling on the screen, right?
[20:46.320 --> 20:48.960]  Like, so like, rather than show the unpleasantness
[20:48.960 --> 20:52.160]  of hiring, like you did in your video.
[20:52.160 --> 20:54.920]  Yeah, I watched that, believe me,
[20:54.920 --> 20:56.840]  I've watched that section of the presentation
[20:56.840 --> 21:00.440]  like 50 times, so many times to get that video right.
[21:00.440 --> 21:02.720]  Right, every time it came to something unpleasant,
[21:02.720 --> 21:04.640]  like actually showing a fall,
[21:04.640 --> 21:07.880]  they would go to like stick figures or illustrations
[21:07.880 --> 21:10.120]  rather than show actual human beings fall.
[21:10.120 --> 21:11.960]  Cause it's, you know, it's a hard thing to sell.
[21:11.960 --> 21:13.920]  You don't want to, it always reminds me
[21:13.920 --> 21:16.880]  of the old commercial that ran,
[21:16.880 --> 21:18.080]  I don't know if you're too young or not.
[21:18.080 --> 21:20.240]  Remember the, I've fallen and I can't get up.
[21:20.240 --> 21:22.480]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I watched a lot of those too.
[21:22.480 --> 21:27.480]  I watched a lot of those for that video, ads are so funny.
[21:27.480 --> 21:29.480]  That was for those of you who are too young
[21:29.480 --> 21:32.520]  or don't remember, or maybe it's a US centric thing,
[21:32.520 --> 21:35.200]  but at some point in the late eighties,
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.680]  maybe probably early nineties,
[21:36.680 --> 21:40.400]  there was a commercial that ran all the time.
[21:40.400 --> 21:42.600]  It was a very famous, but it was for,
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.040]  I think it was called Medic Alert.
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.920]  It was, so it was a, you know,
[21:45.920 --> 21:47.680]  it probably wasn't a bad idea.
[21:47.680 --> 21:50.720]  It was a electronic gadget that you could,
[21:50.720 --> 21:53.400]  you could get for an elderly person in your life.
[21:53.400 --> 21:55.960]  And they would wear it around their neck, like a necklace.
[21:55.960 --> 21:58.600]  And if something bad happened, like they fell,
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.560]  there was a button they could hold
[22:00.560 --> 22:03.680]  and it would call emergency services.
[22:04.800 --> 22:07.200]  And, but it was a really cheese ball commercial.
[22:11.520 --> 22:13.480]  But there was this old lady and she falls
[22:13.480 --> 22:17.120]  and she just says, I've fallen and I can't get up.
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.560]  Cause her son wasn't a good son
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.680]  and didn't buy her a Medic Alert bracelet.
[22:22.680 --> 22:24.920]  There's so many of these on YouTube.
[22:24.920 --> 22:25.760]  It's so funny.
[22:25.760 --> 22:27.400]  All right, I will link to them in the show notes
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.880]  and everybody can have a laugh.
[22:28.880 --> 22:30.840]  But anyway, yeah, and we can talk about that.
[22:30.840 --> 22:34.200]  That was, I think it was Jack Nickus from the times
[22:34.200 --> 22:38.200]  who had the sort of snarky comment about some,
[22:41.040 --> 22:43.160]  you know, I think he called her a blogger
[22:44.560 --> 22:45.560]  sitting next to him.
[22:45.560 --> 22:48.960]  And it was in the context of Charlie Worzel's accusation
[22:48.960 --> 22:52.960]  that Apple bloggers are cheering
[22:52.960 --> 22:54.200]  throughout these Apple events.
[22:54.200 --> 22:55.720]  Nilay, I was on Nilay's show.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.640]  I don't think it's out yet.
[22:56.640 --> 22:57.960]  I don't think it comes out till next week,
[22:57.960 --> 22:58.800]  but we talked about it.
[22:58.800 --> 23:00.440]  But we can talk about it here too.
[23:01.680 --> 23:04.520]  I totally get, I think that's such a,
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.760]  I get why people think that
[23:06.760 --> 23:09.160]  because there is lots of applause during these Apple events.
[23:09.160 --> 23:10.880]  But the thing that people don't understand
[23:10.880 --> 23:12.960]  and it's a reasonable misunderstanding
[23:12.960 --> 23:14.200]  is that these events,
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.400]  especially the ones at the Steve Jobs Theater
[23:17.400 --> 23:19.040]  and the smaller venues like that,
[23:19.040 --> 23:21.360]  and the Steve Jobs Theater in the grand scheme of things
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.040]  is a pretty small venue.
[23:24.440 --> 23:26.920]  The percentage of people who are in that event
[23:26.920 --> 23:29.960]  who are from the media is a lot smaller
[23:29.960 --> 23:31.040]  than most people think.
[23:31.040 --> 23:33.680]  And the percentage who are English speaking media
[23:33.680 --> 23:36.280]  is really small because there's a ton
[23:36.280 --> 23:40.120]  of Asian language journalists there now.
[23:40.120 --> 23:41.920]  The percentage of people at that event
[23:41.920 --> 23:43.920]  who are English speaking journalists,
[23:43.920 --> 23:45.240]  whether you wanna call them bloggers,
[23:45.240 --> 23:46.880]  whether they write for the Wall Street Journal
[23:46.880 --> 23:50.040]  or the Times or whatever, it's really small.
[23:50.040 --> 23:51.520]  There's a ton, a lot of them,
[23:51.520 --> 23:52.360]  a lot of the people there,
[23:52.360 --> 23:55.400]  especially upfront are Apple employees
[23:55.400 --> 23:58.360]  and invited guests who are not journalists.
[23:58.360 --> 24:02.160]  They're just VIPs who are friends of the company
[24:02.160 --> 24:03.520]  or friends of people there.
[24:04.960 --> 24:06.960]  And the people you hear clapping the loudest
[24:06.960 --> 24:08.480]  and the ones who are closest to the stage
[24:08.480 --> 24:10.440]  are those Apple employees and VIPs.
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.280]  It's really not the journalists.
[24:12.280 --> 24:14.880]  And it's, I'm not gonna say I've never clapped,
[24:14.880 --> 24:17.800]  like every once in a while, there'll be a,
[24:17.800 --> 24:20.360]  I would clap for the, if I had been there,
[24:20.360 --> 24:23.920]  I would have clapped for the people
[24:23.920 --> 24:25.000]  getting their lives saved.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.720]  I mean, I've got a heart.
[24:28.280 --> 24:29.120]  I don't clap.
[24:29.120 --> 24:30.440]  I don't know, John.
[24:30.440 --> 24:32.560]  I clapped and it was when they announced
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.360]  the 18 watt charger.
[24:34.360 --> 24:35.760]  See, yeah, exactly.
[24:37.200 --> 24:40.880]  So, I mean, I've got a heart and I'm not sure.
[24:40.880 --> 24:42.440]  I mean, if anyone has a heart,
[24:42.440 --> 24:44.880]  they're clapping when they announce an 18 watt charger
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.720]  after so many years of a five watt charger.
[24:47.720 --> 24:48.760]  I could see that, right.
[24:48.760 --> 24:50.320]  Like, so I forget.
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.160]  I mean, I really did.
[24:51.160 --> 24:54.760]  I didn't actually clap, but I was enthusiastic.
[24:54.760 --> 24:56.920]  I was very enthusiastic in the,
[24:56.920 --> 24:59.760]  I sometimes mumble to myself.
[24:59.760 --> 25:01.760]  Like usually when I'm there with somebody else
[25:01.760 --> 25:03.760]  who I'm from the journal and we usually sit next
[25:03.760 --> 25:05.040]  to each other and we're live blogging,
[25:05.040 --> 25:06.880]  I mumble a lot of things to myself.
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.600]  And so that was definitely a like, holy shit, finally.
[25:10.600 --> 25:13.720]  Yeah, I would have clapped for the SF camera font.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.960]  Right, okay, so there we go.
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.280]  But the thing I found funny about Charlie Worzel's sort of,
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.840]  and Charlie Worzel, who I'm a big fan of
[25:22.840 --> 25:25.640]  and does good work and this year has been
[25:25.640 --> 25:28.920]  on a very good beat of sort of covering
[25:28.920 --> 25:31.560]  privacy related issues from a consumer perspective
[25:31.560 --> 25:33.120]  for the times.
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.000]  So, you know, I'm a fan of his work,
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.080]  but Charlie wasn't there.
[25:36.080 --> 25:37.200]  Charlie isn't the sort of,
[25:37.200 --> 25:40.760]  he's not a reporter or a gadget reviewer.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.440]  So whatever he observed of it was remotely
[25:43.440 --> 25:45.640]  watching the video, you know, at home
[25:45.640 --> 25:47.120]  or at the office or whatever.
[25:50.760 --> 25:53.400]  He made something to the effect of, you know,
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.440]  the laptop lit screens of the Apple bloggers
[25:57.440 --> 25:59.520]  and that these are the people who are applauding
[25:59.520 --> 26:02.080]  at all of these things and that it's unseemly or whatever.
[26:02.080 --> 26:04.200]  And it's like, that sentence doesn't even make any sense.
[26:04.200 --> 26:05.720]  You don't even have to be there to think about it.
[26:05.720 --> 26:08.400]  Cause the reason that their screens are laptop lit,
[26:08.400 --> 26:11.040]  which is true for an awful lot of the journalists
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.880]  who are there, their screens are laptop lit
[26:13.880 --> 26:17.000]  because they're either live blogging or taking notes
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.720]  because they have to file a story very shortly
[26:19.720 --> 26:20.760]  after the end of the event.
[26:20.760 --> 26:22.680]  Like everybody there is working.
[26:22.680 --> 26:25.160]  It is hard to pay attention to everything
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.600]  and observe, you know, cause Apple makes a point.
[26:27.600 --> 26:28.840]  You're like, Ooh, that's interesting.
[26:28.840 --> 26:30.920]  I would like, you know, that's something to write about.
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.240]  I got to take some notes.
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.680]  And in the meantime, they're going on.
[26:34.680 --> 26:37.040]  They've moved on, you know?
[26:37.040 --> 26:38.840]  And so nobody has time to clap.
[26:38.840 --> 26:41.480]  Even if you went in and it was your first time
[26:41.480 --> 26:44.840]  as a credentialed media correspondent
[26:44.840 --> 26:46.800]  and you're excited to be at an Apple event
[26:46.800 --> 26:49.680]  and you plan to clap, you don't have time
[26:49.680 --> 26:52.280]  if you're live blogging or taking notes.
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.160]  It's, you know, it really is not the case
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.600]  that the journalists clap at these things.
[26:59.560 --> 27:02.400]  Yeah, I mean, I think the, I mean,
[27:02.400 --> 27:05.400]  I don't know how much, how many new press they're allowing
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.320]  in now to, I mean, presumably some new publications,
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.800]  et cetera, but a lot of us have been going for years
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.120]  and it's, you know, the day doesn't really
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.400]  ever get any easier.
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.560]  No, it's, if anything, it's harder
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.640]  because they've expanded the number of post-event briefings.
[27:24.640 --> 27:28.000]  And, you know, in the old days, they would only brief like,
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.240]  they brief like Walt Pogue and Ed Begg from USA Today
[27:32.240 --> 27:33.480]  and that was it.
[27:33.480 --> 27:36.040]  Yeah, I mean, like the anxiety might be a little bit less
[27:36.040 --> 27:38.080]  just because you've done it a little,
[27:38.080 --> 27:39.720]  for me at least, it's like maybe the anxiety
[27:39.720 --> 27:41.560]  is a little less, I've done it so many times,
[27:41.560 --> 27:44.800]  but it's still, it's a grueling day
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.760]  and you just, there's a lot to write,
[27:48.760 --> 27:51.760]  there's a lot to sort of just try to like clear your mind
[27:51.760 --> 27:54.080]  of some of the marketing hype on stage.
[27:54.080 --> 27:55.760]  That's usually the hardest thing for me
[27:55.760 --> 27:57.360]  is just to take, like to clear and say,
[27:57.360 --> 27:59.600]  what is actually gonna be important here?
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.320]  And I've done a better job also over the years
[28:02.320 --> 28:03.840]  just to say, I'm not gonna write something today,
[28:03.840 --> 28:05.760]  I'm gonna just save thoughts for the review
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.640]  after I actually test these devices.
[28:09.640 --> 28:10.480]  But this was the first year,
[28:10.480 --> 28:12.040]  I mean, there was part of what Charlie wrote,
[28:12.040 --> 28:15.200]  which I sort of felt, yeah, why did I come to this?
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.240]  You actually didn't go
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.720]  because you didn't have to travel, but you couldn't travel.
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.800]  But I kind of felt like they could have done some briefings
[28:23.800 --> 28:26.240]  on some of this stuff and maybe been as effective
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.040]  as getting the message across to journalists.
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.320]  But you're right in the sense
[28:30.320 --> 28:32.440]  that they don't do these events just for journalists.
[28:32.440 --> 28:35.040]  Right, and primarily they don't.
[28:35.040 --> 28:37.280]  The primary audience is not the media.
[28:37.280 --> 28:38.840]  These are not press events.
[28:40.480 --> 28:42.960]  And I realized that people think that they are,
[28:42.960 --> 28:45.480]  and most companies, when they hold such events,
[28:45.480 --> 28:47.640]  they are more like press events,
[28:47.640 --> 28:49.040]  depending on the size of the company.
[28:49.040 --> 28:51.280]  Like Samsung's events are, I've never been to one,
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.960]  but they're clearly held in cavernous rooms
[28:54.960 --> 28:57.440]  and they're stocked with hundreds and hundreds
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.400]  of Samsung fans from around the world
[28:59.400 --> 29:00.640]  to get that excitement.
[29:00.640 --> 29:03.600]  But I was at a T-Mobile event a couple of years,
[29:03.600 --> 29:05.320]  I forget why, but it was real small.
[29:05.320 --> 29:07.000]  There were only like 50 people there
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.160]  and they were all media.
[29:09.160 --> 29:10.120]  That's a press event.
[29:10.120 --> 29:12.440]  A press event usually has like a Q&A,
[29:12.440 --> 29:15.600]  you get to talk on the record with people from the company
[29:15.600 --> 29:17.640]  and it's not all off the record.
[29:18.760 --> 29:21.920]  The Apple events are meant for people
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.360]  who are enthusiastic Apple users who watch from home
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.440]  and tens of millions, literally.
[29:27.440 --> 29:28.680]  I mean, this is no exaggeration.
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.720]  Like, I think it's hard to kind of comprehend
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.160]  how many people watch these videos from home.
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.560]  Cause it just, you know, 20 years ago,
[29:40.560 --> 29:43.080]  I mean, Apple nerds still were very excited
[29:43.080 --> 29:44.880]  for keynotes 15, 20 years ago,
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.440]  but the number of people who that encompasses
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.040]  is just dwarfed in today's world.
[29:51.040 --> 29:53.080]  I mean, the view counts on the YouTube versions
[29:53.080 --> 29:55.400]  of these videos are just off the charts
[29:55.400 --> 29:58.760]  and it doesn't count the video that Apple hosts itself
[29:58.760 --> 30:02.040]  on apple.com and like when you go to the Apple TV app,
[30:02.040 --> 30:04.920]  if you wanna watch there or wherever.
[30:04.920 --> 30:07.440]  I mean, so tens of millions of people, no exaggeration,
[30:07.440 --> 30:09.600]  watch these and that's Apple's target
[30:09.600 --> 30:10.640]  and what they wanna do,
[30:10.640 --> 30:13.400]  and you can totally understand their perspective
[30:13.400 --> 30:15.280]  is they want to tell the story
[30:15.280 --> 30:17.640]  of these new products themselves.
[30:17.640 --> 30:20.600]  Here's the things we want you to understand about it.
[30:20.600 --> 30:25.600]  It's very hard to comprehend how important that is to Apple.
[30:27.240 --> 30:30.400]  So that's why Apple still does it even for a year
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.080]  where in terms of helping, you know,
[30:35.080 --> 30:37.200]  the world know what's the main point of these phones.
[30:37.200 --> 30:39.680]  They really could have said, you know,
[30:39.680 --> 30:40.640]  the camera's a lot better.
[30:40.640 --> 30:43.840]  Here's a bunch of sample photos showing how it's better.
[30:44.800 --> 30:49.000]  They come in new colors and the battery life is a lot longer.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.560]  I mean, I'm not trying to belittle it.
[30:51.560 --> 30:53.720]  I mean, I gave it a glowing review.
[30:53.720 --> 30:55.640]  You gave it a glowing review.
[30:55.640 --> 30:57.760]  Nilay gave it, in my opinion,
[30:57.760 --> 31:00.840]  probably the strongest review that The Verge
[31:00.840 --> 31:03.520]  has ever given to an iPhone in recent years.
[31:03.520 --> 31:06.120]  These are great products and we'll get into the details
[31:06.120 --> 31:06.960]  as this show goes on,
[31:06.960 --> 31:11.280]  but basically it didn't have to be an event just for us,
[31:11.280 --> 31:12.120]  if it was for us.
[31:12.120 --> 31:12.960]  No, no good.
[31:12.960 --> 31:14.760]  I'm really happy that you agree with that
[31:14.760 --> 31:16.080]  because I was struggling that day.
[31:16.080 --> 31:17.640]  Like, why did we come here?
[31:17.640 --> 31:19.080]  What did I like?
[31:19.080 --> 31:21.520]  You know, and I did take that bigger picture,
[31:21.520 --> 31:23.160]  especially like given that this is the first year
[31:23.160 --> 31:25.240]  they streamed it on YouTube, right?
[31:25.240 --> 31:28.640]  They are very clearly trying to make this a moment
[31:28.640 --> 31:31.040]  where Apple can talk directly to consumers,
[31:31.040 --> 31:34.400]  directly to the people who love their products,
[31:34.400 --> 31:38.000]  the people who are interested in their products,
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.200]  to the broader industry who creates things
[31:40.200 --> 31:41.600]  for their products.
[31:41.600 --> 31:44.600]  So yeah, I think maybe it was really self-centered
[31:44.600 --> 31:47.240]  and I just was like, why did they make this event for me?
[31:47.240 --> 31:49.080]  Like, why just me?
[31:49.960 --> 31:52.320]  Hey, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[31:52.320 --> 31:54.000]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.560]  Make your next move with your own website at Squarespace.
[31:58.560 --> 31:59.760]  Maybe you've already got a website.
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.280]  Maybe it's old, it's outdated.
[32:01.280 --> 32:04.080]  Maybe you know somebody who needs a website
[32:05.080 --> 32:09.200]  and you don't wanna be on the hook for doing all the work,
[32:09.200 --> 32:11.000]  keeping it up to date.
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.520]  Do it on Squarespace.
[32:12.520 --> 32:15.600]  And I'm telling you anything you need on a website,
[32:15.600 --> 32:17.840]  you can do at Squarespace.
[32:17.840 --> 32:19.880]  A portfolio, like if you're a designer
[32:19.880 --> 32:21.480]  and you wanna have a site like that,
[32:21.480 --> 32:25.800]  a blog, host a podcast and not just get it set up,
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.760]  but as you post new content, blog updates,
[32:28.760 --> 32:32.320]  new episodes of a podcast, all goes through Squarespace.
[32:32.320 --> 32:33.760]  It's not like, oh, you set up Squarespace,
[32:33.760 --> 32:35.040]  but then you gotta set up WordPress
[32:35.040 --> 32:36.920]  or something like that to get a blog going.
[32:36.920 --> 32:37.800]  No, you could do it all.
[32:37.800 --> 32:40.600]  Squarespace has all of that built in.
[32:40.600 --> 32:45.160]  They have a ton of professionally designed templates
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.640]  to start with for the design.
[32:47.640 --> 32:50.600]  And all of them work great.
[32:50.600 --> 32:52.400]  They're responsive design, so they work great.
[32:52.400 --> 32:56.200]  They'd scale to phones, to tablets, to giant 27-inch IMAX.
[32:57.080 --> 33:00.600]  And you can customize them to the nth degree
[33:01.720 --> 33:05.120]  to make the branding look like your company,
[33:05.120 --> 33:07.480]  your personal brand, the way you want it to look,
[33:07.480 --> 33:10.280]  a restaurant or something like that, make it look like that.
[33:10.280 --> 33:12.360]  All of that you can do through Squarespace.
[33:12.360 --> 33:14.280]  Everything looks professionally designed.
[33:14.280 --> 33:16.360]  Everything is really easy and wizzy wig.
[33:16.360 --> 33:18.520]  You just do it right there in the browser
[33:18.520 --> 33:20.360]  and you wanna move something from the left to the right,
[33:20.360 --> 33:22.120]  you just drag it from the left to the right
[33:22.120 --> 33:24.080]  and no coding required.
[33:24.080 --> 33:26.320]  You could do everything from the domain names
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.160]  to content updates.
[33:28.160 --> 33:31.480]  And best of all, you can start with a free trial

[33:53.600 --> 33:56.620]  My thanks to Squarespace for their long time
[33:56.620 --> 33:58.560]  and continuing support of this podcast.
[34:00.560 --> 34:01.920]  I was not there this year,
[34:01.920 --> 34:04.400]  but I've been to a couple at the Steve Jobs Theater
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.480]  and it is-
[34:05.480 --> 34:06.640]  The wifi was great.
[34:06.640 --> 34:07.960]  The wifi was great, yeah.
[34:09.160 --> 34:10.520]  You know what I think they really,
[34:10.520 --> 34:15.520]  I feel like they flex those muscles the most at WWDC
[34:16.840 --> 34:20.080]  because the WWDC keynote, unlike the Steve Jobs Theater
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.660]  is truly in like an arena sized room.
[34:23.660 --> 34:24.840]  It's massive.
[34:24.840 --> 34:27.080]  There's like 5,000 people in the room
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.640]  and if they can keep wifi up then,
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.160]  then they can definitely keep it up
[34:31.160 --> 34:33.480]  for a bunch of live blogging,
[34:33.480 --> 34:36.200]  a hundred live blogging journalists.
[34:36.200 --> 34:37.700]  Yeah, I mean, it's like the wifi is the thing
[34:37.700 --> 34:40.680]  you complain about when you really, I mean,
[34:40.680 --> 34:43.680]  I just complain endlessly when it's bad,
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.520]  but then when it's good, I forget to say how good it is.
[34:46.520 --> 34:48.680]  So it was really good.
[34:48.680 --> 34:50.960]  Do you, were you at the event years ago?
[34:50.960 --> 34:54.460]  I mean, obviously it's probably like 10,
[34:54.460 --> 34:56.280]  by definition it's like 10 years ago
[34:56.280 --> 34:59.600]  or close to 10 years ago when Steve Jobs interrupted
[34:59.600 --> 35:02.160]  the keynote because their wifi
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.260]  for the demos on stage was broken.
[35:04.260 --> 35:08.780]  Do you remember what product announcement it was?
[35:08.780 --> 35:09.900]  I don't remember.
[35:09.900 --> 35:11.260]  I have to put it in the show notes,
[35:11.260 --> 35:12.500]  but there was a keynote.
[35:12.500 --> 35:14.940]  It was probably a Mac world expo keynote.
[35:14.940 --> 35:16.340]  I don't think it was WWDC,
[35:16.340 --> 35:19.460]  but they had tried to demo something on stage
[35:19.460 --> 35:22.860]  that required wifi and the demo failed
[35:22.860 --> 35:27.060]  and they tried again and Jobs,
[35:27.060 --> 35:30.460]  in addition to being so good on stage in so many ways,
[35:30.460 --> 35:32.420]  he was also good at like dealing
[35:32.420 --> 35:34.340]  with the demo failure on stage.
[35:34.340 --> 35:37.100]  And he handled it gracefully and turned it into a joke
[35:37.100 --> 35:39.860]  and then handed over the segment to somebody else
[35:39.860 --> 35:42.340]  for the next part of the thing and was off stage.
[35:42.340 --> 35:45.260]  And you can only imagine his fury backstage.
[35:45.260 --> 35:47.300]  And he came back on stage and said something
[35:47.300 --> 35:49.180]  to the effect of, I talked to my tech people
[35:49.180 --> 35:51.680]  and they figured out why this failed.
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.220]  You people, and he like looks at the media section,
[35:55.220 --> 35:59.040]  he said, there's 337 cellular networks.
[35:59.040 --> 36:01.460]  And this was long enough ago where the,
[36:01.460 --> 36:03.260]  you'd remember those things you'd buy
[36:03.260 --> 36:07.100]  like a little portable cellular hotspot.
[36:07.100 --> 36:08.540]  You weren't tethered through your phone.
[36:08.540 --> 36:10.420]  It was like a dedicated device.
[36:10.420 --> 36:12.940]  I would show up to events with like two of those sometimes.
[36:12.940 --> 36:16.500]  Right, or like, if it was a publication,
[36:16.500 --> 36:19.260]  like I guess at the time and gadget or whatever,
[36:19.260 --> 36:21.100]  and there were three or four people there
[36:21.100 --> 36:23.380]  that you guys would have one that the whole team could share
[36:23.380 --> 36:24.940]  but Jobs said-
[36:24.940 --> 36:26.380]  We would all have our own
[36:26.380 --> 36:27.460]  because we were so worried
[36:27.460 --> 36:31.740]  and we would bring multiple networks.
[36:31.740 --> 36:33.900]  We'd bring like one from Verizon, one from AT&T,
[36:33.900 --> 36:36.340]  one for T-Mobile or whatever sprint at the time
[36:36.340 --> 36:38.860]  because we were worried that we wouldn't have,
[36:38.860 --> 36:41.540]  one of the networks could be saturated in the room.
[36:41.540 --> 36:44.060]  Well, that's why there were 300 of them, I guess.
[36:44.060 --> 36:46.940]  And Jobs was like, so if you want this to go on,
[36:46.940 --> 36:48.780]  you wanna see the demo, turn them off.
[36:48.780 --> 36:50.260]  I want everybody to turn them off.
[36:50.260 --> 36:51.940]  I want everybody to shut your laptop.
[36:51.940 --> 36:54.780]  If somebody next to you has their laptop open,
[36:54.780 --> 36:56.620]  give them a hard time, make them shut it down.
[36:56.620 --> 36:59.180]  And everybody in, some of the people in the media section
[36:59.180 --> 37:01.460]  like did it and, but most didn't.
[37:01.460 --> 37:02.700]  Everybody just sort of like-
[37:02.700 --> 37:03.860]  Yeah, I would've been like, no.
[37:03.860 --> 37:07.220]  Just kept plowing ahead and the demo did work then.
[37:07.220 --> 37:09.100]  So I don't know if that was actually the problem or not,
[37:09.100 --> 37:10.940]  but it was a very uncomfortable moment.
[37:10.940 --> 37:14.340]  And it's kind of hard to imagine that happening today
[37:14.340 --> 37:19.340]  because they've just gotten so much more,
[37:19.340 --> 37:22.020]  it's just hard to imagine a modern Apple keynote
[37:22.020 --> 37:24.700]  going ad-libbed like that, right?
[37:24.700 --> 37:26.460]  It's so true.
[37:26.460 --> 37:29.260]  It actually would be very funny to imagine.
[37:29.260 --> 37:31.140]  Like they don't have their teleprompter to read
[37:31.140 --> 37:36.140]  and they're like, it's got a focus pickle something,
[37:37.780 --> 37:39.740]  focus pixels.
[37:40.700 --> 37:44.180]  It was, and it was, and Jobs, everybody knew
[37:44.180 --> 37:46.060]  he didn't have to wait for his biography to come out.
[37:46.060 --> 37:48.460]  Everybody knew that he had famously in private
[37:48.460 --> 37:53.460]  could have a bad temper, could be irascible.
[37:53.460 --> 37:57.380]  His on-stage demeanor was always pleasant
[37:57.380 --> 38:00.020]  and he had something to sell and he's in public,
[38:00.020 --> 38:03.500]  but it was like a moment where we in the real world
[38:03.500 --> 38:05.700]  could sort of see angry Steve.
[38:07.140 --> 38:09.860]  It was, I will put it in the show notes,
[38:09.860 --> 38:12.140]  it's not worth looking up now mid-show,
[38:12.140 --> 38:15.100]  but it was, and in hindsight, boy, that really sticks out
[38:15.100 --> 38:18.340]  as boy, it was a different era for Apple back then.
[38:18.340 --> 38:20.100]  Yeah, I mean, but like you also do here,
[38:20.100 --> 38:22.180]  like just kind of in passing
[38:22.180 --> 38:23.500]  when you talk to the executives
[38:23.500 --> 38:25.260]  and you hear the executives talking before
[38:25.260 --> 38:30.140]  or after the keynote that like they practice so much
[38:30.140 --> 38:33.980]  and they think so, I mean, they've got heavy edits
[38:33.980 --> 38:35.580]  going into this.
[38:35.580 --> 38:37.940]  The first thing that I sometimes ask actually
[38:37.940 --> 38:39.900]  after when we go to meet with some of the executives
[38:39.900 --> 38:40.900]  is what's the number one thing
[38:40.900 --> 38:43.860]  you couldn't have talked about on stage that you wanted to?
[38:44.980 --> 38:47.300]  I actually ask that always after WWDC
[38:47.300 --> 38:49.820]  because to me, some of the most interesting features
[38:49.820 --> 38:51.580]  that come in iOS, they don't talk about.
[38:51.580 --> 38:56.420]  Yeah, yeah, I should remember to ask that question.
[38:56.420 --> 39:00.380]  No, I mean, and it actually puts them on the spot
[39:00.380 --> 39:03.020]  because they're like, oh, I think it was in the one draft
[39:03.020 --> 39:05.140]  that we had this, but then we had to cut it for timing.
[39:05.140 --> 39:09.020]  I mean, like it is a very heavily edited show
[39:09.020 --> 39:11.700]  and they practice, God, I mean,
[39:11.700 --> 39:13.940]  also I tend to sometimes work on some stories
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.340]  going into some of this stuff
[39:15.340 --> 39:16.900]  and if you wanna get in touch with executives
[39:16.900 --> 39:19.100]  or you wanna get in touch with someone from PR
[39:19.100 --> 39:21.540]  to answer questions or get statements,
[39:21.540 --> 39:23.980]  they're like, no, no, everyone here is focused 100%
[39:23.980 --> 39:26.940]  on the show or on the presentation.
[39:30.220 --> 39:33.380]  I linked to it, I think shortly after the event,
[39:33.380 --> 39:36.140]  but there was somebody had an interesting,
[39:36.140 --> 39:37.260]  I forget where they posted it,
[39:37.260 --> 39:38.940]  but it was somebody who used to work on,
[39:38.940 --> 39:42.020]  I think Guitar Hero or one of those games
[39:42.020 --> 39:43.940]  in the early era of the iPhone.
[39:45.140 --> 39:49.300]  And it was like, what is it like to demo at an Apple keynote
[39:49.300 --> 39:52.500]  as like a third party invited company up there?
[39:52.500 --> 39:54.020]  And I've heard this before from other people
[39:54.020 --> 39:57.180]  who were invited that Apple calls you
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.860]  and doesn't quite tell you that that's what they're thinking
[40:01.860 --> 40:04.620]  but that you might be in the keynote,
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.260]  but you can kind of read between the lines
[40:06.260 --> 40:08.460]  and then they want you to fly to Cupertino
[40:08.460 --> 40:11.780]  and then you sign an NDA and like sign your life away
[40:11.780 --> 40:16.780]  and then you go into like an isolation chamber for days
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.580]  because they might have you demo your software,
[40:21.580 --> 40:24.940]  whether it's an app or a game or whatever,
[40:24.940 --> 40:26.980]  but you're actually using the new hardware.
[40:26.980 --> 40:30.180]  So now you've seen this secret new hardware
[40:30.180 --> 40:33.260]  so that they've got you in like rooms without wifi
[40:33.260 --> 40:34.100]  and stuff like that.
[40:34.100 --> 40:36.420]  But you don't know if you're actually gonna be on stage
[40:36.420 --> 40:39.740]  and like you go to these rehearsals and you rehearse
[40:39.740 --> 40:41.580]  and you rehearse and you rehearse
[40:41.580 --> 40:43.420]  and you don't really find out
[40:43.420 --> 40:44.980]  until like sometimes the night before,
[40:44.980 --> 40:47.460]  sometimes the morning of whether you're actually going
[40:47.460 --> 40:50.180]  to make the cut and be one of the demos on stage.
[40:50.180 --> 40:53.020]  So there's usually, who knows?
[40:53.020 --> 40:55.180]  And we don't really know how many times
[40:55.180 --> 40:56.540]  because everybody signs NDAs
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.980]  and I guess they wanna stick to them
[40:57.980 --> 40:59.860]  and they wanna stay in Apple's good graces
[40:59.860 --> 41:01.260]  because they work for these companies
[41:01.260 --> 41:02.380]  that partner with them.
[41:02.380 --> 41:05.860]  But there's a very high likelihood
[41:05.860 --> 41:07.060]  that every one of these keynotes,
[41:07.060 --> 41:09.620]  there's some number of people backstage
[41:09.620 --> 41:12.180]  who've spent the last week rehearsing
[41:12.180 --> 41:14.540]  and didn't even get to come on stage.
[41:14.540 --> 41:17.500]  That's another like short documentary I wanna watch.
[41:17.500 --> 41:18.900]  Right, I would love-
[41:18.900 --> 41:21.420]  The sorrow, the sorrow that those people feel,
[41:21.420 --> 41:23.100]  the deep sorrow when they're like,
[41:23.100 --> 41:25.580]  oh no, sorry, you're not gonna be on stage.
[41:25.580 --> 41:28.700]  But the story of this guy demoing the game was so funny
[41:28.700 --> 41:31.180]  because to paraphrase it,
[41:31.180 --> 41:34.460]  it was like he was nervous and his hands were sticky
[41:34.460 --> 41:37.060]  and because his hands were sweaty,
[41:37.060 --> 41:40.060]  it's like he wasn't doing a good job with the iPhone
[41:40.060 --> 41:42.300]  and he was like practicing during the keynote,
[41:43.340 --> 41:44.340]  like the keynotes going on,
[41:44.340 --> 41:46.500]  he's getting ready to go on and he's practicing the game
[41:46.500 --> 41:50.860]  and it's like, I think it was guitar,
[41:50.860 --> 41:51.740]  but whatever the game is,
[41:51.740 --> 41:55.260]  you'd finish a level and get like one through five stars
[41:55.260 --> 41:56.540]  and he only got four stars
[41:56.540 --> 41:57.900]  even though he worked for the company.
[41:57.900 --> 42:00.060]  And someone for Apple came up and said,
[42:01.020 --> 42:03.460]  Steve would like you to get five stars.
[42:03.460 --> 42:08.460]  And then it was like, Apple isn't really a four star company.
[42:08.460 --> 42:10.500]  And the poor guy is like, I can't.
[42:10.500 --> 42:11.820]  Yeah, but for whatever reason,
[42:11.820 --> 42:15.060]  and this gets to last week's event,
[42:15.060 --> 42:18.100]  for whatever reason, when Apple demos things like games,
[42:18.100 --> 42:20.100]  they really do play,
[42:20.100 --> 42:22.940]  they have the people play them live on stage
[42:22.940 --> 42:26.420]  and they always have done this, they did it last week.
[42:26.420 --> 42:28.380]  And I kind of think that's a little weird
[42:28.380 --> 42:32.660]  and I don't think it is a great use of time.
[42:34.060 --> 42:36.180]  Like I thought that this was a great use of time
[42:36.180 --> 42:40.860]  like I thought that that Frogger demo during the event
[42:40.860 --> 42:45.860]  was bizarrely long and is Frogger really
[42:45.860 --> 42:47.700]  and now that Apple Arcade is out
[42:47.700 --> 42:48.620]  and we see all these titles,
[42:48.620 --> 42:50.540]  it doesn't seem to me like anybody,
[42:50.540 --> 42:52.620]  I haven't spent any time with that.
[42:52.620 --> 42:54.100]  I haven't even signed up for Apple Arcade yet.
[42:54.100 --> 42:56.220]  I've been too busy with other stuff,
[42:57.100 --> 42:59.900]  but I have been following like people's initial reactions
[42:59.900 --> 43:02.500]  now that if you've upgraded to iOS 13,
[43:02.500 --> 43:04.780]  you can sign up for Apple Arcade and people are saying,
[43:04.780 --> 43:08.060]  here's the initial batch of games and what's exciting.
[43:08.060 --> 43:12.020]  I haven't seen anybody saying anything about Frogger yet.
[43:12.020 --> 43:14.060]  Meanwhile, in the actual keynote,
[43:14.060 --> 43:17.100]  they spent what seemed to me like it wasn't 10 minutes,
[43:17.100 --> 43:22.100]  but it felt like 10 minutes of like somebody playing Frogger.
[43:23.980 --> 43:27.300]  I felt like that, hey, here's what you can be excited about
[43:27.300 --> 43:29.940]  with Apple Arcade would have been a lot better
[43:29.940 --> 43:34.380]  if it was a tightly edited video of here's one minute
[43:34.380 --> 43:38.020]  of the best of what's gonna be on Apple Arcade
[43:38.020 --> 43:39.300]  and just show a video.
[43:39.300 --> 43:41.820]  I don't know why they make people play games live on stage.
[43:41.820 --> 43:45.540]  It's just not compelling to me.
[43:45.540 --> 43:49.700]  But for my sake, I hope they do not cut the demos times down
[43:49.700 --> 43:53.000]  because it gives me a time to break and rest and write.
[43:54.180 --> 43:56.260]  Not that I'm not paying attention during the demos.
[43:56.260 --> 43:58.380]  I'm not paying attention to the demos, honestly.
[43:58.380 --> 44:00.220]  I'm never paying attention much during the demos.
[44:00.220 --> 44:01.300]  I'm like, oh, okay, a moment.
[44:01.300 --> 44:02.580]  I can write down what I need to do.
[44:02.580 --> 44:05.180]  Like, I'm like, okay, let me take, what just happened there?
[44:05.180 --> 44:06.740]  That is a good point.
[44:06.740 --> 44:11.140]  So please, I think the demos are built in again for me.
[44:11.140 --> 44:14.240]  The entire event is about me.
[44:14.240 --> 44:16.000]  Apple, if you listen to this,
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.700]  continue to do these things for me.
[44:17.700 --> 44:21.960]  Good Wi-Fi for me, the demos built in for me.
[44:23.140 --> 44:24.420]  The ones that I always think of,
[44:24.420 --> 44:25.900]  because they do it all the time,
[44:25.900 --> 44:29.500]  is they wanna show off the graphical prowess
[44:29.500 --> 44:31.020]  of an iOS device, right?
[44:31.020 --> 44:32.880]  Whether it's the iPhone or whether it's the iPad.
[44:32.880 --> 44:34.420]  And so they'll have somebody come out
[44:34.420 --> 44:35.780]  from some game developer
[44:35.780 --> 44:40.780]  and have some kind of 3D first-person hyper-rendered game
[44:41.180 --> 44:43.500]  where there's a hero with a sword.
[44:43.500 --> 44:46.020]  And it's like, for all I know,
[44:46.020 --> 44:47.860]  they keep showing the same thing over and over again,
[44:47.860 --> 44:49.820]  because that's exactly when I go heads down
[44:49.820 --> 44:51.620]  and start writing notes
[44:51.620 --> 44:54.460]  and go back over the last five minutes.
[44:54.460 --> 44:58.540]  Because they take forever and I have no interest in it.
[44:58.540 --> 45:01.100]  It's like, I get it, it looks visually impressive
[45:01.100 --> 45:03.040]  and you're getting 60 frames per second with this thing,
[45:03.040 --> 45:06.340]  but I don't need to watch this as it happens.
[45:06.340 --> 45:07.860]  Yep.
[45:07.860 --> 45:10.020]  It's always some guy with a sword,
[45:10.020 --> 45:13.980]  slashing at a demon or a monster, a dragon or something.
[45:13.980 --> 45:14.820]  I don't know, who cares?
[45:14.820 --> 45:16.640]  And then there's like a few moments built in
[45:16.640 --> 45:18.480]  to how they got to use Apple's tools.
[45:18.480 --> 45:20.580]  And it's great, it's a great rest moment for me.
[45:20.580 --> 45:22.680]  So, yeah.
[45:22.680 --> 45:23.980]  Yeah, yeah, I don't care.
[45:23.980 --> 45:28.980]  What about the actual iPhones?
[45:29.540 --> 45:31.060]  I guess we should talk about them.
[45:31.060 --> 45:31.900]  I guess we should.
[45:31.900 --> 45:36.340]  I've just been so deep with these iPhones all week.
[45:36.340 --> 45:39.120]  It's funny, last night, my son, I'd barely been home.
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.300]  And when I have been home, I'm like testing cameras.
[45:42.300 --> 45:45.420]  And last night before he's going to bed,
[45:45.420 --> 45:48.300]  he just says, what did he say?
[45:49.180 --> 45:51.180]  Dark, dark, dark.
[45:51.180 --> 45:53.420]  And he's screaming at me,
[45:53.420 --> 45:55.100]  lights out, lights out dark.
[45:55.100 --> 45:56.020]  And I'm like, what?
[45:56.020 --> 45:58.780]  And he's looking at the phone and he says, more phones.
[46:00.100 --> 46:02.980]  And I'm putting it to sleep and I'm like, you're right.
[46:02.980 --> 46:06.380]  We did do test photography and here are two nights ago,
[46:06.380 --> 46:07.700]  I turned out the lights,
[46:07.700 --> 46:10.640]  I took a picture of him and the dog
[46:10.640 --> 46:12.960]  with five different phones, Pixel,
[46:12.960 --> 46:16.640]  two of the iPhones, Samsung phone.
[46:16.640 --> 46:18.460]  And he just keeps now asking
[46:18.460 --> 46:21.780]  every time he sees the iPhone, I tweeted it.
[46:21.780 --> 46:26.780]  He said, yeah, dark or something, lights off, lights off,
[46:27.340 --> 46:28.180]  lights off.
[46:30.780 --> 46:33.140]  That's just a glimpse into like how my life goes
[46:33.140 --> 46:33.980]  for this week.
[46:33.980 --> 46:35.780]  And every time he sees me now,
[46:35.780 --> 46:38.060]  he's like, mommy working, mommy working.
[46:38.060 --> 46:40.120]  And I'm like, this is just killer.
[46:40.120 --> 46:42.140]  Yeah, in the dark, in the dark is what he said.
[46:42.140 --> 46:43.140]  In the dark, in the dark.
[46:43.140 --> 46:44.180]  And he turned off the lights.
[46:44.180 --> 46:46.980]  And yeah, so he's a good tester now.
[46:48.420 --> 46:50.020]  So have you been continuing to test
[46:50.020 --> 46:54.260]  after the initial, our reviews dropped on Tuesday morning.
[46:54.260 --> 46:56.180]  Yeah, have you been continuing to test like the camera
[46:56.180 --> 46:57.820]  and stuff like that?
[46:57.820 --> 47:00.080]  No, but it's always for me,
[47:00.080 --> 47:01.660]  like after the pressure of the reviews
[47:01.660 --> 47:05.000]  over what phone I choose to use as my main phone
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.140]  is like the test for me.
[47:07.140 --> 47:10.900]  And like last year, after all was said and done,
[47:10.900 --> 47:14.220]  I ended up using the XS for a couple of weeks,
[47:14.220 --> 47:17.360]  then till the XR came out and then use the XR loaner phone
[47:17.360 --> 47:19.260]  and then ended up buying XR.
[47:19.260 --> 47:22.300]  And this year it's like automatically back to the 11.
[47:22.300 --> 47:25.900]  Yeah, 11 big or 11 small?
[47:25.900 --> 47:28.580]  Just 11, the iPhone 11, no pro.
[47:28.580 --> 47:31.260]  Oh, so like the new XR thing.
[47:31.260 --> 47:32.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:32.220 --> 47:33.540]  And I was shocked about it
[47:33.540 --> 47:36.280]  because I was really torn during the review testing.
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.840]  Was I gonna get, was I really,
[47:38.840 --> 47:40.740]  did I think I need to go to the 11 Pro
[47:40.740 --> 47:44.140]  or was I gonna just get the 11 or not,
[47:44.140 --> 47:45.980]  not upgrade the XR?
[47:45.980 --> 47:48.460]  Because I'm thinking I'm gonna give the XR to my wife
[47:48.460 --> 47:50.380]  and then buy a new one this year
[47:50.380 --> 47:52.580]  and just get myself into the upgrade program
[47:52.580 --> 47:55.020]  because I just need to do that probably.
[47:55.020 --> 47:57.860]  It is a phenomenal phone.
[47:57.860 --> 48:02.860]  And it is, if anything, Apple's base model pricing
[48:04.080 --> 48:08.620]  disguises how much of a value the regular iPhone 11 is.
[48:08.620 --> 48:11.300]  Because my recommendation for anybody
[48:11.300 --> 48:14.300]  would be not to buy the base model.
[48:14.300 --> 48:18.140]  64 gigabytes is just not enough storage.
[48:18.140 --> 48:20.540]  And I look, it's like one of the ways,
[48:20.540 --> 48:23.660]  one of the things I do with family members and my wife
[48:23.660 --> 48:25.540]  is I like to, I'll see like, hey,
[48:25.540 --> 48:28.100]  how much storage does a typical person use?
[48:28.100 --> 48:30.020]  Like what is my mom's phone?
[48:30.020 --> 48:33.580]  Like my mom got one, has had one iPhone in her entire life.
[48:33.580 --> 48:35.040]  I forget how many years old it is now.
[48:35.040 --> 48:37.300]  It's like maybe like three years old, I don't know.
[48:37.300 --> 48:39.740]  She was, she didn't want one until like three years.
[48:39.740 --> 48:42.260]  She didn't want one until she got hooked on iMessage
[48:42.260 --> 48:43.100]  on her iPad.
[48:43.100 --> 48:44.900]  And then she's like, would I get that on my phone?
[48:44.900 --> 48:45.720]  And I was like, yes.
[48:45.720 --> 48:46.620]  And she's like, I need that.
[48:46.620 --> 48:49.260]  And I was like, all right.
[48:49.260 --> 48:51.620]  64 gigabytes is just not a good value.
[48:51.620 --> 48:55.980]  And with the 11, you can spend just 50 bucks more
[48:55.980 --> 48:58.740]  and get one with 128 gigabytes, which
[48:58.740 --> 49:00.700]  is plenty for most people.
[49:00.700 --> 49:02.780]  Like just looking at like my wife's phone
[49:02.780 --> 49:04.200]  and other people's phones, it seems
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.020]  like 64 is pretty tight just with photos, right?
[49:07.020 --> 49:08.840]  Like photos and iMessage attachments
[49:08.840 --> 49:10.540]  take up most of the space.
[49:10.540 --> 49:12.100]  And 128 is plenty.
[49:12.100 --> 49:14.620]  Like it just seems like typical iPhone users often
[49:14.620 --> 49:17.780]  have somewhere around 64 gigabytes of stuff stored.
[49:17.780 --> 49:19.700]  And so if you have 128 on the device,
[49:19.700 --> 49:20.700]  you have plenty of room.
[49:20.700 --> 49:22.140]  50 bucks.
[49:22.140 --> 49:22.640]  But if you.
[49:22.640 --> 49:24.060]  Yeah, I didn't even make that point.
[49:24.060 --> 49:25.220]  I should have made this point.
[49:25.220 --> 49:28.540]  If you, I don't think I examined it enough.
[49:28.540 --> 49:33.820]  In the, if you, and then on, but on the catch
[49:33.820 --> 49:38.620]  is that if you go with a Pro, there is no 128 gigabyte option.
[49:38.620 --> 49:41.020]  You have to go all the way to 256.
[49:41.020 --> 49:44.340]  And it's $150 over the base model.
[49:44.340 --> 49:48.700]  So to me, the phones that most people should be looking at
[49:48.700 --> 49:52.940]  are the 256 gigabyte models if you're looking at a Pro.
[49:52.940 --> 49:56.500]  And the, because, not because you need 256,
[49:56.500 --> 50:00.500]  but because 64 is not enough, and there is no 128,
[50:00.500 --> 50:03.660]  and the 128 is perfect for just about anybody.
[50:03.660 --> 50:06.060]  You know, just go check your settings, general iPhone
[50:06.060 --> 50:08.900]  storage, and if you're over 128, well, then, you know,
[50:08.900 --> 50:09.900]  look at something bigger.
[50:09.900 --> 50:12.860]  But you're probably well under, get that one.
[50:12.860 --> 50:13.980]  It's only 50 bucks more.
[50:13.980 --> 50:16.580]  And that's a $400 price difference
[50:16.580 --> 50:20.980]  between the 128 gigabyte iPhone 11
[50:20.980 --> 50:24.420]  and the 256 11 Pro, 400 bucks.
[50:24.420 --> 50:25.860]  I did not even think about this.
[50:25.860 --> 50:28.500]  I mean, first of all, I do think that for some people,
[50:28.500 --> 50:32.580]  64 is enough, especially if you're playing for iCloud.
[50:32.580 --> 50:35.540]  If you're playing for iCloud photo, you're probably okay
[50:35.540 --> 50:36.780]  if you're like the average person
[50:36.780 --> 50:37.940]  who doesn't take a million photos.
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.820]  I take a million photos, so.
[50:39.820 --> 50:41.740]  It's easy to find out, check your settings.
[50:41.740 --> 50:45.340]  And if you're well under 64, then go get the 64, you know.
[50:45.340 --> 50:49.580]  Yeah, but the 128, you're right, is $750.
[50:50.940 --> 50:55.180]  And then versus the Pro, which I would need to go up to.
[50:55.180 --> 50:56.380]  1150.
[50:56.380 --> 50:58.220]  1150.
[50:58.220 --> 50:59.180]  That's a lot of money.
[50:59.180 --> 51:04.180]  I mean, it's literally more than a 50% difference
[51:04.780 --> 51:08.380]  because, you know, $800 versus 1200 would be exactly,
[51:08.380 --> 51:10.060]  you know, 1.5 times as much,
[51:10.060 --> 51:15.060]  but 1150 is actually more than 1.5 times as much as the 750.
[51:15.740 --> 51:17.380]  It's such a great value.
[51:17.380 --> 51:22.380]  And it's got the same great regular camera
[51:23.100 --> 51:25.940]  and most people I know only shoot with the regular camera.
[51:25.940 --> 51:27.940]  I know people, I was talking to,
[51:27.940 --> 51:29.740]  chatting with a guy who works at Apple,
[51:29.740 --> 51:32.860]  literally worked at Apple as an engineer, very smart,
[51:33.820 --> 51:36.980]  recently left and he's just been a friend,
[51:36.980 --> 51:39.180]  you know, like an iMessage friend for years.
[51:39.180 --> 51:43.660]  He literally didn't realize his iPhone XS had two cameras.
[51:43.660 --> 51:45.460]  And I was like, what did you think?
[51:45.460 --> 51:46.500]  He didn't realize.
[51:46.500 --> 51:47.980]  He just, you know, he knew it could zoom,
[51:47.980 --> 51:50.780]  but he didn't really realize that it was two cameras.
[51:50.780 --> 51:52.780]  And this is somebody who worked at Apple.
[51:54.940 --> 51:58.780]  I looked at my wife's, I did like a thing where I,
[51:58.780 --> 52:00.180]  you know, with her permission,
[52:00.180 --> 52:03.820]  I went in and looked at my wife's photos
[52:03.820 --> 52:07.300]  that she's taken with her XS over the last,
[52:07.300 --> 52:09.500]  and 10, she had a 10 two years ago.
[52:09.500 --> 52:11.940]  So she's had two years with a camera with dual lenses.
[52:11.940 --> 52:13.940]  And I looked through her photos
[52:13.940 --> 52:17.020]  and she never uses anything other than the one X lens.
[52:17.020 --> 52:17.980]  And the Y, yeah.
[52:17.980 --> 52:20.340]  I mean, there might be like one or two where she-
[52:20.340 --> 52:21.900]  I'm really, my bigger question is like,
[52:21.900 --> 52:23.060]  what were you worried you were gonna find
[52:23.060 --> 52:24.540]  that I wanna ask that on the podcast?
[52:24.540 --> 52:28.500]  I wasn't worried, I just, you know, it's just being polite.
[52:28.500 --> 52:29.940]  Privacy, privacy, yeah.
[52:29.940 --> 52:32.420]  It's respect, it's respect for, you know.
[52:32.420 --> 52:34.020]  It just turned out there were just all these photos
[52:34.020 --> 52:34.860]  of you sleeping.
[52:34.860 --> 52:35.700]  Yeah.
[52:35.700 --> 52:36.540]  No.
[52:37.380 --> 52:41.100]  Shot at one X, only shot at one X, why no zoom?
[52:41.100 --> 52:41.940]  Why no zoom there?
[52:41.940 --> 52:44.620]  Right, so I really think that not having the telephoto
[52:44.620 --> 52:47.200]  is not a big deal for most people.
[52:47.200 --> 52:49.260]  And if you're only zooming in a little,
[52:49.260 --> 52:51.660]  like the equivalent of two X,
[52:52.860 --> 52:56.140]  the digital zoom is so good these days.
[52:56.140 --> 52:59.020]  I think that in a lot of lighting conditions,
[52:59.020 --> 53:00.540]  it would be very hard, you know,
[53:00.540 --> 53:01.700]  like Nilay could tell,
[53:01.700 --> 53:03.700]  because Nilay has razor sharp eyes
[53:03.700 --> 53:06.820]  and really, really is keenly aware of like
[53:06.820 --> 53:10.100]  the 100% level pixel, you know, noise and stuff like that.
[53:10.100 --> 53:11.020]  But for most people,
[53:11.020 --> 53:12.540]  especially if you're only looking at your pictures
[53:12.540 --> 53:15.540]  on your phone, doing this without the optical zoom
[53:15.540 --> 53:16.800]  of having a telephoto lens,
[53:16.800 --> 53:19.740]  just pinching out a little bit to zoom in a little bit
[53:19.740 --> 53:20.980]  will look just fine.
[53:20.980 --> 53:23.300]  It's a great camera for most people.
[53:24.260 --> 53:27.820]  I think the screen is just terrific.
[53:27.820 --> 53:29.140]  Nilay and I talked about this.
[53:29.140 --> 53:30.900]  I actually think that at nighttime,
[53:30.900 --> 53:35.800]  the color of the LCD iPhone 11 display
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.420]  looks better than the Pro.
[53:39.420 --> 53:40.260]  I really do.
[53:40.260 --> 53:42.340]  I think it does whites better.
[53:42.340 --> 53:46.020]  Because OLED has the weird way that OLED works
[53:46.020 --> 53:49.780]  with the sub pixels is really, really strange.
[53:49.780 --> 53:53.820]  And it's why for years before Apple had an OLED screen
[53:53.820 --> 53:56.820]  and the early years of Android phones with OLED screens
[53:56.820 --> 53:58.620]  had really wacky colors.
[53:58.620 --> 54:01.140]  I mean, it was like, you know, really vibrant
[54:01.140 --> 54:03.240]  and almost neon colored stuff
[54:03.240 --> 54:04.980]  that wasn't supposed to be neon colored
[54:04.980 --> 54:06.320]  because OLED is weird.
[54:06.320 --> 54:08.700]  Whereas the LCD, it's just RGB,
[54:08.700 --> 54:11.080]  red, green, blue for every pixel.
[54:11.980 --> 54:14.900]  I actually think at nighttime that the iPhone 11 screen
[54:14.900 --> 54:17.520]  for a white background, which is what a lot of people do.
[54:17.520 --> 54:18.980]  You're using messages.
[54:18.980 --> 54:21.740]  If you're not in dark mode, you're reading email,
[54:21.740 --> 54:24.980]  you're doing stuff like that with a white background.
[54:24.980 --> 54:26.360]  I think it looks better.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.020]  It's a great value.
[54:28.020 --> 54:30.100]  Yeah, I mean, now also that you put together
[54:30.100 --> 54:32.420]  that pricing thought for me,
[54:32.420 --> 54:34.940]  like, am I really gonna pay that much more
[54:34.940 --> 54:36.660]  for the telephoto lens?
[54:36.660 --> 54:38.900]  I did, because I'm an idiot, but.
[54:38.900 --> 54:40.680]  I know, you're you, you know.
[54:40.680 --> 54:45.100]  But I can tell, I really do mean it sincerely.
[54:45.100 --> 54:47.140]  And I think it's even stronger than last year.
[54:47.140 --> 54:48.980]  Like last year, there was a strong consensus
[54:48.980 --> 54:52.140]  among reviewers that, hey, the XR is the iPhone,
[54:52.140 --> 54:54.140]  the new iPhone for most people.
[54:54.140 --> 54:55.520]  I think it's even stronger this year
[54:55.520 --> 54:58.020]  that the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for most people.
[54:58.020 --> 55:01.620]  And I think just calling it the iPhone 11 on Apple's part
[55:01.620 --> 55:03.020]  shows that they agree.
[55:03.020 --> 55:04.660]  Yeah, I think that's the question for me
[55:04.660 --> 55:05.980]  is am I most people?
[55:05.980 --> 55:06.980]  And I think I am.
[55:06.980 --> 55:09.220]  I think I've just realized I'm most people.
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.220]  Yeah.
[55:10.220 --> 55:11.540]  I mean, also the battery life.
[55:11.540 --> 55:12.540]  For me, when I did this,
[55:12.540 --> 55:15.980]  just tried to do as much battery life testing as I could,
[55:15.980 --> 55:19.620]  I think the order I really do feel certain is
[55:19.620 --> 55:21.620]  is you get the most with the max,
[55:21.620 --> 55:23.860]  then you step down a little bit to the 11
[55:23.860 --> 55:26.620]  and you get like, you know, maybe it's an hour
[55:26.620 --> 55:28.780]  or hour and a half, maybe two hours shy
[55:28.780 --> 55:30.260]  of what you would get from the max.
[55:30.260 --> 55:32.660]  And then below that is the Pro.
[55:32.660 --> 55:36.060]  And so even though I like having the telephoto on the Pro
[55:36.060 --> 55:39.980]  and the smaller size of the Pro or the 11 Pro,
[55:39.980 --> 55:41.700]  I think I'm still better
[55:41.700 --> 55:43.900]  with the longer battery life of the 11.
[55:43.900 --> 55:45.340]  Yeah.
[55:45.340 --> 55:46.180]  Let me take another break here
[55:46.180 --> 55:47.060]  and thank our next sponsor.
[55:47.060 --> 55:50.460]  It's our good friends at Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E.
[55:50.460 --> 55:52.940]  Looks like Linode, but it's pronounced Linode
[55:52.940 --> 55:56.380]  because they specialize in Linux server hosting.
[55:56.380 --> 55:58.040]  Look, you can build it on Linode.
[55:58.040 --> 56:01.340]  Dedicated CPUs, distributed applications,
[56:01.340 --> 56:03.540]  hosted services, websites,
[56:03.540 --> 56:06.840]  anything you need to build that you require a server,
[56:06.840 --> 56:08.940]  you could do it at Linode.
[56:08.940 --> 56:12.780]  Everything they offer features native SSD storage.
[56:12.780 --> 56:14.660]  All of their data centers around the world,
[56:14.660 --> 56:17.060]  and they have like 11 or 12 of them now,
[56:17.060 --> 56:22.940]  feature 40 gigabit networks and industry leading processors.
[56:22.940 --> 56:26.420]  And they have additional data centers opening all the time.
[56:26.420 --> 56:28.380]  They've just opened in Mumbai, India.
[56:28.380 --> 56:31.460]  They have one in Toronto that opened earlier this year.
[56:31.460 --> 56:34.300]  That's important, not just for you and your team.
[56:34.300 --> 56:37.060]  If you're in Canada, you wanna be closer to your server
[56:37.060 --> 56:38.620]  to get lower latency and stuff like that.
[56:38.620 --> 56:40.940]  But sometimes it's even a legal requirement
[56:40.940 --> 56:42.380]  where maybe the country you're in
[56:42.380 --> 56:45.980]  or the business you're in needs to host the data
[56:45.980 --> 56:47.920]  within the country that you're in.
[56:47.920 --> 56:51.420]  So having these 11 or 12 data centers around the world
[56:51.420 --> 56:53.140]  is a big deal.
[56:53.140 --> 56:55.080]  And here's the thing, you pay for what you use
[56:55.080 --> 56:57.880]  with hourly billing across all plans and add-on services.
[56:57.880 --> 56:59.300]  So if you only need a burst,
[56:59.300 --> 57:00.860]  let's say you have a big product announcement
[57:00.860 --> 57:02.820]  or it's a new version of something coming out
[57:02.820 --> 57:03.940]  and you have a day where you're gonna have
[57:03.940 --> 57:06.020]  excessive traffic, you can pay more
[57:06.020 --> 57:08.220]  to get more bandwidth, et cetera,
[57:08.220 --> 57:10.860]  ramp up to more processors on the day you need it,
[57:10.860 --> 57:12.980]  and then go back down to what you normally need
[57:12.980 --> 57:15.820]  automatically, it's really, really convenient.
[57:17.220 --> 57:20.080]  And they have a new cloud manager that Linode has written
[57:20.080 --> 57:23.660]  featuring an improved user interface at cloud.linode.com.
[57:23.660 --> 57:25.600]  You can go check it out.
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.360]  It's open source even.
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.900]  And really, it's just people I know who use Linode
[57:30.900 --> 57:33.460]  and developers, and I'm a customer too.
[57:33.460 --> 57:35.440]  I'm a customer and I would tell people to use it
[57:35.440 --> 57:37.520]  even if they weren't sponsoring the show.
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.800]  That's how much I like this company.
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.000]  It's headquartered right here in Philadelphia, by the way.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.520]  Their headquarters is actually the building
[57:46.520 --> 57:49.000]  that used to be the house where the real world
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.360]  Philadelphia was shot, just a little behind the scenes stuff.
[57:52.360 --> 57:54.060]  Anyway, for listeners of the show,
[57:54.060 --> 57:56.000]  if you need web hosting and you're interested
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.420]  in trying this out, they've got a phenomenal deal for you.
[57:59.420 --> 58:03.720]  Use the promo code TALKSHOW2019, all one word, no space.
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.640]  TALKSHOW2019, and you get $20 a credit.
[58:07.640 --> 58:10.280]  Their hosting starts at just five bucks a month,
[58:10.280 --> 58:13.460]  and the five bucks a month plan is totally credible,
[58:13.460 --> 58:15.800]  very usable for a lot of things.
[58:15.800 --> 58:18.060]  So you could get four months of free service
[58:18.060 --> 58:21.040]  right off the bat just by going to linode.com
[58:21.040 --> 58:22.880]  slash the talk show.
[58:22.880 --> 58:26.400]  That's the URL, linode.com slash the talk show.
[58:26.400 --> 58:30.000]  And use that code TALKSHOW2019 when you sign up,
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.200]  get $20 a credit.
[58:32.200 --> 58:34.720]  Four months of free service, unbelievable.
[58:34.720 --> 58:37.240]  So my thanks to Linode, great web hosting service.
[58:37.240 --> 58:39.240]  I'm a happy customer, go check them out.
[58:40.640 --> 58:41.780]  I might use Linode.
[58:42.740 --> 58:44.520]  It's a really great company.
[58:44.520 --> 58:45.560]  Do you ever watch the real world?
[58:45.560 --> 58:47.240]  I never watched.
[58:47.240 --> 58:49.080]  I told Amy this though, and she used to be a fan.
[58:49.080 --> 58:49.920]  Like on MTV?
[58:49.920 --> 58:50.740]  Yeah, the MTV.
[58:50.740 --> 58:51.580]  Of course I did.
[58:51.580 --> 58:52.420]  You didn't watch?
[58:52.420 --> 58:53.240]  Where were you?
[58:53.240 --> 58:54.080]  Where were you in the 90s?
[58:54.080 --> 58:54.920]  I don't know.
[58:54.920 --> 58:56.240]  I guess I watched in the early years.
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.040]  I watched a series or two,
[58:58.040 --> 59:00.000]  and then I did watch the Philadelphia one
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  for a couple of shows till I got annoyed
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.620]  by all the cast members.
[59:03.620 --> 59:05.680]  But anyway, that's where Linode is, their headquarters.
[59:05.680 --> 59:09.160]  It's a big old grand mansion type building
[59:09.160 --> 59:12.560]  where the real world Philadelphia kids used to live.
[59:12.560 --> 59:14.480]  They're probably like all my age.
[59:14.480 --> 59:17.040]  They're probably all into 50 years old now.
[59:17.040 --> 59:19.760]  I'm like, what does Linode have to do with real world?
[59:19.760 --> 59:22.640]  I'm like, did one of the founders end up where they-
[59:22.640 --> 59:23.960]  No, they took over the building.
[59:23.960 --> 59:26.480]  It was the, that's their Philadelphia.
[59:26.480 --> 59:28.640]  Yeah, their Philadelphia headquarters is the building,
[59:28.640 --> 59:31.240]  is that, I'd say a weird building in old,
[59:31.240 --> 59:32.660]  we call it Old City Philadelphia.
[59:32.660 --> 59:33.760]  Old City meaning it's,
[59:33.760 --> 59:36.860]  that's like the part of the city that was vibrant back
[59:36.860 --> 59:38.760]  like when the Declaration of Independence was written,
[59:38.760 --> 59:39.640]  et cetera, et cetera.
[59:39.640 --> 59:42.440]  They have a big old grand building down there
[59:42.440 --> 59:43.720]  that looked like a mansion
[59:43.720 --> 59:45.400]  when the real world kids lived there.
[59:45.400 --> 59:49.180]  And now it's an office for a vibrant web hosting company.
[59:50.320 --> 59:51.680]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely,
[59:51.680 --> 59:56.160]  I watched San Francisco, New Orleans, Hawaii.
[59:56.160 --> 59:57.460]  I can't remember.
[59:57.460 --> 59:58.640]  Did I watch Philadelphia?
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.920]  I need to go back and see what that was.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.960]  Anyway.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.400]  Anyway, iPhones.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.240]  iPhones.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.480]  So your review, you did,
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.080]  you always of course have to do video
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.000]  because that's part of the,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.040]  that's part of the,
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.480]  that's part of the,
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.880]  part of the job at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.160]  You have a, you have a column to write
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.220]  and then it goes in the newspaper, it goes on a website,
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.000]  but you actually wrote two reviews this year,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.440]  which I thought was really interesting.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.520]  And, you know, I'm sure it made it all,
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.760]  all the easier for you.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.400]  Yeah, you know, I was,
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.260]  I was struggling too because I thought I wanted to make,
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.740]  I wanted to write one piece with sort of that angle
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.120]  of the second piece, which was really from,
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.460]  I mean, I haven't actually gotten to the final count yet,
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.200]  but I think we're closing on like,
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.120]  near 400, 500 reader emails.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.960]  Wow.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.240]  Which is always amazing
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.680]  because people really think they can just write to me
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.920]  and I can write back and give everyone personal tech advice,
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.140]  which I wish I could,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.840]  but so many people this year seem to be writing in
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.720]  about iPhone 6s and iPhone 7s or iPhone 6s,
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.600]  I would really just kind of say the six model
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.700]  and the seven model or one.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.440]  And I was like, okay, so this year,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.620]  I'm not gonna do a review.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.340]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do a review,
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.000]  but I'm gonna contextualize it this way,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.960]  that like, if you're upgrading after three years,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.980]  here's what you're getting,
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.920]  here's how to decide on these.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.680]  But then I realized as I was writing that
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.520]  or trying to write that,
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.680]  that I was sort of leaving out a lot of the guts
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.920]  of what people may wanna know
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.240]  if they do wanna upgrade from a year before,
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.600]  probably much more of your listeners or readers,
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.740]  or maybe they're in the one or two year range.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.360]  So I decided to write these two pieces.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.680]  I thought that it was interesting.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.280]  I thought both were interesting.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.240]  And I thought that your technique with the,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.060]  because one of the things,
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.200]  and again, I say this every year,
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.480]  I don't mean to complain because this week,
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.040]  iPhone week is one of the highlights
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.000]  of my year professionally.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.840]  I enjoy it.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.520]  It's like playoff time for people in our business.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.800]  And you gotta be, I know people are,
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.740]  I get way, my iPhone reviews are some of the most read
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.300]  things I write all year long.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.440]  I enjoy doing it.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.880]  It's a privilege to do it.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.260]  If you would have told me 20 years ago, 15 years ago,
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.060]  that, hey, you're gonna get to write reviews
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.880]  of like the most anticipated Apple product of the year
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.240]  a week before they come out,
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.480]  I would have been like, wow, that sounds, that's terrific.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.480]  That's exactly where I wanna be.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.320]  It's a thrill.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.200]  So I don't, I wanna preface all of this,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.020]  but getting-
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.360]  I feel the same way.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.200]  Yeah.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.000]  Getting three iPhones at once and being told,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.160]  everybody's reviews are gonna come up in six days.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.520]  It's like, it is hard.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.080]  And it's hard.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.180]  I mean, it is even harder when you really think about
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.240]  how much has changed from last year,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.760]  and being able to say, okay,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.280]  I wanna focus on these changes,
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.320]  but I also need to contextualize for people
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.520]  who may not care about these camera updates
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.280]  or may not care about these processor updates
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.380]  what they should do.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.840]  And no, I'm in the same boat.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.720]  And like, I always like,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.440]  it's always an exhausting couple of days.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.860]  Like there's truly no sleep.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.480]  There's truly no time for anything outside of making videos,
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.600]  writing, testing, battery testing,
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.080]  taking photos of anything that moves, even stationary object.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.360]  I just am like a nuts, I'm just a complete crazy person
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.240]  to the point where actually
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.240]  I am working with a new video producer this year.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.080]  And he's like,
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.720]  sort of maybe we should just capture you doing this stuff.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.520]  And I was like, no, I don't want anyone to see me.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.280]  Like, he's like, let's just capture,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.520]  you know, you're making these phone calls,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.360]  you're doing this stuff.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.000]  I was like, no, I don't want anyone to see me like this.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.680]  One of the ways I took the same shortcut last year
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.960]  is I evaluated,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.920]  I knew that they were supposed to be the same.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.520]  Last year's 10S, 10S Max,
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.120]  this year's 11 Pro and the 11 Pro Max
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.000]  are supposed to be the same phone, same processor,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.960]  same screen technology, same exact three cameras
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.960]  and same three camera sensors.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.520]  Everything is the same except for the very obvious
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.800]  difference that one is bigger than the other.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.720]  It has a bigger screen and therefore has a bigger battery.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.160]  So because I was so camera focused in my reviews,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.720]  I did, you know, set up all the phones
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.320]  and I verified that yes, these cameras are identical.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.880]  If I take the same photo from the same setup
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.000]  with any of these three lenses,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.800]  I cannot tell the difference.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.920]  Okay, so I put the Max aside from that point forward
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.320]  because I didn't do extensive battery testing.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.040]  I was mostly focused on the camera.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.320]  So why bother shooting with that third one
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.920]  when it's gonna be exactly the same?
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.480]  So I mostly focused on the 11 and 11 Pro
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.320]  and then comparing it to last year's phone.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.680]  But you with the battery focus,
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.120]  like the lead of your review is,
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.400]  like I wrote when I linked to you yesterday,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.680]  it entertains me and this is why I like reading
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.720]  other people's reviews and love reading your reviews
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.480]  is that you and I sort of had the inverse review
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.200]  where you were like, look, the battery life is better
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.280]  and as icing on the cake, the cameras are better.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.840]  And my take was, hey, the cameras are so much better
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.600]  and as icing on the cake, the battery life is better.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.160]  Which are both very good takes.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.920]  I mean, I'm right, obviously, and you are wrong.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.920]  Well, you're probably right in terms of applicability
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.480]  to more people.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.040]  Well, I mean, Neil and I had this fight too.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.960]  Like his big thing is you can't buy better pictures
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.600]  after the fact, right?
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.320]  Like we didn't actually talk about this,
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.840]  but like he's like, you can do other things
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.400]  to save the battery life, right?
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.320]  You can do other things, you can buy chargers,
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.040]  you can keep charging, you can do all these things.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.720]  But cameras like, and we talk about taking photos
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.640]  of our kids all the time and he's obsessed
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.160]  with taking great photos of his daughter
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.600]  and they're amazing photos and I'm always happy
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.320]  when he comes over and takes photos of my son
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.040]  because it's like, these are amazing photos
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.520]  that I just take photos of with my,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.960]  not crappy camera on my phone,
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.320]  but it's the one that I have with me, right?
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.880]  And so you can't throw money at that.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.160]  So yeah, everyone should buy a better phone
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.680]  with a better camera and they shouldn't do things,
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.080]  they have to go out of their way to take better photos.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.520]  And I hear that, but I also hear the fact that like,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.040]  I see, I don't know, everyone walking around
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.120]  with a battery pack in their pocket
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.160]  and have a lightning cord on them,
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.160]  or you can pretty much know that anywhere you go,
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.400]  you can find a lightning cord
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:23.040]  because people are drowning out of battery life.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.560]  And so, I mean, for me, and also, you know, it's funny,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.160]  I read back my iPhone 6S review, which was, you know,
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160]  for me, probably a career maker,
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.720]  or it was a highlight of one of the bigger highlights
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.920]  of something I've written in my career
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.160]  because it got a lot of notice at the time
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.200]  because this was supposed to be an S update
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.440]  and just a simple, you know, spec update for Apple.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.920]  And I kind of took that moment
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920]  to write about how Apple wasn't addressing
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.440]  some of the biggest issues we were having with our phones.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.600]  And the number one thing I said in that review,
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.600]  three years, what was it, that's three years ago,
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.160]  was battery life.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.760]  That there had been no improvements to battery life
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.120]  in the last number of years
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.840]  and that the phones were getting thinner,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.840]  but Apple hadn't been adding battery life.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.200]  Yeah, and it's funny, it's very clear when you listen
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.600]  to the way Apple talks about battery life,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.080]  which is always, it's funny, it's a hard thing to measure.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.640]  There is no way to put one number on it.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.600]  You know, and if you were gonna put one number on it,
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.000]  people put on the milliamp hours, you know,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.760]  the actual technical specification of the battery.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.760]  But that doesn't tell you the story, right?
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.720]  Like, you can't just say Apple's phone
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.680]  has a 3,133 milliamp hour battery
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.040]  and here's a Samsung phone with a 3,600 milliamp hour.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.540]  So therefore the Samsung one has a better battery.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.960]  Well, it does have a bigger battery,
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.940]  but that doesn't mean you're gonna get better battery life.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.880]  You have to use it and you can't, you know,
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.080]  like Apple does these things now
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080]  where they have like audio playback.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.440]  Nilay and I were laughing about it
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.180]  because like the audio playback is like 65 hours.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.120]  And it's like, who is just like,
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.000]  I'm gonna set up my iPhone, play some music
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  and just let it go, not plugged in for 65 consecutive hours.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.520]  But it is a measurement, you know,
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.500]  and they do video playback, streaming video.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.960]  So it's like you can get 17 or 18 hours
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.320]  of continuous Netflix video playback.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320]  Yeah, and actually I had to change.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.120]  So I've been doing battery testing for like, I don't know,
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.320]  10, 15 years now because of when I used to test laptops.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.240]  And I went through many, many years
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.880]  of using video rundown tests or even streaming audio tests.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.000]  And then there were times where I had worked with engineers
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.600]  to create web surfing tests.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.400]  When I was at The Verge, I worked with an engineer.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.680]  It was like, when we first started The Verge,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.520]  my big thing was like,
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.360]  I'm gonna make our own industry battery test.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.080]  And Nilay or Josh Sapolsky at the time said,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.580]  okay, fine, here's some money, go hire a engineer.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.160]  We made this site.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.760]  It would cycle through different websites.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.880]  I was obsessed with it.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.880]  And it had a lot of issues.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.080]  It would always crash.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.480]  I mean, battery life testing
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.160]  is one of the worst things as a reviewer.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.120]  And that's why this year I kind of just said,
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.040]  I'm gonna go through my normal routine,
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.480]  which each of these phones I got to do each day.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.640]  And I did two days with the 11.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.340]  No, I did two days with the 11 Pro
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.200]  because that was the one I was really trying to figure out
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.040]  how much better did this thing get.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.680]  And yeah, I mean, look, part of me feels like Apple's,
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.880]  and I said this in the piece,
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.280]  they've admitted that they needed to do better there.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.000]  Yes, they're slightly thicker.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.660]  I mean, you really wouldn't even really be able
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.560]  to tell the difference, but they're talking about it too.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.000]  Part of me also wonders like how much of this
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.520]  is just to preempt next year when they likely do add 5G
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.800]  and that does likely take somewhat of a hit at battery.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.640]  Yeah, I wonder.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.760]  Well, I loved your approach.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.960]  So basically for people,
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.400]  if they haven't read your main iPhone 11 review
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.000]  and shame on you if you haven't read Joanna's review.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.760]  Or watch the video, please just watch the video,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.000]  more video views, please.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.960]  But it's a brilliant technique and it parlays
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.520]  or it builds on the trust you have with your readers
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.600]  because ideally what you would wanna do
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.820]  is what you said you'd like tried to build at the verge
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.760]  and build like a scientific rig
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.120]  where you could do, somebody could say, here's what we did.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.220]  We did these 26 steps.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.160]  If you do the same 26 steps,
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.520]  you'll get the same results, right?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.980]  That's science, right?
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.880]  You're supposed to have reproducible results.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.280]  It just, that's not a good way to test phone battery life
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.120]  in the real world.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.640]  So what you did was you set up all three new phones
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.640]  and went through a typical workday with the same commute
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.320]  and going into, I guess you went into
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.440]  the Wall Street Journal office every day
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.160]  and Manhattan remains a battery killer.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.000]  Like I had to go,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.280]  because I didn't go to California this year,
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.200]  I had to go to New York to get the review units.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.400]  And it was a real quick trip.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.560]  I was like, I went up early in the morning on the train,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.160]  had my briefing with Apple, got the phones,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.040]  and I was like back on a train to Philadelphia by like 1230.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.600]  And I was like looking at my iPhone 10S at the time,
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.040]  you know, my real phone at the time,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.560]  and I was like, holy crap, I'm at 50%.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.600]  And I was like, I wasn't like on the phone.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.160]  I was just like talking to people at Apple.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.800]  I was like, my God, Manhattan is a battery killer.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.240]  So you went through your typical day with all three phones
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.320]  and just recorded, you know,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.480]  here's when I came home and went to bed,
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.000]  here's what was left.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.160]  I think that's useful.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.160]  And I think it's more useful to real people
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.880]  to find out how these things hold up in the real world,
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.080]  but you can't reproduce it.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.840]  You can't say, I'll reproduce Joanna's results
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.840]  and live a day as Joanna Stern.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.800]  Well, you can't do that, right?
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.720]  I mean, I did do the battery, the video rundown tests.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.120]  I did end up using,
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.520]  I used to use this video on Netflix that was 11 hours long,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.960]  and I would run that down.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.180]  I did find the same video on YouTube.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.120]  So I did do that test just to see the gap
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.040]  between last year's model and this year's model,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.000]  and to also see, you know,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.160]  just give it a benchmark from each of these phones
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.600]  around the same test, under the same conditions,
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.120]  what are the gaps between them?
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.240]  So we could kind of see like, yes,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.400]  the Max really does get the most battery life.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.400]  It ran for 14 and a half hours.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.480]  The 11 ran for 12 or 13 and a half hours or 13 hours.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.160]  And then, you know, the 11 Pro ran a little bit less.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.960]  So I still think that's a worthy test
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.480]  and no one, I don't think most, no one's gonna do that.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.400]  I mean, like, you know, I just do that
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.800]  because I feel like, let me just add some more testing.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.920]  I just do that to make my life more of a living hell,
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.220]  honestly, there's no real reason I do it otherwise
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.840]  than just to hate myself.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.640]  But I think you're right to go back to the iPhone 6s.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.560]  I think you were right and nailed it
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.580]  when you wrote that review that up until that point,
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.280]  it was very clear that what Apple was doing every year
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.120]  was saying, our battery life is good enough.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.040]  Like it was like 10 hours or something.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.040]  It was like 10 hours of X, I don't know, video.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.560]  So they say 10 hours of video playback.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.840]  And it was very clear that year after year,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.080]  they were saying, well, 10 hours of video playback
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.040]  is our, that's our goal.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.440]  And then the team would like,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.880]  so let's see how thin we can make a new iPhone
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.240]  that still gets 10 hours of battery life
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.240]  and see if we can make it lighter
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.440]  and still get 10 hours of battery life year after year.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.400]  And I really think, I think you called them out on it.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.160]  And in hindsight, you were very much right.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.080]  And I think Apple clearly internally had a,
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.560]  hey, I think we've got the wrong,
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.480]  this holding onto this amount of battery life is wrong.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.440]  We need to improve battery life.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.400]  People are using these phones more and more.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.920]  And the interesting thing is that I think the 6s
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.380]  is the thinnest iPhone that was ever made.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.380]  If not, it was the 6, it's very close.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.960]  But somewhere around the iPhone 6, year after year,
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.240]  or at least not counting the S generations
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.920]  that were the same thickness,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.800]  the phones got thinner and thinner and thinner.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.740]  And then from the 6 forward,
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.920]  they've gotten thicker every time they changed the hardware.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.480]  The 7 was slightly thicker.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.600]  I mean, every time it's gotten thicker, it's been slight.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.320]  But you add that up over a couple of generations
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.760]  and the phones this year are actually quite a bit thicker
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.360]  than an iPhone 6.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.600]  Yeah, and I think it was very telling
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.800]  as I also remember thinking,
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.440]  okay, maybe I'm onto something with calling them out on this.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.680]  When it was 2015, same year as the 6s were released,
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.520]  there was the first year
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.680]  they released the smart battery case.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.840]  And I thought that was a big admission too,
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.720]  that we know that people are strapping giant batteries
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.880]  to the back of our phones
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.060]  because we're not giving them enough here.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.600]  And I mean, that's what I said last year in the 10R review.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.080]  This was the first year
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.160]  that I thought they designed a battery of an iPhone
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.200]  that could keep up with us.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.520]  Though, I mean, the Plus models
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.340]  had been doing quite a bit of that for a while,
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.600]  but between the 10R last year and the Max,
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.360]  it was like, this is the first year
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.720]  that there were phones that could keep up with a heavy user.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.760]  Yeah, I think, and I wrote about this in my review,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.600]  one of the changes this year
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.000]  is that they've dropped 3D Touch across the board.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.560]  And last year, the iPhone 10R
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.800]  was already where all of this year's phones are,
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.500]  already didn't have 3D Touch
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.160]  and used what they now call haptic touch instead.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.440]  I think that's one of the reasons
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.760]  why the 10R got so much better battery life
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:24.520]  than the 10S and 10S Max last year
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.400]  was that it was already had a bigger battery
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.280]  and the LCD screen is lower,
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.080]  uses less power than the OLED screens.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.120]  So you're thinking, is that because the chip inside
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.840]  that was enabling the 3D or the layer on the screen-
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.680]  Yeah, it's the layer.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.520]  It's the layer, removing that layer.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.440]  And nobody at Apple,
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.260]  I mean, nobody told me anything on the record,
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.060]  but off the record in my briefings,
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.160]  it wasn't told, hey, getting rid of 3D Touch
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.200]  allowed us to make the battery thicker,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.600]  but reading between the lines, that's what I heard,
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.360]  is getting, and I really do think that,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.520]  I'm sure they're out by now,
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.880]  I didn't look, but the iFixit teardown.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.700]  I do think that the battery definitely got to use up
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.800]  some of the volume that the 3D Touch,
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.680]  because it was, it was a full layer underneath the screen,
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.700]  corner to corner, because you could do 3D Touch presses
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.040]  anywhere on the screen and it was a full layer.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.100]  I don't know how thin it was.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.280]  It was probably, I'm sure if you took it apart and said,
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.320]  here's the actual 3D Touch layer,
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.600]  it probably looks like a sheet of paper.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.160]  It's like, well, that didn't take up much space,
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.760]  but every single little bit of volume matters
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.600]  in these phones.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.240]  They're so densely packed with components.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.980]  And I think the evidence is there
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.680]  that going from the 10R to the 11 this year,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.760]  in Apple's measurements,
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  you get one hour of extra battery life,
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.680]  which is a good year over year change,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.520]  but the pros are, yeah,
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.720]  the pros get four to five hours of extra battery life.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.960]  And I really think that removing 3D Touch
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.940]  was a big part of that,
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.240]  that they, you know, and kudos to Apple,
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.340]  I think for being willing,
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.720]  I'm not gonna call it a mistake,
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.480]  but to, you know, it's,
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.520]  they were willing to go back and rethink
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.000]  how we're gonna do, you know,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.980]  these long presses and force presses.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.200]  And sure, in and of itself,
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.560]  3D Touch is definitely better than the Haptic Touch,
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.640]  but the trade-off for extra battery life,
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.800]  I think is absolutely the right trade-off to make.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.680]  And funny enough, they introduced that in the 6S.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.680]  Yeah, which put the 6S even further back, I guess,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.360]  from where it could be battery life-wise.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.360]  Obviously, I mean, the funny thing in this all too
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:43.120]  has been that I've heard from so many 6S owners
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.760]  who have been so happy with their phones.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.060]  Yeah, I'm curious about that.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.680]  And it's, you know, and I try to emphasize it.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.360]  I know my audience at Daring Fireball
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.640]  is definitely the enthusiast crowd.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.080]  And so you're right.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.520]  I'm sure there are way more people
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.600]  who are on the, you know,
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.960]  annual upgrade plan and do get new iPhones every year,
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.920]  or at least get them every two years.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.400]  And the journal audience is obviously truly mainstream.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.240]  I mean, it's, you know, this massive newspaper
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.080]  that is popular all across the country, if not the world,
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.480]  and you're gonna get people from, you know,
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.680]  all sorts of levels of technical acumen.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.840]  And you're gonna get a lot of people
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.040]  who are just using an iPhone 6 or 6S, you know,
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.800]  and just because that's what normal people do.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.120]  They use their phones until they break.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.040]  Right, as I said in my piece,
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.900]  Sir Upgrades a lot, or those are your readers.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.460]  And I think I have some of those readers,
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.600]  but I also have a lot of these, as I said,
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.760]  Sir Sixers who are just like coming out of the woodwork
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  and not sure what to do about, you know,
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.640]  well, I think the main thing for them
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.920]  is that their phones are old and they're falling,
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.000]  you know, it's time to upgrade,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.080]  but also they're not gonna get iOS 13.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.520]  Right.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.560]  Which to me is a reason to upgrade to a new phone.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.020]  Yeah.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.160]  Yeah, and there's a lot of things
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.780]  that won't work without iOS 13.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.080]  I mean, it's still not out.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.620]  That they're, you know,
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.680]  I guess we should talk about the disaster
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.480]  of the iOS 13 rollout before we wrap the show,
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.080]  but there's features that you need to,
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.360]  like the shared folders in iCloud Drive
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.600]  and stuff like that only work
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.400]  if you're up on the latest version.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.440]  Yeah, and for me, it's always, you know,
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.000]  security updates and I think I wrote a big piece
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.400]  about signing with Apple and I think it's a reason,
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.040]  it is the reason to upgrade.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.840]  Also the new emoji.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.440]  And everybody agrees, it sounds funny,
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.160]  but everybody seems to agree
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.960]  that it really is a big motivator
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.480]  for normal people to keep their iPhones up to date
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.960]  is to get the latest emoji set.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.560]  I actually believe that might be the biggest reason.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.800]  I do too. I have never thought of that,
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.800]  but you'll end up with the little box
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.240]  and you'll have no idea what somebody's trying to say to you.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.280]  Right, and somebody will, you'll say, what is that?
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.200]  And then they'll tell you,
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.400]  and it sounds like a fun emoji to have
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.120]  and then you want it, right?
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.280]  Oh, I want that.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.520]  Why don't I?
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.640]  That's actually a very funny story.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.480]  Yeah, no, security research is,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.720]  I follow a couple of them on Twitter.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.800]  They're deadly serious people for the most part.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.440]  Some of them are rather humorless, really.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.320]  It's just the mentality of being a security researcher.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.840]  They absolutely believe that it's a great,
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.720]  it's a boon to security
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.360]  because it really does motivate people to,
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.600]  effectively, it's like good hygiene for your phone,
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.360]  keep it up to date with the software updates.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.600]  Well, the emoji is what makes people want to do it.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.440]  It's amazing.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.680]  Especially like teenagers,
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.360]  because they probably,
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.000]  most of them probably don't even type anything
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.040]  other than emoji.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.320]  Yeah, the iOS 13 rollout has been a disaster,
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.160]  in my opinion.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.080]  Let's hold off on that, let's hold off on that.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.920]  The other thing I want to talk about,
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.920]  and I don't want to badmouth a fellow member of our tribe,
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.840]  but I thought the other thing that was really interesting
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.120]  about your second review,
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.720]  here's an iPhone 11 review for those with older iPhones,
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.040]  was a fascinating contrast to Brian Chen's New York Times,
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.720]  his only review of the 11s,
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.520]  which I wrote about during Fireball.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.480]  I thought it was a terrible review.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:21.600]  Because I don't think it was helpful.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.080]  I thought that he,
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.480]  again, I'm not asking you to slag on Brian
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.320]  here on the podcast, other than, let me do it.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.960]  But I thought his review was terrible,
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.040]  because I really don't think it was helpful
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.560]  to people with older reviews.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.560]  And saying things like,
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.640]  hey, these new phones take great pictures in low light,
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.600]  and maybe your 6s takes terrible pictures in low light,
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.040]  but you could just turn on the flash.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.760]  I called it technical malpractice.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.400]  Like, that's terrible advice.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.920]  Like, really, I think a great premise
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.560]  for a mainstream tech columnist would be a column
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.920]  like how to get good pictures in low light
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.400]  with your existing camera without using the flash,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.880]  because the flash is terrible.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.920]  Thank you for these great column ideas here, John.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.520]  That would be a great column idea, in my opinion,
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.920]  how to get good pictures in low light,
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.600]  balance, keep your hands still, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.840]  And your column was, your second review of the phones
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.200]  was exactly this, basically the same premise.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.080]  You're somebody with an older phone
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.840]  and you might wanna hang onto it or maybe not.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.320]  Here's how to evaluate whether now's the time to upgrade.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.560]  And yours was like entirely helpful.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.600]  It was like, here's how you can make a rational judgment.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.040]  Like, that to me is our job as reviewers.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.360]  You know your audience and write to the audience.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.880]  And like I said, my audience is a little different
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.200]  than yours in some ways, but know your audience.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.040]  And my goal is, look, I've got this phone
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.480]  before any of you do.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.880]  Let me try to help you understand it.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.360]  Here's what's new, here's what's interesting,
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.760]  here's what's good, here's what's bad,
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.200]  here's what's missing, here's, you know,
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.600]  maybe why you don't want it.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.280]  But I want you to understand it.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.440]  And I thought-
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.440]  Yeah, and I had the, I mean, it was very helpful
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.600]  to have this body of emails,
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.920]  which my editor Wilson helped me kind of go through.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.600]  He went through many of them and we sort of organized them
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.000]  based on issues people had with the new phones,
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.280]  why they were upgrading, what they were scared of.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.520]  I mean, so many people very scared of Face ID,
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.120]  which is very interesting.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.280]  That's what I wanted to, I was just about to ask you that.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.640]  Yeah, so how many people, I have this theory that,
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.480]  so I forget if it was, I think it was last year.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.200]  It was last year when both of the new phones,
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.080]  so two years ago, the iPhone 10 came out
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.920]  with the, you know, Face ID, no home button,
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.680]  and they go hand in hand.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.680]  Last year, both of the new phones had no home button Face ID
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.600]  and there was this,
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.400]  and I don't get into the finance stuff with Apple as much.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.680]  You know, you and I like to talk about the products,
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:55.800]  the software and the hardware,
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.360]  but there, you know, there was this hiccup
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.780]  where it seemed like the first quarter of sales
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.040]  of new iPhones was a bit disappointing,
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.600]  less than Apple expected, less than analysts expected,
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.400]  and the stock took a hit in January
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.960]  when they had to announce this.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.560]  One of my theories, I can't prove it,
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.840]  I don't know how you ever could prove it,
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.880]  but one of my theories is that there's so many people
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  out there who are spooked by the change.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.920]  They're used to having a home button.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.120]  You collect the home button
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.760]  and that's how you go back to the home screen
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.720]  and they're used to Touch ID
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.440]  and Face ID seems a little scarier
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.060]  and maybe like maybe it wouldn't work
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.780]  or maybe there's a privacy thing to be spooked about.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:38.680]  It somehow seems a little weirder to people
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.040]  than a fingerprint reader
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.920]  that I think that sales were hurt by that.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.020]  I really do think that there was X number
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.560]  of million people out there out of hundreds of millions
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.000]  who might buy an iPhone who put it off.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  So I'm curious to hear what the readers
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.420]  of the journal were writing about that.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.520]  I mean, I've gotten,
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.120]  I'm looking through a lot of the emails now.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.560]  I mean, there's a lot of confusion from people.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.920]  They don't really quite understand
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.540]  that they can use Face ID to get into apps
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.380]  and things like that.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.800]  So there's that.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.000]  Some people are just scared of it.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.320]  They don't want to use their face to log in.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.560]  They prefer the fingerprint sensor.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.120]  Face ID for scanning,
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.040]  this person saying would the face scan work automatically
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.140]  in the fingerprint scans place?
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.080]  I like the fingerprint access
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.760]  and obviously the 11 doesn't have this.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.320]  Does facial recognition also work to get into apps?
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.880]  I mean, just a lot of confusion around a lot of it,
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.100]  but also some, I mean, there was one here.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.080]  I was really hoping for fingerprint unlock
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.320]  on the new phones.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.120]  Yeah, see, I want to easily unlock with my thumb.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.560]  I guess I'll keep waiting.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.080]  Yeah, see, you're going to be waiting
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.040]  for a long time, I think.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040]  I mean, though there's rumors
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.240]  that they'll put it in the screen.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.040]  Yeah, but that's a weird rumor.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.060]  And I wonder whether it would be an alternative to Face ID
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.440]  or like in addition to Face ID,
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.440]  like, hey, if you want extra security, you could use both.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.600]  Yeah, when do you expect Apple, Apple spell drawing
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.880]  to offer an in-screen fingerprint scanning?
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.800]  I have two phones and I need to upgrade, but I'll wait.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.120]  I don't like Face ID.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:10.480]  See, yeah, see, you're proving my theory.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.680]  No, this has been a theory since last year.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:13.920]  I mean, not a theory, I heard from,
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.220]  I mean, if I really go back,
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:18.040]  I searched fingerprint scanner in my inbox here
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.880]  and I'm going all the way back to 2000.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.920]  Well, these are probably from 2017.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.240]  I organize all my reader emails into a file and try to...
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.260]  And Apple's in a weird position where I don't know
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.440]  that you can make a fun commercial
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.980]  that let's just say you could come up with a script
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.120]  for a 30-second TV commercial that helps convince people
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.160]  that Face ID is something they can trust
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.260]  and they will like.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.520]  The other problem that Apple has
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.760]  is they still sell older iPhones that have the Touch ID.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.080]  They can't really slag on Touch ID
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.840]  because they still sell iPhone 8 and...
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.240]  Yeah, I mean, I recommended iPhone 8 to these people.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.880]  I don't think that's a bad recommendation,
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.040]  especially since like, you know,
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.720]  they're gonna continue to update with iOS
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.480]  for a number of years out on that.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.940]  Why not?
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.160]  Did I actually keep in the line,
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.480]  like you should stockpile them if you're really that worried?
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.120]  I don't think you did, but maybe.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.680]  Yeah, get a couple of spares.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.880]  Yeah, get a couple of spares
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.240]  as I feel like this phone's going away.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.300]  I mean, the other big thing, let me type in SE,
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.140]  so many people emailing about the smaller size.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.280]  So many people.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.560]  I mean, oh yeah, look at just this last couple of weeks
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.520]  of scrolling down and so many
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.700]  when I search for SE in my inbox,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.440]  you know, they upgrade the smaller phone.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.860]  I love the SE, my hands are small.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.040]  That's unfortunate.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.400]  Even I get that because I don't think that's just,
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.880]  that has nothing to do with your nerdiness.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.380]  It's people, you know, and there are definitely,
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.480]  I know people who are, you know, super nerds
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.180]  and, you know, developers who just love the SE size
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.920]  for that one-handedness and, you know,
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.880]  the compactness and size in your pocket
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.920]  and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.200]  The rumors that they might do an SE
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.360]  like mid-cycle update this year
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.440]  don't, are gonna disappoint those people
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.000]  because the rumors are that it's gonna be
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.640]  like an iPhone 8 size device with, I guess,
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.240]  the A13 chip and probably a better camera and something.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.120]  They should do that for these people.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:29.960]  They'll still sell.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.120]  I don't think that's small enough
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.880]  to please the SE people though, right?
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.720]  Like, so like the iPhone.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.880]  I mean, this was an email from a,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.220]  I'm quite tempted by the new 11, but it's huge.
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.680]  My priority is a better camera
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.560]  and I've even toyed with getting a Samsung
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.820]  and leaving the Apple family.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.860]  Should I just go to an 8
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.400]  or should I wait till they may update the SE?
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.320]  I don't think Samsung makes a smaller phone though.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.100]  Samsung's phones are all huge.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:55.100]  No, well, the new Galaxy S10e, is that what it's called?
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.500]  Yeah, is that what it's called?
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:57.340]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.180]  It's about the same size as a 8.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:04.340]  Yeah, and the pixel, the smaller pixels
[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:07.300]  are smaller and definitely lighter.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.440]  I gotta write this woman back.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.460]  She's very nice.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:11.260]  But I think the people who really-
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:12.420]  Everyone's so nice.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.300]  People who really want that SE sized phone though,
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.020]  I think are out of luck.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.420]  And it's, I don't know what Apple's thinking on that front
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.580]  cause it really does seem like demand is out there.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.500]  And when the SE did come out two or three years ago,
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.060]  whenever that was, they were in short supply for months.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.820]  And there was a quarterly analyst call
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.500]  where Tim Cook even admitted that SE demand
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.200]  had outstripped their expectations.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.620]  And so they were gonna catch up soon,
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:44.620]  but yes, for the debut quarter, you couldn't get one.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:48.700]  You had to order it and wait 10 days for it to show up.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.540]  I bet they do.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.660]  I mean, the interesting thing you're saying
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.500]  that the eight makes sense.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.400]  Maybe they could cut it down a little bit.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.340]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.580]  I don't know what they're gonna do,
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.060]  but I think people there's definitely demand.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.660]  I mean, whether there's enough demand
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.380]  to justify it on Apple's part, I don't know,
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.300]  but there are definitely people who really want
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.440]  something the physical size of an SE.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.460]  I mean, I'm sure they'd love it
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.660]  if it went corner to corner with the display
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.100]  and you could get a bigger display
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.380]  by getting rid of the chin and forehead,
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.380]  but they really want that physical size
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:24.960]  that is the size basically of an iPhone 5, 5S SE.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:29.340]  Well, for the 15 people in my inbox, they should make it.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.780]  I mean, this is 15 in the last,
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.820]  since September 11th have written about the SE.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.660]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.860]  Just not that many, but they're all
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.820]  like pretty lengthy emails.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:39.260]  Tim Cook, if you're listening,
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:41.780]  you could sell 15 of these things.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.680]  15 to these Wall Street Journal readers.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.460]  It's pretty good.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.100]  It's a pretty good deal.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.060]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.260]  and thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.580]  And then we can go into the,
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.400]  we can finish up without after worrying
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.000]  about another sponsor break.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.700]  Hey, this is another company that I love.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:00.940]  Longtime sponsor of the show, Fracture.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.380]  Fracture is where you go with your photos,
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:06.620]  talking about photos of kids and dogs and stuff like that.
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.460]  Hey, get them off your tiny little phone screen,
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.840]  print them out, put them on something
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.220]  you can hang on a wall.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.060]  And guess what?
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.620]  Fracture is the best way I know to do it.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.380]  Because what Fracture does is they take,
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:21.020]  you send them your photos, you pick a size,
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.860]  and they print your photos directly on glass.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.100]  Corner to corner, you don't need a frame.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:31.060]  It's just corner to corner, edge to edge,
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.380]  right on the glass.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.420]  Looks like it's right on the surface of the glass.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.260]  It's amazing.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.580]  It looks so much better.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.640]  I don't know how to explain it
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.940]  unless you've seen it in person, a Fracture print.
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:44.440]  It looks so much better than a printout
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.820]  on a piece of paper that is put behind a piece of glass.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.340]  I don't know how, I don't know why.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.580]  I think it's a lot like the visual effect
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.780]  of when they first started putting the screens
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.060]  laminated right on the iPhone
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.300]  and getting rid of that air gap
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.460]  between the touch and the glass and the pixels behind it.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:03.380]  It just looks amazing.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:04.420]  These are great.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.900]  They are fantastic gifts for anybody in your family.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.740]  Everybody loves getting pictures.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.220]  And everything you need to use them comes in the box.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.460]  If you wanna hang them on a wall,
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.100]  if you wanna prop them up on a mantle or your desk
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.960]  or something like that, everything comes in the box.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.380]  They are fantastic.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:26.480]  They are made, handmade in Gainesville, Florida
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.160]  from US source materials.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.100]  And they are a green company, Fracture,
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:35.300]  operating a carbon neutral factory down there in Florida.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:39.160]  Really great people, great company and a fantastic product.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.540]  Everybody I know who's ever gotten Fracture prints
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.420]  is like, why did I wait so long?
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.460]  These are great.
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:45.460]  Why didn't you tell me about them?
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.940]  And I'm like, hey, if you listen to my show,
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.300]  I've been telling you about them for years.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.300]  They are fantastic.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.880]  They have a special offer for listeners of the show.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.860]  Go to fracture.me, that's their website, fracture.me.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.260]  And you can get a special discount
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.420]  on your first Fracture order.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.380]  You don't even need a code.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.260]  You just go there, you get the discount on your first order.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:08.540]  And here's what they want you to do.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.740]  When you place an order at the very end,
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.920]  they ask a one question survey,
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.060]  which is where did you hear about Fracture?
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.900]  They want you to fill in my show.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.500]  The talk show, that way they know
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.180]  that their sponsorship money is well spent.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.120]  So go to fracture.me, go get some of your photos,
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.100]  print it out.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.260]  I really recommend it.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.000]  Do it.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.980]  Well, not right now, wait till the show's over.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.720]  Nah, right now.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.280]  I took so many good photos with the 11,
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.260]  just testing it with my son and dog that I'm doing it.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.100]  You know what's funny?
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.820]  And I guess you, you're in Eli's,
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.180]  your son and Eli's daughter are about the same age.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.580]  They're pretty close, right?
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.140]  They're like, they're six months, a little bit more.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.320]  When we've gotten them together to play,
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.940]  they don't have a ton of interest in each other just yet.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:58.380]  Yeah, but soon enough, that'll seem indistinguishable.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.140]  They went swimming together this summer
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.740]  at my parents' house and they,
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.820]  I mean, he was spraying her with the hose
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.860]  and she seemed to like that.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:11.060]  So my son is 15, could be 16 in January.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:15.040]  So it's a decade and a half difference almost.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.820]  But I was just, I just stumbled across
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:23.100]  a folder of old video that we had
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.780]  when my son was actually right around the age of your kids.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.640]  He was about a year and a half.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:33.180]  And back then, 13 and a half years ago,
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.740]  my video camera was a mini DV camera.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.360]  So it's standard def, four to three.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.660]  Low light performance was pretty crummy.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.700]  But it was a video, I don't have a bunch of them.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.500]  I've gotten them digitized so they're on my computer now
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.460]  and I don't have to worry about hooking up
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:55.020]  a mini DV thing and you gotta get,
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.420]  but what a pain in the ass it is.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:57.900]  It's like I had to pay money to somebody
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.780]  to take these tapes and turn them into files
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:03.540]  that I could actually play, but I've got them.
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.580]  But oh my, I mean, it's not heartbreaking.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.740]  I don't wanna say that because it's like,
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.580]  we've got hours and hours and hours of video
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:16.580]  of when Jonas was a baby and a toddler and a little kid
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.800]  and they're great and just seeing them
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:22.220]  and hearing him say funny things is all that matters.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.380]  But it's like there's also, and we're all laughing,
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.300]  the three of us, me and my wife and Jonas
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.700]  were watching this together and he's hilarious.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.420]  And you just have that nostalgic feeling
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.540]  that like, wow, this is, we're tearing up, my God,
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.540]  look at this kid, he's so tall and he's 10th grade
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:42.780]  and he's like a little man now
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.100]  and here he was when he was a baby
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.260]  and in some ways he was the same
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:46.860]  and it's so great that we have all this video.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.980]  Like when I was a kid, we didn't have video.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:51.500]  It's great, but then there's the tech nerd part of me
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.140]  who's looking at this and thinking,
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.820]  oh my God, I wish I had an iPhone back then.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.700]  Look at this low, look at this low light performance.
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:01.940]  Oh my God, this is absolutely horrible.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.560]  Yeah, I mean, I think about, even I like to do,
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.340]  I tried when he was first born to take like video every day
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.740]  and then just realized like, okay,
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.820]  no normal person who has a job can do that.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.580]  But anyway, I go back and watch that stuff even now
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.340]  and I'm like, this was not a very good video
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.660]  and I had a iPhone 7, right?
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.740]  Like it was two years ago.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.580]  Well, let me tell you, a mini DV camera from 2004
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.180]  really doesn't hold up today.
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.380]  At least you got it digitized.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.860]  I mean, that's another column I should write.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.780]  Yeah, that's a great column really
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.180]  in terms of how- I'm trying to do that this year.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.220]  Get them before they're even, somebody will be,
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.620]  the longer you go, the harder it's gonna be
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:47.060]  to get older formats or older tape formats digitized.
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:50.340]  Yeah, and then there's, I did a piece a couple of years ago
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.800]  which is still a very popular piece
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.540]  on how to do that with your old photos.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:54.900]  You can send them to a company
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.980]  and they'll just scan them all and do it.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.860]  The other thing we have a lot of clips of
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:01.100]  and we didn't have to digitize them
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:02.940]  because they were digitized, but they're,
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.500]  Jonas, in between that mini DV era
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:11.500]  and then before iPhones became great consumer video devices
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.400]  was that flip camera era.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.240]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.000]  Which was, in hindsight, a weird blip technology-wise.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.100]  But we had a couple of these flips and I'd buy a new one.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.900]  It was like the iPhone of the time for video
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.200]  because it was like a year later,
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.180]  you could get one that shot HD instead of SD
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:29.700]  and had better low light and stuff.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.700]  So we have tons of flip camera footage of them too
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.740]  because it was a great thing to just throw in your pocket
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:37.340]  and going about your day and something cute happens
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.180]  and you can take a clip.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:40.120]  But again, technically speaking,
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.380]  looking at that footage now, it is,
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.980]  it is, it's very crude.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.180]  It is extraordinarily crude.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.580]  So it's, it's.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.100]  That poor company.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:50.940]  Yeah.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:54.140]  It was so, but I remember having two of those
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:56.580]  and I would bring them to, I think it was probably the,
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.340]  one of the iPhone events and then even
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:01.740]  the early Android phone events
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.360]  and I would shoot video on there
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.360]  and load it onto my computer and edited it real quick
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.700]  and upload it to Engadget.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.100]  Yeah.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.820]  Well, it's absolutely, it's just astounding to think about,
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.820]  you know, a couple of,
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.900]  I know Bill Gates has been credited with it
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.360]  and I don't know if it's original to him,
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.560]  but I'll give credit to Bill, good old Bill Gates,
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.460]  but something to the effect of we as human beings,
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:31.460]  it always overestimate what we can do technology wise
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:34.660]  year over year and always underestimate
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:39.540]  the profound changes that happen after a decade.
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.540]  You know, every 10 years, it's like, wow,
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:42.940]  that it's, it's just astounding.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.300]  And every year, you know, like when the new iPhones come out
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.660]  and we're like, ah, this isn't that exciting
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:48.980]  from last year's phones.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.760]  But then all of a sudden you do that, you have like,
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.060]  you have one of those updates every year for 10 years
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.120]  and all of a sudden you're like, oh my God,
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.220]  that thing was a piece of crap 10 years ago.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.380]  No, I mean, one of the pieces that I probably loved
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.500]  working on the most in the last five years
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500]  was the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.740]  I tried to live with the original iPhone for a day.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:10.100]  And I mean, first of all, I put in a SIM card.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:13.100]  It didn't have, I used 2G service
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.300]  on that original iPhone on T-Mobile.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.140]  And it was, that was for me like eye-opening.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:23.140]  It was like, even if everything was the same,
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:27.580]  but you had 2G service, gosh, like that to me,
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.920]  just like, remember how slow it was.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.500]  You can't even remember how slow it is.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.420]  We blocked it out.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:35.900]  Right, when you had a very strong 2G signal,
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.980]  it would take like a minute and a half to load a webpage.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.260]  And that's not- You have that blue bar,
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:44.740]  the blue highlight in the top of the Safari browser
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.540]  trying to load and you just like,
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.180]  maybe it's gonna load today, even get to the bot,
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.540]  even get to the end and nothing would show up.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700]  Yeah, and I mean, camera quality,
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.740]  even in the piece that I did for the Upgraders,
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:01.740]  the review this year, I took some shots with the 6S
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.220]  and comparing that low light shot,
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.100]  there's a picture in the review,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.460]  both in the video and in the review.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:10.820]  The 6S low light shot to the 11 is amazing.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.100]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:15.180]  And I mean- Video difference is night and day.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.540]  It's- Video difference even over last year
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.380]  is night and day.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.740]  I mean, I definitely did, I do poke hard at them
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.380]  in the video, the beginning of the videos,
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:25.820]  kind of like, you know, it's still not a pro camera.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.300]  You know, I kind of like,
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.700]  I had a lot of ideas on how to approach this video.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.540]  And one of the ideas was like,
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.700]  let's shoot a pro movie with this camera.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.300]  And I started shooting with it and I was like,
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.020]  this still looks like an iPhone.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.420]  But it's still like, put them side by side with a 10S
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.460]  and it is far better.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.220]  In talented hands, you know,
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:48.140]  like Apple paid those guys to do that black and white movie
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.300]  that they showed during the event, you know,
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.780]  and when they talked to the guys talking about
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.180]  the filmic app that can shoot simultaneous footage
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.620]  from two of the cameras at once so that you could get like,
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:40:59.540]  if you're doing an interview,
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.380]  you could get a closeup and a wide shot of your subject
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:03.980]  using just the one camera.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:05.340]  In the hands of a pro,
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:08.260]  people are getting astounding results out of iPhone cameras.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.940]  I mean, Steven Soderbergh has shot two feature films
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:13.500]  using iPhones as the camera, which, and they look,
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.180]  they look more like real movies.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.220]  They don't look like, you know,
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.540]  like the Blair Witch Project
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:20.500]  where it's supposed to look like it was shot
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.540]  on a consumer camera.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.980]  They look like movies,
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.740]  but you gotta put a lot of work into it.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:30.580]  And I thought your footage of the nights
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.980]  at the Renaissance Fair,
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.140]  here's footage from the real pro camera
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.380]  we're using to shoot this video
[01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.340]  and here's the footage from the iPhone 11 camera.
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:39.340]  It was fair.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:40.180]  I mean, it's certainly,
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:43.260]  it is still amazing for a camera, a cell phone camera,
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.740]  but surprise, surprise,
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.260]  shooting with a truly professional thousand dollar,
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.060]  multi-thousand dollar camera setup
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.980]  is still gonna get better results.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:53.580]  Yeah, and I should also say,
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.300]  and we were thinking about a different review
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.500]  where I was like, I would have to be very clear to say,
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.860]  I'm not a pro photographer.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.940]  I can, you know, think about a shot
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.620]  maybe better than the average person,
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:06.140]  but I still don't think of shots or setting up shots
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.900]  or way to light shots like a pro.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:09.740]  So.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.260]  Did you, what made you pick the Renaissance Fair
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.980]  as a destination for this?
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.580]  Are you a Renaissance Fair person or?
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.420]  I'm definitely,
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:22.460]  I had never been to the Renaissance Fair before
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.540]  and now I just wanna quit my job
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:27.700]  and go live with the Renaissance Fair folk
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.900]  that travel around the country
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.660]  cause it was just mind blowing to me.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:35.580]  But the way I had a completely separate idea
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.820]  that I tried to really orchestrate
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.460]  and I have this new producer, his name is Kenny.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.620]  He's so creative.
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:43.580]  I'm like, I've met my creative match
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.380]  and he just wants to push me to do some
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:48.220]  even more crazy things, which I'm super excited about.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.660]  So we had this idea, we were trying to do it.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.820]  We're trying to get together.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.420]  On Saturday, we had all these things set up
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.780]  to shoot this other video idea
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.660]  and it just completely fell apart.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:59.260]  And I just started doing some searches for, you know,
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:03.100]  places where photographers wanna go in the New York area.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.540]  And this came up as a place
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.900]  where they had a photo contest every year.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:09.340]  And I just said, we're going to the Renaissance Fair.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.060]  We're gonna shoot there all day.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.140]  We're gonna make a video about it
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.300]  cause I'm sure these people are just gonna be amazing
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.180]  to shoot photos and video of.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.260]  And I've actually never turned around a video
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.380]  with so little idea of what it was gonna be
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:24.540]  and so little time before.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:27.620]  Yeah, we did it all in like 48, less than 48 hours.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.220]  That's interesting that it was a plan B
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.260]  because it was a very,
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.020]  I'm not just saying it cause you're on my show.
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.420]  I thought it was a very entertaining video
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:37.500]  and a good camera tests.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.380]  It was cause there were wide angle,
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.500]  super ultra wide angle things you could shoot
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.700]  and then all sorts of interesting people to shoot.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.380]  And there was even like a tent
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:47.540]  where you took a couple of people
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.340]  to try out the portrait mode in low light,
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.220]  which turned out great.
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.540]  And no, I can't believe that I was plan B
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:56.820]  because it came across very good.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:57.660]  And it was very sad.
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:59.740]  Like I was like distraught on Saturday.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.140]  This is like, not only have this like pressure
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.940]  of writing these reviews as you know very well,
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.620]  but I'm like, I wanna do something creative.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.220]  I always like wanna be, you know,
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.100]  do something a little bit different in the videos
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:10.660]  than other people are gonna do.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.900]  And like it all fell apart on Saturday
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.500]  and I was like, you know, just so devastated.
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.300]  And I was like, I cannot go on.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.220]  I cannot go on.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.780]  And then the Renaissance woman got back to me
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:21.540]  and I was like, okay, this is, you know,
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:22.620]  it's meant to be, we're gonna,
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:26.060]  I'm meant to spend Sunday, all day Sunday
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.980]  at a Renaissance fair, not writing my review,
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.860]  but playing with cameras in the Renaissance fair
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:33.020]  and meeting the queen.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:33.980]  And so I stayed up all day
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:35.580]  and then I stayed up all night Sunday writing.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:36.420]  It was.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.460]  Well, meanwhile, you have two column,
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:42.060]  two reviews that you're planning to do for Tuesday morning.
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.820]  I stayed up like pretty much all day Sunday
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:47.140]  and even Monday morning, my editor's like,
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.460]  where's the other piece that you wanted to write?
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.380]  I was like, I haven't written it yet.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:51.100]  He's like, I think that's gonna be, I mean,
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.580]  Wilson has been working with him for five years now.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.860]  Wilson Rothman is just an incredible editor
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.260]  and he just was like, sit down, write your thoughts.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:00.820]  I really think that story that you've been talking about
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.300]  is the one to write.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.660]  And I wrote it down on Monday and he was like,
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.540]  okay, this is good.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:09.460]  Let's print it both on Tuesday morning, so, yeah.
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.700]  I mean, it must be kind of lonely though for you.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:14.260]  I kind of think about you sometimes in this process
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.980]  of you, when you're doing this,
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.860]  like I texted you at some point saying,
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.340]  how are you doing or whatever,
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.300]  but you must get like,
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.460]  do you get lonely when you're writing these?
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.860]  No, maybe, I don't know.
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:30.260]  I text you in Panzorino with questions or Nilay,
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.220]  so that I know the other people who have phones
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:33.220]  and we can talk about it.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:37.540]  Like, didn't you and I do Memojis when they first came out?
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.220]  Cause it's like,
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:41.380]  if you're one of the only people outside Apple
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.780]  who has a phone who can do it,
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.100]  who are you testing it with?
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.340]  Like, you know, so I've got, you know,
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.340]  I've got friends in the,
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.460]  I don't have colleagues at Daring Fireball,
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:52.220]  but I've got friends in the racket that I can do.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.820]  So I don't feel lonely about it.
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.540]  What always strikes me is actually like your pieces,
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:03.100]  they're like, they're just as simple as they are, right?
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.220]  And your site is so simple,
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.340]  although I really appreciated the photos this time.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:10.100]  There's so much still creative work
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.620]  that goes into your writing, right?
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.660]  There's still so much that you have to structure
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.100]  and think about as you write those reviews.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.100]  And I read them very carefully and I said like,
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.140]  this is not just like a first draft of something.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.020]  I mean, if it is, then you're an incredible writer
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.660]  and you don't need an editor.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.260]  But I still think you're a very incredible writer,
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.740]  but you know, having that process
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.620]  of kind of going back and forth over text with somebody
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.580]  is, I don't know, is important to me.
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.460]  Yeah, I don't have that.
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:40.300]  Yeah.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:42.660]  But I don't-
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:43.580]  So what is your process?
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:46.740]  Like, do you write it and you kind of then go back
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.300]  and read it and move some things around
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.060]  or delete some sentences or?
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.660]  My process is crazy.
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:53.100]  And I think that, you know,
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:57.740]  hopefully the end result reads as very,
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:00.700]  the opposite of scattershot, you know?
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:05.380]  Like my intended writing style is to come across
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.700]  as very precise and organized.
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:10.660]  But my process is the complete opposite.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.100]  Remember, did you ever watch 60 Minutes
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.340]  when Andy Rooney was on?
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:15.820]  I've watched episodes.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:17.740]  Yeah, but his office was like,
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.660]  he had like 40 years of junk in his office,
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:20.900]  like piles of paper.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.660]  Like my office is actually a mess too,
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:26.780]  but my process is like Andy Rooney's desk.
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.420]  I should see if I can find a picture of it
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:29.260]  and put it in the show notes.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:31.020]  But it's actually crazy.
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:32.420]  It doesn't even make any sense.
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:33.380]  I keep notes.
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.420]  I carry like a little Field Notes notebook with me
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:36.260]  wherever I go.
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.980]  And, you know, in my back pocket,
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:41.180]  little pocket notebook that fits in the back pocket.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.380]  I take notes in there.
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:46.380]  I keep notes in my iPhone that, you know,
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:47.740]  I'll make a new note for the review
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.660]  and keep notes in my iPhone in the Notes app.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.740]  And then I have like a larger notebook, you know,
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:54.700]  maybe, you know, I forget what size it is,
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:58.740]  but, you know, more like an iPad mini size notebook.
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:47:59.700]  And I keep notes in there.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.460]  That's the one I usually use to take notes during events.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.860]  So I've got like notes in two different physical notebooks,
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.260]  Notes in the Notes app.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:13.380]  And they're somewhat organized by topic,
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.060]  like camera, battery, whatever.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:17.340]  But I just have this jumble of notes
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.620]  in three different sources.
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:22.540]  And then I just sit there and sort of think about it.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:24.940]  And then usually, and, you know, there's always a moment
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:27.100]  of panic where it's like, I don't have an angle on this.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.500]  Like I can't just publish a bunch of bullet points.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.900]  I've, you know, what's the story?
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.060]  And then at some point it comes to me,
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:38.140]  but it's the pressure of the deadline that squeezes it out.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:40.940]  Like my all-nighter is the night before the embargo.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:44.180]  And that's why, like, so I usually don't hit the embargo.
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:48.580]  Like I did for the watch and my,
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.700]  the iPhone, I think I got up at about,
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:55.540]  it was 6 a.m. Eastern was when the embargo dropped.
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:57.820]  I think mine came out at like nine.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.300]  So I was like three hours late,
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.100]  but it probably looked to most people like I hit it
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:05.580]  because who's reading the reviews at six in the morning
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.420]  on the East, let alone three on the West Coast.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:13.020]  So I came close, but it just comes to me.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.460]  I don't know, there's usually, you know,
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:16.500]  eventually I panic over the weekend.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:20.660]  Like Sunday was, I was really in despair about it
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.140]  because I just, I was like, I should, you know,
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:24.500]  and every year I think, you know,
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:25.540]  every time I do these reviews,
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:26.980]  I think I should get started early
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.460]  and then I won't have to stay up all night.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.780]  And I just couldn't think of an angle.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.780]  I couldn't think of a way to start.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.700]  Yeah, that's, I mean, usually like,
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.540]  that's what I said this year.
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:36.700]  I was like, I can't write two pieces.
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:39.220]  Writing two pieces is harder than writing one long one
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.100]  because I got to think of two ways to start.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.940]  Yeah.
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.460]  Two leads is harder than one.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.180]  The other, and the other thing this year was I went back
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.980]  and I had this sense of deja vu that,
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:51.500]  hey, I think that what this,
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.660]  the angle I'm thinking of here
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.180]  feels like what I wrote last year.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:57.820]  And I read my review from last year and I was like,
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:01.260]  shit, this is exactly what I wanted to say this year.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:06.260]  I even used the lead I wanted to use,
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.900]  which was talking, I used this last year with the 10 S
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.500]  that the, one of the years when Phil Schiller
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:15.180]  was on the talk show at WWDC,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.820]  I asked him whether he, that it seems to me,
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:19.380]  and this was like four or five years ago,
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.460]  maybe like four years ago.
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:24.060]  And I said, the camera really seems like an area
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:26.140]  of intense interest at Apple.
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.900]  You guys, the iPhone camera is getting better.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.620]  It seems like every year,
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.740]  it seems like that's a main area of interest.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:35.580]  Do you see Apple as a camera company,
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.620]  like one of the leading, if not the leading,
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:40.620]  and before I even got to the end of the question,
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.480]  he interrupted me on stage and just said, the.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.460]  Like Phil Schiller sees Apple
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:50.020]  as the leading camera company in the world.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.180]  And it was emphatic.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:57.180]  And I know Phil enough and I know he's competitive.
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.580]  And I know that he's very serious about this stuff.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.540]  It's like his reputation within Apple
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:04.580]  is he's a very serious person
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:05.980]  and you better be on your A game
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:09.120]  when you have a meeting with Phil on anything.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.420]  But his on-stage demeanor is friendly.
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.100]  And his on-stage demeanor when he's been on my show
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.660]  is very funny and he's very loose and casual.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:21.740]  And it's him and he's just a natural at it.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.580]  It's just funny
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:24.020]  because he doesn't do a lot of public stuff.
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:26.580]  But he comes on my show and it's like,
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.020]  it seems as though he does people's live podcasts
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.820]  every week, he's so natural at it.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.340]  But when he said that the,
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.460]  that the, like Apple is the leading camera company,
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.380]  it actually took me aback because he got like,
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:41.460]  all of a sudden it was like a shark
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:42.580]  smelling blood in the water.
[01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:45.900]  Like, I just, it just really was like,
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:48.180]  it's like one of the most memorable moments
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:50.500]  of me doing anything live on stage in my life
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.260]  because it was so emphatic.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:54.800]  And I used it as my lead last year
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.520]  to emphasize how serious Apple is as a camera company.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.580]  And then that's what I wanted to write this year.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.400]  I was like, I blew it.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.820]  I used my lead last year.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:02.660]  And so I just went-
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:03.760]  This was the year to do it.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.780]  Well, I went meta.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.620]  So I just went meta and just referenced the fact that I,
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.380]  this is how I started my column last year.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:13.680]  And, you know, you could say the same thing this year
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.580]  and just fill in the new phone names, you know,
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.980]  that it's another.
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:18.980]  And then once I had that and I was like,
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:19.800]  you know what I'm gonna do?
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.720]  I'm just gonna go meta and just reference
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.460]  that I wrote about the camera last year.
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.000]  I'm gonna write about the camera this year.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.600]  Then as soon as I had-
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:28.220]  That's the other thing about my writing style
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:30.060]  for these, even these big reviews.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:32.820]  I need to have my lead first.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:37.540]  I cannot write the middle section-
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:39.180]  I can't move on.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:40.700]  I have to have the beginning.
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:42.620]  And then once I have the beginning,
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:43.820]  it's all of a sudden,
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:46.680]  it's like I've pedaled my bike up the steep hill
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.100]  and now I'm just going downhill
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.620]  and everything pours out after it.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:51.580]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.740]  I'm the same way.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:57.540]  But in theory, in theory, somebody who is less,
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:00.300]  I was gonna say crazy, but I don't know,
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.020]  but just stubborn.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.220]  I just, it's just a stubborn writing trait
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:07.100]  that if I don't have the lead, I can't go on.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.540]  In theory, I should be able to say,
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:12.260]  write the entire camera section.
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:14.020]  I knew what I was gonna show.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.780]  I knew which pictures I wanted to look through
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:16.620]  of all the ones I did.
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:19.040]  I could have written that before I had the lead,
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:19.880]  but I couldn't.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:23.300]  I just personally couldn't bring myself to do it.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:25.540]  I'm the same way, the same way.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.580]  Like I can't look past that.
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:27.680]  I'm just like, I've got to get this.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.520]  I've been asked to be okay with it
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.260]  and then the rest of the piece will write itself.
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.440]  Yeah.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.260]  So if I have the lead, then I can go.
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:38.140]  And if I don't have the lead, I just sit there and stare.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.460]  iOS 13.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.820]  What a weird, weird, weird.
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.780]  I don't even know where to start.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.820]  It's just such a weird release that.
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:52.060]  So what's your take?
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:55.620]  Why did they have to release 13 before 13.1
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.900]  and why didn't 13.1 just become 13
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.860]  and release it two days later, four days later?
[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:04.440]  I wish that I had better sources to tell me and I don't.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.460]  And then sometimes, I know people at Apple
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:07.340]  and they can tell me things
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.380]  and I can say a little birdie said something.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.840]  I don't have any little birdies on this.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.340]  The best that I can put together
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.240]  is there's a couple of factors.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.660]  So one of them is carrier certification
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:22.700]  and with new phones and the new iPhones
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:25.680]  are debuting around the world, not just in the US
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.340]  and all the carriers have some kind of specification
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.000]  of operating systems, et cetera.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.900]  They need to have whatever is gonna ship
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.460]  out of the factory on the brand new phones,
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.180]  they need to have that in the carrier's hands
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.100]  at least weeks in advance.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.540]  So it probably needs to be locked down
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.460]  at the end of August, at the very least,
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:50.980]  probably like mid-August, somewhere around there.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:55.980]  And iOS 13 was just buggier than most of these OS releases
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.020]  over the last few years, certainly iOS 12.
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.780]  iOS 12 was like remarkably unbuggy.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:03.060]  It was really, even the betas last summer
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.420]  were remarkably stable.
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:06.040]  I mean, they were like indistinguishable
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.740]  from regular iOS releases for the most part.
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.580]  iOS 13 was sort of the opposite,
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.340]  especially on the iCloud front.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:15.580]  iCloud changes in particular were really buggy
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.300]  and people who were using them on their main phones
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.120]  all summer really got bit sometimes
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:22.640]  by sinking problems and lost data.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:25.780]  So I think part of it is they had to lock down 13.0
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:29.340]  to come out of the box when you unload your new iPhone
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:33.240]  when it comes early for this carrier certification.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.220]  But it truly is buggy.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:41.180]  I mean, did you encounter a bunch of bugs?
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:43.540]  Yeah, I wrote a short piece yesterday saying that,
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:48.080]  most people should just wait till 13.1 on Tuesday.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.740]  Yeah, I mean, my big things, I mean, I encountered,
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.100]  I had been using 13, I don't know,
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.580]  it wasn't the GM release, but whatever,
[01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:59.900]  the other release on my XR for a while
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.060]  because I was testing sign in with Apple.
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:02.980]  Right, right.
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:06.260]  And I was having a ton of just like small bugs and messages.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:10.500]  Yeah, messages really was buggy, has been buggy for me.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.620]  Yeah, like have you seen this flickering thing
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.580]  and then sometimes the cursor gets stuck?
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:16.080]  Yeah, I've seen the flickering thing
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.800]  and the one for me that I hit a couple of times
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:19.820]  is the keyboard just disappears.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.620]  Yeah, I had that too, I had that too.
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:25.140]  But, so in other words, where the keyboard should be
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.860]  on screen and messages is just a white rectangle
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:31.260]  and you can't, but you can still type.
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:34.900]  So like, it's like when you hit where the S key is,
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:37.900]  you get an S, but you can't see it.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:40.700]  So it is, it's unusable and force quitting and relaunching
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:41.940]  tends to fix it.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.180]  I've had the same kind of thing, but with the cursor,
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:46.540]  I've had the keyboard issue, I think on the XR,
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:49.340]  but on the iPhones, I've had the cursor just get stuck
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:52.580]  in the middle of the type in the text box
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:57.220]  and you can still type, but the cursor's just stuck there.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.520]  I saw that once, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.260]  There's something I've seen, I do a lot of,
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:06.540]  a fair amount of text editing in Safari
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.420]  because if I wanna update Daring Fireball,
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.620]  I don't really post from my phone much,
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.340]  sometimes short pieces, but if somebody sends me a typo
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:19.740]  and I wanna fix a typo, I'd log it into the CMS,
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:22.060]  I log in through Safari, I don't have an app for it,
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.780]  I just go in through Safari.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.780]  And what I usually do is if it's a long piece, right,
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.920]  like my iPhone review, I don't wanna scroll
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.140]  to find where this is, I'll just search for it.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:36.140]  You can go to the share menu and find on page
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:38.200]  and I'll type the word that I misspelled
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.700]  or the missing word and then it finds it
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.660]  and then I select it and fix the typo and hit save
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:47.220]  and it goes on.
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:49.660]  For some reason in Safari on 13.0,
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:52.800]  when you use the find feature,
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.900]  you can't see what you're typing.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.060]  You know how I get highlights in yellow?
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.220]  Instead of selecting it, it's like highlight in yellow.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:02.920]  Here's if I search for Joanna and here's the match
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.940]  and Joanna is highlighted in yellow.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:08.380]  If you tap on it, it's like you type and it is typing
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.900]  and if you hit save, whatever you type is there,
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:13.780]  but you can't see it, it doesn't reflect on screen,
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:15.380]  which is not helpful.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.740]  There's just all sorts of little bugs like that.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.100]  Anyway, that's 13.
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:20.940]  13.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.900]  I mean, the big one is that just like apps
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:23.040]  are randomly crashing.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.300]  Yeah, well, for me.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:29.220]  And the camera app on the 11, or maybe it was 11 Pro.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:33.660]  I mean, both has been just small little things
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:35.380]  opening up to the black screen,
[01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.780]  not being able to hit the shutter button sometimes.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.580]  Yeah, and editing photos sometimes,
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.700]  because they added a lot of editing features.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.860]  They've added-
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:46.340]  It's so many features in there.
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:50.540]  Yeah, like it's stuff like adjusting brightness
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.860]  and contrast and stuff like that.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:54.380]  And they added all of those same features for video,
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:56.560]  which is all brand new to iOS 13.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.740]  So you can apply their filters,
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:00.820]  like the dramatic filter and the vivid filter.
[01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:03.500]  You can apply it all to video and it applies live
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:05.500]  and you can rotate videos.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.700]  So like if you shoot a video
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.860]  that's two degrees off the horizon,
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:11.720]  you can rotate it to fix that.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.060]  Which is-
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:14.880]  I actually haven't tried that.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.380]  Well, it's gonna crash if you're on 13.0.
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:18.220]  Okay.
[01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:21.140]  I got it to lock up.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:23.960]  I thought maybe it actually corrupted the video file.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:27.100]  I was playing with it and it just went green.
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.300]  The video clip just turned completely
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:32.240]  a hundred percent corner to corner green pixels.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.360]  Which is, I think is like often a test pattern,
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.300]  like for video that hasn't started yet.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.500]  It was just a complete-
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.260]  I thought, oh my God, I think it just corrupted the video.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.260]  Force quit, went back in and there it was still there.
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:48.860]  The video clip was fine, but all my edits were lost.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.260]  Anyway, it's buggy.
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.100]  It's not crashing, but I had no idea this was here.
[01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:54.940]  This is awesome.
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:56.780]  Yeah, well, it was crashing for me.
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:58.060]  I don't know, but yeah.
[01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:58.900]  We'll see, let's see.
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:00.780]  A lot of this stuff is hard to reproduce too.
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:02.960]  And I can see why maybe there are hard bugs to fix
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.500]  because you think like, and then all of a sudden
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:06.500]  I'm like making a list of bugs and I'm like,
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:07.660]  okay, I'm gonna restart the phone
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:08.700]  and do the same thing again.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.900]  And this time it didn't crash or this time it worked.
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:11.740]  I was like, wow.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.860]  The turning of the video is kind of like
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:16.140]  just a thing you did not think you needed.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:18.500]  Nope, but I do because it turns out
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:23.160]  I have a very poor sense of what's level.
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:26.140]  I mean, I just flipped this one,
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.860]  like I shot of Noah last night.
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.860]  I had no idea that like now it's completely,
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:32.160]  it's really straight now.
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.220]  I mean, until he like slams into me and the phone falls.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:36.420]  It's a great feature.
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:38.740]  It's also, you know, when it's a really great feature too
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:41.580]  is when like something random happens out on the street,
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:42.420]  you know, like, and you're like,
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.080]  ooh, I gotta capture this on video.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.500]  Like, you know, some kind of incident or something.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:48.140]  And you just quick whip out your phone
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:51.300]  and get to the camera as quick as you can.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.820]  It's like the last thing you're thinking of is this level
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:55.860]  and now you can fix it.
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:57.060]  So it's a great feature.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:59.540]  Anyway, back to why didn't they,
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:00.980]  why did they ship 13.0?
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:02.340]  So I think they needed to ship it
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.980]  because it was carrier certified.
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:08.300]  And here's the X factor at Dieter Bohn
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:10.060]  and I were going back and forth in this yesterday.
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:12.300]  Cause my first thought was if they moved up
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:15.740]  the 13.1 ship date from September 30th,
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.300]  which is what they told us weeks, you know, two weeks ago
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:20.840]  to all the way to next Tuesday, the 24th,
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.880]  which they just announced yesterday,
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.340]  if it's going to come out five days later
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:29.100]  and it should be more stable,
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.380]  why not just have everybody wait for that?
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:35.100]  So one of the factors that has to come into play
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:39.460]  is that the new Apple watches require iOS 13.
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.960]  So if you get a series five Apple watch,
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.260]  your paired iPhone has to be on iOS 13.
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:49.100]  It's just, you know, that's just the way Apple ties
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.740]  new hardware to the latest OS.
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:55.000]  And so if they were gonna start shipping the watches today,
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.700]  the 20th, they had to ship iOS 13.0
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:02.980]  so that people who get a watch can actually set it up.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:06.240]  Like it would be no fun if you got like, you know,
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.800]  ding dong, UPS comes, here's your new series five
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:11.940]  Apple watch you just spent a couple hundred bucks on.
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.700]  Please keep it in the box for five days
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:17.540]  until iOS 13.1 comes out, right?
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.460]  I guess that's why, I don't know.
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:24.460]  But my advice to everybody is just wait for 13.1.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:27.060]  I know that people wanna play the Apple arcade
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:29.660]  and there's, you know, and if you really have to,
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.260]  or if you're willing to, you know, treat it as a beta,
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:34.620]  if you were willing to put a beta on your phone,
[02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:36.340]  then you might as well install 13.0,
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:39.220]  but know that it's effectively beta quality.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.620]  Yeah, I had a lot of, you know,
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:44.280]  what I consider nerd Twitter users, you know,
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.160]  kind of yelling at me yesterday saying,
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.000]  why are you saying that?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.060]  I put it on my phone, it's fine.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.200]  It's like, you probably had the beta.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.860]  Like my readers are not the people that had the beta.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:53.820]  They're going to get this.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:55.300]  They're gonna wonder why the camera doesn't,
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.140]  you know, is slow or whatever.
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:00.580]  You know, like just, it's four days, four days.
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:03.140]  Yeah, well, and the other thing that I don't know,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:04.900]  and I haven't installed it on,
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.620]  I have an older phone that I was testing the 13 betas on,
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:09.700]  but I never put it,
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:11.940]  because the betas never seemed fully baked to me
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:13.140]  all summer long,
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:15.580]  I never put it on my regular day-to-day iPhone.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:20.140]  My, and my personal iPhone XS still has iOS 12.4.1
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:22.740]  or whatever the latest 12.4 version is,
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:26.540]  still has, because I just, I don't want to put 13 on it.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:28.620]  And I still like having it to compare like,
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:31.760]  hey, what's new from iOS 12 to iOS 13.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  But I don't, I can only assume that internally at Apple,
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:43.180]  their focus with this 13.0 release
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.420]  was very specifically on the new iPhones, right?
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:48.660]  Because they're the ones that have to have it.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:51.620]  And so I can only, my guess, I can't prove it.
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:55.740]  My guess is it's least buggy on the iPhone 11s,
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:59.560]  because they're the ones that they were focused, yeah.
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:02.340]  But what a weird release.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:06.940]  I mean, the fact that 13.1, not 13.0.1, like a minor bug fix,
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:11.100]  but like a pretty serious bug fix and feature additions,
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.100]  right, like the shared folders are shipping.
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:16.400]  There's a whole bunch of the features of iOS 13
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.400]  are shipping too, five days later, which is kind of nuts.
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:24.280]  Right, the big, I thought they'd hold those
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.380]  for another release.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:28.700]  But when I spoke to Apple yesterday, like, no,
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:32.900]  directional AirDrop is gonna be in there,
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.300]  and the audio sharing for AirPods is gonna be in there.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:40.380]  Yeah, and the shared folders, I forget what else.
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:42.360]  There's a couple others, but there's still other stuff
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.260]  that is coming later, like the deep focus camera feature
[02:04:45.260 --> 02:04:46.540]  is still coming.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:50.240]  I presume 13.2, probably like late October,
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.780]  maybe November or something like that,
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.660]  but there's still other stuff that's coming,
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:57.100]  but a lot of stuff is coming Tuesday.
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:59.180]  I worry, and it'll be interesting to see,
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.460]  and it'll give us stuff to write about
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:04.460]  if 13.1 is still relatively buggy
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:06.220]  compared to what we should expect
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:08.940]  from a non-beta release of the OS.
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:12.680]  Some of my developer friends are still a little skeptical
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:15.260]  that 13.1 is in good shape.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.500]  Yeah, I mean, it's a good release too.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:23.460]  I like that it doesn't actually have that many new features,
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:25.780]  and it kind of concentrates on some of the things
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:28.280]  that people have wanted or have, I mean, dark mode,
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.340]  I guess, being the biggest one.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:32.180]  But for me, the sign-in with Apple,
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:34.340]  so I'm super excited about that.
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:37.420]  Yeah, what have you been able to test that with?
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:40.540]  So Apple gave me, or some of the developers gave me access
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:42.600]  to some of the first apps that are gonna use it,
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.060]  admittedly, they're very small apps.
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:46.420]  I use the bird scooter app,
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:49.500]  I use the Life Cake photo sharing app.
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:52.180]  But it was just interesting
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:54.100]  to see the onboarding experience,
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:56.300]  the experience of going in to hide your email,
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:58.560]  going in to actually hide your name.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.300]  And it's all very, very quick.
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:03.700]  And even better, it's like, it just is very seamless
[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:07.260]  to log into all of these apps using Face ID
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:09.420]  or whatever other way you've set up
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.260]  a second form of authentication on the iPhone.
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:16.060]  Yeah, I wrote this in the piece and did this in the video.
[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:19.140]  I think there's so many privacy benefits.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:22.860]  I just really, it seems from speaking to some developers,
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:25.380]  certainly they're gonna be sort of forced into this by Apple
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:28.780]  but they definitely don't seem eager to use it.
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:30.380]  Yeah, I wonder why.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:32.060]  Like, I don't understand why developers
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:33.300]  are not eager to use it,
[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.960]  but I can see why the marketing people at companies
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:40.420]  that want to have your real, the people's real email address
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.420]  so they can send them all sorts of email
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.960]  right to their real email want that.
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.160]  But I'm not sure why developers are so loathe to do it.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.660]  I guess it's just like, ah,
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.300]  because you're just adding,
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.820]  because they're not gonna get rid of the sign in
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:55.820]  with Facebook, they're gonna add the sign in with Apple
[02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:59.740]  and now it's just one more thing to keep working.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:01.180]  Yeah, I mean, it's that,
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.780]  I think one of the interesting responses I heard
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:07.460]  was from Tinder, which was saying they're more worried
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:12.020]  about how they can not have anonymous users
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:13.980]  and having people who abuse the system
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:15.800]  and go back and make new accounts
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.700]  when they're trying to either abuse the system or whatnot.
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:21.940]  And how do they keep track of those people
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:24.440]  when they don't have any information about them?
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:28.180]  So those are some smaller details
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.980]  that they seem to be trying to work out with developers.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.660]  I mean, they all certainly just don't get
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:38.660]  as much information as if you're logging in with Facebook.
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:40.380]  I mean, Facebook, I had gone back and looked
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:42.980]  and talked a lot about this in the video.
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.620]  You go back and you look and you're like,
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.380]  you didn't even realize what kind of info you were giving
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:49.660]  to some of these app developers.
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.300]  And it's there in small writing,
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:52.780]  but everything's turned on default.
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:56.820]  So everything from birthdays to likes to photos,
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:58.700]  just, it's not something you thought about.
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:07:59.900]  No, it really...
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:03.980]  Why in the world would they share your likes?
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:04.820]  Like, it just is crazy.
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.280]  I don't know.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:09.140]  Like, I mean, there's a whole list of thing.
[02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:11.380]  I mean, like, I guess because they wanna wish you
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:13.140]  a happy birthday, but there's a lot of other stuff
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:14.060]  they could do with that.
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:14.900]  I mean...
[02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:16.060]  It's like they're one step away
[02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:18.140]  from sharing the last four digits
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.020]  of your social security number,
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:23.500]  like everything that they would need to like impersonate you.
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:25.300]  I love what we did, but you should watch the video.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.140]  We hired these comedians and we just let them sort of riff
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:30.660]  on like what Facebook would need to get you in the door.
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:32.100]  We should do this video that I did.
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:34.960]  And the woman is just hilarious.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.700]  She's like, do you have any water birth photos?
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:38.580]  We'd like to see those.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:39.500]  I can't wait to see it.
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:40.420]  I will look for it.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:42.960]  All right.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:43.780]  I guess that's a wrap.
[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:45.260]  I mean, is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:47.380]  I mean, that's a long show, right?
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:48.580]  Are we over two hours?
[02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:50.060]  We can't go under two hours.
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:50.900]  Oh yeah, we're over two hours.
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:51.740]  We're over two hours.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:54.220]  Yeah, I only set aside this amount of time
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.540]  for you two times a year.
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:58.900]  Well, I enjoy it very much.
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:00.260]  I enjoy it too.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.740]  No, and it's, you know, a good time of the year.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:04.300]  I know we can't, I cannot let you go.
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:05.220]  Thank God I thought of this.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:06.540]  Cannot let you go.
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:09.620]  I saw on Twitter the other day
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:13.780]  that you were in the Apple store with your MacBook.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:16.620]  Yes, it's so funny, John.
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:18.820]  I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:20.780]  It's so funny that during this week
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:22.340]  where I needed to write, I was like,
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:25.280]  I finally cannot take it any longer.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.780]  So how, what was the, so you took your MacBook Air
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:30.740]  in to get the keyboard swapped?
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:32.700]  Yeah, you know, I wrote the big piece
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:35.660]  and it was in, when did I write it, in April?
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:37.140]  Were you, was that when you were on my show
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:38.460]  or were you on before that?
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:42.700]  Because by the way, I, you know what, you were on before.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:45.380]  So you're, can you tell people,
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:47.700]  for those who don't remember the gimmick,
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:50.500]  the gimmick of your column on the MacBook keyboards?
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:52.780]  Actually, you know what?
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:54.700]  I had told you I was writing this piece.
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.820]  We saw each other in New York and I told you
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:59.420]  I gotta write something, I'm planning something big.
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:03.780]  So in March of this year, in March,
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:07.940]  I did a piece on how my MacBook Air butterfly keyboard,
[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:11.100]  the Air that I had been bought from the company in 2018,
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:14.580]  the one, the Air that I recommended and was so happy to,
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:15.900]  I think that was the last time I was on the show.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.260]  I talked about my review of the Air.
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:20.340]  Yeah, the retina MacBook Air that the whole world
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.260]  had been waiting for for a couple of years.
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:23.860]  Yeah, and I fell in love with it
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:25.980]  and I recommended the shit out of it.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.860]  And so I would say it was probably
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:32.380]  in early March, end of February,
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:34.100]  the keyboard just started to go.
[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.140]  Like certain keys were sticking, they were double pressing
[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:38.220]  and I just couldn't believe it.
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:40.020]  So I started doing some research and I was like,
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.300]  this is happening again, this is happening again.
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:44.700]  I contacted lots of people who had the issues.
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:46.820]  I tried to get in touch with Apple engineers
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:49.380]  who ended up ratting on me and went to Apple PR.
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:53.140]  I mean, I was really trying to dig into this and you know,
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.820]  I just had this idea, I'm gonna write this column
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.140]  with the way my keyboard's writing
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:59.260]  and that's with missing letters and so.
[02:11:00.340 --> 02:11:02.380]  But it was so brilliant
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:04.180]  because it wasn't just that you wrote it
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:06.220]  with misspellings and missing letters.
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:09.060]  There was JavaScript code and sliders
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:12.740]  where the reader could adjust it.
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:14.060]  Like, how did you go about that?
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:16.180]  How did you make that happen?
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.900]  Well, I told Wilson, my editor, he's like,
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.980]  okay, sounds like an idea, I don't know Joanna.
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:21.460]  Typically he says these things to me
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:23.900]  just knowing like I'll figure out a way and come back soon
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:24.940]  with a better idea.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:26.900]  And I went over to our graphics desk and I said,
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.860]  guys, I just, I wanna remove the E's.
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:33.260]  I wanna remove the E's from my column
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:35.380]  but if I do it, then no one will be able to read it.
[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:38.140]  So we need a way to like, you know, they get to the page,
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:42.060]  there's no E's, maybe there's no R's and they can't read it
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:44.700]  but then we let them turn on the E's and the R's.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:46.500]  And the guy was like, oh, they'll look around,
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:47.820]  I'll see if I can find somebody to do it.
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:49.780]  Elliot Bentley works on our graphics desk
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:52.420]  and he's like, nobody can do this, but I wanna do it,
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:54.020]  it sounds hilarious.
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:56.580]  And so he just coded up this page and then he's like,
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:58.580]  and I also told him that there were these double presses
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:00.140]  and he's like, let's put that in too.
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:02.880]  Let's, you know, give people that option too.
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:06.220]  And I mean, I did hear from a lot of people
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:07.820]  who didn't realize they could turn them on
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:10.540]  and they said, you know, this is a bullshit article,
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:12.140]  I can't read it, how am I supposed to read it?
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:13.620]  And I tell people that you could turn it on.
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:17.180]  But yeah, so then after that, a month later,
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:19.660]  I like to think I take some credit, not all the credit
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:23.660]  and I also take your piece or linking to me as some credit,
[02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.580]  you know, Apple said, okay,
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:26.220]  we gotta do something about this.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:29.900]  And they improved the amount of time to repair in stores,
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:34.020]  they rolled out the, you know, generation 3.5,
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:37.140]  they knew this was a big PR disaster.
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.740]  And so I sort of said, okay, I'm gonna get it replaced,
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.740]  but like, I just was dragging my feet on it,
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.360]  I don't know why.
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  I also installed this unshaky app extension on my MacBook
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.400]  and it kind of got rid of the double presses.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.360]  So I was like, okay, I can live with it.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.040]  And then end of summer, I was like,
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:55.200]  I can't live with this anymore,
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.420]  so I need to get this fixed
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.420]  by the time I go to the Apple event.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:03.420]  I went to the store, the Wall Street store here in New York
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:06.560]  and they said they didn't have the part.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.440]  So I really, really felt like I affected my change.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.280]  And also it's like amazing,
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.680]  I go in and they have no idea who I am, right?
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.800]  So they're like, oh, how do you know it's broken?
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.080]  But I was gonna ask if you thought you got recognized.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.840]  Sometimes I do at an Apple store and sometimes I don't.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.560]  I have been recognized at Apple stores.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:26.920]  Like two years ago, I did this piece on iCloud
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.840]  and I just snuck into the iCloud learning session.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:33.160]  And the guy just said to me, he's like,
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:34.000]  what are you doing here?
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.080]  And I was like, I'm learning about iCloud.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.520]  And he's like, I doubt it.
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.440]  And I was like, no, no, I'm here just learning about iCloud.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.360]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:44.240]  But no, they had no idea.
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:45.920]  That's just fun, like I play along
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:47.280]  and I don't wanna tell them who I am.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:49.120]  And I don't wanna like, you know, I'm just like,
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.240]  oh, I'm just pretty sure it's broken.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.760]  I'm actually, I'm pretty positive.
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.640]  I'm pretty positive it needs to be replaced.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.040]  And they're like, oh, okay, we have to go look.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:13:59.400]  And I was like, if you look in my records,
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.280]  I was here and back in March,
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.320]  you guys replaced one or two keys.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.520]  This thing needs to be replaced.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:05.920]  Okay, we gotta look at it.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.280]  And then they went in the back and they said,
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.240]  we're sorry, we don't have the part here.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.640]  We gotta order it, that's gonna take a week.
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.160]  So we can hold onto it.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.880]  And I said, okay, well,
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.320]  I'll bring it back when you have the part.
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.480]  And I came back another time, dropped it off
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.160]  and then took about 48 hours for them to swap it out.
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.160]  And then finally got it back this week.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.280]  Can I tell you, I cannot believe
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.360]  I almost let you get off the show without telling you this.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.680]  I do have little birdies sometimes.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.640]  And one of the things that I heard was the,
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:40.640]  was it July where they came out with new hardware
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.040]  for like the back to school season with new MacBooks.
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:48.400]  And it was like the air got rejiggered,
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:50.280]  but it still has the same CPU and everything.
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:53.440]  They really just updated it so that it ships,
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.240]  like somebody who bought a new air in August
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.120]  would get the one with the new 3.5 gen keyboard.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:03.680]  Can I, I know for a fact that your column
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.880]  was influential in that Apple rejiggered
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:10.880]  their hardware schedule to get that half generation
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.440]  hardware thing out.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.840]  I don't think that the explanation was well,
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.880]  because of this one column from Joanna Stern
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.760]  in the Wall Street Journal, we need to do this.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:21.560]  But it was like maybe the straw that broke the camel's back.
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:25.760]  Like internally, your column was a,
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:28.080]  let's actually change our plans.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.640]  This is, that's how bad, this is how bad it's gotten.
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.120]  We actually need to change our plans
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:36.080]  because Apple doesn't really do half gen updates
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.320]  on MacBooks anymore.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:40.680]  And then back in the day, they would be updated
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.480]  for random components here and there.
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.480]  But for the most part now, they're more sweeping updates.
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.440]  And your column in particular was like a,
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.840]  this got escalated to the highest levels of the company
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:55.720]  and like, this is bad.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:59.360]  Yeah, and I actually, the column,
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.280]  look, it was a clever way to do it.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.920]  I did not think it would get as much attention as it would
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:08.720]  until I had the statement from Apple, which was sorry.
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.120]  And I got that statement in my email
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.160]  and I just jumped up and down.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:15.480]  I was like, they're fucking saying they're sorry.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.120]  Like, that's where I kind of knew that this was,
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.560]  and I mean, I had known from my reporting
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.880]  from talking to so many people
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.440]  and seeing that this was happening again
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.640]  on this specific model.
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:28.040]  I mean, I made a spreadsheet of 20 people at least
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:29.720]  that I had been emailing back and forth with
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:31.800]  asking what letters were, what were breaking.
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.200]  I mean, they're like, I actually did true reporting
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:37.120]  to figure out that this was really happening.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:41.400]  Well, and the hell of it is really that it wasn't random.
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.960]  It really was seemingly for the most part based on usage.
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:47.560]  So the most likely keys to have problems
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.600]  were the ones you use the most.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.480]  Like your gimmick of the column of having the Es disappear
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:58.480]  wasn't just to make it as unreadable as possible.
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:16:59.680]  It was fair.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.040]  That's partly what made the column so powerful
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.880]  is that the Es and Rs and the spacebars
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:07.760]  are among the most common keys to have problems
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:10.760]  because it seemingly is usage-based
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.760]  that it's by hitting the E key more frequently
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.120]  than every other alphabet letter on the keyboard
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:19.160]  that it caused the problem.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.920]  So the fact that it was scathing
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:26.240]  and really made Apple and the keyboards look bad
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:29.000]  is one thing, but the thing that really to me resonated
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.600]  is that it was fair.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:32.880]  Yeah, and I still to this day,
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:36.560]  I would love some actual technical explanation from Apple
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:37.720]  what's going on with these
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.280]  because they thought they fixed it with the,
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:43.520]  I like to call it the condom.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.560]  They put the condom on the top,
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:48.080]  they thought that was gonna fix it
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:51.480]  and they still just have not really fully explained
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.520]  what's happening here.
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.960]  And it's just like, are these things too delicate?
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:58.760]  Only so many times I can speak to engineers
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:02.400]  and I fix it about what they think is wrong.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:03.360]  And what's their explanation?
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:04.840]  They say something to the effect of
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:08.640]  that they have made a material change, whatever that means.
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:10.600]  And that could mean like multiple things
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:13.840]  like does that mean you're using a different material
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.960]  to manufacture certain components
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:18.880]  or do you mean material in the other sense
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:21.240]  where it's like a meaningful change?
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.080]  And it's like-
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.920]  No, no, I think they actually mean material,
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:25.520]  like physical something.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.160]  They did clarify for that for me off the record
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.780]  that yes, do we mean that there are parts of the keyboard
[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:33.560]  that are using a different material
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.840]  in the manufacturing process that should be more durable?
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:41.400]  And it seems to me that anecdotally that it is,
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:42.720]  like I still don't think it's great.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.300]  I think that I really do think that my belief is that
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:48.740]  I don't know if it's gonna happen later this year
[02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:50.440]  or next year or whatever,
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.000]  but that there will be a new keyboard design in MacBooks.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:54.840]  And well-
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:56.680]  Yeah, this thing's done.
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:01.600]  Talk about when we in the audience
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.440]  might applaud.
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:06.160]  Oh, I will stand up, I will stand up, a standing ovation.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:09.440]  Well, let's sit, I'll try to sit next to you.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.440]  We'll be our own little standing ovation.
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:17.800]  Please, tell my bosses at the Wall Street Journal
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.640]  I got up and clapped, I mean, really.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.880]  Well, let's just get up and go just run down the aisle
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:26.380]  and storm the stage and give out hugs.
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:27.640]  But I really do think it's gonna happen.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:29.720]  And I really do think though in the meantime,
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:34.720]  as a stop gap measure, this 3.5 Gen hardware update
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.800]  really was, I know it was influenced by your column
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:39.480]  because it was just so devastating.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.920]  And I mentioned it this week-
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.640]  I mean, I'm sure I'll win the Pulitzer for this.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:46.600]  It's the holy grail of column writing, right?
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:50.240]  That your column has an effect on the world, right?
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.120]  It absolutely does.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.400]  Right, it's what you want.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.880]  And sometimes the best way to do it isn't to be literal.
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:59.340]  Like if you had just written that column straightforward
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:01.300]  and said, written a column that said,
[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:03.540]  hey, my E's and R's don't work sometimes.
[02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:05.280]  And sometimes I get double letters.
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.920]  It would not have had the effect
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.920]  that the gimmick had, right?
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:15.240]  Yeah, and honestly, for me, it was just like,
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:17.680]  I started writing and I was like,
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:19.400]  people won't be able to read this,
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:21.560]  but this is how it's really writing for me.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.880]  How did it run in print?
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:27.200]  We just read that, I think the first graph
[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:30.720]  and then we just said, we re-corrected it
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:32.480]  and the graph down had it.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.560]  And then we had the headline.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.440]  I mean, the headline too was huge.
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:37.480]  And it was also, that was totally,
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.520]  that was the way I wrote the headline.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.560]  What was the headline?
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:43.800]  All the E's were missing.
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:45.160]  Oh, right.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:48.160]  So it was like Apple with no E still hasn't fixed,
[02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:50.560]  no E, MacBook and keyboard has no E.
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:53.000]  Oh, and no R, oh wait, no.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.400]  We actually missed the R in the, whoops.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  I'm looking at it now.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.320]  It was, it was a devastating headline.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:01.160]  It really was.
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:01.980]  Yeah.
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:02.820]  Oh, anyway.
[02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:03.840]  I mean, between this and the Galaxy Fold,
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:06.920]  I was busy this past spring on these things.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:11.320]  Do you think they're gonna ship the Galaxy Fold?
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:15.600]  I know that they're supposed to, but I mean.
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:16.440]  I think.
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:17.280]  It looks like it.
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:20.080]  I mean, I can't say too much,
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:23.800]  but I'm supposed to speak with the company soon.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:24.640]  I don't know.
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.160]  I still think they're gonna run out the clock
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:28.400]  and then come out with a different fold.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.280]  I think they're gonna run out.
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:32.640]  Maybe they'll ship it, but I think they're gonna,
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.600]  part of me thinks that they're just gonna run out the clock
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.480]  and tell people they're coming out with it,
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:38.480]  delay, delay, and then come out with a new,
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:41.060]  an entirely different folding phone.
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:41.900]  There's no doubt in my mind
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:45.560]  they're gonna ship a folding phone that will actually work.
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:46.940]  I don't know whether it would be good,
[02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:49.840]  but I don't think that the one that they were going to ship
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:52.000]  is going to ship, but we'll see.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.640]  I mean, they announced last week or two weeks ago
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:56.320]  all these improvements that they've made
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:57.160]  and they're shipping.
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:58.960]  I actually think they're starting to ship in Korea.
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:00.080]  Yeah, maybe.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.000]  Well, then maybe I'm wrong.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:02.840]  Anyway.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:04.840]  Anyway, congratulations.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.600]  I mean it sincerely, column of the year.
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:08.720]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:09.840]  It really was.
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:12.440]  It was so great and really had the effect
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.660]  on the actual world, so, whoa.
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.080]  Yeah, I mean, mostly I got those butterflies,
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:17.920]  the real butterflies,
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.960]  and that was the biggest accomplishment of my life.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.880]  You don't know what it's like to order butterflies.
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:26.520]  Everybody, of course, can read your fine work
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.520]  at the Wall Street Journal
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:30.080]  and on Twitter, you're just Joanna Stern,
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:32.540]  the most obvious and easiest username
[02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:33.840]  to remember of all time.
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:36.140]  Thank you for coming back on the show.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:38.420]  I guess I should thank my sponsors,
[02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:41.760]  Squarespace, Linode, and Fracture,
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:44.480]  and I hope to see you soon.
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.280]  Hopefully I will see you at a MacBook event later this fall
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:51.000]  and we can sit together and do our standing ovation.
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:56.360]  No, my guess is I do think they're gonna have an event.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:58.160]  Because we know the Mac Pro is coming.
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.580]  I can't believe that they would do it without an event,
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.080]  although I guess with the iMac Pro,
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:03.560]  they didn't have an event when it shipped.
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:06.240]  They had us, they did those demos.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.280]  Did you go to that?
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:08.120]  It was like-
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:08.940]  Yeah, New York.
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:09.780]  Yeah, and they had just,
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:11.960]  so maybe they'll do something like that.
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:14.400]  Instead of having an audience event, maybe they'll do,
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.160]  I think they're gonna do something though
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:18.200]  because the Mac Pro is definitely coming.
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:19.120]  They're gonna wanna show it off.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.880]  I think that there will be new iPad Pros
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:23.580]  because I think that they've got the iPad Pros
[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:25.120]  on the same schedule as the iPhone now,
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:27.420]  where like six weeks after iPhone's
[02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:29.740]  with the A whatever number,
[02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:34.740]  the iPad Pros come out with the A13X and it's insanely fast.
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:37.520]  So-
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.760]  Yeah, I think they're also probably gonna do
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:41.440]  this little tracker, this title tracker thing.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.900]  It just feels like it's gonna come before holiday.
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:47.240]  I think so too, and so I kind of feel like late October.
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:49.000]  And you know, when they do a second event,
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.520]  they usually do like October 20 something,
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:55.440]  and they often pick like a unique locale.
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:56.440]  Remember like two years ago,
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.360]  they had the event at the Chicago High School
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:01.380]  and last year it was the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.180]  I hope it's New York.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.760]  I don't really hope it's not California.
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:09.240]  I have a conference in California on the 21st.
[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:11.800]  So if anyone's listening,
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:15.120]  make sure the wifi is good on the 28th some place.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:17.080]  Anyway, Joanne, I hope to see you then.
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:17.920]  Yes, you too.
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:18.740]  Thanks for being here.
