[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  haven't been on the show in a while. Last time I looked it up. It was episode 211. It was the
[00:04.880 --> 00:11.280]  last Jedi Star Wars spectacular with with guy English and a cavalcade of other other stars.
[00:11.280 --> 00:15.360]  Somehow you've gone a year and a half without being on my show. But now here you are. And I've
[00:15.360 --> 00:20.560]  had the entire cast of ATP on consecutive episodes. Well, there you go. Well, you're
[00:20.560 --> 00:28.160]  really afraid that like I haven't been on like it's my fault. You know, I'm not the actor in
[00:28.160 --> 00:33.680]  that sense. I haven't been on. Is that a thing I can do? Can I just come on? Yeah, you can always
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.240]  just pop on. Yeah, just keep your Skype open. Invite yourself on. That's how that's how it
[00:38.240 --> 00:43.520]  works. But I thought it was a special special relationship, as they say. How's your summer
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.280]  going? Pretty good. It's good. Good summer this year, I think. I saw a bunch of your pictures on
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.120]  Instagram. Boy, your kids are getting big. All of our kids are getting big. They're monsters.
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.320]  My daughter is at a post. Most of the pictures I have, but she's she's taller than everyone in the
[00:58.320 --> 01:06.960]  family now. Practically not taller than you. No, no. Jonas is sprouting up. He's he has a we were
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.720]  I guess I forget he took jeans to Marcus Peach House, but he had to take jeans somewhere. And
[01:14.720 --> 01:21.120]  it was a pair of jeans that, you know, in a way that that Amy knows. But they were definitely
[01:21.120 --> 01:25.520]  a pair of jeans that he had just worn like the last week of school. And they're too short.
[01:26.880 --> 01:35.280]  It was the end of July. Yeah, they do that. Oh, man, we've got we've got a fair amount to
[01:35.280 --> 01:44.160]  talk about. I want to go down history lane maybe later on. Just talk about Mac OS in general. It
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.200]  struck me today to look it up. I seem to to remember and my memory served me correctly that
[01:49.200 --> 01:58.240]  you ended your 15 year series of extensive Mac OS 10 reviews. I guess ending with OS 10 reviews
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.720]  at 10.10 I guess because you thought that was a nice number. But now we're up to 1015 this
[02:04.720 --> 02:10.320]  summer. So now we will have the fifth one that you have not reviewed. Talk about it later.
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.480]  Other thing I wanted to talk about. Every once in a while I bring it up. But I like to sometimes
[02:18.480 --> 02:23.600]  wonder when's the last time you changed your mind, not you in particular, but one has changed
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.360]  their mind. I think it's a problem with our species in general that we we make up our minds
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.400]  and we don't. We don't change them. But if you don't change your mind, what's your assumption
[02:34.400 --> 02:38.000]  that you're always right? You've never been wrong. If you're not changing your mind, you're not
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.920]  identifying the times that you're wrong, right? Well, you may have arrived at what you think is
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.960]  the correct answer after a series of wrong answers. Because if you have your mind made
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.760]  up about something and it's because that's the right answer, changing it would change
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.840]  it to the wrong answer. So right. So just because you change your mind doesn't mean
[02:57.840 --> 03:01.280]  that you're now correct. But I guess I get your larger point for sure.
[03:02.560 --> 03:11.680]  I would like to revise and amend my commentary on the Siri recorded privacy issue.
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.720]  Well, you should because you blew that one. I did. I totally did. And it was bad timing
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.520]  where in addition to in addition to being wrong and should have been, I shouldn't have been wrong,
[03:21.520 --> 03:28.640]  I should have thought this through better. Then after Marco and I recorded my last episode,
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.120]  then, of course, on a Friday, that's when Apple, you know, issued a statement and sort of
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.240]  acknowledged the scope of what's going on, which I thought looked pretty bad. Like there were some
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.760]  tidbits that we didn't know about before. I saw two articles. I know Matthew Panzerino had one at
[03:45.760 --> 03:52.880]  TechCrunch and then Sam Byford had one for The Verge. And I thought this was a real eye opener.
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.840]  In Byford's article at The Verge, it's like the third paragraph says Apple did not comment on
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.800]  whether in addition to pausing the program or contractors listen to Siri voice recordings,
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.480]  it would also stop actually saving those recordings on its servers. That's a bit weird
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.640]  that they're not going to say whether or not they're somebody at Apple knows whether they're
[04:14.640 --> 04:22.880]  still saving the recordings. Currently, the company says it keeps recordings for six months
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.720]  before removing identifying information from a copy that it could keep for two years or more.
[04:28.720 --> 04:35.280]  Two years. Holy smokes. Right. Who the hell knew that this was going on? Well, that's kind of the
[04:35.280 --> 04:41.200]  whole thing. Like it's it's easy to, you know, read the sort of the letter of the law surrounding
[04:41.200 --> 04:48.320]  this and come up with an explanation that makes it seem perfectly normal. But the spirit of Apple's
[04:48.320 --> 04:55.680]  privacy stance is in exact opposition to this very thing. The idea that you agree to something
[04:55.680 --> 04:58.960]  that you don't really read this some sort of amorphous thing that gives Apple the right to
[04:58.960 --> 05:06.720]  collect a bunch of information. And then, you know, they like the normal company, the way it
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.520]  works with big companies is you realize that like they're doing way more than you thought they were.
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.360]  You didn't read it. And not only did you not read it, but you can't even imagine the things
[05:15.360 --> 05:18.560]  they're doing based on the vague language of this in that agreement that you didn't read.
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.560]  Whereas the Apple one is you don't read it. And you what you expect is to be surprised by
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.160]  how good their stance on privacy really is. Like, that's always the thing. People like Apple,
[05:28.160 --> 05:31.040]  you know, how many people have you heard? Just assume that Apple does something
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.280]  nefarious because everybody else does it. And you try to convince them. No,
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.680]  Apple doesn't do that. Apple doesn't actually make money from advertising. They don't actually
[05:39.680 --> 05:44.240]  sell your location information when you use maps to, you know, Starbucks so they can present you
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.600]  with a car like all these things that everyone assumes they do. The whole Apple thing is
[05:48.400 --> 05:52.720]  in many cases, you will be surprised by the evil thing that Apple is not doing.
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.880]  But this particular case is the opposite. It's the way the rest of the world works.
[05:57.840 --> 06:02.880]  They did a thing and we're surprised by how bad it actually is.
[06:04.000 --> 06:09.920]  Here's a statement from a guy named Steve Jobs back in 2010 at the D8 conference. That's the
[06:10.640 --> 06:13.440]  I guess it was the Wall Street Journal at the time, but that was Walt Mossberg and
[06:13.440 --> 06:20.240]  Kara Swisher's conference where Steve Jobs used to appear in those high back red chairs
[06:20.240 --> 06:26.080]  more years than not, I think. But he was talking about privacy all the way back in 2010. And he
[06:26.080 --> 06:30.960]  said, privacy means people know what they're signing up for in plain English and repeatedly.
[06:31.600 --> 06:37.280]  I believe people are smart and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them.
[06:37.280 --> 06:42.560]  Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them.
[06:43.120 --> 06:46.240]  Let them know precisely what you're going to do with their data.
[06:46.240 --> 06:53.280]  I can't think of a single thing to criticize in that statement. And it seems like it's almost
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.240]  spot on a description of what's wrong with this series story. Because we still don't really know
[06:58.240 --> 07:04.000]  what's going on. We don't really know are these recordings that are getting reviewed all from
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.120]  the hey dingus verbal commands? Are some of them the ones that were manually initiated when you
[07:09.120 --> 07:14.880]  hold down the button? Which devices? Are they the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are
[07:14.880 --> 07:22.560]  in places? You had a good rant on ATP about, you know, of course they want them for debugging
[07:22.560 --> 07:27.840]  purposes. If Siri is mishearing certain commands or doing the wrong thing in response to them,
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.880]  there's no way that, well, I shouldn't say there's no way, but it's very difficult to fix it
[07:33.440 --> 07:40.720]  without being able to listen to the recording. But we don't know when they get sent. I still don't
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.280]  know. I'm still not sure now that I think about it and really go deep. I'm not sure how much of
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.600]  this gets processed on device period, whether they're saving their recordings on servers or not.
[07:50.640 --> 07:53.920]  It's unclear to me like how much of Siri still works when you're in airplane mode.
[07:55.040 --> 07:58.080]  Yeah, that was a question when I had an ATP and I had just assumed that the transcription
[07:58.080 --> 08:02.320]  was done on device because the devices are so powerful. But Marco told me that's not
[08:02.320 --> 08:05.920]  actually the case and it's sending everything over the network. I don't know about everything,
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.720]  though. See, I don't believe that. I don't know. Well, the audio anyway for the purpose of
[08:10.720 --> 08:16.720]  transcription. Anyway, the point is this is entirely opaque to the user and the Apple
[08:16.720 --> 08:22.000]  experience that we all want and that we were promised is that it's actually better than we
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.080]  think it is. And in this case, it's either worse than we think it is or, depending on how cynical
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.480]  you are, it's exactly the way we think it is. Like, oh, there's another big company collecting
[08:30.480 --> 08:34.480]  our data and not telling us how much they're collecting. And we're surprised to see how
[08:34.480 --> 08:38.320]  creepy it is. That's how every other company works. And Apple is supposed to be the exception
[08:38.320 --> 08:42.960]  and generally is the exception, which is why the PR for this is so bad, because think of how what
[08:42.960 --> 08:48.000]  a hard time you'll now have explaining to somebody that really Apple doesn't do it that way or no,
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.720]  Apple can't see your messages except in unencrypted iCloud backups like this.
[08:53.360 --> 08:57.280]  The more you have to add qualifications and the more the person you're trying to convince comes
[08:57.280 --> 09:00.800]  back to you and say, what about that time where they saved a lot of Siri recordings? And like,
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.200]  that's the thing that happened for sure. But in this other case, Apple is actually better than
[09:05.200 --> 09:11.520]  the competitors like so it's this perception is the real problem here. I mean, that's secondary
[09:11.520 --> 09:14.960]  problem. I suppose the real problem is that recording all of our voices without our knowledge.
[09:14.960 --> 09:17.920]  Trenton Larkin Our mutual friend, Manton Reese, pointed out
[09:17.920 --> 09:26.160]  that Amazon actually does a pretty good job with this where it's pretty easy to search the web for
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.720]  how do you control your Alexa stuff, you get a fact, I have it in the show notes. So it should
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.080]  make it into the final show notes here for the public. But they have a fact about Alexa, that's
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.560]  pretty, I would say it's written in plain English font, a little small, maybe, but there's a link,
[09:40.560 --> 09:49.040]  and they tell you how to get to a list of your recorded commands in their app. And then there's
[09:49.040 --> 09:53.520]  a URL you can go to on the web. And as long as you're signed into your Amazon account, you can
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.400]  delete recordings from a date range, you can there's a there's a button to delete all of the
[09:58.400 --> 10:06.480]  saved recordings. It's really pretty clear. And then there's a toggle for whether you want to
[10:06.480 --> 10:13.120]  allow your recordings to be reviewed by Amazon. And so you can opt out of it. So that's I, that'd
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.360]  be pretty tough. I can't really think of anything to suggest there that that seems like the way it
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.000]  should be.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.600]  Have you ever used those web pages for the for Amazon or for Google? They both have similar
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.480]  pages. Have you ever gone to them for your own devices? I did. I did it today in preparation
[10:26.480 --> 10:36.160]  for the show. And there was a recording of my son telling Alexa to shut the f up. So I've gone to
[10:36.160 --> 10:44.080]  these pages as well in the past. And the strange thing about pages like this is that the experience
[10:44.080 --> 10:51.360]  of going to a web page and scrolling through, like all of your past recordings, and like being
[10:51.360 --> 10:59.600]  able to play them sort of viscerally makes you understand the fact that things you say in your
[10:59.600 --> 11:04.000]  house have been transferred to a server somewhere and are being stored there. You can read those
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.120]  words and understand the agreement. It's written in plain English like, yeah, of course, that's
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.520]  the way it works. But actually seeing the web page and actually being able to scroll down
[11:11.520 --> 11:16.000]  to three months ago and play a thing that somebody said when you weren't in the house, you feel
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.160]  creepy doing it because now you're basically eavesdropping on people in your own house hearing
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.800]  how they use device, especially if it was an accidental activation or something. And in many
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.560]  ways, I feel like the existence of that page really hammers home exactly how invasive and
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.240]  creepy this is, despite the fact that, as you know, this is a good thing to have if they're
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.080]  going to store them at all, give the user visibility, give the user control or whatever.
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.360]  But I think what most people would prefer is as soon as you've done what I asked for you,
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.000]  forget it. Don't record my information anywhere. Delete it if you have it saved anywhere or just
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.840]  don't save it in the first place. That's what everybody wants until and unless they're having
[11:51.840 --> 11:55.680]  a problem or whatever, which gets into what I was saying in ATP, which is at the point where
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.680]  you're experiencing malfunction. That's the point where people would willingly opt in
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.720]  more often than not to getting their thing recorded just so Apple can fix it. But every
[12:04.720 --> 12:10.800]  other time, what would make people the most comfortable is I am not recorded and stored
[12:10.800 --> 12:17.120]  anywhere ever unless I explicitly asked for it. Yeah. And the counterexample, which I love the
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.400]  feature, I forget how many handful of years old now at this point, but the voicemail transcription
[12:22.400 --> 12:33.200]  feature in iOS has a has a little thing where it'll say, was it a bad thing? Was it a bad thing?
[12:33.200 --> 12:40.240]  Where it'll say, was this transcription useful or not useful in their links? And then you can tap
[12:40.240 --> 12:46.880]  useful and then you get a dialog box instantly opens up right away, which is nice. Help improve
[12:46.880 --> 12:51.200]  transcriptions. Would you like to submit this voicemail to Apple to improve transcription
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.760]  accuracy? Recordings will only be used to improve the quality of speech recognition in Apple
[12:55.760 --> 13:01.520]  products. Do not submit recordings if you believe the speaker would be uncomfortable with you
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.880]  submitting the content to Apple. Cancel or submit. Or if it's illegal in your state.
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.920]  Yeah, I guess they could mention that, but I'm not sure though, if you do, if you leave a voicemail.
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.160]  There's like a two party consent thing. I don't know. Do they know they're being recorded? I have,
[13:16.160 --> 13:20.320]  I don't know how this works legally speaking, but the wording is, is nice, but I don't,
[13:20.320 --> 13:26.400]  I don't understand how the legalities work there. Yeah. I saw you post that to the notes document
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.440]  and the, the spam voicemail that you have transcribed there. I've received that same
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.760]  voicemail. Yeah. Something about my excellent credit history and I'm eligible for blah, blah,
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.240]  blah. It's like it's vaguely broken English. Some kind of credit come on. It's like,
[13:40.240 --> 13:43.520]  you're going to send this mail to literally millions of people. Can you spend 10 minutes
[13:43.520 --> 13:51.440]  getting the grammar right? They're still going with the trick where they have the same area code
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.280]  as I do and the same first three digits as though it's, you know, as though that makes it more
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.840]  likely, you know, that it's somebody I know. Yeah, I have a brutal one. My caller ID, you know,
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.480]  we tend to get the same, what I think are the same spammers calling all the time. And you can see
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.760]  from the caller ID and for the longest time, caller ID of Boston college was calling and I,
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.360]  I got to the point where after they called three days in a row where I answered it ready to
[14:17.360 --> 14:21.840]  tell them to take me off their list or go away or whatever, whatever things I could possibly do.
[14:21.840 --> 14:28.160]  And I answered it and there was nobody there. Just nothing like I could, I don't think they hung up,
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.680]  but there was no one like, hello, hello, nobody there. And so they kept calling,
[14:31.680 --> 14:35.200]  they'd call every single day and I'd pick up every single time and there was nobody there.
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.120]  Like this is the worst scam ever. Like you have to, you have to pick up, you have to tell me
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.200]  something. I can, how can I give you all my money if you don't say anything? Eventually someone
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.760]  picked up and I told them to take me off the list or whatever. And I also started blocking the number
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.160]  in which is a thing that I can do with my phone service. Like actually, this is not, this is my
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.080]  landline phone. I actually have a landline. I started blocking the number. Then I realized that
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.200]  they would call day after day and every time they call the caller ID says Boston college,
[15:01.200 --> 15:05.920]  but every time they call it's a different number because I, I bet, I bet a ton of numbers show up
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.040]  as Boston college and they're just going through all, you know, they're faking their call ID
[15:09.040 --> 15:12.400]  through all of these numbers. And so now I'm just resigned to the fact that every day someone will
[15:12.400 --> 15:15.840]  call my house with the caller ID Boston college and I have to just not answer it.
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.720]  What do you, I can't understand the hit rate on these things. Like I don't even understand
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.240]  cause sometimes I'll answer it cause I'm bored and I just want to take some of their time and
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.480]  I feel like I'm doing a service for humanity even though I'm probably doing myself a disservice by,
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.400]  by marking my number as actual number. But I get so many of these calls anyway. It doesn't really
[15:34.400 --> 15:40.800]  seem, plus you're lonely. Yes, exactly. I just want to talk to somebody, but I'll, I'll, I'll
[15:40.800 --> 15:43.600]  start talking to them and it's like, I don't even know what they're trying to sell me. And that's
[15:43.600 --> 15:47.680]  like, they can't even make it clear. It's like, do you get the ones in Chinese? I get a lot of
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.040]  calls. Oh, I do too. You're just not getting anywhere with this. Yeah. Yeah. I forget what
[15:53.040 --> 15:57.040]  the transcriptions look like for those. They're, they're usually, I think it just ops out. I think
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.760]  it just on the iPhone it's like, you know, did not transcribe or could not transcribe. Right.
[16:01.760 --> 16:08.720]  Transcription not available. Yeah. But anyway, I I've, I've, I'm, I've gone from ambivalent about
[16:08.720 --> 16:19.360]  this story to upset to, I, you know, I would like to know exactly how this happened. And I think,
[16:19.360 --> 16:25.760]  and cause the, one of the weird things that you and I both know is that Apple has a privacy team,
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.720]  like in the way that you would think most companies today should have one, but in a way
[16:30.720 --> 16:34.640]  that like certain things have to go through legal, you got to send it through the legal department.
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.920]  And when they do new features, they, they have a privacy team that new features have to be run
[16:39.920 --> 16:47.360]  through. And that these are people actually just met a couple of them at WWDC who are shockingly
[16:47.360 --> 16:53.280]  super smart, but also have that mindset where they totally, you know, it's like being a
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.640]  white hat hacker. Like they know how to think like, well, here's how I would abuse this
[16:58.640 --> 17:08.480]  and close stuff up. I, my only theory is that Siri has such a weird history, you know, where
[17:08.480 --> 17:14.400]  it started as this third party company and then they slowly started integrating it. And it's,
[17:14.400 --> 17:21.360]  it's always been, you know, partially on device, partially in the servers and that somehow the
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.680]  whole thing just sort of slipped through the cracks and that this never really got looked at
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.840]  and in terms of the privacy implications, because it's so far over the line.
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.960]  I mean, that could be true, but my assumption has been that one of those things that we all
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.880]  don't read explicitly said that Apple is going to do this and we all agreed to it. Like that
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.480]  doesn't end to my point before. It doesn't actually make it better. Like I think, I think
[17:42.480 --> 17:47.600]  Apple may be surprised to learn that, Oh, that thing that we put in the agreement that nobody
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.760]  read that you all agreed to, like that's, they're not going to hide behind that. Like so many other
[17:51.760 --> 17:56.240]  covers like, well, you agreed to it or whatever. Cause Apple, I think understands that it doesn't
[17:56.240 --> 18:00.400]  really matter whether we click the accept thing on the thing that we didn't read. What matters is
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.560]  how we feel about it as customers. And I think in this case, as in many cases, we are all
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.800]  surprised at how surprised Apple is that we don't like something. Like if we pose this hypothetical
[18:12.800 --> 18:17.040]  to anybody who follows Apple or is an Apple fan, we'd say, yeah, people aren't going to like that.
[18:17.040 --> 18:20.400]  But maybe with an Apple, it was like, well, everyone agreed to this and we've been
[18:20.400 --> 18:23.760]  doing it for years and no one's complained. So I guess it's a thing that's okay. And
[18:23.760 --> 18:27.920]  the privacy team would be like, look, we outlined it in plain English. And if you had read the thing,
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.040]  it would say what we did. And we believe in your privacy and here's what we do. And we
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.880]  anonymize it and we only keep it for two years. And that's better than the industry standard.
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.920]  Like there's a whole bunch of things that you can say to yourself inside Apple to convince
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.560]  yourself that this is actually okay. Lots of the evidence out in the world can be used to support
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.120]  the idea that Apple's customers are okay with this thing that's happening. When in reality,
[18:47.120 --> 18:50.800]  Apple's customers, A, weren't aware that it was happening. B, once they became aware are not okay
[18:50.800 --> 18:58.160]  with it. Yeah, definitely. And well, I saw one theory that maybe somehow inside Apple,
[18:58.160 --> 19:05.120]  they chalked it up to the, like when you first set up a new device, or I guess every time you
[19:05.120 --> 19:12.080]  do a major software, like OS update, you go through this, the onboarding process. And there's
[19:12.080 --> 19:17.200]  a question like settings and or diagnostic info or something like that. Will you help Apple out by
[19:17.200 --> 19:24.240]  setting sending diagnostic information? And I, I don't have it in front of me, but I'm guessing
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.600]  that there's a, well, actually, I don't know if they would have a link to the web, a web page
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.920]  where they explain more because in that in that onboarding process, you can't really jump to safari
[19:33.920 --> 19:38.480]  because you're not set up yet. You have a thing like email it to me. Yeah, it used to be like
[19:38.480 --> 19:43.200]  print it out on your Mac, but now it's like email it to me. You know, so most people just look at
[19:43.200 --> 19:48.560]  the high level diagnostics, the two sentence summary of it, and they either hit the button
[19:48.560 --> 19:55.120]  that says, Okay, I'll send it or they hit the little not button underneath that is a little
[19:56.160 --> 20:00.160]  diabolically designed like, no, you don't want this one, you want to send us the diagnostics,
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.560]  but somehow they thought that that diagnostics thing and maybe legally, maybe from a legal sense,
[20:04.560 --> 20:11.520]  it does. It certainly is. Yeah. And the thing is, I do wonder what, you know, sort of a non tech
[20:11.520 --> 20:17.040]  enthusiasts conception of diagnostics is, but I think within the tech narrow world, we're all
[20:17.040 --> 20:20.880]  thinking crash reports, right? That's, that's kind of what we're thinking like, yeah, right. If
[20:20.880 --> 20:24.640]  there's some problem with the program, or if you want to know, like, how many times I launch it,
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.200]  or how many times a feature is used, that's what I'm opting into when I say diagnostics, but even
[20:29.200 --> 20:33.760]  tech nerds would be surprised with it. Oh, and also, everything you say to Siri, we have a
[20:33.760 --> 20:38.880]  Siri, we have the right to send and store for two years. That is not in our mental model of what
[20:38.880 --> 20:45.280]  that button means to us. Yeah. And it is funny to think about the fact, you know, so they
[20:45.280 --> 20:51.680]  apparently strip your iCloud ID from these recordings after six months, right? Yeah, that's
[20:51.680 --> 20:58.000]  what that that in that to me is a little, that's not what I expected. So after six months, they
[20:58.000 --> 21:06.240]  don't want to do it. But it's, it's theoretically possible that, you know, like your example was,
[21:06.240 --> 21:10.240]  I think, James Earl Jones, who was here, Freeman, Morgan Freeman, close. Well,
[21:11.120 --> 21:15.360]  someone with a voice that you would recognize saying words that you would recognize as being
[21:16.320 --> 21:22.720]  relevant and Morgan Freeman talking to Steven Spielberg about a new movie. Right. You know,
[21:22.720 --> 21:27.600]  it's, it's not outlandish to think that somebody could could have one scooped up or it was, you
[21:27.600 --> 21:32.800]  know, easily identified. Yeah, I mean, especially they have human, they have humans listening to
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.680]  this. And there's this big fleet of humans, one of the humans is going to hear the Morgan Freeman
[21:37.680 --> 21:41.920]  thing is going to recognize Morgan Freeman's voice. And this, you know, like social insider
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.400]  trading, if you recognize like a CEO talking about financial things, like, and I know, it's like,
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.160]  all the employees agreed to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like, these, this is where this stuff
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.600]  happens. Having this information at all is a liability. And then having this information
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.960]  pass through the hands of like, your lowest paid, least well treated employees is not great.
[22:01.760 --> 22:09.600]  No, no, it's not what you want. I even I've been recognized by my voice. I was we were at Disney
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.680]  World last month. And we were waiting for dinner. And I was ordering a drink at the bar. And my wife
[22:15.680 --> 22:21.280]  noticed at first that this guy next to me just suddenly shot his head over, like, got hit by a
[22:21.280 --> 22:26.320]  thunderclap. And he was like, are you john kruber? And that doesn't really that happens to me at
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.880]  WWDC. I'm sure it happens to you at WWDC. It does not happen to me at Disney World.
[22:30.880 --> 22:34.800]  Well, to be fair, you're Disney a lot. Yeah, I guess the law of averages.
[22:35.360 --> 22:39.360]  But like he even said, he said it wasn't that I recognize you. It was that I recognize your voice.
[22:39.360 --> 22:42.880]  Yeah, that's that's the way it works with podcasting, which is as I prefer it, I suppose
[22:42.880 --> 22:48.800]  because then you just keep your mouth shut and be anonymous. Right. faces made for radio as they
[22:48.800 --> 22:55.040]  say back on car talk. Oh, definitely. I guess we're done with this story, though.
[22:55.760 --> 22:58.320]  Got the Alexa thing got the permission for the voicemail.
[22:59.360 --> 23:02.800]  Boy, pacing a screenshot into a note really takes up a lot of space.
[23:02.800 --> 23:06.320]  Yeah, you can't even see that note on my Mac Pro here because it's running out cap and I
[23:06.320 --> 23:15.200]  can't see shared notes. I can see it on my iPhone. All right, let me take a break here and thank
[23:15.200 --> 23:22.320]  our first sponsor. Let's see who lucky winner is who gets to go first. Why don't we talk about
[23:22.320 --> 23:29.200]  away? I love away. I just got done taking my away suitcase on a trip. It's still good as new.
[23:31.760 --> 23:37.280]  They've they make suitcases, they're top notch, really, really great. All of them are made from
[23:37.280 --> 23:43.680]  either a lightweight durable German polycarbonate, which is to say a very fancy, very nice plastic
[23:43.680 --> 23:50.080]  or aluminum alloy. I've got the polycarbonate one because mine is so old that they only had the
[23:50.080 --> 23:55.520]  carbon at once when I got mine. And I have no reason to replace it because it's still as good
[23:55.520 --> 24:01.360]  as new. They've considered all types of travelers and they make their carry on two sizes with an
[24:01.360 --> 24:07.600]  optional ejectable battery, which I love, absolutely love. And when they say ejectable,
[24:07.600 --> 24:12.480]  it is super ejectable, you just click down on it pops up. That's important now because now when
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.400]  if you if you're traveling on an airplane, and they make you check your bag, rather than putting
[24:18.400 --> 24:24.640]  in in the overhead, you have to remove lithium ion batteries couldn't be easier. Super great. I love
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.040]  having that battery right there on my suitcase, then all you have to do keep a lightning cable
[24:29.040 --> 24:34.080]  handy. Although I guess you need two cables. Now if you want to charge an iPad, we all need a lot
[24:34.080 --> 24:40.160]  of cables, but there we go. Plug it right in your suitcase. Every single seat at the airport is now
[24:40.160 --> 24:46.960]  a seat with a charging port for you. I love it. For 360 spinner wheels guaranteed for a smooth
[24:46.960 --> 24:54.640]  ride. My wheels still absolutely fantastically smooth years old, lots of trips, a really clever
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.520]  internal compression system that lets you pack more keeps your shirts from getting all wrinkled
[24:59.520 --> 25:06.080]  up. I go everywhere. I can't remember the last time I went anywhere without my away carry on.
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.800]  I really like it. It's a great suitcase. You can save 20 bucks off your suitcase by going to
[25:12.800 --> 25:21.120]  away travel.com. That's their URL away travel.com slash talk show 20 talk show because this is the
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.640]  talk show 20 because you can save 20 bucks. And just remember that promo code talk show 20 during
[25:26.640 --> 25:33.440]  checkout. So go to away travel.com slash talk show. And my thanks to away for continuing to
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.760]  support the show. All of our suitcases are now away suitcases. You know what? We had a funny
[25:39.760 --> 25:46.560]  thing when we went to see Marco and we got off the ferry. A guy took mine and you know, because he
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.760]  had an away suitcase as well. Many suitcases look alike. So check many luggage tags, many suitcases
[25:51.760 --> 25:56.880]  look alike. I'm a big believer in that. And it's funny because I realized that I don't even know
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.920]  how many other people have an away carry on because I can't remember the last time I had to
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.400]  gate check it. I all you know, because I have pretty good status on American Airlines. And I
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.800]  always fly on American Airlines. So I don't get like a bad boarding group where they might take
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.520]  my suitcase away and stick it underneath the belly of the plane. I'm sticking it right over my seat.
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.120]  So it's never really out of arm's length. But that would have been that would have been bad bad.
[26:23.120 --> 26:33.360]  Bad. Yeah. I have all my drugs and stuff in my suitcase. Hey, I know you're Martin Scorsese fan.
[26:33.360 --> 26:39.360]  Do you see the trailer for the Irishman? I am avoiding any media related. I mean,
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.560]  Todd was here. He's doing cool media blackout for it. But he was I think he's working on the
[26:44.560 --> 26:50.000]  movie now. So I don't know that anyway. I'm mostly I'm mostly avoiding like all trailers now.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.960]  And so like if I'm interested in a movie, I avoid the trailer because I don't want to be spoiled.
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.720]  And I'm not interested in the movie. I avoid the trailer because why bother? So the answer is no.
[27:00.320 --> 27:04.880]  But you're aware of the basic premise. I am not aware of the basic premise. I have
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.840]  almost nothing about this movie other than the director. So I just don't even know the cast.
[27:10.560 --> 27:13.840]  I didn't hear Oh, maybe I don't think I know anything about the cast.
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.200]  Can I spoil the cast? Sure, go for it. It's the whole gang is back together. It's got De Niro.
[27:19.200 --> 27:26.640]  It's got Joe Pesci. And they've added Al Pacino. But they're all men now. It's gonna be sad. Well,
[27:26.640 --> 27:32.320]  this is the thing. They've they've you young young eyes, Robert De Niro.
[27:33.120 --> 27:36.400]  All right. That's what I wanted to explain. Todd was here. His involvement.
[27:37.440 --> 27:44.880]  There is some serious Todd Visari action going on. I will say the trailer is excellent. It is
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.960]  not very spoilery and shocker because you'd think you know, somebody like Martin Scorsese
[27:48.960 --> 27:53.360]  is going to keep control of his trailer. Do you think directors even of that stature have
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.600]  control of the trails? What I've heard is that no matter who you are, you get no say in your trailer.
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.400]  But I don't know how true that is. I don't know about that. If anybody does, I would think I
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.080]  would Yeah, sure. No, you would think but like I was I always think about I think about like
[28:06.080 --> 28:11.760]  Stephen King having control over his book covers. Right. And I my again, my vague knowledge of this
[28:11.760 --> 28:15.760]  is that even Stephen King has to just deal with what the publisher wants to put on the cover.
[28:15.760 --> 28:22.080]  Right. Right. Right. The inside of his books is he has control over. They're very consistent,
[28:22.080 --> 28:28.640]  you know. It's all set typeset in Garamond number. I suppose if you get big enough,
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.400]  you can insist on whatever you want to insist on. But I think just being conditioned by years
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.000]  and years of being in the industry, you could become accustomed to the idea that the director
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.440]  doesn't have control of the trailer and the author doesn't have control over the cover.
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.040]  Yeah, from what I saw in the trailer, the the way that they've made Robert De Niro look younger
[28:45.040 --> 28:52.400]  than he really is, is pretty astounding. It is outside the uncanny valley. Now it's a trailer.
[28:52.400 --> 28:57.120]  So maybe they're cherry picking the shots, you know, with dark lighting and, you know,
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.040]  cherry picking the best spots. But that's pretty interesting. And I don't know how I feel about it,
[29:03.040 --> 29:09.440]  though. Like in some sense, like if we keep giving, if we keep giving the role of a mid
[29:09.440 --> 29:14.480]  40s gangster to Robert De Niro, when when did you know when does the younger when does our generation
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.640]  get to step in? It'll just be his voice on a completely computer animated figure. Like the
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.560]  worst thing about De Niro and these other actresses, we have so much footage of them at that
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.400]  age. Like, it's not like we don't know what they look like. Right. You know, as opposed to like
[29:28.400 --> 29:32.480]  aging Captain America, we don't know what Chris Evans is going to look like when he's old. But we
[29:32.480 --> 29:38.400]  know what you know, 3040 year old Robert De Niro look like. We're very familiar. Yeah, yeah, I'd be
[29:38.400 --> 29:44.160]  curious to hear after this comes out, talk to pick Todd Vizzier, his ear about it and find out how
[29:44.160 --> 29:50.320]  much work and what what source material they use to get exactly how much they replace. That's,
[29:50.320 --> 29:54.000]  that's the whole thing is I was like, Oh, but just do a nip and a talk. And it's like, no,
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.360]  we're just going to erase your head and replace it with our computer head.
[29:58.560 --> 30:04.160]  It's an it's a Netflix movie, which is kind of interesting. But they're, they're doing the,
[30:05.200 --> 30:10.160]  I guess it's that whole thing Spielberg was talking about back at the Oscars in March,
[30:10.160 --> 30:17.040]  where, you know, for whatever reason, Spielberg thinks that any movie up for Oscar consideration
[30:17.040 --> 30:24.160]  has to have been in a theater. Of course he does. It's, you know, see, you know, I, I like
[30:24.160 --> 30:30.480]  tradition as much as the next guy. I don't really see. I don't really see that as a requirement. A
[30:30.480 --> 30:36.640]  movie is a movie. Yeah. I like seeing a movie in a theater. I like a big screen. I like a good loud
[30:36.640 --> 30:41.840]  sound system. You know, when you go to the movies, I don't go much anymore. I got to say, but I do
[30:41.840 --> 30:45.440]  like going to see a blockbuster in a movie theater. I like the way that I don't have to
[30:45.440 --> 30:50.080]  worry about, you know, waking up my wife or something because I have the volume too loud,
[30:50.080 --> 30:53.840]  but if I don't put the volume up loud, then I can't hear what they're saying. But then
[30:53.840 --> 30:57.600]  when the action, you know, when the Hulk starts throwing things against the wall, all of a sudden
[30:57.600 --> 31:02.800]  the volume you had set for dialogue, it's no longer appropriate, you know?
[31:02.800 --> 31:07.600]  Yeah. Plus the, the, the recent in recent years, innovation that I feel like is
[31:07.600 --> 31:12.720]  given a big boost to my desire to go to movie theaters, reserve seating everywhere.
[31:12.720 --> 31:15.600]  It's the best thing ever. Do you have that at all your local theaters?
[31:15.600 --> 31:18.640]  I can't remember the last time I went to a movie without reserved.
[31:18.640 --> 31:21.120]  No, I won't. I won't go to movie without reserve seating.
[31:21.760 --> 31:26.800]  Yeah. So absolutely fantastic. What a, what a, why did it take so long?
[31:26.800 --> 31:30.240]  Computers. Cause it's such a, it's like a bookkeeping hassle and you know,
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.920]  it's not like we didn't have the computers to do it, but someone needed to say, let's try this.
[31:33.920 --> 31:37.440]  Like once the technology was there, it's just a matter of someone being willing to use technology.
[31:37.440 --> 31:40.640]  And once the first person was willing to use it and probably saw what it did to attendance,
[31:40.640 --> 31:45.200]  then it's just spreads like wildfire. That's why, because before like, what would the logistics be
[31:45.200 --> 31:48.880]  of just how many shows a day and how many seats and picking what your seats are and,
[31:48.880 --> 31:51.200]  and sort of knowing when the seats taken for someone else took it,
[31:51.200 --> 31:54.560]  like it would cost so much money to run that without, without the web, essentially.
[31:54.560 --> 31:58.560]  And like a play, plays have always had reserved seatings, but a play
[31:58.560 --> 32:05.440]  typically the theater only has one showroom. It is the theater. And I,
[32:06.160 --> 32:12.880]  I think most plays are typically one show a day, maybe two and not $7 a ticket and not $7 a ticket
[32:12.880 --> 32:20.320]  or whatever, whatever current prices are around 11 or 12 bucks. 13. Right. So I guess it is the
[32:20.320 --> 32:25.440]  computerization. The other thing that's really nice about a modern theater is the, the reclining
[32:25.440 --> 32:31.440]  seats. Oh yeah. Yeah. They're sort of like stadium seating, reclining seats, and I've even almost,
[32:31.440 --> 32:36.000]  but not quite come around to those ones that give you the food in the theater. Cause my wife really
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.120]  likes our local theater that gives food. I never get food in the theater. I don't want other people
[32:41.120 --> 32:45.360]  to get food in the theater, but I have to say that since it makes my wife and sometimes my kids
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.840]  happy, I like that because it makes them more willing to go to the movie because you can
[32:47.840 --> 32:51.520]  convince them, Oh, we'll go to the one with the food and you can get, you know, junky French fries
[32:51.520 --> 32:55.920]  that you like. And the second thing is they somehow manage, maybe it's because it's stupid
[32:55.920 --> 33:00.400]  30 minutes of trails in front of everything to get you the food before the movie starts and not
[33:00.400 --> 33:05.200]  deal with anything related to it until the movie is over. And for the most part, people are nice
[33:05.200 --> 33:09.520]  about not making chewy, noisy things. The only bad thing is it's a little bit of extra lighting so
[33:09.520 --> 33:13.360]  that people can see the menus, which I wish they would turn off. So I would, I do not prefer it and
[33:13.360 --> 33:17.680]  would avoid it if possible, but I do like the idea that other people in my family like it because it
[33:17.680 --> 33:23.760]  gets them to go to the movies. Yeah, I totally agree. I first time I know they're the famous
[33:23.760 --> 33:28.080]  chain is the Alamo draft house. And I know that they're, I think they're out of Texas now. I think
[33:28.080 --> 33:33.200]  they're spreading nationwide. But when for a couple of years, when I lived up in Massachusetts,
[33:33.200 --> 33:38.560]  we had a place that it was called Chunky's and it was weird. It was like when this was a novelty
[33:38.560 --> 33:44.560]  and it didn't really have theater seating. What they had were the passenger seats from
[33:44.560 --> 33:48.960]  Lincoln continentals, like mid 80s Lincoln continentals and they just bought a whole bunch of
[33:49.840 --> 33:56.560]  passenger bucket seats from like 80s Lincoln's, put them on wheels and then you didn't really,
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.400]  I have to say I didn't really like that because I want to be squared up and I want to be in the
[34:00.400 --> 34:04.160]  center. But it was a way that you could kind of wheel your seat around. It was a comfy chair.
[34:04.160 --> 34:10.320]  That's weird. Yeah, it was definitely weird. And by modern theater standards to the seat out of
[34:10.320 --> 34:14.720]  even a Lincoln continental is way smaller than the current gigantic recliners that they have in
[34:14.720 --> 34:18.880]  these theaters. There's enough room for like two normal sized people to sit on each one of these
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.520]  things. Yeah. The old school movie theaters, I guess. And that was the other thing too,
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.360]  is that they've raised the prices enough and attendance is down and they go for blockbusters.
[34:27.360 --> 34:32.560]  But I guess in the old days, throughout decades ago, they were really just trying to pack people
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.240]  in like sardines. Yep. Little tiny hard seats with, if you're lucky, some kind of dingy fabric.
[34:38.240 --> 34:44.320]  Yeah. Rubbing elbows with the public literally. Yeah. And if you rub the seat the wrong way,
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.720]  it kind of like gave you like a, you know, like a, what would you call that?
[34:50.240 --> 34:53.200]  You know what I mean? Like it's like the velvet and if you rub it the right way,
[34:53.200 --> 34:55.920]  it feels smooth. Single directional velvet. Yeah. Yeah.
[34:59.280 --> 35:02.320]  Anyway, I'm looking forward to that. Although I don't know if I'll see it in the theater.
[35:02.320 --> 35:05.680]  Figured I'd run it by you. See what I thought. The Netflix thing, if it's Netflix,
[35:05.680 --> 35:08.320]  is it only on Netflix? Do you have the option to see it in that theater?
[35:08.320 --> 35:12.960]  Oh yeah. So they're going to, they are going to do a quote unquote limited run,
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.040]  which I take to mean maybe New York and LA. So I don't know that.
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.080]  New York, LA and Philadelphia, obviously. Yeah. I somehow doubt it. I think I'll wait
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.960]  for it to come out on Netflix, but I'm looking forward to it. I think it's kind of interesting.
[35:24.960 --> 35:28.720]  Are they going to do same day on Netflix? No, I don't know.
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.720]  I feel like that's a super Netflix-y thing to do. Drop the whole season at once and
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.200]  put it on Netflix the same day it opens in theaters. Yeah. What do you think about Netflix's
[35:37.200 --> 35:41.440]  distribution of, you know, like here's season three of Stranger Things. Here's the whole thing.
[35:41.440 --> 35:46.800]  Here's eight episodes. I like it. I mean, there's a place for both kinds of distribution,
[35:46.800 --> 35:52.880]  so I'm not in favor of one completely replacing the other, but I like having it as an option
[35:52.880 --> 35:58.800]  because I, you know, I don't, I think because there's so much now, I feel a lot less of the
[35:58.800 --> 36:04.240]  pressure to watch a show that comes out immediately. Otherwise I'll get spoiled by my friends because
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.440]  now we're all in the same boat where it's like no one has time to binge watch Stranger Things
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.520]  season three when it comes out just because it comes out because there's a million shows like
[36:13.520 --> 36:19.680]  that. And who has that kind of time? So we all do watch it at our leisure, but I watch things
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.240]  in a bursty manner. Sometimes it's like no episodes for several days and then I do four
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.920]  episodes in a day and that's, I like having that available to me. It's, you know, it sort of lets
[36:29.920 --> 36:37.200]  me go my own pace. I thought about it a lot with Stranger Things this season. I didn't do super
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.920]  bingey. Like sometimes I just get in a real rut where I'm staying up real late and I'll watch like
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.760]  three or four episodes of a thing and I mostly watch like one a night, maybe two. It used to
[36:47.760 --> 36:53.600]  bother me because Stranger Things in particular has cliffhanger episode endings and it just feels
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.000]  to me like this is supposed to make you wait a week. You're supposed to wait a week to find out
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.840]  what the hell just happened. But then I was thinking about it and, you know, you brought
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.440]  up Stephen King. Like it's, they even call them chapters on Stranger Things. Like it's no different
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.840]  than a novel where lots of thriller writers will put a cliffhanger ending at the end of a chapter
[37:14.560 --> 37:17.760]  and you make the decision. Do you find out what happened or do you go to bed?
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.640]  Yeah. And, you know, the people making these shows are not surprised by how they're being
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.920]  distributed. Like they can, they should be able to tailor the show so that it works in the format
[37:27.920 --> 37:31.440]  that it's, that it's, you know, being presented, which is why, you know, Stranger Things is a great
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.520]  example. And we've talked about this before on Twitter and with our friend Todd, the idea
[37:38.160 --> 37:45.440]  of opening credits, shows that are made in an era of streaming services where there is a potential
[37:45.440 --> 37:52.320]  for you to watch episode after episode, have to decide whether they're going to try to have a big,
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.720]  long, luxurious intro, and then allow people to hit the skip intro button in their streaming
[37:56.720 --> 38:02.720]  service of choice, or whether they're going to try to have a really tight but entertaining intro
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.800]  that people will actually watch instead of hitting the skip intro. I think season one of Stranger
[38:06.800 --> 38:12.800]  Things had a fairly long intro sequence by sort of normal standards, but it was so artfully done
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.200]  that I watched that intro for probably more than half of the episodes of Stranger Things because
[38:17.200 --> 38:23.520]  it was so good. And so I watched the intro to most shows. I watched the Game of Thrones intro
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.600]  every house of cards, though, that was like 10 minutes long. I would watch it. Watch it. Or would
[38:29.600 --> 38:37.280]  you allow it to play while you go get a beverage and pick some boogers? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I guess
[38:37.280 --> 38:41.760]  I guess now that I think about it, I skipped I skipped sometimes, because that was really long.
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.240]  Like, you know, and it wasn't anything that didn't grab you. Like, the point is that it's possible
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.760]  to, you know, that all of these television shows, movies, whatever should be made with the knowledge
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.080]  of how they're going to be viewed and distributed. And so you can work within that framework to do
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.600]  very interesting things. I'm not a fan. The one thing that Netflix really bothers me is I don't
[39:01.600 --> 39:09.680]  like the race at the end of the episode to quick get the remote and let the music play. You know,
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.920]  like one of the cool things, you know, lots of shows do it, but they'll pick at the end of an
[39:13.920 --> 39:20.320]  episode instead of having a theme song, like you do at the opening credits, you play a unique song
[39:20.320 --> 39:26.400]  picked just for this episode to sort of set the mood and let yourself ease out of the show. And
[39:26.400 --> 39:31.840]  the filmmakers behind the shows carefully picked and licensed these songs. I want to hear it. I
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.680]  want to hear the music sometimes. And with Netflix, you're and it's like, hey, Netflix,
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.480]  I'm dealing with an Apple TV remote here. You got to give me some extra time.
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.760]  And the thing is, the UI of these streaming service constitutes a form of spoilers in
[39:47.760 --> 39:52.880]  many cases, because if you don't see the little prompt for the next episode, you know,
[39:52.880 --> 39:58.080]  there's a post credit sequence or, you know, there's an intricate credit. Right. That's
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.880]  happened to me many times where the thing doesn't pop up and I'm like, oh, oh, there's more to it.
[40:02.880 --> 40:06.080]  And I would rather have experienced that organically or not at all. Like,
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.840]  I feel like the best kind of sort of post credits or mid credit sequence are the kind where
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.800]  you discover it on your own or you don't. Right. If you just turned off the TV,
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.160]  then you don't get to see it. But if you did leave it running, it's a pleasant surprise.
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.840]  Like that's the best form of it. Unlike, you know, things like the Marvel movies,
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.080]  where we've all been conditioned as a society to sit through 10 years of credits, because we know
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.080]  there will be post credit sequences, possible multiple ones, TV shows, you never know.
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.080]  Sometimes they'll just be one at the end of a series or end of a season or a show will never
[40:34.080 --> 40:37.920]  do one and then just do one randomly in the middle. I know a lot of people who watched,
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.720]  I mean, I don't. Some people watch a show that I really enjoy that I don't want to spoil
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.320]  that did have a sort of mid credits post credit sequence that lots of people just never saw.
[40:48.320 --> 40:53.440]  And it really changes the entire plot of the show because it's the kind of, you know,
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.840]  twist on a twist ending thing. And I've talked to people and they're like, I watched that whole
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.160]  show. And then I heard you talk about it. I had no idea what you're talking about. And then I
[41:04.160 --> 41:09.280]  went back and watched them. I was like, Oh, that's, that's perfect. Because you can watch
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.520]  the show and be satisfied with it when just turn it off when the credits start to roll.
[41:13.520 --> 41:15.520]  But if you kept watching, you got a little bonus.
[41:16.320 --> 41:19.440]  Stranger Things. I thought season three was pretty great. I thought it was my probably my
[41:19.440 --> 41:24.400]  favorite season. And that says a lot because I liked the first season a lot. I thought second
[41:24.400 --> 41:30.560]  season was a little and then usually the you know, by the third season it's it's fading away.
[41:30.560 --> 41:33.440]  Usually don't think about that. But I thought it was great. And I thought that they
[41:34.560 --> 41:42.400]  to my eyes and my recollection, they nailed mid 80s mall culture. Absolutely. Perfectly. Like I
[41:42.400 --> 41:46.960]  don't know how much money they spent to recreate an 80s mall but it was money well spent because
[41:46.960 --> 41:51.840]  it was it was perfect. Did you say that the what they used was one of those abandoned 80s malls,
[41:51.840 --> 41:55.840]  like an actual abandoned 80s malls, and then they dressed it up, which is probably the only way you
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.840]  could do it short of CG. So that aspect of was great, right? For me, season one is still far and
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.640]  away the best season of Stranger Things by like miles and miles season two, I have fond memories
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.640]  of but don't, but that's only the bits I can remember. And it was weird, you know, but fine.
[42:12.640 --> 42:16.720]  Season three felt like it was very straightforward. And it felt like a little bit like they were going
[42:16.720 --> 42:19.840]  through the motions. And I think they're a little bit confused about what to do with these characters.
[42:19.840 --> 42:23.840]  It's the problem of having any show with kids as the stars, they start to grow up and they get
[42:23.840 --> 42:30.240]  awkward. And the show has to decide when to start treating them like adults and when to keep treating
[42:30.240 --> 42:34.640]  them like kids. And I feel like Stranger Things is in that awkward phase. I enjoyed it. I just
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.480]  feel like season one is just so much better. It was just lightning in a bottle because it was
[42:38.480 --> 42:44.320]  the kids at the right age. And it's a show and you know, some sort of nostalgia and throwback
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.000]  and homages to things that we're familiar with just at the right time. And it was,
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.360]  I was riveted for season one and season two and three. And it's just a show that I'm watching and
[42:51.360 --> 42:57.600]  enjoying. And somehow an original take on the supernatural, you know, it was something I'm not
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.000]  sure how original is. But it's like it's Quentin Tarantino original where you see all the influences,
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.520]  but then they are channeled through this other creative person. And it makes them more than
[43:05.520 --> 43:09.760]  what they were. Yes, that's a good way to put it. Right. There's nothing new under the sun.
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.040]  Making supernatural. That's what we always want. But some people are more open about it. Like we
[43:13.040 --> 43:16.400]  everyone is always remixing everything they've experienced into their own creations. But sometimes
[43:16.400 --> 43:20.960]  what comes out is something that isn't immediately recognizable as a combination of the source
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.280]  materials. But then there are people again, like Tarantino, who you so clearly see their influences.
[43:25.280 --> 43:29.440]  You clearly see what they love and they make this new great thing, but you can draw direct lines
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.040]  back to all this other stuff. It's, it's, you know, it's very clear, unlike other art where you
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.880]  would never know they were inspired by something until you saw like an interview with the director.
[43:38.880 --> 43:42.560]  Right. Did I ever figure out, did they ever tell us what the hell happened to that Barb?
[43:42.560 --> 43:49.280]  Yes, she's dead. Oh, she's dead. Sorry, sorry, Barb. Let me take a break here. Thank our good
[43:49.280 --> 43:55.840]  friends at Eero. E-E-R-O. Eero blankets your whole home with fast, reliable Wi-Fi, eliminating poor
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.720]  coverage, dead spots and buffering. You'll have a consistently strong signal wherever you need it.
[44:01.360 --> 44:06.960]  Not just one router somewhere by your TV and you hope it gets all the way upstairs to your bedroom
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.440]  because that's where you're also streaming lots of video on your iPad or Wi-Fi or whatever.
[44:11.440 --> 44:19.040]  Uh, what, what they use is they use multiple little devices and they're small. They're very
[44:19.040 --> 44:24.080]  good looking. The ones that plug into the wall, they call them the beacons. They have a nightlight
[44:24.080 --> 44:29.680]  so they can shine down on the floor. If you don't want the nightlight, use the app, turn it off easy
[44:29.680 --> 44:35.200]  as pie. Couldn't be easier. Uh, and the whole thing, you set it up. It is so easy to set up.
[44:35.200 --> 44:43.600]  It is so uncomplicated, so requires no networking expertise to get a network with multiple devices
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.920]  that blankets your whole home with coverage and you do it all through their app, which is a really,
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.640]  really good app. Um, I, I have the feature on, I like it. I don't know why, but I like the,
[44:54.640 --> 44:59.920]  I get notifications when a new device joins my network. Sometimes my kid will bring a friend
[44:59.920 --> 45:05.600]  over and it'll say new Apple devices on the network. I like knowing that, um, really don't
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.800]  know why, but it's there. If you want it, you don't want it. You can turn it off. I'm talking
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.480]  to you over an Eero network right now. It is a great product. I use it myself, whole house

[45:50.480 --> 45:54.880]  how many floors you have, et cetera, et cetera. Couldn't be easier. My thanks to Eero
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.000]  for their continuing support of the show and for the, uh, the wifi I'm using right now.
[46:01.920 --> 46:05.920]  Uh, let's get into it cause who knows how long it's going to go,
[46:05.920 --> 46:12.720]  but do you, do you miss writing your OS 10 reviews? Mac OS 10 reviews a little bit.
[46:14.880 --> 46:18.480]  Did you, what was the average, you know, like offhand, what was the average word count?
[46:18.480 --> 46:24.080]  Uh, I think there was like maybe, um, it was, it was lumpy, maybe 30 K,
[46:25.280 --> 46:29.760]  something like that. It's, it, it, it's closer to a, they were closer to
[46:30.320 --> 46:36.000]  short books than long articles. Yeah. I sold them as e-books, e-books for the past, uh,
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.520]  for the final three or four or five. I don't remember how many. Um, but yeah, no, I,
[46:41.520 --> 46:47.440]  I, when I think about it, I remember the writing process. I don't, I think about how,
[46:47.440 --> 46:52.400]  how long it would take. It's kind of like doing a legal copy where a contract is a certain link,
[46:52.400 --> 46:56.720]  but every sentence has to be vetted. Right. Like when you're doing technical writing,
[46:57.280 --> 47:02.560]  it's just, I have sort of like school, forgot my homework, forgot I was signed up for a class
[47:02.560 --> 47:09.200]  type of, uh, stress dreams about trying to imagine, you know, you've written something,
[47:09.200 --> 47:16.160]  it's like 20, 30, 40,000 words. And every single line of it is a like,
[47:16.160 --> 47:21.680]  that's not an opinion is a statement of fact about a product that isn't released yet. And that is
[47:21.680 --> 47:28.480]  subject to change at any time. And that you have to publish on the day, the thing is released
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.680]  and every single fact in it needs to be true of the version that they release. I still have like
[47:33.680 --> 47:40.640]  stress dreams and waking sort of jolts about that. Like it was just, it would take so long
[47:40.640 --> 47:48.720]  to do to just to get through like two paragraphs of texts because every single sentence made
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.120]  assertions and, and even the opinions were based on those assertions. So you can't even leave the
[47:53.120 --> 47:56.080]  opinions because you're like, this thing is terrible. And that ends up, they change that
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.400]  thing to work a different way. Now that opinion has to be removed or revised and you have to
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.560]  decide what you think about it and write a new thing about it. I guess I don't miss that part.
[48:04.560 --> 48:10.880]  For sneakity things like file paths and is there a tilde in front of the library or is that the
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.280]  root level library and you got to get every single, every single bit of that much, much
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.360]  more esoteric things than that. Like the screenshots alone because it changed stuff around.
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.360]  I think that's what drove you over the edge was where the screenshots,
[48:23.360 --> 48:26.720]  I mean the screenshots towards the end, the screenshots were the part that I enjoyed the
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.720]  most because I really started to just like insist on like my, my standards for screenshots just got
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.200]  higher and higher to the point where nobody reading the article appreciated the extra level
[48:37.200 --> 48:40.240]  of effort I was putting into it. Like this is the point of diminishing returns was like
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.520]  three reviews before I ended and I just kept going. Like I wanted the screenshots to be artful.
[48:45.520 --> 48:51.360]  I wanted the content to be interesting. I wanted there never to be any blurred or blocked out
[48:51.360 --> 48:55.360]  things in them, but of course I didn't want to reveal any actual personal information.
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.000]  I wanted them to be composed well. I wanted them to show multiple things in a single screenshot.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.120]  I needed them to be written to resolution. Like it was just, I went on and on and on.
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.920]  And that's, that's one of the parts that I threw myself into towards the end. But yeah,
[49:11.920 --> 49:15.600]  that was a nightmare, but no, just like even the technical stuff about exactly how something works
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.640]  under the covers and what this command does and what technology are they using underlying this
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.080]  and what this data structure looks like. And they, you know, they've changed that stuff.
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.120]  And you'd have to like, every time a new build came out, you'd have to go through and revet
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.600]  all of your past work and then continue writing. If you were still in the process of writing it,
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.600]  it's just exhausting. Does it bother you? It bothers me. I feel like they should have
[49:39.600 --> 49:44.880]  stuck with a name. It bothers me that they went from Mac OS 10 to OS 10 now to Mac OS
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.960]  because it makes it hard to talk about it in retrospect. Yeah. Like, you know,
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.600]  when it was all Mac OS 10, you could say Mac OS 10.4 and Mac OS 10.5 and you didn't have to
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.240]  mix it. And what do you, you know, I'm still, I think I'm actually kind of inconsistent on it.
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.600]  Like what do I do now when I refer back to a 10 year old version, do I call it Mac OS 10
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.400]  or do I use Mac OS for consistency with the current? You got to call it what it was named
[50:12.400 --> 50:15.760]  at the time. Like there, there is the, I forget which one, I think it was lion or whatever was the
[50:15.760 --> 50:21.520]  in between one where Apple was pushing, trying to say OS 10 without the Mac, but they didn't really
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.640]  commit to it except for like retroactively. So there was one that was in the middle,
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.840]  but every other one is fairly definitively has an, a product name when you're referring to a
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.000]  specific version is easy to use the name that it was called when it was released. If you're
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.240]  referring to like the first 15 versions of the Mac operating system, I would go to like the Mac
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.960]  operating system or some other generic term that is descriptive, but does not pin it down. And when
[50:44.960 --> 50:51.040]  I speak about it, I, I try to do that, but then if I need to refer to the whole group as an actual
[50:51.040 --> 50:57.200]  prog name, I usually go Mac OS 10 or OS 10. Cause there's still, it still seems like in a,
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.280]  in a non-marketing sense at a technical sense, that's still the canonical name. Like there's
[51:01.280 --> 51:08.000]  some command line utilities, like isn't, what is there like system info or CIS version. There's
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.920]  things you can type at the command line that'll tell you like what version of the operating system
[51:11.920 --> 51:16.080]  you're running. And it still calls itself Mac OS 10. There's still places where it's, it still
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.000]  says that hunt down those strings eventually. Yeah. No, the main thing that I'm disappointed
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.800]  about the naming is that I enjoyed the consistency of the new naming scheme, but I hate it. I don't
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.760]  like the actual naming scheme, the lowercase than going to uppercase. I find that aesthetically
[51:29.760 --> 51:34.400]  unpleasing. It's almost as bad as what you do, which is making up your own naming scheme. That
[51:34.400 --> 51:39.920]  is like the Apple naming scheme, but changed in a way that you find more pleasing because I don't
[51:39.920 --> 51:42.640]  play games with the capital. You're playing, you're playing your own game. You're like,
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.120]  I've come up with my own naming scheme. But I firmly believe that for the most part,
[51:47.120 --> 51:56.480]  uh, you don't, one doesn't spelling is letters, not case and case is a style that you put on it.
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.440]  So in the same way that I wouldn't follow their direction, if they said we always italicize the
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.080]  word Mac OS always, it's always italics. Oh, I would, I would not italicize it. You've gone
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.240]  to a third level. You, you, you got the letters, you've got capitalization and now you're saying
[52:10.240 --> 52:17.200]  like font face. Like that's a third level, right? But I take your point. You're you're, you decided
[52:17.200 --> 52:19.920]  that the spelling is just the letters, which I think is ridiculous. And I'm sure there are
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.400]  examples in English where the case is so important that it changes the meaning of the thing,
[52:24.400 --> 52:30.640]  but I'm saying aesthetically, I actually find capital M lowercase AC capital O capital S to
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.840]  be less aesthetically pleasing than the way Apple wants you to say it. Hmm. Cause it looks like I
[52:35.840 --> 52:40.240]  always love Mac space OS. I love that name. It was, you know, classic Mac OS was called that
[52:40.240 --> 52:45.200]  later in its life. You've taken that name and squish it up in a way that people used to do
[52:45.200 --> 52:52.800]  mistakenly, right? No, my friend, uh, Nat irons, who's easily top two typo reporters and daring
[52:52.800 --> 52:58.080]  fireball history along with my friend Chris pepper. Uh, but dozens, dozens, probably hundreds
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.480]  of typos he's reported to me over the years. Longtime reader. Like he, when they first switched
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.640]  to this, he was like, this is driving me nuts. Cause he's, you know, the type of anal retentive,
[53:06.640 --> 53:11.840]  careful reader who not only notices typos when I make them, but then immediately will text me
[53:11.840 --> 53:16.800]  cause he knows I care and I want to hear about it when they first changed the name. He was like,
[53:16.800 --> 53:21.440]  cause he's a longtime Apple user and he was just like, I spent an entire decade in the 90s
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.400]  correcting people when they closed up Mac OS. I can't, I can't even with this.
[53:26.400 --> 53:32.880]  Yeah. I mean, at least it's consistent. I mean, Apple Apple on naming has had problems in recent
[53:32.880 --> 53:36.800]  years, so I applaud them for an attempt, a successful attempt to attain consistency,
[53:36.800 --> 53:43.040]  even if it is consistently mediocre. The, uh, what do you think they're going to do
[53:43.040 --> 53:47.920]  with the iPhone name this year? I think they're going to go to 11 and it seems like they have
[53:47.920 --> 53:54.160]  to do something in addition to just 11. They could do 11 and 11 max, but then what do you call the
[53:54.160 --> 54:02.000]  10 R model? Yeah, I don't know. I mean like there's with Apple being so inconsistent with naming,
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.200]  you can't really look at the past and try to predict what they're going to do based on that.
[54:08.160 --> 54:15.680]  The one thing that the past tells us is that Apple has been willing to take the Roman numeral 10
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.800]  and use it without incrementing it for a long time. Right. Right. And also what they did with
[54:20.800 --> 54:25.680]  the iPad where they decided not to put a number on it, the new iPad, that whole business. Right.
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.600]  So I feel like that is, that option is on the table that these things ended up being called
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.160]  the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 10 S and the iPhone, like, but, but I don't think that's a likely,
[54:34.880 --> 54:38.400]  it's just, you know, I just feel like that is a possibility, a plausible possibility,
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.200]  but honestly, at this point, almost anything is plausible. The number 11 is certainly plausible.
[54:43.200 --> 54:48.640]  A Roman numeral, an X, and then an I is plausible. It would be terrible, but it's plausible. I mean,
[54:48.640 --> 54:53.120]  just, you know, think, is that beyond, is that beyond what Apple would do? No,
[54:53.120 --> 54:56.080]  it is not beyond what modern Apple do. Apple would totally make that name.
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.720]  If they use Roman numerals at all, they could use it. You never, you can't roll it out.
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.520]  Yeah. And in the end, like then because they've been so inconsistent, I think they've conditioned
[55:05.520 --> 55:11.120]  us not to attach at least condition me not to get too hung up on the names. Cause like they're,
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.480]  they're always going to be a little bit of a mess and they're not going to really make any sense and
[55:14.480 --> 55:20.320]  stop hoping for an inspired name. The inspired name is iPhone and it's not even, that's not that
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.880]  inspired because when we were all predicting back in the job, I was working at before the
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.960]  iPhone came out, we'd make our WWDC predictions on a big whiteboard. We were iPhone on a whiteboard
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.080]  for years before the iPhone came out. It was the obvious name for the thing. And Apple Apple makes,
[55:34.080 --> 55:37.440]  you know, it's the reverse where you come up with a name and it's not the name is great.
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.240]  It's that the product is great. And the greatness flows backward into the name. iPhone is a great
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.400]  name. It's the stuff they put after and the letters and everything, whatever. Like we'll
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.920]  get used to whatever they pick. Yeah. I don't know, but I feel like they can't keep incrementing
[55:51.920 --> 55:55.440]  the numbers. Like, are they really going to go to 13? Yeah. What does Samsung Samsung just
[55:55.440 --> 56:01.280]  crossing the 10 barrier this year? I forget. Yeah. Cause they just released this week. The,
[56:02.160 --> 56:10.960]  Oh, the sap Samsung galaxy note 10. I think it's called the note 10. So they're up at 10
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.680]  and they had the respect not to, not to use a Roman numeral. I think I talked about this on
[56:15.680 --> 56:23.520]  ADP, but like other companies have had what in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.520]  parlance is a stat crunch where you name your product and you keep incrementing the number
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.480]  and eventually it becomes so big that it's unwieldy and you rescale all the numbers.
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.760]  The API did it for their video cards. They were going up to like the radion 7,000 something,
[56:37.760 --> 56:41.520]  8,000 something, 9,000 something. And they were pushing up against like 9,700 and they're like,
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.840]  are we going to go to 10,000? Or maybe we could call it 10 K and they just did a stat crunch.
[56:45.840 --> 56:50.320]  They're like, Nope. Now it's the radion like 100, 200, 300. They just reset everything
[56:50.320 --> 56:55.280]  back so far that it's not confusing. You don't think, what is the 9,700 better than the new
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.880]  9,400? It's like, if the question is, is the 9,700 better than the 500 they're so far apart
[57:00.880 --> 57:04.560]  that it's clear they're not in the same family. So just reset everything. I don't think Apple
[57:04.560 --> 57:08.880]  will do that, but tech companies have done that multiple times in the past. And it's,
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.400]  it's a corner that you paint yourself into eventually if you just keep making the number
[57:12.400 --> 57:18.080]  bigger. So you don't even, now that you don't write these reviews, you're not, it's not just
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.320]  that you're not spending your summer writing and screenshotting a 30,000 K booklet on the new
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.400]  operating system. You're not even running it, right? Cause you can't run it on your Mac pro.
[57:29.040 --> 57:34.080]  I took a long time off of just like, I wanted to be completely ignorant of the new Mac operating
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.760]  system just because it was so relaxing. Right. But now I'm more like the average tech nerd. I
[57:39.760 --> 57:47.600]  have the beta installed. I fiddle with it. I instinctively go through sort of my normal routine
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.720]  after a thing is installed. Basically a routine that lets me look at every piece of user interface.
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.800]  Like I go through every preference pane and every screen and every tab and every menu item and every
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.920]  launch, every single bundle app. It's just sort of like a thing I do to sort of go through the
[58:01.920 --> 58:06.960]  EOS to find out what's new and maybe look at the versions of command line tools. I still do that,
[58:06.960 --> 58:10.400]  but then I don't do it. I don't take notes and I don't do it with an eye on retaining anything.
[58:10.400 --> 58:13.840]  And so now I'm more just like a casual, Oh, look at this fun thing. Oh, let's try this. Oh,
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.800]  let's do that. Uh, but that's about it. What's your, what's your take on dark mode?
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.920]  I'm personally not a fan. I think it's great that it exists.
[58:24.560 --> 58:30.720]  Right. I think it's a lot of work for developers for a feature that is on my list of like things
[58:30.720 --> 58:35.840]  that Apple should prioritize. And the operating system is fairly low, but I'm not going to ding
[58:35.840 --> 58:39.920]  them for it because it is a good thing to have. And if they're not going to allow theming,
[58:39.920 --> 58:43.520]  which they're not, and Apple's the only one that can do it. They did a really good,
[58:43.520 --> 58:46.880]  I felt like they did a really good job with dark mode, a very difficult task, which is
[58:47.760 --> 58:53.200]  make a dark mode, whichever it's easy to say dark mode. I just want it to be not so bright.
[58:53.200 --> 58:57.120]  Okay. But also I want everything to still be legible. And like, this is what you're not
[58:57.120 --> 59:00.080]  saying. And I want to be able to tell where everything is and I want the window layering
[59:00.080 --> 59:04.240]  still to work and I don't want it to be ugly. And I want my applications to be able to support
[59:04.240 --> 59:09.360]  it in an intelligent way. It's, it's a big, big, much more complicated feature than you think it
[59:09.360 --> 59:14.240]  is. And Apple, I think did a really good job of implementing it. And I see a lot of people using
[59:14.240 --> 59:18.960]  it at work. But I bet there are a lot of other features that I would have slotted ahead of it
[59:18.960 --> 59:25.280]  in terms of what Apple could have spent time on. Wildly popular at WWDC. And I want everybody to
[59:25.280 --> 59:33.120]  be comfortable reading and true dark mode as we now have on iOS and macOS after a year is so much
[59:33.120 --> 59:41.120]  nicer on the eyes than using the accessibility feature to just invert, do just a sort of a dumb
[59:41.120 --> 59:46.960]  inversion where everything light goes dark. And I'm sure that that feature isn't as simple as
[59:46.960 --> 59:51.840]  I'm thinking either, but aesthetically it is so much more pleasing and there's so many more subtle
[59:51.840 --> 59:58.480]  cues. Like with the accessibility feature, what was a drop shadow looks like a glow because it's
[59:58.480 --> 01:00:04.960]  just inverted. Whereas with dark mode, they've done some very clever stuff to provide hints of
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:13.840]  depth without going to a glow. But cognitively, I can't, I only app I, you know, I run BB edit
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.280]  and dark mode. So BB edit sticks out and I like writing on a dark background and BB edit, but
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:25.840]  that's just one app. And it helps me identify that dark window over on the left. There's my BB edit
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:33.760]  window. Especially on iOS, trying it on the betas over the summer, it just does it. There's
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.240]  something cognitively that just does not work for me in dark mode. Like I'm sitting there and I'm
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.040]  like going through emails and I realized that I don't remember any of the emails I just read.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:50.960]  Yeah, I think, I think I talked about this when dark mode was first announced last year, that like
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:59.440]  for me personally, culturally, I don't want my computer to work this way because of the historical
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.360]  baggage. Like when I was a kid, all of my first computers were a black CRT with light text on it,
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.720]  whether it's monochrome green or amber or whatever. And that's how all computers were
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.360]  until the Mac, which was the reverse. And the Mac was like sheets of paper are white and ink is
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.160]  black. That's the cultural context of this computer. And it was such a clean break from
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:29.760]  computer and thing that culturally acknowledges the written word and drawings and everything in
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.080]  the way that you are familiar with it outside the computer world. And that had, I've totally
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.000]  imprinted on that. I want black text on a white background whenever I see text, including in BB
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.240]  edit and everywhere else. So while every single other person at work has their text editor in
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.400]  dark mode with the candy colored syntax highlighted code all over it, all of my text windows are white
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.080]  and the text is black. Now, obviously, eventually, if I can't look at that because of ice cream or
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.640]  some other reason, you know, there's lots of accessibility reasons to prefer dark, but
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.360]  culturally, philosophically and emotionally, the Mac is white background with black text on it to
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:12.240]  me. Yeah, because part of the, we just don't use the phrase WYSIWYG that much anymore. And it's
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.960]  just for good reason. Well, you don't Mr. Markdown. Right. Well, you can get WYSIWYG in a
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.760]  preview window. That's not what WYSIWYG means. I know. I know. Because you're not editing.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.320]  Kids don't even know. How many people listen to the podcast when we say WYSIWYG know what we're
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.560]  even mean anymore? I wonder. I do wonder. W-I-Z-Z-Y-W-I-G is what I think we're saying.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:42.480]  Right. Yeah, maybe. But part of the WYSIWYG revolution of the 1984 Mac wasn't just that,
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.520]  like, when you opened a word processor that you didn't have to input formatting codes and,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.160]  you know, that you had real fonts to pick from. And if you put an image in, you actually saw
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.560]  the image right where it was. But it was just like you said, like, it was the fact that it was
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.280]  a white window with black text. So it was even more what you see is what you get, because you
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.040]  could, you know, what you saw on screen is like the original Mac, right? The original Mac, there
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.000]  was one Mac, there was only one, there was one printer that you hook up to it. And if you bought
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.760]  that Mac, and you bought that printer, and you bought Mac, right, and you wrote something in
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.720]  Mac, right, and you had in your Mac, right window, and then you printed it, and then you took that
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.880]  piece of paper, and you held it up against the damn screen that you just typed it on. The idea
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:34.720]  was what you saw is what you get. And that became increasingly less true over time as DPI monitors
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.800]  changed and printer changes. But in general, that was the promise and the dream. And it was
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:45.040]  absolutely unheard of in any other context, because the printer, you know, character printers,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.720]  they printed whatever the hell characters they wanted. They didn't care what was on your screen,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.520]  right? And the other ones were, you know, like a sort of desktop publishing type system or
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.000]  with formatting codes or whatever, what you printed out had no relation to the gibberish
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.200]  you were seeing on your screen, right? And the Mac was, you know, what you see is actually what
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:09.280]  you get more or less. And it was it was amazing. It was definitely a revolution. And I don't think
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.840]  people pick that up. And yeah, I have the same cultural feelings about Dark Mode too, where it
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:24.000]  just doesn't look right to me. What are your thoughts on the sort of increasing? I don't know
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.160]  if it's all sandboxing, but the increasing number of warnings when you do quote unquote dangerous
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:38.080]  things on on Mac OS. I know Jason Snell has written and talked about it quite a bit recently.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.720]  I haven't listened to the most recent version of his podcast, but I know he got some feedback
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.640]  from Apple about it. I don't know. I don't know what the solution is. I get why they're doing
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:00.000]  some of these things. I really hope, I really hope that they're not just tightening down
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.640]  hypotheticals, that they're really like, hey, we know some bad things, you know, some things
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:11.120]  that apps have been doing. And so we're doing this for good reason, not just because it could be.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:18.240]  But boy, it's starting to get annoying, in my opinion. Yeah, if I was writing, still writing
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.480]  reviews. First of all, I would have experienced this more because just fiddling around as I just
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.640]  described the new beta operating system, you won't run across this until you actually start using it
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.280]  to do real work. Or if you know that they're making changes in this area, and you will investigate
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.760]  deeply and do a bunch of synthetic experiments to find out what the barriers are. This incidentally
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.240]  would be a nightmare section to do because these are the type of policy changes that they can make
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.520]  right up to the last minute. Like the mechanisms are all there. Like here, we have a system for
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.160]  controlling this, but you can change the policy in the OS at any point and probably already have
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:58.720]  changed the policy. So yeah, I see what they're, I see what they're going for. But I think if I
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:05.680]  had to write about this, I would get very philosophical and say, like, the goals of
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:15.040]  safety, predictability, and confinement are laudable. But the best way to get the thing
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.440]  that you have to the state where those goals are achieved may not be to take the thing that you
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.920]  have and just start putting tiny padlocks on every single little door. Like the reason iOS has these
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:31.680]  properties that they want to bring to the Mac is that iOS is fundamentally different in many ways.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.040]  And I don't think you can get the Mac to that level of security by taking the Mac as it exists
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.760]  and putting tiny locks all over the place. Like technically you probably can, but it will be a
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.520]  terrible experience. There's a reason iOS doesn't work this way. If this is your goal, you have to
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:54.560]  look at the Mac and say, are there parts of the system that we need to change in radical ways to
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.920]  get to there? Rather than saying, here is how the system works. How can we start making minor
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.920]  modifications to slowly ratchet our way up to that level of security? Because that is
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.200]  putting the security ahead of the user experience in a mild way, but that eventually cumulatively
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.080]  makes the overall experience much worse. Right. And it's like, I want, I think bicycles should
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:22.000]  be made to be as safe as possible, but sometimes you want to ride your bicycle dangerously fast
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.120]  and it's your bicycle and you should be allowed to do that. Well, that's the second thing I didn't,
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.640]  I didn't even touch on that thing, which is okay. But what if that goal of being like iOS in terms
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.840]  of security is incompatible with one of the reasons that people like Macs, then you've got
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:41.600]  a, you've got a dilemma there. Cause it's like, do we just decide that that's not the way our
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.360]  devices are going to work moving forward? Or can we preserve that thing that people like about the
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.440]  Mac and provide that functionality continue to provide it in a safer way. And the current thing
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.520]  is both, you know, the best example of these entitlements that all of this temporary stuff
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:04.000]  in the name, it's like temporary, like this is fundamentally how, you know, insert program here
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.640]  works either programs like this are going to be allowed to exist or they're not going to be
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.960]  allowed to exist, but there's no amount of temporary indulgences that you can give it.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.520]  Like, it's just, it's like, do you not understand the tension here? People want to use their Macs
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.360]  to do this thing saying you can keep doing that thing for now is not reassuring. What we want
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.440]  to hear is we've come up with a safer, better way for your thing to continue doing its thing.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.240]  And they've never said that they're just like, eh, you can, we'll grandfather you in here,
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.560]  some temporary entitlements, you know, like they never come out and say, have you, have you
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.640]  considered not being that kind of application? Like, I don't know if they actually tell the
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.880]  people, like, have you considered not having access to the whole file system? It's like,
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.800]  I'm a disk cloning application. It's like, have you considered not being a disk cloning
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.800]  application? It's like, well, do you want disk cloning applications to exist or not?
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.000]  If you do want them to exist, that has to be on your list of requirements. You can't just
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  hope they go away and give them temporary entitlements and litter them with dialogue
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  boxes. Like there's, there's a disconnect between any sort of coherent future vision
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.080]  for the Mac and what they've been, what changes they've been making in the operating system.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.280]  Like there's, they're diverging. The one that I ran into a couple of months ago was I was doing
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.840]  something in terminal and I forget where I wanted to go, but maybe it was in one of those containers
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.360]  in my home library folder. I don't know. I was somewhere where there are protections,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.440]  like, I don't know, maybe in my mail folders or something. And I'm in terminal and I typed
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.160]  LS and there was like nothing. I got no results. I'm like, there's gotta be, I know there's stuff
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:50.080]  here. And I like opened, like open dot just to open this current, isn't that what you typed
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.760]  to get it open in a finder? Yeah. So I did that and I saw the, if the finder could see these files
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.480]  and I'm go back to terminal and type LS and there was nothing. And I realized I had to grant
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.200]  terminal full disk access, but I didn't get, it didn't say, you know, there was no warning.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:13.520]  I just had to know it. And for some reason, like with apps like BB edit, which I grant full disk
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.520]  access to, so I can open anything and super duper a disk cloning utility where you obviously it's
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:25.920]  like, I know that I've got to grant super duper full disk access and super duper, even if it
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.760]  doesn't have it will helpfully tell me when it launches that, Hey, you need to, we, we can't do
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.760]  our thing without full disk access. Cause that was like an alternate name for the app full disk
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:45.360]  access. Whereas terminal it, I spent more minutes scratching my head on this than I would like to
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:52.160]  admit because who would ever think that terminal wouldn't be able to just list files wherever you
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.800]  are. Like I'm in terminal. Yeah. That's another, that's another thing that Apple has done recently.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.640]  And again, I understand the reasons for it, but as it violates some sort of, uh, the mental model
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.120]  of a whole different, uh, sort of cultural domain, which is system integrity protection.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.920]  The Unix model has always been, if you're root, you can do anything, system integrity protection,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.480]  change that you can be root and also not be able to do something that just doesn't even make any
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.040]  sense from the model of Unix, which is fine to have different models and change things around.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.000]  But that's, it's getting back to one of the things that people love about max. It was
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.320]  Unix with a nice GUI on top. And some people who love Unix, love max. Some people love max,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.800]  love Unix and I'll be able to love both love them. And both of those realms are seeing changes. And
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.440]  to be fair, this happens in Unix outside of the Mac as well, where Unix does change over time,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.640]  but like to make that kind of change, like this, this is the thing you're going to do. It's like,
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.160]  we want to have system integrity and protection. We want there for there to be things that root
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:56.640]  can't do. A Unix-y way to make that change, a more Unix-y way would be to define a new super
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.200]  root user that's rootier than root so that you would keep the model the same, but that there
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.320]  would be a Unix-y way to, you know, if you sudo from mute for some, with some flag, you can become
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.120]  the super duper root and you can still do everything. Like in other words, change Unix,
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.880]  but change it in a way that still feels like Unix. You just added one more layer of stuff
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.880]  and system integrity and protection is like, the answer is like reboot with it off or whatever.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.840]  Like I understand why they did it the way they did it because it's a security feature. And if
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.440]  you could just bypass it that easily, but entering your admin password, it just becomes like,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:34.400]  it all makes sense. I'm just saying like, it's, it feels uncomfortable to take a well-established,
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.080]  I keep saying culture, but like, that's really what it is. A realist well-established culture
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.960]  of a realm of computing and start modifying it in ways that, that fly in the face of,
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.680]  of the history, like that are not well integrated with the whole.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.360]  Trenton Larkin Yeah. Like you,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.760]  you expect sudo ls to always list the files in the current system. You don't really expect,
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.720]  it's not a very Unix-y thing to say, well, go find terminal app or, or go to your system
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:07.200]  preferences and hit a plus button and choose it from a gooey picker to, to, to, or if I can't
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.160]  delete a file, change it to any of your RAM setting and reboot, and then you'll be able
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:17.120]  to delete the file. That doesn't, that doesn't really fit either. The other thing, so I'm torn
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.960]  on this and I know Jason and I went back and forth on Twitter about it. Like I kind of,
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:28.640]  there's a part of me that says that I want like an expert mode. I want, and maybe, maybe it's not
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.600]  even a checkbox in system preferences. Maybe it's like a thing you have to type at the command line
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.680]  in terminal just to sort of show your command line bona fides. But I kind of want to turn all that,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.520]  a lot of that stuff off. And I kind of wish that there was an expert mode. I get it though. Like
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.400]  as soon as those words come out of my mouth, I immediately, the, the gooey designer in me is
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.920]  like, once you start adding an expert mode, you know, you're, you've, you've lost the,
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.400]  you've lost the plot a little bit. I mean, you're bargaining. Like you're just like, I can see how
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.600]  this could be implemented and please give it to me because I don't want to be annoyed. But I think
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:10.240]  what we all really want is the ability to continue to do the powerful things that we enjoy the Mac
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:17.520]  for, but also in a safer way. Like we, we want, so it's not a middle path. It is a fundamental
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:24.000]  change. Like it's like, do you want the Mac to be safer? You need to figure out a way to make the
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.840]  Mac safer while also not only retaining all of the power we had before, but if anything, making it
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.480]  more powerful and that requires rethinking on a level way above sort of adding security as it is,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.920]  as you said many years ago, Ronco spray on security. That's not the way security works.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.760]  You have to, that's the way bad security works. And it's, and it's a difficult problem because
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.760]  you see the, you see the conflict. Here's the way the Mac has always worked and here's security.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.640]  How do I get them together? What you have to think is, well, what do people actually use the Mac for?
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:03.760]  Like what, what, in what ways do they need flexibility and along what axes does,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:10.560]  do their workflows change and then provide safe, secure mechanisms to continue to make those
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.640]  changes. And that requires rethinking at a much greater level than they're changing. Like it's
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.760]  a type of rethinking that happened between classic MacOS and MacOS 10. That level of rethinking is
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.720]  required to get us to an operating system that retains and enhances the power of the Mac,
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.040]  but has the security of iOS. We are never going to get there by making small changes to the
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.240]  existing Mac operating system. Right. And this death by a thousand paper cuts of authorization.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.200]  Now it's just this terrible negotiation of who's going to be the most annoyed,
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.800]  like how secure versus how much annoyance. And that is not a trade off. You want to feel like
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.080]  you're making it. iOS is a good example. Not that we want the Mac to work like iOS, but
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.680]  that those trade-offs didn't happen. The fundamental design of iOS is the way it is,
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.920]  because it was designed from the beginning to provide that level of security. And now they're
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.000]  trying to add features to it, uh, which they're, I feel like they're able to do more easily add
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.440]  features to a system that's already secure in these ways than to add security, because
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.680]  there is no expectation on everything they've given us in iOS. Every new piece of functionality
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.760]  has been like, we've never been able to do this before. So it's a blessing. It's a bonus. We are
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.600]  not starting at a level of infinite power than watching our power Wayne. We are starting at a
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.480]  level of total constraints and then rejoicing when we can use third party keyboards. Right.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.520]  And we've all, you know, I'm not going to say, I don't want to attempt, attempt the gods, but,
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:36.160]  uh, so for some definition of can't, which isn't really, can't it's probably shouldn't and,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:42.320]  and to their credit, they typically don't, it's hard to take away an automation system
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.560]  that people really use. Like at this point, so many, you know, people in the Mac OS 10 era
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:55.040]  are used to having, uh, it's scripting languages like Pearl and Python and Ruby
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.160]  at their fingertips. Uh, they're used to being able to write a bash script or something, you know,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.520]  do something like that. Apple script. I mean, does anybody really think people at Apple still
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.320]  love Apple script and it's still around, but it is still around because there are a lot of people
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:16.800]  who really count on it. Um, you know, and apps like keyboard maestro, one of my favorites have
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:26.560]  long had superpowers that, you know, to automate things in your onscreen, uh, buttons and stuff
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.280]  like that in a way that can't be scripted otherwise, it'd be hard to take that away,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.960]  but it's, I kind of just want to authorize all of it. The other thing I, my other complaint is
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:43.040]  that I don't feel like these, uh, entitlements, the, the way that you, as the power user who
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.400]  wants to change them, I don't think they're organized very well at all. Like I tend to think
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.680]  that there, there should be a way to do it by app. So that instead of fishing all over system
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.960]  preferences to find the three places where I want to add BB edit as, as a special app and give it
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:07.600]  entitlements, I'd rather just say here's BB edit and here's the permissions I want to grant to it.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.720]  Check, check, check. I want to check them all. Yeah. The whole system is not,
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.840]  uh, not designed very well. I give it from a software developer's perspective,
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.800]  like the nightmare of having to explain to all your users to do with this dance,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.520]  like there's a lot of steps. The steps steps are complicated and they require a bunch of skills
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.840]  that not every Mac user has, especially in this day of people being raised on iPhones
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.920]  involves using another application with separate windows, involves dragging something from somewhere
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.640]  into that window. As you said, there's no way to organize by application. And I think iOS has
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.760]  a better model here where for the most part, the iOS model is that if an application wants to do
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:50.480]  a thing that it requires permission for it prompts you and that you, uh, you can say allow or deny,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.920]  like right from the application. So it's not, it's not like this making you go someplace else
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.960]  and drag a thing or whatever. And then the second thing is that they're adding now is
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.440]  these reminders, which say, just so you know, the Facebook application has been using your
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.680]  location for the past three hours and here's where it, you know, like those dialogue boxes.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:12.400]  Yeah. That is a great, you know, suspenders to add to the belt to say, yeah, we know you
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.400]  tapped through that dialogue and it was really easy to do, but just a reminder, this is what
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.280]  this app is doing. Those two things combined makes people aware of what the app is doing
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:28.000]  while also not require them to do more complicated stuff. Like there's nothing developers of iOS
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.840]  applications don't have to have like a read me file or a support site explaining to people how
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.880]  to click allow. Like it's, it's people, it's very easy to do. It's way too complicated to do that
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:44.160]  on the Mac. Even I find it annoying just because it's so tedious and time consuming. Like I
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.480]  understand the consequences. If it's good enough for iOS, explain to me the consequences here,
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:55.680]  allow me to quickly say yes. But then to your point, have some place where this is more visible
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.920]  to me, a Mac like way to do it would be some kind of like activity report. Maybe you can,
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.760]  maybe you can be in screen time for the Mac and you know, like should buy application to show
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.680]  me what they're all doing. So I can look at a report if you're interested and then proactively
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.960]  occasionally remind me that something's doing a weird thing. So I have, you know, it's,
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.680]  it's a delicate balance, but that's, that's the line they're trying to walk with the Mac now
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.800]  and with iOS for that matter. And on the Mac there, they have made it too complicated and
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.840]  too annoying. Yeah, it's occurred to me that maybe they could put some of that in the get info window
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:31.920]  in the finder. So if you select an app and you do, nobody knows what that window is. I do. Of course
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:38.800]  I did it 10 minutes ago today, but nobody else ever looked at that window. Do you know another
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.320]  thing? So this is the Mac OS 10 knowledge that I think even fewer people know. Do you know the
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.080]  difference between a command I command option? I command option is show info and it's a,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.720]  instead of command, I will open a window and then if you select another file, it, it doesn't change.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.480]  But a command option, I will show you a floating palette. And as the selection changes in the
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:04.320]  finder, it changes what it's showing you the info for. And we are the only two people who know that
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.480]  in the entire world. I thought I use it all the time and inspector versus info windows,
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.560]  but it's just, it's such a, it's such a relative classic Mac OS is still hanging out there.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.840]  And then the command option is not from classic Mac OS. That's the nextism I believe that
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.720]  we benefited from during the transition. Yeah. Cause next was a little bit more
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.760]  inspector-y. Yeah, inspector-y. Yeah. Sort of weird that they're both there,
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.840]  but I remember thinking it was pretty cool in it. Don't tell anybody. Someone at Apple will
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:39.520]  find out they're both there and remove one of them. I will say while you mention it,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.080]  next is an exception to my spelling rules. I do spell it the way that next spelled it.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.560]  You're a mess. We've gone over the punctuation outside the quotes and you're spelling next with
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:55.600]  the capital X and T because it just, when you spell it without their funky capitalization,
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:02.640]  it doesn't look like the same company. It's like, it doesn't read to me as the, the former company
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:07.120]  that Apple acquired with Steve jobs, just like Mac OS all squished together with capital M doesn't
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.680]  read like an Apple product. That's because there's no Apple product by that name.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.400]  I don't know how much longer we can roll, but let me thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.720]  You're never going to guess who it is. It's our good friends at Squarespace. I love this company.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.720]  Look, Squarespace is where you go to build, host, maintain a website. You can build a store.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:32.080]  You could host a podcast. You could host a blog. You could host a portfolio of your work.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.000]  If you're a designer, you could put menus up. If you run in a restaurant or you know,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.760]  someone is running a restaurant, anything you could do with a website or mix and match multiple
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.000]  of those things, you could do it with Squarespace and you do it all. Here's that word, WYSIWYG.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.040]  It's all in a WYSIWYG fashion. You do it right in a browser window. You drag stuff. You see it
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:58.720]  as you drag it. That's what you get. Really what you see is what you get. They have,
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:06.480]  in my opinion, one of the nicest analytic interfaces I've ever seen. So clear, such good
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.680]  data design, and it gives you a nice overview of where people are going on your site, where they're
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:17.280]  coming from. A lot less confusing than most analytics packages that I've ever seen, which
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:24.560]  typically seem like they were designed by people who shouldn't be designing anything. Just a great
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.520]  company. They have great customer service. Here's the deal. Next time you need a website or next
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.880]  time somebody comes to you and needs a website, try it at Squarespace first. Give it an hour.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.160]  See how far you get. Start building your website today at squarespace.com. And remember this,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.960]  enter this offer code, talk show, know the, just talk show at checkout. So you don't need it when
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.600]  you sign up. You can get started and then you get like 30 day free trial. When the 30 days are up
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:55.840]  and you want to keep your website, just remember talk show and you save 10%. What's the ATP code?
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:01.600]  Probably just ATP. Yep. I think so. Yeah. You don't know. You don't listen to the ads.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.680]  I can't do it. I was telling Marco when we were doing, I know Marco records the ads for the ATP
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:16.560]  before you guys start recording and then he can just, he just slots them in. But when you're,
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.120]  I don't listen to your live telecast. I always listen to the edited version when he, when you
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.120]  guys do sponsor breaks, how long do they last? Just a couple of seconds or do you guys get up and
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.560]  refresh your beverages in the live show? Yeah. Like when you're recording, like let's say it's
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.840]  Wednesday. It's last night, right? You probably, you guys probably did a show last night.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.880]  So like when you're recording and you've got a live audience that is listening along and chatting
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.720]  and IRC, um, what are the, what does Marco do for the sponsor breaks? There are no sparking
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.120]  sponsor breaks. Can't stop. Won't stop. Show must keep going, but you don't even mention it. There's
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:57.360]  no, not even mentioned. We don't even know where the ads are going to be when we're done recording
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:06.560]  in a live show. I have a lot of trouble doing a sponsor reads in post. It takes me, I, you know,
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:12.640]  I think I did it. I did it, you know, I think I did a fine job with those three sponsors reads
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.200]  tonight. One take right there, straight through off the top of my head. I can't think of anything
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:21.840]  I forgot to mention, but when I do them in post, because like, let's say the, uh, I don't have the
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.800]  ad when I'm, you know, I told you I would record tonight, but I, maybe I don't have the text for
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.040]  one of the ads. I'll do it tomorrow. It takes me like six takes. I feel like an idiot and,
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.720]  and I'll, I'll like, and there are times where I do it in posts like that. And I look at the
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.960]  running time and it's like seven minutes and I'm like, what the hell? I mean, I know my sponsor
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.120]  reads are sometimes long, but seven minutes. So what the hell am I doing? It's like without the
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:54.800]  pressure of feeling like I'm, I'm wasting you, John Syracuse's or whoever my guest of the episode
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.760]  is like, I don't want to bore you. I don't want to waste your time. Uh, so it, it gives me like
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.000]  an edge and it keeps me sharp on a sponsor read. Whereas when I'm just talking to myself in a
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.760]  microphone, uh, I do a terrible job. That's just acquired skill. Just like doing the ad reads in
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.880]  the show. It's a, I'm sure it's a thing that you could get good at if you wanted to do it. You got
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.360]  good to doing the ads in the show, right? So it's just a good question to practice. I feel like if
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.640]  it's something you wanted to do, a change you wanted to make, you could do it, but you sound
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.080]  comfortable doing them live in the show. And it's also a very different feeling psychologically.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.320]  Like I feel like right here we're having a conversation and I'm not talking to myself.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.320]  And when I first started doing podcasts, I definitely was self-conscious about it. It
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.240]  seems weird. I never really spent much time speaking into a microphone. Uh, I thought it
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:47.600]  was very weird in the first years of it hearing my own voice in my headphones. And technically,
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.280]  I don't even know what changed in the interim, but there was also like in the early years doing the
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:57.120]  show with Dan Benjamin, there was also a little bit of lag with the audio and it would, it would
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.000]  drive me nuts. Like I, I couldn't finish a sentence sometimes because I, I'm hearing my
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.440]  words from half a second ago. You get used to it, but I still find like if I record the ads like
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.280]  that, I, I, I have this, it's incredibly self-conscious. I'm doing something very weird
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:19.200]  talking to myself. Yeah. Well, I mean, the, the beauty of it is you can do six takes cause who
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.560]  cares? It's time consuming, but at least you, you are all, it's like, it's like writing, you know,
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.280]  you shouldn't during two daring fireball live versus being able to write ahead of time and
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.840]  then decide when it's ready to be published. There you go. Uh, I hear you bought a fridge.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:41.120]  Uh, yes I did. And you talked about it with a friend of the show, Merlin man on your show.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.880]  Honest to God, like that was reconcilable differences. I did buy a fridge and that was
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.320]  intended to be like, Oh, I bought a fridge. Let me just mention it for two minutes. But it just,
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:58.880]  it just spooled out of me and eventually became an entire show. Like it was not, not the intention.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.640]  And it's not even like, it's not even really like a good story with like a twist ending
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:09.200]  and or anything like it's not even a story at all. It is just merely a sort of a recitation of
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.040]  the events involving the purchase and installation of a refrigerator, but I'm glad people enjoyed it.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:23.120]  Um, yeah, I'll put a link in rectives fridge show. You must've had tons of this with, you know,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.560]  your when you move, yeah. And you got to like new furniture and new kitchen and new, I mean,
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.000]  unless Amy just deals with all this stuff, but like just, it's gotta be, you know,
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.360]  that multiplied by a thousand, right? Uh, yeah, I love our fridge. We have a really nice fridge
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.600]  and I love it to death. It's one of my favorite things I've ever owned and it's always got ice
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.560]  and it doesn't have, it doesn't have a stupid thing. You stick a cup in and it shoots ice.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.480]  You just open the freezer drawer and then there's a big bucket of ice and it's always filled up and
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:57.840]  we're never out of ice, which was in our old house where we rented and had like a typical renters
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.400]  fridge, you know, kept stuff cold, kept stuff frozen, but you know, didn't really have any,
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:08.480]  any features. Do you do any of the fancy ice stuff for your fancy drinks?
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:15.920]  Uh, no, I've got these, uh, uh, I'm not a believer in that. Uh, I think it's
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:22.880]  sort of a waste of time even though you like the clear ice or weird shapes like balls or
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:28.880]  large cubes. I have the balls, but what I have that's easier and it's the only thing I really
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:35.760]  use are the large cubes and they're in a, is it silicon or silicone? So I think it's a brand
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:43.600]  called Tuvalo, uh, the Tuvalo king size ice. Let's see if that's right. Um, and it's super easy.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.320]  Just fill it up and it makes six, you know, sort of fist size cubes of ice.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:56.080]  Here's, here's the question. If, uh, you had a magic cost tree, super efficient butler who
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.320]  could give you perfectly clear ice whenever you wanted it instantly, would you use that in your
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:08.400]  drinks? No, I honestly don't care about clear ice. I really don't. And I care about so many things
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:14.480]  and I, uh, like if I am making a cocktail, I would like, I like to have a really nice,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:20.240]  uh, like if there's like a lemon slice or a, you know, appeal, uh, I like to make that nice and
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:25.520]  neat. I like to pick my own lemons and oranges and I picked them specifically as to whether the
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:33.920]  rind has any, any gross no blemishes, no blemishes, no blue ink, but I, I, I don't get it. I, I, you
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.240]  know, I have all sorts of weird quirks. I have been picky about my pens. I'm picky about all
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.400]  sorts of things. So I'm not putting anybody down who is picky about clear ice and, uh,
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:49.760]  our friends at studio neat who make all sorts of fun stuff like the space pen and notebooks and
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:56.160]  the, uh, the glyph, which is a great product. That's a little, uh, tripod mount for any phone.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.200]  So you can snap it on your phone and put it on a tripod. They make all sorts of cool stuff,
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.040]  including a clear ice kit. And I just could not care about their clear ice kit.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:08.800]  Well, again, the kit means you have to make it yourself. I was just asking like if you,
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.480]  if you could get it instantly, but you don't care about it. Like I don't care about drinks
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.240]  and I don't really drink at all, but I do think clear ice is really cool. And the main,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.640]  uh, first of all, I think it looks cool. But the second thing is if you're talking about different
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:26.240]  sizes and shapes, you have a drink like in the summer where the ice starts to get small and you
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:32.000]  drink and some of the ice cubes come into your mouth, right? When an ice cube has all the air
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.040]  pockets, the sort of texture and also kind of taste of an ice cube with a bunch of those air
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:43.280]  pockets on your tongue is very different from an ice cube that does not have all those air pockets
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:47.840]  in it. Like I feel like it actually changes how the drink tastes, even if it's just ice water,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:54.240]  you know, the taste I'm talking about, the aerated ice cube taste. And I, I find the clear ice more
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:58.800]  luxurious. That said, I do not make clear ice and I've never made it in my entire life and never
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:02.960]  would because it's way too much of a hassle for me to deal with. And I don't even put ice in my
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:07.440]  drinks most of the time. So it's not a thing that is a factor in my life, but I do, I do find it
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:13.600]  appealing. So if I had that instant butler, I would accept clear ice almost all the time.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.320]  Yeah, well, I guess if I had the butler, I mean, who am I kidding?
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:23.680]  What is your preference? Like, you know, would you rather have a clear ice cube or a non-clear
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.160]  one? The clear ones look cooler and I feel like they taste better.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.960]  Yeah, I guess if I didn't have to do any work, I wouldn't have to. Even my pal Lee, the guy who
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.840]  runs Hopsin Laundry, my beloved cocktail bar here in Philly, where he fusses over everything. He
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:41.440]  does not fuss over clear ice. He has very good ice. And he's very particular that this drink
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.000]  gets a cube and this drink gets a sphere and whatever, but he doesn't bother with the clear
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.960]  ice. I don't see anything in the silicone thing that helps with the clearing. No, this doesn't
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:57.920]  clear. This is just just a way to make big ice cubes. Yeah. If you're doing it commercially,
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.520]  like unless I guess you could increase your price by a lot if you go through the hassle,
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:05.920]  but it is quite a hassle to do. Yeah. And it's like, you know, some of these ones,
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.480]  it's like they make a big thing and then it's like the non-clear part settles to the bottom
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.840]  and you've got to sit there and like cut it in half and all this stuff. And I've seen things
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.320]  on YouTube where there's like restaurants that have like $40,000 ice cube makers just to get
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:26.080]  clear ice. How did we get off on the ice? Oh, the refrigerator talk. I'll tell you what though,
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.440]  as much as I like the fridge, we have a, I forget the name of the brand, but we have a supposedly
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:38.080]  Oscar. I forget what it is. A dishwasher Bosch. No, it's something else, but I don't want to
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.960]  besmirch them too bad, but it's apparently a very nice dishwasher. It does get the dishes clean. I
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:48.240]  will say it will to get the dishes clean, but man, oh man, is the interface terrible. And it's
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:53.360]  got, even though it's brand new and it's nice, it has those, uh, has those type of buttons
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.360]  that kind of click and I guess they're waterproof. You know what I mean? That there's like a membrane
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.560]  sort of like microwave buttons often are, but the, but your touches just don't register sometimes
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.840]  and you'll hit like, you just press harder. Yeah. And you hit start and it, and it makes,
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.920]  I don't know what the symbol means. It, you hit start and it makes, it puts three little
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:19.280]  horizontal lines up on this screen. And that means go and you close the door and then nothing happens.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.280]  And then you open it up and you hit the same button and you get the same three lines and
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.640]  you close the door and it kicks in. Yeah, this is, I feel like there's a gap in still,
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.480]  still in this modern age. Like we were all so excited when, you know, back in our youth,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.440]  when consumer reports came as like, finally someone is going to do reviews of things that
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.080]  people previously didn't review, like a clear ride, look at dishwashers and reliability and
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.760]  cars. And in the modern era we have things like, well, this was just, you know, online reviews was
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.360]  a big revolution. Then things like the wire cutter where they're like, I don't have time to read a
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.880]  bunch of reviews. Just tell me which one I should buy. None of these, I feel like address this major
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.840]  concern that is such a factor in all of our lives, which is, is this the best whatever for you? Oh,
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.640]  here's how much it costs. Here's the features it has. If the interface drives you insane, that is
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.120]  a huge factor. I don't care how reliable it is. I don't care how much it costs. I don't care how
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.960]  clear it gets. This is every day. I have to use this interface. If the buttons are annoying to
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.280]  press, let alone if the buttons are inscrutable. And I feel like there's, you know, I'm mostly
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.800]  complaining about the wire cut here. This way too little emphasis in consumer reports, in any kind
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:29.680]  of product reviews, in the wire cutter of the user interface of physical products that can make or
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.280]  break. Like I understand you do want to know how does it perform and you do want to know about
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.320]  reliability and you do want to know about features. But in the end, even if you have all those, if
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.280]  the thing that you're describing is the case, this, this, you will not love this appliance.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.920]  This appliance will slowly drive you mad. Yeah, totally. And it's, it's just why you're driving
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.480]  me mad. The other thing that stinks and I get it, you know, I want to be a good citizen. Maybe it's
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.360]  even legal now. I don't know, but it takes forever to clean the dishes. It does get them very clean,
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.280]  but I guess, you know, like as a water saving measure it, it squirting like one tiny hot thing
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.400]  at a time. I don't know why mine also takes a long time. And I, I do wonder, I assumed it took
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.920]  forever because it's doing like an extremely thorough job because I feel like it is doing
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.800]  an extremely thorough job, but I don't, I don't know what's going on inside there. I don't know
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.200]  what's taking so long. I was talking to Marco about it. Marco's, Marco's convinced it's a
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:29.360]  water saving measure. Maybe. But it's funny because it's like it, it, it just shows the
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.920]  difference. You know, people in all sorts of industries, people designing engineers who are
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.880]  designing dishwashers are thinking about water converse at conservation now. Whereas like you
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.400]  just know that like when dishwashers first became a thing, like, I don't know, late fifties, early
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:50.720]  sixties, the engineers at general electric, all they were thinking was how do we close down these
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.040]  dishes as fast as we can? Cause that's the selling feature. That's the error where they said, if we
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.440]  can get these dishes clean by spraying them with the radiation, we'll do it. We don't care about
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.080]  you, your healthy environment. We just want to get dishes clean. And then we're going to advertise
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.320]  the hell out of the fact that ours is faster than the other guys. Our radiation really removes every
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:14.480]  trace of dirt. Totally, totally sanitizes them. No life remains on these dishes when we're done
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.600]  with them. I had a link in here. It looks like David Pogue is back at the New York Times. I
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.360]  don't know if that's a one-off thing. I haven't looked at that story fly through, but I didn't
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.960]  follow the link and didn't note that it was the New York Times. It's a story on Easter eggs and
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:37.440]  just totally rip off James Thompson's presentation. Do you know what? I don't know because I have James
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:44.720]  Thompson of, of a peak calc fame and drag thing fame. For those of us who are a little bit older,
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.160]  you still use drag thing. I'm running it right now. I'm looking at it right now,
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.080]  even though it's not retina, but you don't have a retina. No problem. So James Thompson was at
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.480]  a conference recently and did like a 28 minute talk on the history of Easter eggs. I've got
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.560]  it saved up. I have seen rave reviews of people saying that this is, they knocked it out of the
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:12.000]  park knowing James. I'm sure that he did. For those of you who don't know peak Calcs,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:21.920]  peak Calcs, Easter eggs are some of the most, those are not Easter eggs. I know the definition
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.880]  of Easter eggs expanded to ridiculous. It was kind of like a lunatic fringe lunatic fringe.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.640]  It was not an Easter egg and after dark French was a feature of after dark. It wasn't a hidden
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:38.640]  cool thing that you could discover. It was totally there. It was like, it was just a feature. And in
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.640]  the same way peak Calc, which is essentially a calculator, has a quote unquote Easter egg where
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:51.360]  there's an entire crazy 3d game environment in the same application and AR. Yeah. And AR like it.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.560]  Yeah. But, but it is not a cute hidden little feature somewhere that you would notice or could
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.160]  trigger. Even when you have things like all the breakout game and system seven or whatever that
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.360]  counts as an Easter egg because it was hidden like an Easter egg is hidden. And I guess the about
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.920]  stuff is the peak Calc stuff is kind of hidden in the about screen, but at a certain point,
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:15.840]  like I would love to know a number of lines of code. How, how much of peak Calc is the
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.760]  quote unquote Easter egg and how much is the calculator at this point? How much is the math
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.360]  engine or James would call it probably the math engine with the code carried over from whatever
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.160]  he wrote it in Pascal, like 20 something years ago. I'm just curious whether if you have any
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.480]  fond memories of Easter eggs from back in the day, what was the, the finder one? Was it the,
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.840]  it was the finder and if you held down the option key and went to about this Mac about the finder
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.360]  is about the finder with the little mountain range. Yep. I did that. Here's the thing that I'm
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.480]  thinking about Easter eggs the other day. I watched James's thing as well. That little thing
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.480]  where you hold on the option key when you select the about and it changes to the about the finder
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.840]  and you see the little Sierra Nevada mountains and sort of this abstract black and white artwork.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:08.160]  Um, I must have activated that Easter egg hundreds of times in my life on my Mac.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:17.600]  Why? Like once I did it once, then I knew that it was there. Uh, the discovery had been made.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.760]  There's not, it's not like there was any interactive elements or anything. If you,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.280]  you know, if there was scrolling credits, you can watch them scroll. But once you've done that,
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.120]  that's it. And I wasn't showing people, it's not like other people were there with me. Hey,
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:33.520]  let me show you this cool history that you might not know about in your Mac. Just me by myself. I
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.440]  would activate that Easter egg. And I think the reason I was doing it was like, you know, the
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.960]  thing that Apple says about all their current products, but is actually true of Easter eggs,
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:49.200]  surprise and delight. I just needed like, I just liked the idea that it was there and I would just
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:55.040]  activate it and get a little smile and be like, and have a little, little tiny micro dose of joy.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.960]  So yeah, there's that thing that somebody did cause they thought it would be fun.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.920]  And there's that graphic. My favorite or one of my favorites was, um,
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.560]  QuarkXPress had one and I might misremember. It's been a long time since I've used QuarkXPress,
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.640]  but for a number of years I used QuarkXPress more than I used any other app. I used it more
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:20.480]  than BB edit even. Um, and I got really, really good at it and there was a keyboard shortcut to,
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:28.960]  to delete the current element. And it wasn't just the delete key. It was like command option K or
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.560]  something like that. And the, the, the, the idea was, I think that you could be like in text
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.600]  editing mode where the delete key would delete the last character. But what do you really want to do
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.080]  is you want to delete the whole text box that you've placed on the pace board. So you do command
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:49.600]  option K or something like that. But if you held down an extra key, I forget if it was control,
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:56.160]  I think it was control. So you do control command option K a little alien came out from the side,
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:02.160]  marched over and then shot the element you were deleting with a Ray gun. And it would take like
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:08.800]  20 seconds for this. And I, I used it all the time, like late at night at the student newspaper,
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.560]  like you start going start crazy. I would, I would make the little QuarkXPress alien come out and
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.760]  spend 20 seconds deleting a thing that I could have deleted completely instantaneously. But I
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.200]  thought that was amusing. One of the beautiful things of the modern internet is that you can
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.880]  find a video of that happening, I believe on YouTube or some other source. Cause I remember
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.880]  Googling it at some time in the past and seeing the little animation. I never used QuarkXPress
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.640]  in real life, but yeah, it's totally one of those little Easter eggs that, you know, just there to
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:42.720]  be fun. And why were you activating it? Because you were looking for a tiny micro dose of surprise
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.800]  and delight. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if James mentioned it, but Mailsmith had an Easter
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:56.240]  egg where on on April 1st, it would add a preference to the notification set. Mailsmith
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:02.480]  is a, the email client made by bare bone software based on the text engine of BB edit. And on April
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.760]  1st, it would add a preference. And I think it was on by default to deliver a 10 kilovolt electric
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:14.720]  shock with each new email. And all it did is play like a little buzz sound, which was funny. I'm
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.960]  not really much for April 1st gags, but it was all right. But I do recall that while I was there,
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.640]  we got, did get some support mail from people who did not realize it was a joke.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.800]  I remember being impressed. One of the other Easter eggs I was impressed by that it invoked
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.880]  a new era of Easter eggs was the first, the first thing 3D Easter egg that I experienced,
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.760]  which was the Iguana flag on the power max. That was, I don't remember this. It was a nice
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.920]  combination. I think it's in James's talk. It was a nice combination of, so the power Mac,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.440]  the whole big thing with the power Mac was a power PC, a Macintosh and the whole message and sort of,
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.600]  you know, significance in the community was that these are much faster than your old Macs. They
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:04.320]  are more powerful. They can do all sorts of neat things that your old Mac could never do. Oh,
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.200]  right. Right. Like the graphing calculator. Yeah. And it was, and the Easter eggs followed
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.920]  along with that. I, this was, I think this was in, in firmware or something, or maybe there was some
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.160]  kind of key combination. I forget how to activate it, but basically it would take over your entire
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:25.200]  screen with a comically grainy by today's standard background image of one infinite loop with the
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.040]  flags that are, you know, in front of the building. Right. It was a kind of zoomed in more and there
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:36.160]  was a flag pole and hanging from the flag pole was a flag. I think it had a flag with somebody's
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.120]  pedaguan on it or something. And it was rendered in quick draw 3d, which you can recall as Apple's
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.880]  attempted a 3d API back in the day, or maybe it was, maybe it was like quick draw 3d rave,
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  or I don't know. I don't remember the particular standard, but it was a 3d flag again, comically
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.640]  green with a comically small number of polygons on it. And it would flap in the breeze and that
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.400]  this alone, it doesn't make any sense that this would be impressive, but this alone was impressive
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:05.360]  that you'd have a big color graphic, which looked quote unquote photorealistic in the background,
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.240]  cause it was just a photo. And then a 3d flag flapping in the breeze, which is really,
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.600]  it was a really hard thing to do. And it was demonstrating that as it, as it flapped at like
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.680]  12 frames per second or whatever, it was demonstrating the amazing power of these new
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.880]  computers, because you couldn't hope to render this at all at like one frame every seven seconds
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.200]  on like an old Mac or worse. Right. Right. And you had mouse control. I don't think there was
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.920]  a cursor on the screen, but if you move the mouse around, you could influence the direction of the
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.240]  wind on the flag. So you didn't actually see a cursor, but you'd noticed that it was interactive,
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:41.600]  that you changed the direction of the wind. And by changing the direction of the wind, you know,
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.160]  sort of making it go all the way to the right and all the way to the left and all the way to
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.080]  the right, like back and forth whipping, making the flag whip back and forth. You could eventually
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.600]  tear the flag off of the pole and it would like flutter down. And this was an amazing Easter egg,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.000]  cause it was like hidden inside your computer. It was 3d graphics and it was interactive and it was
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.480]  weird and had an iguana on it. And it was super Apple focused and it demonstrated the power of
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.720]  your power Mac. That's another one that stands out in my memory. It's a little weird that Apple
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.560]  doesn't do stuff like that anymore. I mean, you get the feeling that Steve Jobs wasn't really
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:15.040]  a fan of that sort of thing, which is weird because if you think about Steve jobs making
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.920]  like blue boxes with was he was and the pirate flag and everything like that, that was totally
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.640]  up his alley, but at a certain point he turned the corner on it. Or either outgrew it or decided
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.080]  that if it's not him doing it, don't do it. Cause now you're messing up his thing. It's great when
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.280]  he's messing up AT&T's phone system. It's not so great when you're messing up his thing.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.000]  Yeah. Cause the other thing I wouldn't, I don't know if sometimes you'd call them Easter eggs
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.520]  just because they were clever. But just an about box that did something interesting.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:49.680]  You know, you'd go to about this Mac or about this app and it would, you know, people, it was a,
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:56.320]  it was a place for, for clever developers to blow off steam. I mean, James obviously still has it,
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:03.760]  but, um, yeah, yeah. But that's, that was thrown by the wayside. It was the one,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.160]  it was the one window that the developer felt like was for them. It was a place where you could go.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.760]  The only reason the user would go there is to maybe get a version number. So that's the only
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.680]  information you have to convey. But every other part of that window is it's like the place for
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.920]  the developer to take a bow and depending on how deeply you want to bow, if you want to put in a
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.880]  breakout game or a 3d driving game with an AR component, that's the place to do it.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.800]  But it's interesting that Apple sort of grew, went away from that. I can't remember the last
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:38.000]  time anybody found an Easter egg in Apple software, but Google still does it famously
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.560]  all the time. You know, they had Mario driving around Google maps on Mario day. Do you know
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.400]  this Mario day is March 10th because it looks like Mario. It's terrible. It's like May the 4th,
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:58.160]  all these sort of pun based holidays are not great. May the 4th at least I cringe at it. I think
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.840]  it's a little corny, but at least you would say like when it is May 4th, you would say May the
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:10.480]  4th and it does sound like May the 4th be with you. It works at a certain level where Mar 10
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:17.280]  equals Mario. It's kind of a stretch. I'm trying to think who else does Easter eggs.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.040]  That's probably still Apple one's hidden in there. Like people can sneak stuff in, but it's
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:26.160]  huh. The thing is there's so much more software now that, you know, so many more applications,
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.640]  the number of applications in the app store dwarfs the number of applications ever made for
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.600]  classic Mac OS by probably orders of magnitude. So if there are awesome Easter eggs out there,
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.080]  maybe we just don't even know about them. I feel like at various points in the early life of the
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.120]  Mac, I was at least aware of, if not had a copy of every application available for the computer,
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.960]  right? Certainly all the popular ones, right? So you could, it's like being in a small town where
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.120]  you know everybody. And then you know, like these three have Easter eggs and everybody eventually
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.080]  knows about the Easter eggs and we share it. And with like with millions of apps in the app store,
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.680]  that doesn't happen anymore. There's not, there's not that sort of it was like television, you know,
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:06.800]  when we're all watching the same three networks and the same five shows, it's a lot easier to
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.960]  have a shared understanding of the current state of play. But you added this, here's a story you
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:20.160]  added to the show notes about Apple locking batteries to iPhones. Michael Tsai has it on
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.640]  his website. I'll link to that in the show notes. This has been growing for a while and I think that
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:34.880]  the gist of it now is that it's not that you can't use a non-authorized battery replacement,
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:41.520]  but if you put a non-authorized battery replacement into an iPhone, and presumably maybe iPads too,
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.360]  or if not, it might be coming. You get like a permanent warning in settings that tells you
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:53.120]  that the battery needs to be serviced, which would annoy the hell out of me to have something like
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.480]  that, that I can't, especially if it badge settings, I don't think it does badge settings,
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:03.440]  but imagine if it did drive me nuts. Yeah. So this is the type of thing where like now it's a bunch
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.120]  of people experimenting. So this is, it's not a rumor. It's a real thing that's happening,
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:14.080]  but it's unclear what the actual situation is. Situation could be that the logic in Apple's
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.840]  operating system that tries to validate the battery with the little chip that's in there,
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:24.240]  uh, you know, can, it triggers this battery needs service thing, but really it's erroneous because
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.240]  what it should just be detecting is that this is not, it's not the battery needs service. It's just
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:31.760]  that it's not matched up with the hardware and that should be expressed in a different way.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.600]  Or it could be that this is totally intended behavior and Apple's trying to stop people
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.480]  from putting in other batteries, but the effect of it may end up being the same. And this is
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:46.560]  this ongoing battle of like, uh, and it's, it's, you get it, even if it is an authorized part,
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:51.920]  if it's just that if the service is performed by someone other than an authorized Apple itself or
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:58.400]  an authorized Apple repair technician, there's some kind of magic incantation that once you put
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:04.480]  the replacement part in you, you do some sort of diagnostic thing that says, okay, it's now it's
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.400]  authorized. Yeah. But I'm involving some sort of private key that only Apple has or something like
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:13.120]  that. Like the thing that this is part of the larger right to repair issue of like, should
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.680]  Apple, it shouldn't be legal for Apple to stop people from start third parties for repairing
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:24.400]  them. It reminds me a lot of the printer ink DRM debacle of years past where printer manufacturers
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:27.920]  make all their money off the sink and so they wanted to make it so that you couldn't use third
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:32.080]  party ink cartridges. So they put some sort of DRM in the ink cartridges and then tried to sue
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:38.640]  the makers. Absolutely nothing about making your print print output look better or come out faster
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:46.400]  or have higher fidelity. It was simply there for pure, uh, uh, spite marketing spite.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.080]  Yeah. And, but see, the thing is there, their story was similar to the Apple. They would say,
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:55.520]  well, we just want people to have, make sure people have, you know, guaranteed compatible,
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:00.880]  highest quality ink that we can control. Who knows what you're getting from those third party things
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.640]  that might not work right. Or it might work right with this version, but then we open our software
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:08.000]  and that ink doesn't work because they didn't realize they had to design in this way to do
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.800]  account for some change in our printer. So really it's the safest if you use our first, like that's,
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.040]  it's exactly the same story of, uh, with the Apple batteries, like, Oh, well, third parties,
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.160]  you know, we want it to be installed by an authorized dealer. We want it to be a genuine
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.040]  part. And that's why we put this code in there and blah, blah, blah. And like you can, again,
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:29.520]  within the company, I can imagine people convincing themselves that what they're doing
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:35.600]  is in the best interest of the customer, but in back in reality, it is not in the best interest
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:39.760]  of the customer. Like, I feel like it was clearly established that it is better for people to be
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.440]  able to get cheaper printer ink. It's bad for a single company. They didn't have the monopoly
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:48.240]  on this because they raised the price and because there's no competition. Right. And so it's bad if
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:55.040]  no one, but Apple can successfully put an Apple battery back into an Apple phone. And there's
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.360]  always going to be cases where like, Oh, some third party, uh, badly installed the battery and
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:04.000]  it blew up instead of playing on fire and killed everyone on board. But that's just, that's part
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.720]  of what Apple has to deal with as a company in the world. And I honestly, it wouldn't be that
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.160]  big a deal because what Apple would say is, yeah, that's because the third party did it and they did
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.040]  a bad job, right? It would be actually good for Apple to be able to explain that it would help
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.080]  people keep people away from it. But the reality is that that doesn't happen. People just get
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.200]  cheaper batteries and third parties and everyone is better for it except for apparently Apple who
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:29.200]  just can't stand the idea of that happening. Yeah. And the other one, and I don't think that
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:34.960]  there's an issue with it at the moment, but I know that in that third party, uh, repair scene
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:40.400]  for phones, the big one is repairing cracked displays, uh, because they're just displays
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.840]  are made of grass, glass, and people sometimes unfortunately drop their phone and then the glass
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:51.120]  shatters and people have different, there's different amounts of shattering and people
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:56.560]  have different standards for what they'll put up with once they've done it. Um, and you know,
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:02.480]  uh, I would probably go the authorized route. I've done it. In fact, I think twice that I've dropped
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:09.200]  an iPhone. Um, but I totally respect that. Uh, some people, if they could do it for half price
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.840]  and it still looks like a nice display, it's an, I guess an Apple part. I mean, you can't really
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:20.720]  have a third party display. They would like to save money on it. Um, I get it. You know, I, I'm
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:27.680]  not a, uh, I'm, I'm probably more on Apple side on the right to repair stuff than a lot of people.
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:31.840]  A lot of nerds, like a lot of nerds are really upset about all of this stuff and I get it. Like
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.440]  your phone, you should be able to do whatever you want with it. Um, but I know like the, I fix it
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:43.040]  guys are really down on all the glue that Apple uses to put things together. I mean, I feel like
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.640]  that's a separate issue, like the issue of how repairable they are. Right. You can be militant
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.880]  about that or can you, you can not be militant about it, but it's, it's the idea that if I'm
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.920]  physically able to do a repair or replacement, like if I'm able to do that with the tools and
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.080]  skills that I have, but then some kind of essentially DRM lockout prevents the device
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:09.680]  from working from appearing to work correctly in the future for no actual good reason other than
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.600]  just like Apple doesn't want this to happen. That's bad. Like we can't rely on Apple's
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:18.320]  benevolence to have reasonable repair prices and wait times. We, we want there to be pressure like
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.920]  for years and years, you know, before the iPhone and you know, there was authorized Apple dealers
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:27.760]  before there were Apple stores. That's where you went to get Apple stuff done. That is a
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.400]  well-established system for Apple having some modicum of control because to be an authorized
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.560]  Apple dealer, the word authorized means Apple authorized you to do it. I would go beyond that
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.520]  and say it should be perfectly possible to have completely unauthorized repair centers for these
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:47.440]  things, right? As long as you know, they're the, the backstops against all the safety and the
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.240]  danger things should be legal backstops that exist for consumer perception, independent of any
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.320]  individual company. Like in other words, liability for doing a bad phone repair and it blows up a
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.320]  battery. We're like, that's the legal system and our laws should protect us against that. It's not
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.040]  like we're saying a laissez-faire if you battery blows up tough luck, like, you know, that's,
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:11.200]  that's why we have laws. But beyond that, Apple shouldn't have any say in whether you're allowed
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.640]  to get your phone repaired. They can void your warranty because again, that's an Apple thing.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.520]  That's always been the deal. Fine. You get it repaired someplace else. It's not an authorized
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.200]  Apple dealer. You avoid your warranty. Like these are the trade offs that need to be made. And it's
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.200]  not it, you know, the slippery slope. But like if you allow this, it will be madness. We lived
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.040]  in this world for years where there was authorized Apple dealers, no Apple stores and also
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.560]  unauthorized Apple dealers and nobody, you know, the world did not end. It is a perfectly viable
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.120]  system. You could take these things apart, put them back together and they just worked.
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:44.400]  Uh, it reminds me of a longstanding observation. You still have a TiVo.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.560]  I have multiple TiVos.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.320]  Uh, so we're still a TiVo family. And that's why, uh, I think we've talked, you and I have talked
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:57.760]  about this on the show before. It's very hard to convey to somebody who doesn't own a TiVo,
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.400]  how much better TiVo fast forwarding and skipping around is and how you never, ever have to wait for
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.880]  anything. It's always super fast. They've even added better features where certain shows now get
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.200]  indexed where you can just hit that. Do you have, do you have the green button D and it skips
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:22.880]  it perfectly skips the commercials. But we, we, we first computerized television or video watching,
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:28.640]  if you will, to make it better and to do amazing things like time shifting without having to
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:38.000]  do manage a bunch of VHS tapes and a, a much easier. I mean, it was, uh, people forget it.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.600]  Again, we're going to lose the younger crowd, but the blinking 12 on the VCR was a real thing.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.480]  That was a real thing where VCRs were so, so bad to use, had such a terrible user interface
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.320]  that people didn't even bother to set the clock. And if you don't have the clock set,
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.840]  you can't program anything in advance. You can't say, well, I'm going on vacation and I want to
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.960]  tape my favorite show on Tuesday night. Well, if the clock isn't set, good luck. People didn't
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:10.800]  use it. TiVo revolutionized this. It made it, you had this nice little TV guide right on the screen
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:17.280]  and you'd say, that's the show I want. And then you'd get it. And it was great. We used computers
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:22.960]  to make watching TV better. And now we use computers to make watching TV worse with
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.360]  unskippable Hulu ads. And like we went from me using computers to be able to skip ads if you
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:35.440]  want to, to using computers to make it so that you cannot skip the ads. Yeah. Well, in some respects,
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:41.120]  we also may use computers to make TV better still as in let's forego the entire concept of a
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.600]  continuous stream of shows that air at fixed times and then having a device deal with them,
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:49.360]  streaming services, the shows just exist and you watch them when you want. So that's an improvement.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:54.960]  But now that they have control over sort of the venue again, they're using that control to
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.200]  extract money in various ways. Although I have to say that for the most part, first of all,
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:04.640]  my TV usage, my TiVo usage has been decreasing as I have more and more shows around streaming
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:12.800]  services. And second, I prefer the experience of using a completely commercial free streaming
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.240]  service that I pay for and can stream and download anytime. I don't want them the experience of TiVo
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:26.240]  in all ways except for the control factor, because if I have to use it on TV OS, I'm using the
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:33.040]  terrible Apple remote. And if I'm using it on an iOS device, I find the playback interfaces,
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:37.840]  the sort of interface that, you know, on the screen that you use to play the show in all of my
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.840]  applications to be terrible. I want to sit down every single one of these developers and say,
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:46.560]  let me explain to you the things that people do when they're watching shows on their iPad and how
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.080]  terrible your interface is at doing those things. Like the ones that don't have like a go back 15
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:57.280]  seconds or that's just like the tip of the iceberg, right? You know, I could start getting
[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:02.800]  out of those buttons. I could start getting into obscure stuff like the idea that if when I pause
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:07.680]  your video to like read the letter that someone is writing, if you dim the screen so much that I
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:11.680]  can't see the stuff anymore, why do you think I'm pausing it? Yes, I could be pausing it to go to
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.760]  the bathroom, but I could also be pausing it to pick something out of a frame. You have to give
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:20.320]  me a way to remove your HUD with a second tap, which many applications do, but many applications
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.320]  do not. You know, another thing people do all the time, they turn on the captions to tell what
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:29.360]  somebody said. This one barrier that Apple got right, the what did he say, you know, Siri thing,
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:33.200]  which makes you feel silly, but at least the future exists. Go back a little bit and turn
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:37.440]  on captions. If captions are four levels deep in the menu, that's not a good experience.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:44.000]  Yes. So many things. And remembering playback, I cannot express to you how important it is for
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.480]  you to remember my playback position because you do not. It is infuriating. Like you just got to
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:52.480]  get these basics right. And because there are so many applications, they all have an opportunity
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.280]  to screw up that interface in their own unique ways. Right. Imagine a book that you couldn't
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.920]  bookmark. Or it would try to, but then it would forget. And just drop you 70 pages prior or
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:08.080]  something like that. Or keep insisting after you finish the book that you are in the middle of
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.920]  chapter one. And every time you go back to the library, the book flies out of the shelf and hits
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.040]  you in the forehead and says, Hey, you want to continue reading chapter one? You're like, I
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:18.960]  finished that book. How can I convince you that I finished reading that book? Stop telling me to
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.360]  resume in the middle of chapter. Do I have to read it again to convince you library that I finished
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.640]  the book? That's I've had that experience with streaming services that like keep insisting that
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.000]  I resume watching a series that I had fully finished watching because there's some of the
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.640]  metadata about what I've seen and what I haven't is messed up and I have no way to fix it.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.000]  Trenton Larkin Do you see this thing that came out today where Apple released a series of ASMR
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.360]  videos to YouTube? I did. And I at first I thought that was like a third party like someone just took
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:52.000]  a bunch of Apple videos and did some ASMR stuff. But then eventually after the 75th time I saw the
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.320]  link, I actually followed it and saw that it was literally an official Apple video. And I was a
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.840]  little bit surprised by that. But you know, it's YouTube and they're trying different things.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.320]  What does ASMR stand for? I'm googling it right now.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.120]  Dan Kloeppel I used to know the something sensory
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:10.480]  something response. Trenton Larkin
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:15.680]  Yeah, something like that. Autonomous sensory meridian response.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:17.520]  Dan Kloeppel I got two out of the four,
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:18.640]  partial credit. Trenton Larkin
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:28.640]  Basically, it's satisfying noises. You know, like people crunch paper. It's just a huge on
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.520]  I guess everything's huge on YouTube. There's a niche for everything.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.200]  Dan Kloeppel Well, this is this is actually a pretty big thing. And it's a little bit
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:41.280]  woo woo with the whole like, who gets what experience from watching these videos,
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:46.000]  but I feel like anybody, especially if you've never seen it before, will get some reaction
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  from the experience, perhaps a reaction that might surprise you. Because if you like,
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.520]  it's just a video of people whispering and crumpling paper, I'm not going to find that
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:59.440]  remotely interesting. You may find it incredibly interesting and satisfying, or you may find it
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.760]  mildly more interesting than you thought you would. But I doubt anyone will look at an ASMR
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.760]  video for the very first time and say, I find this exactly as boring as I thought I would.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.840]  Trenton Larkin Right. And it's I don't know how they're
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.080]  recording the sounds because it's and they're, you know, the Apple angle is that these are shot
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.760]  on iPhone. And they are gorgeous videos. It's again, I found it. I'm not really into the sound
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:23.840]  that much. But it was interesting. And the one where the woman was whispering was definitely
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:29.040]  it. You really want headphones for that one. Now that every one of them opens with best best heard
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:37.760]  on head with headphones on. But I just like it because it ups my it makes me up my game,
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:43.600]  or at least raise my raise my goals for what what I can shoot with my phone because I'm like,
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:49.520]  Damn, this is this is like a real movie. My iPhone movies still look like home videos. You know,
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:56.960]  I feel like get yourself a gimbal or a tripod. Yeah. It seems like a lot of work. Yeah, that's
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:04.400]  fine. Anything else you wanted to talk about? I had a whole bunch of stuff on the future of
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:10.480]  Mac OS, but we don't have time to get into that now. We don't have time on that. We I know that
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:18.240]  you're very excited. The Mac Pro is coming. What is and I feel like this is to me, I talked to
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:25.040]  every guest about it every week is what is your take on this 16 inch MacBook Pro? Is it a
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:31.120]  replacement for the 15 or not? I think it is at this point. I think I mean, even if the 15 hangs
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:37.600]  around, I think essentially this is the successor to that. And eventually, in the same way that
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:43.040]  models eventually fall off the end of Tim Cook's Apple, the 15 inch will be in the dust bin and the
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:49.280]  16 inch will be the new 15 inch. That is my current expectation. Did you guys talk about
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:54.960]  those weird rumors about people spotting the 16 inch? I didn't listen last time. We did. We
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.800]  have that in the notes and we discussed it amongst ourselves. It never actually made it into a show.
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.920]  The joke I made about it, which my two co-hosts didn't get because they don't remember this,
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:09.040]  is that what we're talking about is someone posted a photo of a supposed
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:16.640]  prototype of the 16 inch MacBook in a public place, like a public cafe or Starbucks or something.
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:26.240]  Yeah, not even like Cafe Max on campus, like a Cupertino area lunch spot. It just seems so
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.760]  bizarre. Who would do that? Well, so the joke I made about it was that I'd like that photo
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:39.360]  better if it was on the floor of an elevator. And I was joking about it in the early days of
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:47.920]  MacRumors. The thing that happened a lot and became a source of parody was because digital
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:53.920]  photography was in its infancy, lots of the supposed spy photos of things were terrible
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:59.680]  quality, very grainy, low resolution, terrible lighting, because who had any kind of camera,
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:03.760]  let alone a digital camera? And what was the resolution and what was their light sensitivity?
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:10.320]  And that made it incredibly easy to make quote unquote convincing fake photos. And so eventually
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.520]  it became like a joke that every time there was a supposed photo of something, it was like
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:18.880]  Bigfoot. Like, why are they never in focus? And so one of the famous ones was someone took a picture
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:24.800]  of this is the new iMac. And here it is a box on the floor of an elevator in a supposed convention
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:33.200]  center from a weird angle, incredibly grainy. Like if if you actually had access to this thing
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:39.040]  and a camera, no one would take just one terrible grainy photo and post that. And so when I saw this
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:44.160]  picture of this Mac and supposedly in the Starbucks or whatever, I'm like this in the
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:51.360]  modern era, the the resolution and color fidelity and focus of this photo was awful. Like, was it
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:59.760]  taken on an iPhone 3G? Like, I don't understand what took this photograph. And most of the mystery
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:05.040]  and authenticity of the photo comes from the fact that it is so low quality that you can't tell if
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:10.160]  that was drawn by someone with a Sharpie marker, or whether it's an actual physical device.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:16.400]  Yeah, I guess the if you want to, you know, give them the photographer the benefit of the doubt
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:22.480]  and and and make the argument that it is a legit shot, I guess. Maybe it was somebody who was
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:27.360]  nervous about being realized what they were shooting and that this person however crazy
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:33.680]  they are to be using a prototype off campus certainly doesn't want to be photographed.
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:39.040]  They're in a public place, first of all. And second of all, we see creep shots of celebrities
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:43.760]  all the time, you're much more likely to be beat down by the bodyguard of a celebrity than some
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:48.240]  Apple nerd to yell at you when you're in a public place, you can take a picture of them at their
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:52.560]  table. I know you don't want to be creepy. But the point is, if you took the creepiest of creep shot
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:56.240]  under your arm with your iPhone, it would be 100 times better than the quality of that photo. I
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:00.560]  don't understand why the photo is so bad and why there's only one of them. Right? Well, the other
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:06.080]  crazy thing about it is that and I just find this so hard to believe, but it would kind of be cool,
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:11.920]  it would kind of warm my heart. But the fact that this rumor is that the Apple logo on the back of
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:17.760]  the display is the the six color Apple logo. Yeah, that's that's a separate rumor. And this that's
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:23.760]  why this this photo like when I look doesn't show the Apple but no, it does. It does. Yeah,
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:29.760]  that's the reason I made the elevator joke is because this is exactly how in the old days,
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.920]  you would make a convince a quote unquote, convincing fake. You'd make it grainy,
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:37.520]  you'd make it plausible and you incorporate some other rumors. So you're like there has been a
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.560]  rumor going around that Apple is going to bring back six color Apple logo, which I certainly
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:45.040]  hope they do because I love that logo. And I think it is plausible rumor. Incorporate that into your
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:51.440]  fake by getting someone to take it, take a grade Dell, shove an Apple sticker on it, and then take
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.000]  an off kilter low resolution, poorly lit out of focus photo of it and then post that one photo
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.800]  online and say, here it is. I caught the 16 inch MacBook Pro in real life. And here's the thing,
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:05.120]  if the MacBook Pro comes out and it is gray and has an Apple logo on the back of it,
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.680]  that doesn't mean that photo is real. It just means that they successfully made a reasonable
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:16.560]  fake. God, like I used to be frustrated when I was younger that people were so bad at producing
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.320]  leaks, but eventually people got good at it. Like when we see the parts leaks for the iPhones now,
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:27.440]  they're good. There's like 15 photos. They're in focus, they're high resolution and they are legit.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:31.280]  And when the real phone comes out, we can compare them side by side and say, yep, those were the
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.640]  parts of the phone. Yeah. Or the cases, right? Like the cases sometimes leak and it's like,
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.200]  yep, that was a perfect cutout. Down to the millimeter because they give those specs to
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:46.160]  the case makers before the phones come out. I think they do with some select partners,
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:52.080]  but there's a huge racket, like the lesser case makers that don't necessarily have Apple's trust
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:10:03.920]  bribe the employees at the factory to get the schematics. The rumors used to be so much worse
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.200]  too. They were so bad in the old days. I wish this would be a good like, you know,
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.160]  secret history book, secret history of people who, I guess they couldn't do it as a profession,
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:20.160]  but as a pretty extensive hobby would just submit fake stuff to Apple Rumorsight, right?
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:25.200]  Right. They just make up something, they make up code names. The more ambitious ones would do like
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.560]  3D renders or make up grainy photos. Like the 3D renders were not intended to be real. Like,
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:34.800]  here's an artist rendition of what this thing actually looks like. They would just make up
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:40.240]  stuff from whole cloth and the sites would post it and we would read it. It was a fun pastime,
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:45.440]  but that seems to have fallen by the wayside. Now we mostly get real rumors from supposed
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.960]  reputable publications like Bloomberg or whatever. Right. Reading the rumor sites like in the late
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:55.920]  90s, maybe early or very early 2000s was a lot like reading a supermarket tabloid.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:00.640]  Yeah. I did it and I was interested, but I pretty much went through like
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:03.920]  a whole week of posts and be like, that's bullshit, bullshit. Nope.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:07.360]  But like people who read tabloids, you'd also kind of get excited sometimes like,
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:14.640]  but what if this one is real? Like it was like the more ridiculous they were, the more you'd like
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:20.640]  hold that because the good ones would incorporate like all the little kernels of truth that are out
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:26.240]  there, mix them all together and then, you know, put a unicorn on it. Right. And so it was like
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:32.320]  all our hopes and dreams with just enough plausibility to make us consider it at all.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:40.240]  I know you're eyeballing a Mac Pro later in the year, probably. What are your current thoughts
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:47.520]  on the display? It seems to me like with this news a week or two ago that LG's whatever it's called
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:56.080]  display is not in fact dead. It was only getting like a minor refresh suggests to me like my take
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.520]  on it is that this makes this makes me feel less certain about Apple coming out with a lower priced
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:10.080]  pro display. I mostly agree with that. I mean, like so like Apple doesn't control what LG does.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.560]  If LG wants to make a 5G display, that's fine. It really all depends on exactly how much Apple
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:19.360]  starts pushing it in its venues. How much does it push it in its stores, in its advertising,
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:24.400]  on its website? That I think is a stronger sign of whether Apple is going to make a reasonably
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:30.640]  priced display than the fact that LG is continuing to make the display. But all that said,
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.160]  speaking of stress dreams, I continue to have stress dreams about the monitor,
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:41.440]  both waking and sleeping like, you know, I don't it's I don't need that display. But if I had that
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.600]  display, I think I'd really enjoy it. But it's really expensive. I just go back and forth and
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.080]  back and forth. And then I think like, could I buy this computer, but then put something,
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:54.080]  put a non Apple display on it? Like that's the whole reason I was flipping out when Apple stopped
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.520]  making displays is that I couldn't stomach that idea. And it's it there's an industrial design
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.320]  mismatch there. And even if you're going to put your Mac Pro under your desk, and so it's not
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:10.960]  right next to this display, it you know, it's not a bad looking display. It's very plain. It's kind
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:17.920]  of bad. The bigger forehead like it's not even a symmetrical. Yeah, it's not symmetric. It's a nice
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.560]  panel. But I just couldn't help but think that when they announced the price of the pro display
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:31.760]  XDR, and literally caused gasps in the room. I just my my thought immediately went to Well,
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:37.520]  why? Why not just Apple Pro display? Why say XDR? Unless they were going to make a pro display
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:43.600]  that's not XDR. And the XDR stuff is the stuff that, you know, non film editors don't really
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:49.440]  need. You don't really need 1000 nits, right? You probably burn your eyes out. If you're just
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.800]  coding or something like that. You don't need the super high dynamic range. You just need
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:14:01.280]  regular dynamic range. High dynamic range. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know purchase wise,
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.600]  I don't know what I'm going to do. It is a no brainer to me that Apple absolutely should make
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:11.280]  an iMac without the iMac. Right. But I don't I don't I don't understand what the whole like is
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:15.920]  just another instance where like they they do all the mismatch round table and get the pro
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:19.600]  workflow group and talk to all these people like no one during that entire sequence said,
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:24.640]  What about are you gonna have like a regular monitor? What about a display in the you know,
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:30.320]  1500 dollar range again, I like spending so long in corporate America, I continue to be,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:35.600]  you know, sure, like it'd be about anything like that within Apple, they are able able to convince
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:41.440]  themselves of things that seem preposterous to us on the outside, like they no matter how much
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:46.160]  outreaching you do an hour, how many roundtables you have, no matter how much, you know, sort of
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:52.320]  talking with your customers, that somehow internally, they're able to decide that this is
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.520]  not a product that we need, or we don't need it this year, or we don't need to say anything about
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:01.360]  it. And it's just such an obvious gap. Our only standalone Apple display is $6,000. Yeah, it's
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.600]  like, it's like, and you and you really want the $7,000 one. Yeah. Yeah. And here's the thing,
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.720]  like, this is sort of the communication gap is like back back up that round table thing that
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.400]  you went to where they were, they were like, we're, we're gonna make a Mac Pro, we screwed
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.400]  up, but here's what we're gonna do. We're recommending to the Mac. They so triumphantly
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.120]  said, and also, we're gonna make a display. Yeah, right. And there was much rejoicing,
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.720]  and everyone was happy. And I feel like there was a disconnect is not about the happiness,
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.720]  because Apple's like, we think we think people want to display too, we should say that we should
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:35.600]  do that. And you and they said it, and everybody liked it. And everyone's happy Apple smiling,
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:39.440]  because we're smiling. They said they're going to do a thing. We say we love the thing. Like,
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:44.960]  we're all one big happy family. But but we're not happy about the same thing. Because Apple's like,
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:50.800]  let's make that $7,000 display now. And we're all expecting, like, you can make a $7,000 display.
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:54.320]  That's awesome. Like, I think that's a great thing for you to make. But you can have a regular one,
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.920]  too, right? Like, and now they come out like, here's the thing. And then we're all grumpy,
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.960]  like, but we were all happy. What were you all happy about the display? It's like, yes,
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:07.600]  but we weren't thinking of the same thing. Like, we need to, there needs to be closer communications.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.920]  Just just, you know, when you say you're going to make a display, that's the problem with all
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.960]  those secrets. When you say you're making a display, you're not going to make a $7,000
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:18.480]  reference monitor competitor. Are you like it wouldn't even occur to us to ask that and they're
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:22.080]  not going to tell you what they're going to make either. They just want to roll it out and just be
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:28.720]  all smiles and wait for the plaudits to roll in. It's like, no, no, you blew it. Like, you can
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:33.680]  have that. And again, I think if they had that display and also an iMac without the iMac,
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:40.080]  the story would be as positive as Apple wanted it to be. So we would be like, I'm going to get this
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.320]  also new Mac Pro with this monitor. And imagine if I had that even cooler monitor. It would be
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.680]  all we, everybody would love it. Right. But because they didn't, and because we all didn't find out
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:54.560]  about this miscommunication until it's, you know, whatever the Henry thing likely until we opened
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:02.160]  the gifts are like, yeah, no. So I really, I really hope they fix this eventually. There's
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:08.480]  there's the, you know, people who don't like Apple products, nerds who don't like Apple products,
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:13.600]  will you know, the long standing decades, you know, as far back as I can remember, even before
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:21.440]  there was internet, the rap that we get is that we're brainwashed, right? We're, we're, what else
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:29.840]  cultists, they, you know, the cult of Mac or whatever. I have to like the number of people who
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:38.720]  are saying, just let us use an iMac as a standalone display. And I'll just, I'll just ignore the very
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:44.080]  nice computer that's inside is sort of right up that, you know, I have to admit that cause it's
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:48.400]  crazy, but people really are, you know, I can't tell you whenever I tweet about this and stuff
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:53.680]  like that, how many people say, I just wish that I could plug my Mac book pro into an iMac and that
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.080]  would be fine with me. Part of that is bargaining because they're like, okay, you won't do the thing
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:01.600]  that I want, but how about this thing that you sort of did once bring that back, right? But then
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.320]  part of it is also the actual convenience angle of like, look, I literally do have an iMac that I
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.040]  use, but sometimes I sit down in front of it with my laptop. It would be cool to have a quick little
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.480]  docking thing, right? So there's, there's two halves of that. Right. But it makes no sense
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:23.040]  because clearly they should be able to make a 5k display for less than an iMac. Just sell it for
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.240]  the same price as the iMac. Like that's just, just like it's all profit. Like just do not reduce the
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.120]  price. Make it cost more than the base iMac. Like people would buy that. That's how desperate. And
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:37.600]  that's, that's where I think the disconnect is that Apple thought that we were all happy. Like
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.960]  we were sad when they didn't make monitors and we're happy when they said they would. And Apple's
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:46.880]  like, they want us to make a monitor because only Apple can make this amazing breakthrough monitor.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:52.560]  And the real answer I feel like is we want Apple to make a monitor so it matches our computer and
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:57.200]  it's really nice. Like, like at the base level, we also think it's cool if they can make an awesome
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.520]  monitor, right? But at the base level, in the same way, the same reason we want them to make
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:08.080]  Wi-Fi routers and USB hubs is that it's hard to find nice high quality stuff that you know works
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:12.320]  with your system. That's part of the beauty of buying Apple stuff is like, I know it will be
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:17.600]  nice. It will look nice. It will be high quality. I know it will work with the Mac because it's made
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:22.320]  by the same company. It'll turn on with a button, you know, when I want it to turn on.
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:27.440]  It'll have nice integrations that don't like, and yeah, it'll be more expensive. And that is the
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:32.720]  bargain we have struck, but Apple, I guess, interpreted the demand for and happiness with
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.120]  the announcement of a monitor to be, they want us to make a breakthrough. And I don't want to say we
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:41.280]  didn't want, we do want them to make breakthroughs, but you also just have to make a decent monitor.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:48.720]  And the other weird thing about it is, is in the, in the post switch to Intel world, we,
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:57.040]  we as Mac users gained access to a lot of peripherals and, and things, you know, because
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:05.200]  of the Mac is, is effectively just a very specific Intel PC. You know, we, we, we can literally boot
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:14.480]  windows if we, if we choose to. But the display world has bifurcated in such a weird way. Like
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:20.320]  we don't have, there just are no options for a nice iMac caliber 5k display out there. And most
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:26.320]  PC users who are like, especially gamers don't want retina displays. They want bigger pixels
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:32.480]  because they want to drive them at a high frame rate. And so it's just very, very strange. Like,
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:37.840]  we don't have an option to go. There's one, one 5k display we can choose. It's from LG.
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.160]  It's kind of like, yeah, and it's ugly. Yeah. And it's kind of not wanted. Yeah. And the thing is,
[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:47.760]  like, I understand where they're coming from and I still hold a lot of hope that like the,
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:52.160]  the strategy is announced the Mac Pro and the top end display. And it's one big
[02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:57.440]  cohesive story for super duper pros and then, then backfill later. But with Apple secrecy being the
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:01.760]  way it is, and in the current sort of in-between stage, we are where you can't actually order a Mac
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:07.680]  Pro yet. You know, and with the LG thing coming out, they've reintroduced uncertainty where I
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:15.200]  feel like they, they didn't have to. And maybe, or maybe like they, like, I don't know what kind
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:18.240]  of financial sense any of this makes because they're going to sell so few Mac Pros and they're
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:22.160]  going to sell so few of these displays and they would sell so few of the display that we were
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:26.640]  speculating about. But like, as the argument for the Mac Pro has never been, this is an awesome
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.240]  business for Apple to be in. It's the argument that my argument has always been, it's a business
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.720]  that Apple has to be in, even if it's not particularly profitable because to not be in it
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:44.640]  is to sort of you know, consign yourself to a narrow band of the market where you miss out on
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:50.480]  all sorts of benefits. So anyway, that is my hope. My hope is that they call this one the XDR
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:54.960]  because there's also a Pro display. I don't know if it would be 6K, I would be happy with 5K,
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:22:01.120]  like the iMac panel, but a nice Apple branded Pro display with all sorts of nice features. And it
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:06.560]  just, it, I can't help but think that it's possible that they were like, well, let's hold something
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:12.000]  back so that when we announce this for sale in October, that we'll have some, we'll have
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:17.360]  something new to announce in addition to what we already pre announced at WWDC.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:22.080]  That's a terrible strategy though, because they've like, once they saw what the reaction
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:26.960]  was, they should have said, Oh, we wanted to surprise you later. And instead, we are signing
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:31.360]  you up for multiple months of being disappointed. And that's really when this multiple wants a
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.560]  disappointment. If they had something to stop the disappointment, I think we would already know
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:41.520]  about it. So I hope, I hope they're scrambling to produce something like this. But given that
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.080]  given their timelines, I don't expect it anytime soon.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:46.320]  A thousand dollar arm.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:53.520]  I'm not even getting into the stand. Just, just talking about the monitor itself.
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:58.640]  John, it was good to have you back on the show. Let's not make it a year and a half again. I'll
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:03.520]  invite you. You don't have to invite yourself. I'll invite you back. At the very least, we have
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:07.920]  a Star Wars movie coming up this year, right? We could do, we could do a Star Wars Spectacular.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:12.160]  Sure. Yeah, no, those don't, those don't count, actually. So actually, yeah, you gotta have me
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:17.840]  on for the tech topics. But Star Wars, I'm always game for, for sure. Yeah, it's always good talking
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:24.880]  to you. I enjoy your show. One of my favorites. My thanks to our sponsors this week. We had
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:30.160]  Squarespace where you can go to build websites, ero, where you can set up a mesh network,
[02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:35.600]  Wi Fi in your house, and away travel where you can get yourself an excellent suitcase.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:39.920]  Er, my thanks to you for being here, John. It was great.
