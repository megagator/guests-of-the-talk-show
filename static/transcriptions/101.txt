[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  Yes, but can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Yeah, and I can hear a spell
[00:04.200 --> 00:13.200]  It's very strange. I don't know. I don't know. I seriously I spent 15 minutes and made like probably 12 recordings to make sure that everything was
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.080]  I
[00:14.080 --> 00:17.000]  I'm telling you, and I really I include
[00:17.520 --> 00:23.080]  Most I have the time we include this stuff in the show like me having problems with Skype
[00:23.080 --> 00:27.920]  I am like like Mr. McGu with Skype
[00:27.920 --> 00:29.920]  Like nothing can possibly
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.920]  I never want to have a podcast where it actually just plain works. It's always
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.920]  Well, the horrible thing is that I
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.320]  Work on audio recording actually this is what I do every day
[00:43.800 --> 00:50.040]  Every day and somehow I just it just screws up every time that I actually I mean when I test things
[00:50.040 --> 00:53.120]  It's fine. It's always fine and I said, you know sometimes I run kind of long test
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.400]  I'm like all right. All right things are going well, and then now actually using them
[00:56.400 --> 01:00.400]  It's me always breaks. It's it has to be Skype's fault. They can't be any of our
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.800]  Perfect perfectly usable software. Oh, of course. Which always functions
[01:06.520 --> 01:10.240]  At 100% so you anyway, Krista Morgan you sound great
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.240]  Oh, great. Thanks. You do as well. Thank you. I have so much to talk about
[01:15.240 --> 01:20.240]  I am so excited because the watch stuff came out and yes, are you excited about the watch? I
[01:20.240 --> 01:27.360]  I'm excited about the watch and also I don't know this this happens sort of with I feel like every time
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.680]  There's either a big update to an Apple product or a brand new Apple product most like well
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.760]  Do I really need that and then of course? I know the day that it comes out. I'm gonna be like, oh god
[01:37.760 --> 01:39.760]  Give this give me this thing
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.760]  So I'm excited about it, but also a little like I don't know I'm excited because I think it's kind of cool
[01:45.760 --> 01:47.760]  But I also think that it is
[01:47.760 --> 01:50.920]  It's this weird mix of
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.440]  Apple being way ahead of where they've ever been with a new product before
[01:57.240 --> 02:00.560]  Combined with that there's still a lot of mystery around it
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.840]  There is yeah, there's quite a bit of mystery as to what I mean even even with
[02:06.560 --> 02:13.080]  The watch kit out now. I feel like there's still a mystery about what you'll you'll actually be able to do in this
[02:13.080 --> 02:18.960]  Sort of first round before we can build truly native apps on though on the watch at least for me
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.080]  Yeah, I mean I I the day that it came out
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.560]  I think I think it was the very day. Maybe it was no
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.440]  I think it was the same day
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.880]  I was out in San Francisco because I was at the event and they announced the thing and that and I was down in Cupertino
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.280]  Or not yeah for the event and then I came back to San Francisco and I like put my nose together and
[02:41.280 --> 02:43.200]  You know Mike a lot, right?
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.560]  The rans and repose and he is in San Francisco now
[02:47.560 --> 02:53.840]  He works there. He's at Pinterest and we met and we had a drink and and the first thing that he said to me was that this is
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.720]  Weird because it feels like this is like year three of the watch because there's like two different sizes
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.720]  There's all these different bands like it feels like a third
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.240]  Generation Apple product like okay now we're gonna give you two sizes and we're gonna give you choices of the styles
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.040]  Whereas the tradition right the traditional way of doing an Apple product is here's the one
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.480]  Here's here's the first one and there's one way right and it's very limited and you're good
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.560]  It's everybody's gonna have the exact same size and the exact same band and you're gonna like it and that's it
[03:26.560 --> 03:35.440]  Right right and it just feels like they've skipped like a year or two and it seems the same way with the SDK like I know that
[03:35.440 --> 03:41.840]  It's not truly native apps yet that we're we're just projecting apps from extensions from the iPhone
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.760]  But that we don't but it's so huge compared to like the iPhone SDK right we
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  Or you know like when that that took like a year or something right and like it was just it was just web apps at first
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.600]  Right we don't even have the watch yet and yet we can start thinking about the apps for it
[03:55.600 --> 03:59.440]  Yes, it seems that's incredible that is yeah, I know I think yeah
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.080]  That's a it's really that really puts it in perspective actually because I was kind of like oh well
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.040]  I don't know because it's just an extension and but no that really puts it in perspective because yeah
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.800]  Especially when you especially when you compare it with the iPhone launch and
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.960]  I remember never and you know before the SDK was ever even announced and before they announced anything about third-party apps
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.840]  He was like oh, I'm gonna make a web app for it because I bet that's what they'll
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.080]  I bet that's what they'll say at first and then it was and people are just so mad
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.160]  That it wasn't an SDK for a long time. I think what made people mad was at
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.080]  WWDC 2007 and I wrote about this at the time and I
[04:35.200 --> 04:42.080]  But I think what made people mad wasn't that they're that they didn't say look we're we're just not ready for it yet and
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.040]  You know in the future you can write apps, but you can't do it yet
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.960]  We're not ready because everybody would have said we're a little disappointed
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.880]  But we understand but what they did was at WWDC
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.720]  It was Scott for stall and they were like we have a really that and this was the quote-unquote the words
[04:56.720 --> 05:01.600]  sweet solution for all of you who want to write apps for this phone and
[05:02.240 --> 05:08.560]  Everybody got so excited everybody was ready to stand up everybody was ready to like storm the stage and then they were like you can write web apps
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.560]  and it was like
[05:13.120 --> 05:18.240]  Yeah, and I called it on during fireball. I called it a shit sandwich. Yeah
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.240]  You know, I don't think I've ever told this right. This is funny
[05:21.240 --> 05:27.640]  Um, so it that was like I guess Monday because it was the first day of WWDC
[05:28.040 --> 05:34.760]  2007 and I called it that that a shit sandwich and everybody was disappointed it was because they set us up by calling it a sweet solution
[05:35.480 --> 05:42.840]  Um, and it's still it was only like five years since I'd been writing during fireball and I'd had it was like when I
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.320]  I'd started getting press credentials for the keynotes and stuff like that, but I was a
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.440]  a lot less
[05:50.440 --> 05:54.600]  popular than then it during fireballs gotten to this point and
[05:56.360 --> 06:04.240]  Like a day later. It was like Tuesday at WWDC and I was writing the escalator and right behind me was Phil Schiller
[06:04.240 --> 06:08.160]  And I'd never spoken to him it face to face in my life at that point
[06:08.160 --> 06:13.440]  And I was like holy shit Phil Schiller and I was like, oh, sorry turn around. I was like
[06:14.080 --> 06:18.440]  And I was you know, it was that that weird nerd way where it's like at first
[06:18.440 --> 06:22.400]  You think I should introduce myself and anything. Oh my god. No. I know I should just turn around
[06:23.240 --> 06:24.800]  Be silent and I was like no
[06:24.800 --> 06:31.160]  I should totally the professional thing to do would be to introduce myself because I know he knew my name because I know he'd sent me email and stuff
[06:31.160 --> 06:37.640]  And I was like, hey, I'm John Gruber and he was like, oh nice to meet you and then it the first thing he said to me
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.200]  He goes nice to meet you and he goes I got to tell you I don't think that's a shit sandwich
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.080]  Nice and I oh man. That's awesome. I was so totally blown away because I was like
[06:47.080 --> 06:55.000]  No fucking way. He read my shit on the day that I wrote it yet on the right exactly Phil Schiller stays up late and reads your blog
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.320]  And then we got in like kind of an argument about like a very very friendly cordial argument about whether or not
[07:01.840 --> 07:08.040]  Writing web apps for the iPhone was just shit sandwich. Right. Right. Oh, that's really cool. That's a fun story
[07:08.280 --> 07:14.920]  But anyway, we don't have to write shit sandwiches for the for the Apple watch right no. Yeah, it's actually pretty
[07:14.920 --> 07:22.040]  Pretty awesome. And so and so soon too. I mean, I remember with when I was watching the the Apple watch keynote
[07:22.040 --> 07:26.920]  I was like wait in November that seems I mean, yeah, just in comparison. I mean, it just seems
[07:28.120 --> 07:31.960]  Really fast and it's like they were they were just really thinking about this from
[07:32.600 --> 07:38.440]  From the beginning about how how they were gonna get third-party developers like involved like right away, which is really cool
[07:38.440 --> 07:44.760]  Really nice to see. Yeah, I really think that it shows that it's like you know
[07:44.760 --> 07:48.840]  Because I know they said when they unveiled it in September that they've been working on them for three years
[07:48.840 --> 07:50.840]  But it makes me think that they've been
[07:51.320 --> 07:56.920]  Thinking about stuff like third-party apps for three years, too. Oh, yeah, definitely
[07:57.720 --> 07:58.760]  Yeah
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.760]  Well, I'm guessing yeah, well the iOS
[08:01.400 --> 08:06.040]  App store was just I mean, it's just sort of changed, you know everything and influenced them a lot
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.560]  When building this from the ground up because with the iPhone, you know, they probably they were just working so hard to get that
[08:12.280 --> 08:18.360]  First initial product off the ground like they they you know, they had ideas probably for third-party developer stuff
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.360]  But not at the outset
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.840]  Anyway, not for not for a while and so yeah, it's pretty cool that they could
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.560]  Envision that you know from from the beginning with this and then it makes me wonder like well
[08:29.720 --> 08:31.720]  What's going on with the Apple TV?
[08:31.720 --> 08:42.440]  It's funny it is funny though because it's you know what it's funny though because it's
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.200]  Those are the two things that everybody thinks are next well
[08:46.200 --> 08:48.680]  I mean, obviously the watch is definitely next they've announced it
[08:48.680 --> 08:51.640]  But you know all year long people have been thinking you know
[08:51.640 --> 08:53.640]  There's been rumors that they're gonna do a watch
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.760]  um
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.760]  but it's funny because
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.720]  TV and the watch are sort of
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.760]  The extremes of computing in terms of being like
[09:05.960 --> 09:12.280]  And Apple keeps using this word intimate that the watch is the most intimate thing. They've ever made intimate intimate intimate
[09:12.280 --> 09:19.000]  They keep using it, but it's true. It I don't think that it's I don't think that it's like marketing hype
[09:19.320 --> 09:25.240]  I think I mean and whether the watch is gonna be but that's to be personal. Yeah, because it's so close to you
[09:25.240 --> 09:30.040]  It's on your skin all the time, you know, and I
[09:31.080 --> 09:34.920]  And the TV is the opposite it is the least
[09:35.480 --> 09:41.800]  Intimate computing destination that they could possibly make because you sit far away from it, you know, you're
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.600]  You know you instead of measuring it in inches you're passively watch things
[09:46.840 --> 09:51.880]  Yeah, right and famously you're you know, it's a passive device that you kind of you watch
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.880]  So when you tune out, you know, you're mind, you know kind of blanks when you're watching TV
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.520]  And so it's kind of funny that those are the two things interesting
[10:01.480 --> 10:09.480]  I don't know and I wonder though if there's like a design connection between them though because it does seem though that overall their design
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.280]  aesthetic is sort of zeroing in on a
[10:13.080 --> 10:15.080]  sort of style
[10:15.880 --> 10:17.160]  Yeah, that's a good point
[10:17.160 --> 10:23.320]  And I wonder how that could be that something is as different as a watch in the TV if they could share a certain
[10:24.440 --> 10:29.720]  Aesthetic. I don't know. Oh sure. Well. Yeah, I would love. I mean, so the the Apple TV finally got
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.600]  A bit of a UI refresh, but it's not I mean, it's just sort of like a a new code of paint
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.360]  It's not for me. I mean, it's just not a big it's not a huge update
[10:38.360 --> 10:43.160]  It just sort of like got rid of the glossiness and it's and it's more in line with them like iOS
[10:43.160 --> 10:46.680]  7 and 8 and with in with Yosemite, but um
[10:47.480 --> 10:49.480]  Yeah, it'd be really cool
[10:49.480 --> 10:52.280]  If it if it borrowed from the the watches aesthetic
[10:52.280 --> 10:54.280]  I really I mean so far from screenshots
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.400]  And from the videos I've seen of the watch it. It looks beautiful
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.560]  I don't know, and even just things like controlling
[11:02.360 --> 11:06.840]  Apple TV with with the with the watch app because the iOS app the controls Apple TV is terrible
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.320]  I mean, that's one one little bridge, but like yeah, if the UI of
[11:11.320 --> 11:16.840]  Of the TV could somehow be influenced by the watch that would be great, but I also just see I don't know
[11:16.840 --> 11:23.560]  iOS apps on on the TV would be amazing. I'm just games and all kinds of that do you so you have an Apple TV
[11:23.800 --> 11:31.880]  I do yeah, I every time I mention being frustrated by the remote the physical remote that comes in
[11:32.440 --> 11:35.320]  And I hate that it's infrared because it's like
[11:35.320 --> 11:42.280]  Yes, like our Tivo I think we're like two generations in with a Bluetooth Tivo remote
[11:42.280 --> 11:48.360]  So you don't have to point the remote at anything and you get used to that you get used to not having to point it
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.880]  And the stupid Apple TV remote and and and I always think like I'll bet it's the battery
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.760]  I'll bet the battery is weak and that's why I can't do it and I'll buy a new
[11:57.560 --> 12:03.640]  Stupid little you know, whatever that battery is I'll buy a new one put it in and it's exactly the same
[12:03.640 --> 12:09.720]  And it's not the battery. It just sucks. Oh, it's just finicky. Yeah, that thing is just so and it's I mean
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.840]  It's only like slightly better than the the horrible plastic one that that used to
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.480]  Come with the Apple TV end with and with MacBooks like years ago. Oh the white one right right
[12:19.480 --> 12:23.160]  And it's just yeah, remember yeah, um, but yeah, just it's no good
[12:23.160 --> 12:25.160]  And we have a Roku 3 as well and
[12:25.720 --> 12:28.120]  Um, you know, it's about the same price
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.520]  I think it's the Apple TV and it just like the the interfaces is ugly but it just does so much more and it just makes me kind of sad
[12:34.520 --> 12:39.560]  Because the controller is also like a game controller and you can plug headphones into it
[12:39.560 --> 12:41.880]  And it's it's not you know sleek and sophisticated
[12:41.880 --> 12:44.600]  It's sort of chunky and sort of like a friendly design
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.520]  But it's so much better like as an actual remote control. It's um, I don't know kind of makes me sad
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.400]  Every time I bring this up especially on the show
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.120]  And I know there's people who who are listening right now and they're already firing up their email
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.320]  They're already writing the email to me telling me this and I'm telling you right now
[13:01.320 --> 13:07.160]  Stop don't send me the email. They're gonna say oh, but use the app for the iPhone the iPhone
[13:07.160 --> 13:14.360]  Oh the app is terrible the app is worse the app is worse for everything except typing passwords
[13:14.760 --> 13:16.200]  Right, oh yeah exactly well
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.400]  That's you know assuming that the the app will connect with the Apple TV which sometimes mine still doesn't it'll just be like
[13:21.400 --> 13:26.360]  Can't find Apple TV and so it's like okay by the time built the app launches and connects to
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.760]  Apple TV I could have used a terrible little remote to to do whatever it was I needed to do
[13:31.480 --> 13:34.840]  Um, yeah, it's just not I don't know. It's just a stinker
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.640]  It's to me no to me though. It's it's
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.960]  It's them to me the the single biggest deal with Apple TV is the remote honestly
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.360]  I don't care if they don't I would love it if they added apps. I'd love it if they had an SDK
[13:50.360 --> 13:57.240]  Um, I don't but if they came out with the exact same looking and and logical interface
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.080]  But just had like a bluetooth remote that just always worked like every time it just works
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.800]  Yeah, every time I hit up it goes up and every time I hit down it goes down instead of having to
[14:08.760 --> 14:12.120]  Point the damn thing. I would be so much happier with it
[14:13.240 --> 14:15.240]  Yeah, and the stupid app
[14:15.240 --> 14:22.840]  Really definitely so anyway, I do think I think that the watch could be that could be a huge deal like a watch thing
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.200]  That knows like I and I think this is possible that it could know like
[14:28.840 --> 14:32.600]  Um, not just that you're in the same house like on the same Wi-Fi network
[14:32.600 --> 14:35.400]  But if you're close enough that you could be watching Apple TV
[14:36.120 --> 14:43.400]  You know, so that it would know and if there's something playing then the watch could like have the playback controls automatically
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.920]  That would be so that would be so great. Oh, that would be sucked. Yeah. It would be a game changer
[14:49.480 --> 14:51.960]  I know that that's a cliche. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it would just be
[14:53.320 --> 14:56.200]  Oh, it would and it's um, I mean, it's not far fetched at all
[14:56.200 --> 14:58.840]  I mean, it seems like that would be a pretty straightforward
[14:59.400 --> 15:04.760]  App for them to make even I mean for Apple to release natively on the on the watch would be great
[15:05.320 --> 15:10.680]  So here's hoping well, I I think Tim quote said that it I don't know if it was on the Charlie Rose interview
[15:10.680 --> 15:16.680]  But one of the interviews he said like you know after they announced the watch and now that he's out and about wearing the watch
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.000]  He's even said that one of the things he does with it is control his Apple TV
[15:22.280 --> 15:25.800]  Oh, yes. Oh, I didn't yeah, I missed him. So it's definitely
[15:26.280 --> 15:29.560]  I mean whether they're going to ship that in the initial version or not
[15:29.960 --> 15:33.080]  But you know, they're obviously have it working. You know like as a beta
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.280]  It's already working. Oh, good, and I can't help but think that it's the potential is there
[15:38.280 --> 15:44.360]  For it to be totally it might require a brand new Apple TV, but if it's still only 99 bucks
[15:44.360 --> 15:49.640]  It's only 99 bucks. So so what buy a new Apple TV, right? Yeah, yeah, but if it could be like
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.600]  You know, I know that you're on your stupid couch watching your stupid TV
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.800]  So here here's the playback controls for Apple TV pause
[15:58.200 --> 16:02.600]  And then you can just tap your wrist to pause it and get up and you know refresh your beverage or river
[16:03.480 --> 16:05.800]  It would be so great. Yeah, oh, it would yeah
[16:05.800 --> 16:09.880]  Do you guys make popcorn? Do you gonna make popcorn at home? Oh, yeah, I'd love popcorn
[16:10.120 --> 16:15.800]  Nevin does not like it because the kernel stuff stick in his teeth, but I'm I'm a big popcorn fan
[16:16.360 --> 16:19.160]  Is you know, he has he's a very particular man
[16:21.480 --> 16:27.480]  Can I tell you that I'm 41 years old and I have only like three months ago my my mother-in-law
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.960]  Amy's mom actually gave us this tip and it is like the greatest tip ever
[16:31.960 --> 16:37.000]  It made me think of it because we're the idea of being lazy and just watching movies on on the couch
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.600]  Do you know this to use coconut oil when you cook your popcorn?
[16:43.160 --> 16:48.920]  Oh, no. Oh my god. It is the secret to like what like movie theater popcorn tastes like
[16:50.360 --> 16:53.880]  Oh interesting. So it is it's that would make sense
[16:53.880 --> 16:59.480]  Yeah, because I know that movie theater popcorn is usually vegan. So it's maybe that's what they know it's oh you don't need anything
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.840]  And you don't need anything else all you need is plain popcorn like just
[17:03.640 --> 17:05.640]  Whatever, you know, you don't have to buy any special popcorn
[17:06.200 --> 17:13.560]  you buy coconut oil and just salt and you put and coconut oil is weird and and you buy it and
[17:14.120 --> 17:16.760]  Anybody listening who follows this tip. I'm telling you. It's genius
[17:18.120 --> 17:24.760]  Nobody told me that's what she said. She said just by coconut oil and I went to the supermarket and I look and coconut oil is
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.920]  It has a melting point of 76 degrees
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.560]  So it's gonna be solid. Yeah, so it's very it's like congeal. Yeah, it's congealed
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.160]  It's more like it's more like butter like it's something you don't pour it. You scoop it. It's like a it's like a
[17:39.560 --> 17:43.800]  Yeah, congealed is the perfect word. That's normal. It's exactly right
[17:44.360 --> 17:51.640]  You put like two teaspoons of it in your pan and then you put the popcorn in and it it makes popcorn amazing
[17:51.640 --> 17:58.680]  It's it's exactly it is the secret to movie theater like a good movie theater popcorn
[17:59.480 --> 18:02.440]  I want some popcorn. I have no idea where that aside came from
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.640]  But it's good. It's cooking with John Gruber. Yeah, exactly
[18:05.640 --> 18:08.680]  That's like there's like three things. I know how to cook and one of them is popcorn
[18:09.240 --> 18:11.560]  And everything I know how to cook is equally simple
[18:12.360 --> 18:15.000]  I know how to make coffee. I know how to cook popcorn
[18:15.000 --> 18:22.200]  And it's just you know, that's important in the same way that coffee is just ground up coffee beans and then you pour hot water on top of it
[18:22.920 --> 18:24.440]  popcorn is
[18:24.440 --> 18:30.600]  Put coconut oil in a pan and heat it at medium and then pour popcorn and salt
[18:31.480 --> 18:33.480]  So that's the extent of my
[18:35.320 --> 18:38.120]  Cooking I'm not very talented in the kitchen
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.160]  Now we just have to find a way to remove all of the little kernel bits. So
[18:43.160 --> 18:51.080]  You know, I did see something I saw something at Whole Foods where they're I didn't I didn't buy it because it's it's like everything at Whole Foods where it's like
[18:51.400 --> 18:54.440]  It's so expensive. I was like, I don't know about this. There's like a
[18:55.720 --> 18:57.320]  I forget the name. I don't know the name of it
[18:57.320 --> 19:00.040]  But and if you look at where they sell the unpopped popcorn
[19:00.600 --> 19:05.960]  They they had a they had a special popcorn and it would they were they were indeed very tiny kernels
[19:05.960 --> 19:12.760]  And it's called like something something little popcorn and it advertises as doesn't get stuck in your teeth
[19:13.640 --> 19:19.800]  That's that's something a something about this special brand of popcorn which is slightly more it's not like super expensive
[19:19.800 --> 19:21.880]  But it's slightly more expensive than regular popcorn
[19:22.440 --> 19:27.720]  That when it pops there is no nothing is left of the shell the entire shell
[19:27.720 --> 19:29.720]  I don't know. Oh, yeah, okay
[19:29.720 --> 19:32.440]  I have to try it so you may have to get that for never yeah
[19:32.440 --> 19:36.280]  I think I well because I really think you would enjoy popcorn. We're it not for that
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.280]  See I would have thought that he was in the popcorn, but that it was that he he put like
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.080]  Crazy flavorings on the popcorn. Oh sure
[19:43.080 --> 19:47.640]  No, I'm sure that he would really get into that like making you know like masala popcorn or something
[19:47.720 --> 19:52.040]  You know really interesting, but um, he's just yeah, you just can't abide the
[19:54.040 --> 20:01.080]  Little kernel sticking his teeth too much. Yeah, I can kind of hear that I do it is sort of the downside to pop everything has a downside though
[20:01.080 --> 20:04.520]  Yeah, yeah, oh, it doesn't bother me. It doesn't stop me
[20:04.840 --> 20:11.960]  Um, all right, let's take a break and I will thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at hover
[20:12.360 --> 20:14.360]  You've ever heard of hover
[20:14.360 --> 20:17.640]  Hover I have heard of hover hover hover hover
[20:18.600 --> 20:27.320]  Is the best I say this with no qualifications the best domain name registrar on the internet and they've been around forever
[20:27.320 --> 20:29.320]  They've been around you know, I don't know 20 years
[20:29.320 --> 20:31.320]  Um
[20:31.400 --> 20:38.120]  They're the best and it's a such a scammy business registering domains everybody else is it's all
[20:39.880 --> 20:44.520]  Crazy ads when you go to get domain name and then after you registered the domain
[20:44.520 --> 20:51.720]  There's all these upsells on things like getting privacy for your personal information on the domain and
[20:52.520 --> 20:54.520]  paying extra to
[20:54.520 --> 21:02.360]  Secure the domain and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera hover gets rid of all that nonsense you pay one price and it's great
[21:02.360 --> 21:04.360]  It's not the lowest price. That's for sure
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.720]  Um
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.000]  It's the fairest price though and the prices are low. They're totally totally competitive
[21:11.000 --> 21:17.080]  They're very very reasonable and that's it. There's no upsell and everything is secure and you get great
[21:17.640 --> 21:19.640]  24-hour tech support
[21:19.640 --> 21:26.600]  And they have this amazing thing I say it every time I do the sponsor read for hover, but it is truly amazing
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Which is valet
[21:29.160 --> 21:34.680]  Domain transfer so you sign up for hover you open your account and now you're a paying hover customer
[21:35.160 --> 21:37.640]  You can go to them and say look
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.920]  I've got all these other domains that I've registered in the last 15 years and some of them are over here
[21:43.080 --> 21:45.640]  And some of them are over there. I want them all in my hover account
[21:45.640 --> 21:54.360]  You just give them your information at your other domain registrars and they go and move everything over and they switch the DNS
[21:55.080 --> 21:59.240]  Everything just happens automatically and they're they're like experts on this
[21:59.240 --> 22:05.400]  They do this the people who do the domain transfers. That's all they do is they're like DNS experts
[22:05.400 --> 22:09.000]  So they're not going to screw it up. They're going to do everything right and next thing
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.720]  You know all of your domains are in your hover account and they're all transferred and all the DNS is updated and
[22:16.840 --> 22:20.600]  No services interrupted. It's an amazing thing. It sounds too good to be true
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.920]  It sounds like something well you'd have to pay
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.320]  X amount of dollars per domain to do it. No you sign up for hover
[22:27.320 --> 22:31.960]  You have a hover account if you have a hundred domains at some other shitty domain registrar
[22:32.280 --> 22:38.120]  Just give them your information and they'll move all hundred of them over to your hundred of over to your hover account free of charge
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.600]  It's just part of being a hover customer
[22:41.560 --> 22:43.560]  Super super great
[22:43.880 --> 22:49.000]  So if you want to register a domain name or if you have domain names already
[22:49.160 --> 22:53.480]  But it's at some shitty registrar and you want to move them to someplace. That's awesome
[22:53.720 --> 22:57.720]  Moving to hover go to hover.com slash the talk show
[22:57.960 --> 23:01.720]  hover.com slash to the talk show and when you sign up
[23:01.720 --> 23:09.080]  Here's the here's the coupon code. They they give me one a new one for every episode. This episode's code is vodka

[23:21.800 --> 23:26.520]  You'll save 10% so my thanks to offer nicely. No, so here's the thing. I've been obsessed
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.480]  Most obsessed with with the watch is the font
[23:29.480 --> 23:33.960]  Samprint now we have it. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful now. We have a name for it San Francisco
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.600]  So yeah, you like it
[23:37.080 --> 23:42.200]  It's pretty. I really like it. I heard from somebody inside Apple a couple
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.480]  After it was announced and before they they gave the name and I was asking like does anybody know what the name is?
[23:47.960 --> 23:51.160]  Somebody told me internally. They were referring to it as
[23:51.160 --> 24:00.600]  Denvetica and which it makes me laugh and I think it's so true because it feels like two-thirds. Helvetica one-third
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.880]  Din which is for anybody who doesn't everybody knows how that got but Din is
[24:07.320 --> 24:12.520]  Just capital letters d-i-n. I don't even know what it stands for, but it's like a font from Germany. It's like a
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.120]  I think it I think I could be making this up, but I think it was created as sort of like a
[24:20.120 --> 24:24.680]  font for signage in Germany at some point
[24:25.320 --> 24:30.840]  And it really that's what that's what San Francisco looks like. It looks like a you know two-thirds
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.320]  Helvetica one-third Din and I think it's a very very very pleasant. Mm-hmm
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.960]  It's a really nice sands and
[24:38.760 --> 24:41.880]  I I've been I've been wondering if Apple would make its own
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.560]  It seems so natural that it that that Apple would create its very own, you know specialized sensor
[24:47.560 --> 24:49.560]  And
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.680]  Yeah, it's it's beautiful. Yeah. I think well one of the things that's so interesting is
[24:55.560 --> 25:03.160]  So Microsoft has their own UI font sego sing we segue. I don't know how you pronounce it, but it yeah
[25:03.160 --> 25:06.840]  Looks like Frudigar, but it's you know, it's what they've used for
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.080]  Metro and all of the modern versions of
[25:12.840 --> 25:14.840]  windows and
[25:14.840 --> 25:16.840]  Google has
[25:16.840 --> 25:20.440]  Roboto which is their font for Android and they use it
[25:21.080 --> 25:24.920]  They use it in their iOS apps to it's like Google's UI font
[25:25.160 --> 25:33.240]  So Microsoft and Google have their own custom fonts for user interfaces and Apple which is the most to me clearly the most
[25:33.880 --> 25:37.320]  design-oriented of the major tech corporations has used
[25:38.600 --> 25:41.400]  Helvetica which is a great font, but it's funny
[25:41.400 --> 25:46.360]  It's always struck me as a little I don't know ironic that they don't have their own custom font because they're so
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.440]  Design focused and yeah, so it's it's been a long time coming in and I'm happy that to see it is happening
[25:55.480 --> 25:57.480]  It's interesting to me that it
[25:58.200 --> 26:05.480]  That the the kit that you download or the design out of the calm design resources has two versions of San Francisco
[26:06.680 --> 26:08.680]  display in text which
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.760]  is
[26:10.760 --> 26:11.880]  a lot of
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.600]  Designy fonts, you know, fonts you use for graphic design come with display in text
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.600]  Variants where the smaller sizes are called text and then at intended for larger sizes you call it display and it changes the
[26:24.600 --> 26:26.360]  Earning it changes some of the letter shapes
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.640]  I don't know of any UI font that's had that distinction before right
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.600]  Yeah, I don't know um
[26:34.600 --> 26:36.840]  Did you see there's a thing at least not notice
[26:36.840 --> 26:42.840]  That there was somebody has a github project where you can they they I don't know what what kind of
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.280]  There's some kind of hack you can do to the font files to say
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.160]  To set certain bits that make it look like the system font and then you can run you through
[26:51.800 --> 26:53.800]  You install this version of San Francisco
[26:54.760 --> 27:02.600]  and reboot your Mac and Yosemite runs with that as the system font. Oh, right. Yes, I did I did see that
[27:02.600 --> 27:06.360]  I mean, I didn't I just saw it as a someone tweeted about it. I didn't follow the link
[27:06.680 --> 27:08.680]  But that's a cool idea. I did it
[27:09.720 --> 27:11.720]  Did you and how how's it?
[27:11.720 --> 27:13.320]  How's it going?
[27:13.320 --> 27:15.320]  I ran it for a day and
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.960]  I at first I was very very excited and I liked it and I kind of had that feeling like back in the day like
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.240]  20 years ago when I would run like system extensions that would change the look of the windows and stuff like that
[27:28.440 --> 27:31.560]  Oh, yeah, you know, I totally felt very cool about it
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.800]  And there are certain things that are definitely nicer about it than Helvetica as a UI font
[27:36.360 --> 27:38.360]  But overall it's like
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.040]  Not quite right. It's just a little too
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.080]  I don't know there's something about it that that doesn't work
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.080]  You know, it's it's I know that with the UI version
[27:53.080 --> 28:02.040]  You know the the UI font in in Yosemite that it's not just playing Helvetica Noya. It's it's like a yeah, they've tweaked it
[28:02.280 --> 28:04.280]  you know that to their own
[28:04.520 --> 28:06.520]  You know, just to just to
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.440]  Make it better for for Yosemite and in particular in a different sizes
[28:10.680 --> 28:14.600]  Make it more legible and the shapes nicer, but yeah, so it's like their own version
[28:14.600 --> 28:16.920]  But it's still you know, Helvetica it well
[28:16.920 --> 28:23.800]  It makes me think though that with San Francisco that it makes me appreciate the way that they've sweated the details to make Helvetica
[28:23.800 --> 28:30.440]  Noya nicer as the Mac system font and I wouldn't be surprised if in the future it
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.400]  Is the system font on iOS and or Mac to but when if and when that happens
[28:37.640 --> 28:43.000]  They're gonna have to put that same amount of work into tweaking it to make it perfect for it
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.400]  Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, like they'll probably have to tweak it a lot because yeah, if if San Francisco as it exists now
[28:49.400 --> 28:51.720]  Was made specifically for the Apple Watch
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.280]  I mean, it's made for this tiny screen and they haven't really put a lot of work into making it
[28:56.840 --> 28:59.880]  You know, and the larger sizes that you would use
[29:00.920 --> 29:04.760]  On the Mac or in or in iOS, so right, but that would be I don't know
[29:04.760 --> 29:07.720]  I could see it working nicely, you know, yeah if they if they did
[29:07.720 --> 29:13.960]  Um, tweak it, but you can see it working nicely as a system font. I think it's some weird combination of
[29:14.520 --> 29:17.000]  Like how many pixels high the font is
[29:17.560 --> 29:23.240]  Combined with the physical size like if you measure with an actual ruler how big it's going to be
[29:23.800 --> 29:26.200]  When you look at it like it's not just like oh make
[29:26.840 --> 29:33.960]  16 point font look perfect. It's make 16 point font look perfect at
[29:33.960 --> 29:39.560]  A quarter of an inch high as opposed to like on the watch where it's going to be much smaller
[29:40.600 --> 29:43.160]  On the watch it seems like it's really
[29:43.720 --> 29:44.200]  I don't know
[29:44.200 --> 29:49.560]  I remember being blown away by it in the presentation and then at the event when I actually got to look at the watch
[29:49.640 --> 29:53.720]  The actual watches, you know hands-on it looks so cool
[29:55.240 --> 29:59.560]  That seems so long it looks amazing. I can't wait to actually get my hands on one and then see what it's like
[29:59.560 --> 30:03.720]  Yeah, it's been nice and adjustment away from Lucy to Grand at first
[30:03.720 --> 30:06.760]  It was strange on on Mac. You like oh wow
[30:06.760 --> 30:09.560]  There's just telemedica everywhere and and some of the
[30:09.960 --> 30:14.360]  You know, especially like the first really like with iOS as well like they're just some
[30:15.400 --> 30:18.440]  Size is it which like it wasn't really working for me at first, but I feel like now
[30:19.880 --> 30:27.480]  Like I don't know it's it's working really well as the system bond on the Mac. Yeah, I definitely do I like it, but it's
[30:27.480 --> 30:33.480]  It's it's been in a job as somebody who obsesses over type. It's been an adjustment like
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.360]  Sure, and you know
[30:38.280 --> 30:39.800]  Loose it a
[30:39.960 --> 30:43.720]  Worked loose at a grand grand day. That is another one of the things. I have no idea
[30:44.200 --> 30:49.720]  It's got Lucy to grand. Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm saying right now. Yeah, like do you pronounce the E on grand day?
[30:49.720 --> 30:55.080]  Grande Grande Grande Grande. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. What do you say? It's Starbucks. It's grand day, right?
[30:55.080 --> 30:57.080]  Yeah
[30:57.080 --> 31:03.000]  Yeah, I mean if it was in Spanish it would definitely be grand day, but yeah, well, whatever it's called it
[31:03.480 --> 31:11.880]  It especially worked well at small sizes like you know the the hinting work that Apple did and who you know
[31:11.880 --> 31:16.520]  The the people who made lucid in the first place intending it to be a great screen fun
[31:17.240 --> 31:23.320]  It really really worked well at very small sizes like for like when you're setting like
[31:23.320 --> 31:25.320]  uh
[31:25.320 --> 31:31.000]  Like a preferences dialogue and there's small text underneath a control that explains what that setting you know in detail
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  What that setting does
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.960]  Lucid it works so well at that and whenever it's I see that now in Helvetica on
[31:38.440 --> 31:44.360]  You know, Semedy sometimes it looks a little weird not that it looks bad, but it somehow looks it strikes me as a little
[31:44.920 --> 31:51.000]  It just feels funny, but I'm getting used to it. Let's let's talk about Yosemite. So sure
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.560]  What are as a UI designer? What what is your overall impression now that we're a couple?
[31:57.560 --> 32:01.800]  You know Yosemite is kind of settled in, you know, what what are your impressions overall?
[32:02.120 --> 32:07.320]  Um, you know, I really like it. It's everything feels very light and it's sort of for me
[32:07.320 --> 32:09.320]  It feels like it's going along with like the
[32:10.200 --> 32:13.480]  You know ever increasing fitness of the actual
[32:14.040 --> 32:16.840]  Hardware and it just sort of like helps everything feel I mean
[32:16.840 --> 32:23.960]  I like that they preserve the depth with the the drop shadows on all of the windows themselves, but then having the
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  The sort of translucency
[32:27.400 --> 32:32.440]  vibrancy stuff everywhere. It sort of at first it felt like overkill to me, but as I've sort of adjusted to it
[32:32.840 --> 32:38.920]  I like it. It feels like yeah, everything is is like these nice little pains of glass hovering over each other and
[32:39.800 --> 32:46.360]  You know, I think it feels good. I really what I really like a lot though is all of the really small like subtle animations that they've added
[32:46.360 --> 32:52.600]  Everywhere that they're not big and flashy and they're not they're not they're not slow. They don't really they're really subtle again
[32:52.600 --> 32:54.600]  So like it's like you wouldn't really
[32:54.600 --> 32:59.480]  Notice it too much, but things like checking a checkbox just animates in a nice friendly little way
[33:00.200 --> 33:05.000]  Um, you know, just even even things like like choosing something from a context menu is
[33:05.560 --> 33:10.120]  Just slightly different. It just it's just a little bit more alive a little like springer if that makes sense
[33:11.000 --> 33:13.400]  And so I feel like with you somebody they've
[33:13.400 --> 33:19.160]  They've made they've made it so you're a little bit more connected to the UI if that makes sense after
[33:20.200 --> 33:22.520]  Yeah, after like years of touch screens
[33:23.560 --> 33:29.880]  I'm feeling really connected to that. I was feeling like with with Mavericks even just feeling a little set back from the Mac
[33:29.880 --> 33:32.520]  Especially because you use a mouse or a trackpad
[33:33.400 --> 33:36.200]  But yeah, I don't know. I feel like I feel like you have somebody is more
[33:36.200 --> 33:43.640]  You've I feel more connected to it. I like it. Yeah. I feel like that's a good point with the animation and I feel like it's
[33:43.880 --> 33:51.240]  Interesting because clearly the the iPhone and iOS where we're Apple really got into that sort of
[33:52.120 --> 33:58.440]  Make things that the things you interact with on the device feel alive and feel like real things
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.240]  But they didn't do an iOS inspired
[34:03.240 --> 34:08.600]  Mac UI until now like they skipped that whole
[34:09.240 --> 34:15.320]  iOS 1-6 era in terms of like bringing those ideas to the Mac and they waited
[34:15.960 --> 34:17.960]  until after iOS 7 and
[34:18.520 --> 34:21.960]  I thought there was some I mean, you know, like the textural stuff was definitely
[34:22.360 --> 34:25.720]  Bleeding over into the Mac, right? Yeah, but not what you see
[34:25.960 --> 34:31.640]  But you know what I mean? Yeah, I agree you mean like with like the trackpad and like with the gestures you can do on the mouse
[34:31.640 --> 34:37.560]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, right and that but but also like there were and there were more like textures and things in actual in apps
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.800]  Like it was starting to take on oh texture. I see I thought you said gesture. Yeah. Yeah
[34:42.680 --> 34:46.760]  Oh gestural too, though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean and I actually have really enjoyed that
[34:46.760 --> 34:52.520]  I'm really glad that the you know magic mouse and the trackpad allow so many gestures now a little bit
[34:52.520 --> 34:55.080]  But I don't know I don't know that the textures
[34:55.880 --> 34:57.880]  I think the Mac was going in that way
[34:57.880 --> 35:06.280]  Anyway, you know that that with Mac OS 10. Sure. I feel like what what what Yosemite ads that's new is like what you said?
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.960]  Where where there's subtle animations, you know like
[35:10.360 --> 35:16.040]  Like when you click a pop-up menu, and it just grows the menu grows out of the the pop-up button
[35:16.840 --> 35:20.440]  I it's such a nice little touch. I'm a couple people
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.840]  Complained to me about that one, but I really that's one of the things about Yosemite that I enjoy
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.720]  I really like that animation where the menu it grows. I don't know how else to say it
[35:29.720 --> 35:31.720]  It just grows out of the button
[35:32.360 --> 35:34.360]  It grows and then yeah when you make your
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.880]  Selection there's just a little bit more feedback. It's just like this slight little like
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.160]  Like flash like it's like you know, you know, I've I've seen your input and I responded to it
[35:43.160 --> 35:45.160]  You know that sort of thing. It just feels more
[35:45.800 --> 35:53.000]  Um, yes, like it's slightly more alive now. Yeah, that's it's so funny that you made that noise because it doesn't make noise
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.920]  But that is what it feels like doo-doo. Yeah, like there is that sort of feeling to it
[35:59.800 --> 36:01.800]  Do you feel though
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.920]  As a designer that it is
[36:05.720 --> 36:07.720]  That you have like to redo everything
[36:08.200 --> 36:12.760]  Or do you feel that it's not that much work to to get
[36:13.400 --> 36:16.520]  Like rogue amoeba's apps looking perfect on Yosemite
[36:17.160 --> 36:19.160]  Is it a restart?
[36:19.160 --> 36:23.640]  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely going to be a lot of I mean if we did nothing else
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.960]  It would just have to be a lot of like re-skinning everything
[36:26.520 --> 36:29.000]  Um, and I don't I don't think we're going to go
[36:29.400 --> 36:32.680]  Um, like we're not going to dive into the translucency
[36:33.400 --> 36:35.560]  Um, stuff too much at least not with
[36:36.760 --> 36:39.320]  With the next, you know, few iterations of our apps
[36:40.040 --> 36:46.520]  Um, we're sort of I don't know. We're going to sort of be in the middle there and sort of make things look at home on Yosemite
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.520]  Um, hopefully
[36:49.480 --> 36:52.520]  That's the goal anyway make things look at home on Yosemite, but still look like
[36:53.320 --> 36:55.480]  um, our stuff if that makes sense and
[36:57.240 --> 36:59.240]  Yeah, so not whole hog into it
[36:59.880 --> 37:03.800]  I feel I feel yeah, I do I feel because I feel like somehow like
[37:04.440 --> 37:07.560]  Going from Iowa 6 to Iowa 7 for most apps
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.960]  Was like you really had to redo the whole thing to make it feel like oh yeah
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.440]  where as I feel like going from
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.960]  Pre Yosemite Mac app to Yosemite. It's really
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.480]  It it to me. Yeah. It's more subtle. Yeah. It's a lot more subtle. I think it's a lot less
[37:25.720 --> 37:27.400]  Yeah, it's a lot more subtle. It's a lot less work
[37:27.400 --> 37:30.520]  And it just depends on your app though. Um, like something like fission
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.960]  I feel like would um, would benefit from just a little bit of re-skinning, but then something like pazo
[37:36.440 --> 37:38.440]  Which oh, I still love my little um
[37:39.160 --> 37:41.160]  Recording app. It's it's a very um
[37:41.160 --> 37:46.600]  Um, you know, it's all skeo morphic and and cutesy and in whimsical so
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.720]  Um, so it just depends on the app and and how much um
[37:50.520 --> 37:57.160]  How far in either direction it already was to begin with I guess um, and some things will take more work and other things less work, but
[37:59.640 --> 38:05.160]  You know, I yeah, like I feel like pazo is a good example though because pazo
[38:05.560 --> 38:09.960]  You know, and I know that this word gets overused, but it's skeo morphic
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.160]  And I Paul just I think was Paul who just walked about it. I saw the post, but it was a like celebrating
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.480]  Um, like an anniversary or something, but it was you know mentioned. Yes. Yeah mentioning the old
[38:22.040 --> 38:24.040]  Braun physical
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.520]  Radio that sort of inspired the look of it
[38:27.080 --> 38:34.840]  Um, right and which is a beautiful device super beautiful device. Mm-hmm. I kind of feel like which they gave me so
[38:34.840 --> 38:39.240]  Sorry, the anniversary was my five year anniversary and they gave me the brown
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.760]  Radio that inspired pazo, which was an incredible gift. Anyway, I'm just throwing that in there. That how awesome
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.320]  You know, he's you know, he's not awesome. He's kind of yeah, he's kind of a dick
[38:50.360 --> 38:52.360]  Because he's so awesome
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.080]  That's also good guy. No, the problem is he comes up with clever ideas like that
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.040]  And then it makes you know, it makes the rest of us look bad who don't have clever gift ideas. It's true
[39:02.040 --> 39:07.960]  Like my my idea of a good gift would be like like a gift card for the item store
[39:10.600 --> 39:14.600]  Like here go by you know go by the new levels for Monument Valley and
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.640]  Whereas Paul Kefassus comes up with a brilliant idea like the actual
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.680]  1968 radio that inspired pazo and then ships it to you. Yeah
[39:27.320 --> 39:29.640]  Which is terrible because it's so
[39:29.640 --> 39:35.080]  It's so wonderful that it's terrible because it makes yeah, I feel can tap that right
[39:35.080 --> 39:37.800]  Yeah, and then he's like oh, yeah, it's just donating platelets this week
[39:46.120 --> 39:52.200]  Exactly he's giving you a wonderful gift while his other arm like from one hand on his phone while the other arm
[39:52.200 --> 39:54.200]  Is is donating platelets
[39:54.200 --> 40:02.760]  Terrible right exactly, but I don't you I do feel though that I can app like pazo kids gets away with the
[40:03.480 --> 40:10.680]  The skeuomorphic gimmickry still on Yosemite in a way that like on the iPhone with Iowa 7
[40:11.320 --> 40:16.920]  That sort of thing looks dated. I don't know there's something exactly. Yeah, well, I still feel like yeah
[40:16.920 --> 40:18.280]  I feel like
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.800]  Piazo and I think it's just that like the the Mac is such a it's just a much more broad platform. It's just
[40:25.400 --> 40:28.680]  there's a lot more variation I think between apps and
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.040]  Yeah, and so it can still like I've been using it this whole time, and it's still
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.160]  The cutesy for me. I'm still sort of like oh, maybe I shouldn't have gone so skeuomorphic with it
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.240]  But that's me with every single thing I design like you know if it's over three months old
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.400]  I'm like oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that but
[40:45.400 --> 40:48.840]  Um, yeah, I feel like it can still be at home
[40:50.280 --> 40:52.280]  On Yosemite whereas
[40:52.280 --> 40:54.280]  Yeah, anything that's that's super
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.960]  Textured and detailed like that on iOS. It just yeah, it just looks like iOS 6 and it looks
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.480]  Really out of place. Yeah, it's it's funny because there's so many more
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.400]  iOS users than Mac users, you know, but I don't know maybe by a factor of 10 at least
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.480]  But it seems it just seems curious to me that
[41:16.840 --> 41:23.960]  iOS is where Apple seems to be more radical with their UI design where the pre iOS 7
[41:24.600 --> 41:32.760]  Ui aesthetic for iOS was way more skeuomorphic and more textured and had more like oh, this is this looks like a pain of glass
[41:33.160 --> 41:35.960]  With a glossy, you know effect on it
[41:35.960 --> 41:42.200]  And it's bubbly and it's textured and the texture is really really rich
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.400]  Way more over the top than the Mac ever got and then when they went the other way
[41:47.560 --> 41:54.120]  They went way more radically in the direction of okay, no textures no 3d effects
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.800]  This is I know again. It's overused word, but this is flat
[41:58.760 --> 42:02.200]  You know the buttons don't even have outlines. They're just text
[42:02.200 --> 42:08.600]  Oh man, it's just that is not even a button. Yeah, and the Mac
[42:09.800 --> 42:13.240]  Both ways it never it's way more conservative to me
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.680]  It never went that textured before and now with Yosemite where they've sort of updated it for a modern look
[42:19.320 --> 42:25.560]  It's it's nowhere near as radical as iOS 7 and I think it's it's more more pleasing overall. Oh definitely
[42:25.560 --> 42:29.960]  And I think if they really benefited from having you know done iOS 7
[42:29.960 --> 42:35.320]  Um, you know before you have somebody and so they sort of I mean this is my I'm just
[42:35.880 --> 42:37.960]  It's all conjecture, but I'm just guessing you know that they
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.520]  They had all of that experience and we're like okay
[42:40.520 --> 42:44.520]  Well, it's it's like the pendulum sort of swung too far in that direction like that
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.520]  Let's get let's strip everything down to
[42:47.240 --> 42:50.920]  Really really minimalist design and it's like okay. Well, maybe that was a little too far and then
[42:51.560 --> 42:53.960]  Yosemite feels like just just nudging it back
[42:54.920 --> 42:56.920]  Just far enough so that it's comfortable
[42:56.920 --> 43:01.320]  And yeah, and buttons look like buttons and there are slight gradients here and there
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.160]  Yeah, it's nice and I think it works. I think it works and in some ways better
[43:07.160 --> 43:09.960]  And I think that's why it feels more
[43:10.520 --> 43:16.280]  Accommodating to a broader range of styles sure that it's still you know
[43:16.280 --> 43:18.280]  Like I said like it still feels like
[43:18.440 --> 43:23.400]  System where PASO as it is without any kind of you know new Yosemite update
[43:23.400 --> 43:28.040]  Still looks it still looks right. It still looks like that's you know acceptable
[43:28.680 --> 43:30.840]  Right, yeah, I hope so anyway
[43:32.360 --> 43:35.160]  I thought it was interesting. I that's sort of you know
[43:36.040 --> 43:42.200]  I think I've touched on this before but like before they unveiled Yosemite and everybody kind of knew of course
[43:42.200 --> 43:44.200]  They're going to do some sort of
[43:44.280 --> 43:50.840]  iOS 7 style update for the Mac. I really was braced for it to be a lot more radical
[43:50.840 --> 43:54.120]  I really thought that they were going to flatten everything more
[43:54.360 --> 44:00.280]  You know like and like you even said like where they still have the shadow effects between windows to show you what's in front of
[44:00.280 --> 44:02.280]  I thought maybe they'd get rid of stuff like that
[44:02.680 --> 44:09.800]  Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah, and they didn't and it even really surprises me that they still have
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.720]  So many settings and system preferences that let you the user
[44:16.280 --> 44:19.720]  You know change things like I kind of I would have bet
[44:19.720 --> 44:22.600]  A year ago that the the
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.560]  iOS 7 style update to macOS would have gotten rid of like
[44:28.360 --> 44:34.600]  The ability to change the appearance color, you know like blue and graphic. Oh, right. Yeah between blue and graphic. Yeah
[44:35.560 --> 44:40.040]  Right, and you can go it's it's interesting that they provided the dark theme too
[44:40.040 --> 44:43.240]  It's sort of that came out of nowhere because it's it's just seems very
[44:43.240 --> 44:49.640]  Counter to what Apple's done for the last few years just just not allowing much appearance
[44:50.840 --> 44:57.080]  You know specialization or customization so having like a secondary like dark theme and then of course
[44:57.080 --> 44:59.080]  Yeah, we were talking before
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.080]  about the
[45:01.080 --> 45:07.000]  The reduced transparency and increased contrast. Oh, well, I don't know. It's not really a hack the accessibility
[45:07.000 --> 45:15.480]  Preferences that you can do to change the whole look is as like as a thing that now people are doing to sort of customize the look
[45:16.120 --> 45:20.360]  Themselves, which is which is fun. And you know, I did that for a while. It's it's fun
[45:20.600 --> 45:25.640]  Yeah, so what it is is in system preferences if you haven't done this in a in system preferences
[45:25.880 --> 45:27.880]  Go not it's not in the general
[45:27.720 --> 45:33.560]  Pain where you set most of the UI stuff. It's an accessibility. It's an accessibility and you
[45:33.560 --> 45:40.680]  You can check reduce transparency and then you can also check increase contrast and
[45:41.640 --> 45:45.720]  Increase increase contrast is the really interesting one to me. Yes
[45:46.840 --> 45:51.320]  Me too. Yeah, and oh actually if you if you select increased contrast it will automatically select
[45:52.280 --> 45:54.280]  Yes
[45:54.280 --> 45:55.960]  That's so fun
[45:55.960 --> 46:01.000]  and it's it's kind of wild like and you and I
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.040]  Before the show we were emailing or chatting or whatever whatever the kids do
[46:07.960 --> 46:15.880]  But but we both said the same thing like at the same time, which is that it looks sort of like like some kind of alternate universe
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.280]  Where the original like 1990s Mac OS
[46:21.720 --> 46:27.000]  Like evolved through to today's display technology, you know that right?
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.920]  Just completely linearly like yeah, like blue never happened like there was nothing ever like big and puffy or whimsical
[46:33.160 --> 46:35.160]  anywhere I just sort of like stayed with the
[46:36.120 --> 46:42.280]  You know dark outlines around buttons and things just sort of got more streamlined and sleek sort of and then like the yeah
[46:42.760 --> 46:46.600]  The system font changed from Chicago to
[46:47.160 --> 46:50.760]  Helvetica. It's just yeah, it's so interesting to to use though
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.000]  And it's it's actually really pleasant. I really enjoyed
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.080]  I used it for a while. I'm maybe even close to a week and then I changed turned it off and now that we're talking
[47:01.080 --> 47:04.360]  I did it again, and I'm looking at it. I'm like, I'm gonna leave this on
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.800]  I really like it. Yeah, and if you set your desktop background to like a a dark gray
[47:09.960 --> 47:13.800]  Then you're just yeah, it just feels like an old Mac. It's really fun
[47:14.600 --> 47:19.000]  It's a really neat effect and and and you said me the screenshot everybody does
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.600]  I've I get it on Twitter like every three days from somebody over there like what what the what the hell's going on with this
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.400]  Is when you do things like what are the ways that you can bring on it? Like if you change the volume
[47:30.520 --> 47:33.560]  Yeah, if you if you mute your your volume and like there's a
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.600]  That icon is sort of I guess it has
[47:38.120 --> 47:43.640]  Blank pixels and and it just gives a black background where there should just be blank pixels and it's like oh man
[47:43.800 --> 47:47.640]  What happened there? Yeah, it's like when you just like there's like goofy little things like that
[47:47.640 --> 47:49.640]  There's a few like
[47:49.640 --> 47:51.240]  buttons and like
[47:51.240 --> 47:57.560]  Sometimes find your buttons or in like save dialogs like the the buttons will be like a skew when they're when you're in this mode
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.600]  And I'm not sure why that happens, but yeah, it's just there's a few little quirky things that that happen
[48:02.760 --> 48:09.240]  Yeah, there's like just a couple of weird glitches. It's I mean they're technically buds, but it glitched
[48:09.240 --> 48:16.920]  Glitch feels like a better word, but yeah, it's like when you change the volume. It's like the the little I
[48:17.800 --> 48:23.480]  Don't even know what you would call it. Is it a like a the little transparent heads up display that that shows you
[48:23.800 --> 48:31.240]  What the volume level is at as you're hitting the buttons on your your keyboard has round rounded corners and
[48:32.040 --> 48:34.040]  It's like when you turn this mode on
[48:34.040 --> 48:41.560]  They get completely squared off into perfect squares, but the difference between the round right corners and the truly perfect squares
[48:41.560 --> 48:45.960]  It's just filled in with black and it looks really it's really kind of gross
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.000]  It's just goofy. Yeah, it's gross. It's gross. Let's face it. It's so it's broken
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.040]  Yeah, it's like your Mac is looking at you and it has something in its teeth and you're you want to like say
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.600]  You want to just look at it and be like you got hey
[48:59.080 --> 49:01.080]  Yeah, you got something
[49:01.080 --> 49:06.200]  Teeth right there. Yeah. It just out. Yeah. Yeah. It upsets the perfectionist in me
[49:06.280 --> 49:13.080]  But overall though, I kind of think it's a better look than the default Yosemite look which I which in turn
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.760]  I do kind of like
[49:14.920 --> 49:17.480]  But I feel like this is even better. Yeah, it's um
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.520]  It's really clean and and everything is like super obvious
[49:23.800 --> 49:27.000]  Which I like and and and things just really stand out well in the
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.280]  Yeah, I like the the higher contrast. It's nice
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.960]  Looks good. I mean, so I mean, it's just one random little thing unrelated to
[49:36.680 --> 49:39.640]  Most everything else, but what the whole like the thing that bugs me the most
[49:39.640 --> 49:45.080]  And it's such such a stupid little thing is like the the forward and back buttons in safari and finder
[49:45.080 --> 49:51.960]  Just what those navigational buttons. It used to be a segmented button. Mm-hmm. Do you know what I mean? Like the it's like a it used to be
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.880]  Yeah, they're they used to be triangles now. They're like back and left and right carrots, but anyway
[49:55.880 --> 50:05.000]  The they're like very close together and they're rounded rectangles, and they just they they don't quite touch and oh that bugs me so much there
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Yeah, and they kind of
[50:07.960 --> 50:15.640]  But no, I know exactly what you mean is that they also sort of in in the middle where they meet there's there's like a little like a butt crack
[50:16.840 --> 50:21.640]  Yeah, exactly like they're not they're not yeah, and if they were and if they were touching they'd still have their
[50:21.640 --> 50:28.920]  Rounded rectangle edges like just meeting up in a weird way, and it's like why isn't that a segmented button anywhere like what happened
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.600]  Right it used to just be anyway, or just like put them slightly farther apart or just make it a segmented button
[50:34.600 --> 50:36.440]  I don't know exactly it's like they've
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.240]  They've tried to split the difference in a weird way where it doesn't look like yeah again
[50:41.240 --> 50:46.920]  And again that I think that's the actual like that's actually what you call it in next code is a segmented button
[50:47.320 --> 50:50.680]  But that's what it used to look like it just look like a button
[50:50.680 --> 50:56.280]  With segments to divide it whereas now it looks like two buttons that were
[50:57.080 --> 51:03.720]  Inappropriately cut placed right next to each other. Yes, exactly. Oh, irks me so much. Anyway
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.600]  Most other things are for a beautiful and yeah, no, I totally agree with that. I don't I don't like that
[51:10.600 --> 51:12.600]  There's like a yeah like a plumber's
[51:13.160 --> 51:15.160]  But crack that you see at the top and
[51:15.560 --> 51:17.560]  Thing I don't it bothers me

[54:43.320 --> 54:45.480]  So my thanks to lynda.com for sponsoring the show
[54:47.640 --> 54:49.640]  All right icons. Let's talk about icons
[54:49.640 --> 54:55.480]  I got sure so that's one of the areas like I mentioned before where I sort of expected
[54:55.960 --> 54:58.600]  Yosemite to go in an iOS
[54:59.560 --> 55:05.320]  iOS style way where I kind of was thinking that they're going to say okay now all icons have to be circles
[55:06.200 --> 55:12.200]  Or something like that. Oh, I know that would be awful. Yeah. No, I'm so glad they didn't and I mean
[55:12.200 --> 55:15.400]  There are plenty of circles all around the UI, but I'm so happy that
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.600]  They're still using objects
[55:18.600 --> 55:24.120]  You know in a lot of places. I mean that they do still they they are using a lot of circles and a lot of
[55:24.760 --> 55:27.160]  Like they tilted rectangle basically
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.440]  But I'm like I like that they stuck with a lot of
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.800]  You know objects or representational more representational things and just made them in sort of a
[55:36.200 --> 55:41.720]  A paired down simplified style so that they sort of look like Yosemite, but they're still sort of fun shapes
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.160]  And they're not all they're not all one shape. That's that makes me happy
[55:45.160 --> 55:53.640]  Yeah, I it makes me when it when they showed it to us and you know one of the things I noticed was you know
[55:53.640 --> 55:59.160]  Even in the like default Apple doc when you have a fresh install of Yosemite
[55:59.160 --> 56:04.040]  There's a variety of icons styles so you can see right away that there's no
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.280]  Just one style and I you know write it right in the keynote
[56:08.280 --> 56:09.240]  I thought oh, that's great
[56:09.240 --> 56:11.880]  I was totally wrong about that and then I started like question myself
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.040]  I was like well, why did I think they were gonna do that like I kind of thought you know
[56:16.040 --> 56:18.440]  Why why did I expect that like?
[56:19.320 --> 56:23.480]  Because it makes me think like oh of course they wouldn't do that because it wouldn't work on the Mac
[56:23.880 --> 56:27.160]  But it somehow I was dreading it and expected them to do that
[56:28.760 --> 56:33.000]  Well, um, yeah, and there are I mean I don't that's sort of far-fetched because
[56:34.040 --> 56:35.960]  Yeah, in some ways I could see that making sense
[56:35.960 --> 56:43.080]  But I'm so glad that that's not the way things went because having a doc full of circles would be really annoying. You'd have to use
[56:43.960 --> 56:48.680]  Um, you know, you'd have to really use color and have a very clear very simple
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.040]  I can't you know like iconic shape inside of your circle to identify your app and
[56:54.840 --> 57:01.720]  Yeah, I think it would just be really sort of bland and kind of annoying to sort of figure out what is what just having lance
[57:01.720 --> 57:06.920]  So I'm happy they they kept their they kept the idea of of different
[57:07.480 --> 57:10.440]  Shapes and using a lot of physical objects, but just um
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.080]  Yeah, just sort of reskinned them and there's a lot more
[57:15.480 --> 57:22.040]  Texture and depth to them even again even just the ones from Apple alone, you know third parties who can do whatever they want
[57:22.040 --> 57:27.160]  But even the Apple ones have more texture and depth than the icons on iOS. Oh by far
[57:27.160 --> 57:29.320]  Yeah, yeah, so much. It's yeah, it's great
[57:29.320 --> 57:34.120]  But it's still um, you know the same time. It's still look. It's definitely paired down unless, you know blee
[57:34.920 --> 57:39.320]  Then um, then previous uh, my icons like I was I was actually
[57:39.640 --> 57:42.920]  So I was just home in Florida visiting my mom and she's still running Mavericks and um
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.920]  Yeah, I was really just sort of like oh, yeah. Wow. Look at all these these icons like everything is shift so shiny like
[57:49.640 --> 57:51.720]  Um, just the you know giving the icons
[57:52.440 --> 57:55.320]  Just just subtle makeover so that everything is more matte
[57:55.800 --> 57:57.320]  um
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.240]  unless glossy and and just tweaking the colors and the lighting and and
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.840]  In shapes and in sort of flattening things out
[58:05.320 --> 58:09.480]  Um, reducing perspective on the on the rectangles that are tilted that sort of thing
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.680]  Um, yeah, I think it's it's helped. It's a good it's a good compromise. It's a good middle ground
[58:14.680 --> 58:17.560]  I think I still have one of my machines
[58:17.880 --> 58:23.160]  It's actually a machine I used to record podcasts. It's still running Mavericks. So I still see it's a MacBook Air
[58:23.160 --> 58:31.720]  Um, okay, and it it like increasingly as like week by week. It just looks like older and older and older
[58:31.720 --> 58:33.960]  It looks it looks silly at this point. Yeah
[58:35.160 --> 58:37.160]  And in particular
[58:37.560 --> 58:44.120]  To me the icons really really stand out like like the finder icon. It's like why?
[58:44.920 --> 58:47.000]  Yeah, I don't know. Why is it big?
[58:47.000 --> 58:53.080]  Why did they make it look like it's made out of glass? I don't get it like there still is a lighting effect
[58:53.080 --> 58:57.880]  I got the new one in Yosemite. There's a very nice lighting effect. It looks like there's light coming down from the top
[58:58.440 --> 59:01.080]  Um, it has texture. It has depth
[59:01.640 --> 59:09.720]  But the one I'm looking at them side by side right now. It's like the the Mavericks one has this glass effect that just looks so
[59:09.960 --> 59:14.440]  Like I can't say it better than blingy blingy is the exact right word
[59:14.440 --> 59:17.000]  Yeah, and it's like why why did we do that?
[59:18.200 --> 59:21.800]  It's like looking back at like high school pictures, and it's like why did I have a moment
[59:22.440 --> 59:29.320]  Why did we think that looked good right? Yeah, the other one that really stands out to me is the app store icon and
[59:29.800 --> 59:34.040]  Like I think iTunes used the same stuff, but it's like iTunes was updated now
[59:34.040 --> 59:40.520]  It's like iTunes has the Yosemite icon even on the old system, but like the app store icon is this circle
[59:40.520 --> 59:47.320]  You know with just an incredible amount of like gloss and glass sort of
[59:48.360 --> 59:52.760]  Lighting oh, yes. Yeah, it's like has like rays and yeah, it has like this. Yeah
[59:54.120 --> 59:58.600]  Um, yeah, at least the old one had like was all of this light and sort of in depth to it
[59:58.840 --> 1:00:01.160]  And the new one is just like you know subtle gradient
[1:00:02.520 --> 1:00:08.680]  The iconic you know app store. You're just generic application icon and yeah big change
[1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:11.640]  Do you when you guys are working on apps?
[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:17.560]  Do you do you get to work on the app icon right away or do you wait and is the you know
[1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:21.240]  It's that something you do later in the process. Oh, it just depends on the app
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.040]  Like we're already working on a a new app
[1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.640]  I'm not allowed to talk about and I've already made the icon for it and you've you know
[1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:30.200]  Pretty much decided like yes, this is the final version of the icon
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:33.000]  I think it just depends
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.600]  on where where developers are as sort of like we go through wireframes and we get things
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:41.240]  You know pretty much where we think they should be and then
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.520]  There's a lot more back-end work and then it's sort of like okay
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:46.760]  Well, here's a thing that I can do in the meantime
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:51.400]  I mean we have we have a lot of apps and I'm the only designer so I'm sort of always rotating around
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:55.720]  What I'm working on but yeah, it just depends on on the app at which point
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:57.720]  We do the icon
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:02.280]  There's not there's not a hard and fast like time that we that we do right you can always change it later
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:04.920]  But I find with most designers who I know that they
[1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:11.480]  They can't stand working on an app until they have something that could plausibly be the app icon
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:16.760]  You know like oh, right. Oh, yeah, bugs me so much when there's just like a some placeholder art
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:19.560]  From the developer
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:21.800]  Let me at least make yeah, we're out, you know
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:25.320]  I'll at least make you know something like here. This this might this might be a
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:33.320]  And right like in other words the best way to get some sort of plausible app icon idea out of you would be to
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:39.400]  Make a have engineering create a build where where the icon is just like a
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:44.680]  You know some clip art from the internet because it'll it because as soon as you see it
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:49.480]  You'll be like I need to immediately drop everything and make something so that the next build
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.680]  Oh, man, but I'm so not allowed to do that. Oh, yeah, I
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:58.120]  I have to get because that is exactly what I would do and then so
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:03.880]  Yeah, I have to sort of be rained in on that. It's like no you can't work on the icon right now
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.880]  You have like three other things you need to do
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:07.880]  Oh, it's so hard
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:12.600]  We really need this sign-up dialogue done because we can't use the app until we have a sign-up dial
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:16.920]  You know, no, I have got to yeah, I have to fix this icon right
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  Yeah, we have yeah, there's a lot of
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:24.200]  Prioritizing that like we often should have different
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.520]  Priorities as far as that goes like I don't want to work on the
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:30.520]  boring
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.520]  Network when preferences window, you know, I want to make the icon
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:37.080]  But that's you know, that's how it goes
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.280]  I don't know I
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:44.120]  Cons to me it's it's funny because I I've always said this
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:48.520]  I think people argue about icons more than any other thing in
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:54.440]  Software design. I don't even say user interfaces on all the software design because it's the one
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.440]  It's the one thing that
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.840]  Even if you're not a designer
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:04.440]  It's just a single point of entry and it represents the whole app so it is important and
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:08.680]  Oh, it's hugely important. Yeah, it's how you identify the app
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.080]  It's how when you're just you know switching back and forth
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:15.080]  Between apps. It's like how you quickly at a glance see what that app is
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:21.000]  Reminds users. Yeah. I don't know. I have I could launch it so it's definitely important. Yeah, extremely
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.360]  But it's not truly as important as the amount of
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  argument that happens over
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:33.800]  Changes to icons like people are still people are still fishing about the new icons in Yosemite
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.760]  You know because you can't please everybody all the time
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.200]  Sure, so I think the icons overall
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:46.040]  I think they look much better, but like for example, here's oh, yeah, I like most well
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:49.400]  Here's one that I don't like I don't like the system preferences I got
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:57.800]  Yeah, it's sort of it's kind of bland. Yeah, and it's it's got like too strong of a lighting effect and too
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:04.760]  Realistic of a gear. It's like super photorette. It doesn't fit with the it doesn't fit with the others
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:07.320]  Yeah, it's it somehow
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:13.080]  I don't know it looks to me it. Yeah, well, it looks about the gradient especially like the gradient that's on the the gear
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:15.080]  It just looks very like
[1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:22.360]  It's kind of an uncanny valley like between the subtle gradients on everything else and then like trying to go more photorealistic
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:25.800]  Because it's not photorealistic enough to be like the old blingy style
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:32.520]  But it's more photorealistic than the other gradients used elsewhere on other app icons and so
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:38.920]  Yeah, it's just kind of weird and then just like having it be it just like the the gear being in a circle in a box
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:41.640]  Like that gray outer box is very bland. I'm very boring. Yeah
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:47.480]  Yeah, don't I yeah, and I feel the other thing I dislike is is the Safari icon still
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.480]  I like it better than the one on iOS, but
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:58.280]  See I've I've you know, that's interesting because I like the new Safari icon. Do you yeah, I do I don't know why
[1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:05.240]  But I do but I also wish that it was on iOS. I wish that they would yeah
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:10.520]  I guess it sort of is reminiscent of the one on iOS
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:16.840]  But the thing I don't like about the iOS one is that the iOS one is is a circle
[1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:21.160]  And they've just put the circle in the
[1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:23.320]  In a white square
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:29.280]  Right, I always call them squares and it whiskus always correctly that they're they're technically what is there?
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:33.320]  Super ellipses. Yeah, super ellipses. Yes. Um
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:41.720]  Sorry, it was like it was like it was like they wanted to be so I don't know why not just make the compass be the super ellips
[1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:48.760]  You know make the whole thing blue and put the the the compass dial on that why put the circle in the square
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:52.200]  It just seems exactly. Yeah, seems forced to me
[1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:58.040]  Oh, and to like the the lighting effects and the coloring and the gradient on the on the one on
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:00.440]  The Mac is is nicer
[1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:05.400]  Maybe there's more detail there. It's sharper cleaner, but yeah, it's weird
[1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:09.720]  I'm just right wasn't the old dinner the old Safari icon on iOS didn't fill the entire
[1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:15.400]  Routed rectangle at that point. It was a round of rectangle. I think I could be wrong
[1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:20.360]  Yeah, I think that it did don't make that and then yeah, and then they they didn't yeah
[1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:26.680]  The circle inside the square because at that outer white square that this compass is sitting in it doesn't really do anything or make any sense
[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:29.320]  It just forces that
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:32.200]  the entire icon to be sort of smaller so
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:35.560]  I'm
[1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:37.560]  Yeah, I'm looking at
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:43.800]  An old screenshot from iOS 6 and yes the old Safari icon the whole the blue filled filled the whole square
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:45.800]  Right. Yeah, that's what I thought okay
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:48.440]  Yeah, I feel like all they needed to do is just redraw
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:52.280]  Do it the same way and just redraw it without the walls. Yeah, just redraw it and just yeah
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:59.320]  Yeah, exactly just make it matte make it a look at home on iOS 7 and 8 and that's all they need to do but
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:05.000]  But here we are it just seems to me though that people people bitch about icons and I am
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:10.040]  As we sit here in bitch about icons and I get exactly people who bitch about icons
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:14.760]  But like I feel like people bitch about them disproportionately to
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:18.840]  To how much they actually have to deal with them because it's so
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:23.480]  Easily encapsulated, you know, it's it's like as a designer
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:31.560]  It's the same thing when you ever you pick a color and it's like you will get into arguments with you know
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.560]  Whether it's like a client
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:35.560]  Relationship or whether it's like you know
[1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:38.680]  Like with you like where you're full-time at a place
[1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:45.640]  But it's like you can get an argument over a color that will last for hours because it's so easily and comp
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.200]  You know, there's there's no subtlety to it
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:51.640]  You can just say I don't like that color and then all of a sudden exactly
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:58.680]  You know, you're you're two people are jointly using the color picker to pick a new color and it just goes on
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:01.480]  icons
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:06.280]  Yes, yes, and and everyone has a very strong opinion about them like there's no one
[1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:10.360]  Yeah, there's no one who doesn't want to weigh in whereas you know
[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:16.040]  With if you're designing like a sidebar or something like that people are you know less interested
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:19.720]  I guess but everyone wants to give their input when it's yeah, I found and you know
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:21.720]  I mean it makes sense because it is
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:27.080]  You know the gateway to the app and the thing that represents the app as a whole so it is you know
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.120]  It's a really important thing and it tends to be more fun and more interesting. I think so people
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:39.800]  Just jump on that. Yeah, it's like with us like you're designing a sidebar and you need like a gear button
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:46.040]  To get to you know settings for the sidebar and it's like is it lower right?
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:52.280]  Is it lower left and and if you put it in the lower right of the sidebar and somebody thinks it should be lower left
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.840]  They'll just say like gently like I don't know maybe this I don't know if that's right
[1:08:56.840 --> 1:08:58.440]  It feels like maybe it would be more natural
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:03.160]  More natural if it was in the lower left and they'll say it like you know like an open-ended question like that
[1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:08.840]  Whereas if they don't like the icon, they'll be like this icon is terrible. Oh, it makes my eyes exactly
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:15.880]  Yes, yeah, you nailed it totally you don't get like this subtle sort of you know
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:24.440]  Maybe kind of do something different feedback with icons that you get with other things like should it be lower left lower right
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:28.520]  Should we draw a box around these controls because they're grouped together?
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:34.120]  You know things like that everybody you know sort of does that in a more I don't know
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.960]  It's the feedback's always a little bit more humane with stuff like that. Yeah, it's true
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:44.920]  Definitely we'll get very opinionated and very passionate about their icons
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:51.240]  Oh, one thing about icons that I mean, and this isn't I mean, it's not about icon design
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:57.720]  But just one set a little thing about you somebody that I'm kind of sad about is when you drag an icon out of the
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  Doc it doesn't do the little poof animation anymore, but you still have the poof sound because
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:04.600]  But instead it just says remove there's like a little
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.800]  Pop-up that hovers ever that says remove and then you drag it away
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:12.280]  And it does the little poof sound, but you don't get that little like puff-up smoke animation, you know
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:15.080]  I miss that that's all
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:19.160]  Yeah, oh that you know it's I don't think that I'm doing it right now
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:21.160]  I don't think I've removed anything from my dog
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:26.120]  It would be a remedy until just now I just noticed this weird remove thing
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:30.040]  Yeah, yeah, it's just it's a little I mean, maybe it's more obvious
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:34.360]  But come on. I mean the the smoke was it was whimsical
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:38.760]  They could have made it. I mean they kind of changed it like so it matched you somebody or something
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:40.760]  I don't know I like I do like like in
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.400]  Launchpad they kept a little
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:49.240]  Like have to put a whimsy there by having like the little the little sparklies around a new app that you haven't launched. Yes
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.520]  Like in lunch, but yeah, it's so cute. It's like I like I like little
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:57.480]  Like you know it would be overkill if it was like on it, you know in everything
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:01.320]  But just little hints of it here and there it's it's nice to keep things like that
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.720]  But it's yeah, but it's just funny that you still get the little poof, but you don't have the animation anymore
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.960]  But you get the sound yeah, and it's a good contrast to the sparklies in
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  Uh
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:17.240]  Launch center. I I sort of feel like with launch center like somebody made that animation
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:23.720]  I like like because I don't think it's new. I think it's I think it's the same sparkly animation that was there before your
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:27.880]  Semedy I don't think maybe they tweaked it, but it looks very similar to me
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:31.880]  I can't help but think that there was somebody who made it and they loved it
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:35.000]  And then you know, you know, they're like we're gonna do this, you know
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.200]  We're gonna redesign the whole OS, you know for 10 point 10 and we're gonna flatten everything
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:45.720]  We're gonna get rid of all the stuff and that they like secretly were like oh god, please don't come for the sparkly
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:52.200]  Please don't come with you know, and then like nobody nobody ever like filed a radar that was like get rid of this
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:54.760]  Weird sparkly thing and they are like sure
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  They're beloved sparkly thing because it it does I I like that it's there, but it does kind of stick out
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:10.440]  I think yeah, it doesn't it doesn't really fit, but it's I still just like it and and I think it works because it's sort of like a
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:15.880]  One-off like it's just a random rare thing like it's not, you know, there aren't things like that all over the
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  The OS so it's fine. It
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:22.200]  It just happens in that one place and it's fine. It's just a little little touch of fun
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:29.720]  The obvious thing to do would be to to copy the iOS style and put just put a blue dot next to the
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.720]  App name if it's updated
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.920]  It's a boring
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:38.600]  It is and it's it's just one of those funny things though where like
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:46.200]  Like overall like I said, you know a little earlier that overall the Mac is more to me more conservative
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.000]  Ui-wise than iOS but like the sparklies in
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:52.840]  Launch Center is you know way bling
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:13:02.680]  Like way more bling in than iOS. Oh for sure. Yeah, but it just in that one space in the rest of it doesn't look
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:06.840]  But I mean the rest of it, you know fits in fine like the icon fits in fine
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:13.080]  You get this, you know nice, you know frosted glass effect over your over your background and
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:17.880]  Search bar up at the top side. I mean that's everything else looks like it. It just fits right in
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:28.280]  But then you get the little sparklies have you I this is and this is one of those things too that I wondered about and I maybe it'll never happen
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:29.880]  but I
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:31.880]  speaking of
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.880]  Launch Center
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:35.880]  I sort of expected
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:48.680]  That when Apple eventually did the okay, let's do a major redesign of OS 10 that I expected that the finder would be replaced with launch center as the sort of
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:54.680]  Interesting like starting point of the OS like when you first log in with nothing launched
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.320]  I thought that they would switch to launch center which is
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:02.200]  You know, it's it's pretty much the Mac version of the iOS home screen
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:07.720]  Right exactly that and you know that I never occurred to me that they would that they might do that but it makes sense now that you
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  You mentioned it that would be a good
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:14.760]  Sort of analogy to to the iOS home screen to be to start there
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:21.880]  Well, and I think I wonder and I just one of those things where I would love to I would love to just find out like the
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:26.280]  Inside scoop as of whether they thought about it or not, but you know, they never talk about it
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:30.280]  but I wonder how much how much of it is that
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:34.680]  You know, maybe they would like to and if the Mac was a brand new thing
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:43.200]  That's exactly what they would do, but they can't do it because so many people save all their crap to the desktop and the desktop
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:47.640]  Has to be there because they're so limited with all the files and random stuff
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:50.360]  right because you know
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:56.600]  For everybody who is technically adept enough to know that the desktop is really just a
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.640]  folder in your home folder, you know
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:05.800]  There's other people who if they logged in and they saw nothing but apps they would think oh my god
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:10.760]  Home Mac files on my desktop are gone. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, people would freak out
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:16.040]  I'm sure I don't know. I can't help but think that that might be the only thing that's keeping them from doing it
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:19.640]  I don't know. Yeah, that'll be interesting to see
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:26.200]  If anything switches more towards that or sort of moves in that direction or if they somehow split the difference in the future
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:33.640]  Do you save files to your desktop? Is your desktop clean or is it or is it messy my desktop right now has let's see
[1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:39.560]  Seven things on it and it's temporary things. I tend not to leave them there for too long
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.560]  It's sort of something like oh, I need to
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:44.520]  Follow up on this thing and I'm gonna leave it on my desktop
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.080]  But yeah, I sort of go through and clean things up
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:53.560]  Now and again, and I don't think yeah nothing here is terribly old
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  But yeah, so it's not it's not perfectly clean
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:02.360]  But it's not littered with with things either and it's all all things of sort of a temporary nature that I don't
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:06.120]  Like things like if they were all deleted right now like it wouldn't be a big deal at all
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:12.200]  Yeah, I was about to say that I keep a very neat desktop and I looked and I had to open a window to get the count
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:15.400]  I have 25 items on my desktop, so it's not needed. Oh, that's a mess
[1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:20.840]  But I do the same thing though where it's I think everything is pretty recent
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:27.640]  I'm looking at the dates. All right, I'm sorting by date and the oldest thing is from October 15th. So
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.640]  It's everything is from the last month and I do and then like I'll get in like it's like
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:41.000]  My physical office my real world this the room that I'm in as I record this right now is a mess. It's like Andy Rooney's office
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:44.280]  It's just a thoughtful of papers and books and boxes and stuff
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:50.440]  But I do I keep a neat computer and I once a month or so. I just like get everything off my desktop
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:54.920]  Yeah, right exactly. Me too. I just sort of got there and clean up and
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:59.400]  Yeah, this is bugs me after a while having too much stuff there
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.320]  Yeah, it's like I feel like if my office is a mess at least my computer can be neat
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:10.120]  And it's so much it seems so much easier to clean up your desktop
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:13.320]  Than it is to clean like your a room. So I do
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.480]  But it always blows me away when there's when I see people who have like
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:24.680]  Seriously like a hundred two hundred things on their desktop like everything that they've ever done
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:35.400]  Yeah, yeah, the triggers like my OCD
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:39.240]  I noticed though. I didn't notice that
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:42.520]  So Jonas is 10 and he's
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:51.000]  Starting to use a Mac way more than he used to he used to really just use like I was devices because he has like homework and stuff like that
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:55.640]  And without me ever like I never really like
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:00.440]  Never really sat down and showed him like here's how to use a Mac
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:07.320]  It was just let him figure it out on his own. He just naturally saves files to his desktop
[1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:09.560]  All of his files around stuff
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:13.880]  Interesting notes and stuff like that like plans for Minecraft and things like that
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:19.960]  Nice so I thought that was pretty interesting because I kind of wondered whether that was like an old-school
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:24.360]  Mac have it like from the old days that people have carried over or you know
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:27.040]  Did like would somebody like him who's you know?
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:32.160]  really you know really only started using a Mac in the last year or two would they
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:39.120]  Would they naturally do that and he does he does save stuff to just naturally just saves files to his desktop
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:45.120]  I don't know why that is yeah, it's gonna be surprising. Yeah, yeah instead of I mean because I was I'm just thinking like if you
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:49.040]  Are looking at it for the first time and you get a saved dialogue for the first time
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:51.840]  You know, there's a default
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:58.160]  Director in the sidebar called documents. So I would imagine that by default people would save things to their documents folder
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:00.160]  But now I guess not
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:05.280]  Well, I don't know. I'm so habituated. I'm not sure like it's hard to be objective about it
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:10.480]  I wonder if it's because the desktop is like the one place where
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:12.720]  I know that you can you know
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:18.160]  You can change the view options for any window in the finder to you know list or column or icon view
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:24.480]  Yeah, but it's the one place that's always icon view and you can arrange things spatially and say
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:30.080]  I've got this file and I want it over here on the left and it's gonna be on the left and you drag it over there
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:36.240]  And it stays there as opposed to being a list. That's my that's my hunch as well. It does it, but I haven't I haven't asked him
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:39.200]  Interesting. Yeah
[1:19:40.880 --> 1:19:44.560]  Uh, let me take another break here and thank
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:49.040]  Our third sponsor of the show. It's our good friends at igloo
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:52.400]  igloo is the internet that
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:58.560]  Doesn't suck that's my slogan for them. They call themselves the internet that you'll actually like
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:07.200]  Intra nets are typically ugly they're badly designed and the people on your team your company
[1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:13.680]  They typically wind up avoiding them and just email each other back and forth and send file attachments and they just use email for everything
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:15.680]  Uh
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:21.840]  igloo is totally different. It's the internet. You'll actually like and you get all sorts of cool features. They have
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:24.720]  Twitter like
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:31.920]  Microblog so imagine like a version of Twitter that was just for your team internal totally private just for your your team
[1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:42.640]  They have that they have file sharing you can put comments on everything and the design of the internet of your igloo
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:49.680]  Uh, can match your brand and it matches across all devices because all of their templates are
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:57.600]  Responsive so everything looks good on iPads. It looks good on your phone. It looks good on your retina 5k Mac
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:06.000]  Easy to use easy to set up and it requires no technical expertise at all to set it up
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:09.520]  They have a sandwich video
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:15.840]  Uh, for those of you who don't know that's Adam Lisa Gore's company a funny funny video that shows exactly
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:20.560]  What's different about igloo compared to everything else and other types of intranets
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:25.920]  Go to their website and check it out and you can see this cool video
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:32.880]  And here's the best part igloo is free to use for up to 10 people
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:35.520]  Not for a month just in perpetuity
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.520]  So if your team is 10 or fewer people you can sign up for igloo
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:45.840]  And just use it and you'll never own them a nickel you just use it if your team is bigger than 10 people
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:50.120]  You can try it for free no credit card
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:56.920]  Just sign up try it and have 10 people use it to test it and see if it everything I say about it is true and
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:03.440]  Then once you decide to use it you pay it's really really low price per user after 10 people
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:08.640]  Um, I don't even know how that's possible though that if for up to 10 people, you know
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:12.160]  Just use it for free. So if you're curious at all
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:17.680]  Why not try it? Why not check it out because it's free just go sign up and try it. It's free
[1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:23.440]  Really really cool. Here's where you go. Go to www dot igloo
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  software dot com
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:34.600]  slash the talk show igloo software dot com slash the talk show and they'll know you came from here. So my thanks to igloo
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:39.680]  The other week I
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:42.680]  I had Merlin Merlin man on the show and
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:50.400]  This is what we call follow up. I guess we're supposed to do this at the beginning of a podcast, but I forgot I have a note here
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:56.040]  We were talking about roman numerals and what a pain in the acid is with the Super Bowl because it's like
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:57.320]  exact sex
[1:22:57.320 --> 1:22:58.800]  V I
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:02.440]  something something and you never know what Super Bowl it is and I
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:04.640]  said
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:10.640]  That when they had Super Bowl 50 which would be Super Bowl L that they should have that's when they should have
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:22.680]  Dropped the roman numerals stick and just gone with them. Yeah. Well, it turns it turns out Super Bowl 50 hasn't happened yet
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:25.440]  It's next year next year is Super Bowl 50. It's gonna be in San Francisco and
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:30.160]  They've already announced that that's exactly what they're going to do
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:35.080]  They're gonna drop the roman numerals stick and it's just Super Bowl 5-0 Super Bowl 50
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:36.880]  Nice
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:45.960]  So nice because I think that's so much better and not nice because I spent like five minutes on the podcast two weeks ago
[1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:51.880]  Saying complaining that's what they they should have done a couple years ago when Super Bowl 50 happened, but it hasn't happened
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:58.200]  So let me get that out there because I keep getting email from people saying dude Super Bowl 50 is next year
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:00.200]  And they're doing exactly what you said
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:03.600]  I can't take any credit for it though because they asked it well before the show
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:08.920]  So the got that out there. All right. Here's a question for him
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.440]  With the
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:19.240]  Watch kit SDK that Apple released this week Apple included what they called
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:23.320]  Design resources something like that the thing that they've come with the font
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.320]  But it also came with a bunch of
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.040]  PSD files Photoshop files for
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:37.760]  Mm-hmm both software layouts and things like it's like a typographic grid that shows you all of the type sizes
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:45.440]  And it's not specified by like a number like saying oh give me 16 point font
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:50.320]  It's like give me caption give me headline give me yeah, oh, right. Yeah
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:57.200]  Mm-hmm. They have all of those sort of styles established and they're they're really they might need a stick with their established styles
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:07.960]  Right, well, the idea being right and using those styles means that you don't have to worry about the difference in physical size between the 38 millimeter watch
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:13.200]  Yes exactly and right and presumably maybe next year or two years from now
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:19.360]  Maybe there'll be a 44 millimeter watch and maybe there will be a 36 millimeter one and your your stuff will all just work
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.360]  Because it's all
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:23.360]  Relative sizes and stuff like that
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:26.880]  Which I think is probably the way to go. I think it's you know, yeah
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:29.680]  I think it definitely is
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:32.840]  Clever and yeah, that's smart way to set it up from the outset
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:37.800]  Here's my question. My question is I thought it was so interesting that they shipped all these things as
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:39.560]  PSD files
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:43.680]  Do you do you as a designer? Do you do you do a lot of your work in Photoshop?
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:44.960]  Oh, yes
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:49.480]  Every yeah, that's that's mostly what I use eight hours a day is fetish up
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:57.800]  Yeah, there just really isn't anything that's like more versatile or better for doing what I do not yet anyway
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.480]  So yeah, I spent I spent a lot of time in Photoshop. I thought that was so interesting
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:09.760]  It was sort of to me like a concession that Photoshop is the de facto standard UI design tool
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:15.880]  Right, yeah, I think it definitely is. I mean, I think it's sort of industry standard, but it's interesting
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:19.680]  I mean, it's funny that but they do that with the typefaces because
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:28.440]  Just the way that Photoshop renders text is terrible. I mean, especially compared to like the way that just oh, I stand renders
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.960]  Plants like it's I don't know you have these different, you know, like you can you can change
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:37.800]  the display of a typeface from like
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:41.160]  crisp to strong to smooth, you know
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:44.720]  So and it like changes things a little bit and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:51.360]  And everything just reads so much more clearly if it's if it's rendered programmatically rather than through Photoshop and then
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:53.720]  in a PSD
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:57.160]  Yeah, with work working on on Vesper with
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.320]  Whiskus he does everything and he's you know a total Photoshop die hard like again like
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:06.360]  Doing where he's eight hours a day in Photoshop
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:11.720]  And I have to always refrain from complaining about the way type looks because I know that
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:14.280]  It's not really same like that
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:21.760]  Yeah, it's not the same rendering path. It's like all text is effectively like four placement only like here's how much space
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.040]  It will take up wait until the app is actually an app and then bitch about the type
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:29.000]  Right, have you heard of this app sketch?
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:33.160]  Um, I don't know
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:37.960]  That's the other app when I when I I Twitter that
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:45.240]  Pointing out that you know that Apple shipped all these things as Photoshop things in that. It's the de facto standard
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:51.080]  And I got all these people saying that no everybody's using sketch these days to do
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:57.080]  Interesting to do UI design and it looks like a cool app. I've never used it
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:01.000]  But yeah, I'm looking at it now on the website and I think it looks familiar
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.720]  I think I've like someone has linked to it before and I just haven't really given it at the time of day yet
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.160]  But yeah, it's something good to check out for sure, but you know, I
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:12.040]  Often look into other like
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:17.160]  UI design prototyping tools things like that and sometimes I use them like supplementally, but
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:22.120]  Yeah, I don't know. I just still like live in Photoshop for for most of the time
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.080]  No, and and you have like super like complex like layers
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.320]  and yeah, well just yeah tons and tons of groups that I turn off and on for a different
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:37.080]  You know views within and different states within a view, so
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:39.880]  Yeah, it gets it gets pretty complicated
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:41.800]  It's like one of my favorite things
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:47.400]  I don't really use Photoshop anymore personally, but I like to watch somebody who's really good at Photoshop use Photoshop
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:53.640]  And then they click click through and they have all these groups and like all of a sudden what you're looking at on screen is like totally different
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:55.640]  And it's like well, how'd you do that?
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.080]  Lovely
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:03.640]  Krista Morgan. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming back. It has been too long. I think so much for having me. Yeah, it's fantastic
