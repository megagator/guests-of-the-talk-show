[00:00.000 --> 00:06.320]  Yes, but can you hear me? Yes, I can't hear you. Yeah, and I can hear us but it's very strange. I don't know
[00:07.200 --> 00:13.360]  I seriously I spent 15 minutes and made like probably 12 recordings to make sure that everything was fine
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.960]  I'm telling you and I re I include
[00:17.480 --> 00:23.340]  Most I half the time we include this stuff in the show like me having problems with Skype. I
[00:23.340 --> 00:29.980]  I am like like mr. Magoo with Skype. I like nothing can possibly
[00:30.780 --> 00:35.900]  Know I never want to have a podcast where it actually just plain works. It's always
[00:36.900 --> 00:38.900]  well, the horrible thing is that I
[00:39.060 --> 00:43.280]  Work on audio recording apps like this is what I do every day
[00:43.860 --> 00:50.400]  Every day and somehow it just it just screws up every time that I actually I mean when I test things, it's fine
[00:50.400 --> 00:53.580]  It's always fine. And I said, you know, sometimes I run kind of long tests. I'm like, alright
[00:53.580 --> 00:56.380]  Alright, things are going well and then no actually using them
[00:56.940 --> 01:00.380]  Something always breaks. It's it has to be Skype's fault. It can't be any of our
[01:01.020 --> 01:05.760]  Perfects perfectly usable software, of course, which always functions
[01:06.260 --> 01:10.460]  At a hundred percent so you anyway Krista Murgen you sound great. Oh
[01:11.220 --> 01:15.060]  Great. Thanks. You do as well. Thank you. I have so much to talk about
[01:15.060 --> 01:17.820]  I am so excited because the watch stuff came out and
[01:17.820 --> 01:19.940]  Yes, are you excited about the watch?
[01:20.820 --> 01:27.320]  I'm excited about the watch and also, um, I don't know this this happens sort of with I feel like every time
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.860]  There's either a big update to an Apple product or a brand new Apple product music
[01:32.140 --> 01:36.620]  Well, though I really need that and then of course, I know the day that it comes out
[01:36.620 --> 01:39.220]  I'm gonna be like, oh god, give this give me this thing
[01:39.700 --> 01:43.140]  So I'm excited about it, but also a little like I don't know
[01:43.140 --> 01:47.740]  I'm excited because I think it's kind of cool. But I also think that it is
[01:48.980 --> 01:50.980]  it's this weird mix of
[01:52.060 --> 01:56.240]  Apple being way ahead of where they've ever been with a new product before
[01:57.260 --> 02:00.540]  Combined with that. There's still a lot of mystery around it
[02:01.260 --> 02:05.820]  There is yeah, there's quite a bit of mystery as to what I mean even even with
[02:06.540 --> 02:08.780]  The watch kit out now
[02:08.780 --> 02:15.020]  I feel like there's still mystery about what you'll you'll actually be able to do in this sort of first round before we can build
[02:15.020 --> 02:17.020]  Truly native apps on the on the watch
[02:18.020 --> 02:23.100]  At least for me. Yeah, I mean I I the day that it came out
[02:23.100 --> 02:26.460]  I think I think it was the very day. Maybe it was no, I think it was the same day
[02:26.460 --> 02:32.580]  I was out in San Francisco because I was at the event and they announced the thing and that and I was down in Cupertino
[02:32.580 --> 02:41.300]  Cupertino or not. Yeah for the event and then I came back to San Francisco and I like put my nose together and
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.780]  You know, Michael Lop, right?
[02:43.780 --> 02:48.100]  Ransom Rose and he is in San Francisco. Now. He works there
[02:48.100 --> 02:53.820]  he's at Pinterest and we met and we had a drink and and the first thing that he said to me was that this is
[02:53.820 --> 02:59.500]  Weird because it feels like this is like year three of the watch because there's like two different sizes
[02:59.500 --> 03:06.180]  There's all these different bands like it feels like a third generation Apple product like, okay
[03:06.180 --> 03:10.380]  Now we're gonna give you two sizes and we're gonna give you choices of the styles
[03:10.660 --> 03:15.020]  Whereas the truth right the traditional way of doing an Apple product is here's the one
[03:16.220 --> 03:21.140]  Here's here's the first one and there's one way right and it's very limited and yeah
[03:21.140 --> 03:26.540]  You got it's everybody's gonna have the exact same size and the exact same band and you're gonna like it and that's it
[03:26.540 --> 03:34.180]  right, right, right and it just feels like they've skipped like a year or two and it seems the same way with the SDK like
[03:34.180 --> 03:38.060]  I know that it's not truly native apps yet that word
[03:38.060 --> 03:41.820]  We're just projecting apps from extensions from the iPhone
[03:41.820 --> 03:45.420]  But that we don't but it's so huge compared to like the iPhone SDK
[03:45.420 --> 03:49.100]  We are you know, like when that that took like a year or something, right?
[03:49.100 --> 03:51.220]  And like it was just it was just web apps at first, right?
[03:51.220 --> 03:55.620]  We don't even have the watch yet and yet we can start right thinking about the apps for it
[03:55.620 --> 03:59.420]  Yes, it seems yeah, that's incredible. That is yeah, I know I think yeah
[03:59.420 --> 04:03.060]  That's it's really that really puts it in perspective actually cuz I was kind of like oh well
[04:03.060 --> 04:07.020]  I don't know because it's just an extension and but no that really puts it in perspective because yeah
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.780]  especially when you especially when you compare it with the iPhone launch and
[04:11.100 --> 04:16.900]  I remember Nevin, you know before the SDK was ever even announced and before they announced anything about third-party apps
[04:16.900 --> 04:19.820]  He was like, oh I'm gonna make a web app for him because I bet that's what they'll
[04:20.340 --> 04:24.020]  I bet that's what they'll say at first and then it was and people were just so mad
[04:24.020 --> 04:30.100]  That there wasn't an SDK for a long time. I think what made people mad was at
[04:30.780 --> 04:34.060]  WWDC 2007 and I wrote about this at the time and I
[04:35.220 --> 04:39.360]  But I think what made people mad wasn't that there that they didn't say look
[04:39.540 --> 04:46.060]  We're we're just not ready for it yet. And you know in the future you can write apps, but you can't do it yet
[04:46.060 --> 04:51.880]  We're not ready because everybody would have said we're a little disappointed but we understand but what they did was at WWDC
[04:51.880 --> 04:58.260]  I'm it was Scott for stall and they were like we have a really the and this was the quote-unquote the words sweet solution
[04:58.700 --> 05:01.580]  for all of you who want to write apps for this phone and
[05:02.200 --> 05:04.900]  Everybody got so excited. Everybody was ready to stand up
[05:04.900 --> 05:09.660]  everybody was ready to like storm the stage and then they were like you can write web apps and it was like
[05:13.140 --> 05:19.620]  Yeah, and I called it on during fireball I called it a shit sandwich yes, you know
[05:19.620 --> 05:21.860]  I don't think I've ever told this right. This is funny. So
[05:23.220 --> 05:27.660]  It that was like I guess Monday because it was the first day of WWDC
[05:27.980 --> 05:32.060]  2007 and I called it that a shit sandwich and everybody was disappointed
[05:32.060 --> 05:34.380]  It was because they set us up by calling it a sweet solution
[05:35.700 --> 05:37.140]  and
[05:37.140 --> 05:44.020]  It's still it was only like five years since I'd been writing during fireball and I'd had as like when I I'd started getting
[05:44.140 --> 05:47.340]  press credentials for the keynotes and stuff like that, but I was a
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.540]  a
[05:48.540 --> 05:50.540]  lot less
[05:50.940 --> 05:54.620]  popular than then it during fireballs gotten to this point and
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.660]  Like a day later
[05:57.660 --> 06:04.300]  It was like Tuesday at WWDC and I was riding the escalator and right behind me was Phil Schiller
[06:04.300 --> 06:10.340]  And I'd never spoken to him it face-to-face in my life at that point and I was like, holy shit Phil Schiller
[06:10.780 --> 06:13.460]  And I was like, oh, sorry turned around. I was like
[06:13.460 --> 06:20.300]  And I was you know, it was that weird nerd way where it's like at first you think I should introduce myself and then you think
[06:20.300 --> 06:22.300]  Oh my god. No, I know I should just turn around
[06:23.220 --> 06:24.780]  Be silent and I was like no
[06:24.780 --> 06:30.540]  I should totally the professional thing to do would be to introduce myself because I know he knew my name because I know he'd sent
[06:30.540 --> 06:35.500]  Me email and stuff and I was like, hey, I'm John Gruber and he was like, oh nice to meet you
[06:35.500 --> 06:39.660]  And then it the first thing he said to me he goes nice to meet you and he goes I got to tell you
[06:39.660 --> 06:41.660]  I don't think that's a shit sandwich
[06:41.660 --> 06:43.260]  I
[06:43.260 --> 06:47.100]  Mean, that's awesome. I was so totally blown away because I was like
[06:47.880 --> 06:50.980]  No fucking way. He read my shit on the day that I wrote it
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.020]  Yeah on the raid exactly Phil Schiller stays up late and read your blog
[06:55.020 --> 07:01.320]  And then we got in like kind of an argument about like a very very friendly cordial argument about whether or not
[07:01.820 --> 07:05.260]  Writing web apps for the iPhone was just shit Sam. Right? It's right
[07:05.260 --> 07:12.940]  Oh, that's really cool. That's a fun story. But anyway, we don't have to write shit sandwiches for the for the Apple watch, right?
[07:12.940 --> 07:14.940]  No, yeah, it's actually pretty
[07:15.580 --> 07:22.020]  Pretty awesome and so and so soon too. I mean, I remember um with when I was watching the the Apple watch keynote
[07:22.020 --> 07:26.820]  I was like wait in November. That seems I mean, yeah just in comparison. I mean, it just seems
[07:28.020 --> 07:33.720]  Really fast and it's like they were they were just really thinking about this from from the beginning about how
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.420]  How they were gonna get third-party developers like involved like right away, which is really cool
[07:39.140 --> 07:41.140]  Really nice to see. Yeah, I
[07:41.380 --> 07:44.780]  Really think that it shows that it's like, you know
[07:44.780 --> 07:48.620]  Cuz I know they said when they unveiled it in September that they've been working on it for three years
[07:48.620 --> 07:50.620]  But it makes me think that they've been
[07:51.240 --> 07:56.600]  Thinking about stuff like third-party apps for three years, too. Oh, yeah, definitely
[07:57.500 --> 07:58.700]  Yeah
[07:58.700 --> 08:04.260]  Well, I'm guessing yeah that they well the iOS app store was just I mean that's just sort of changed, you know
[08:04.260 --> 08:06.260]  Everything and influenced them a lot
[08:06.620 --> 08:11.580]  When building this from the ground up because with the iPhone, you know, they probably they were just working so hard to get that
[08:12.220 --> 08:18.340]  First initial product off the ground like they you know, they had ideas probably for third-party developer stuff
[08:18.340 --> 08:20.340]  But not at the outset
[08:21.020 --> 08:25.980]  Anyway, not for not for a while. And so yeah, it's pretty cool that they could envision that
[08:25.980 --> 08:31.140]  You know from from the beginning with this and then it makes me wonder like well, what's going on with the Apple TV?
[08:33.940 --> 08:35.940]  Anyway, that's it. That's a very different
[08:36.140 --> 08:42.380]  Story, but it's funny. It is funny though, because it's you know what it's funny though, because it's
[08:42.900 --> 08:48.660]  That those are the two things that everybody thinks are next. Well, I mean obviously the watch is definitely next they've announced it
[08:48.660 --> 08:53.160]  But you know all year long people have been thinking, you know, there's been rumors that they're gonna do a watch
[08:53.160 --> 08:54.840]  But
[08:54.840 --> 08:56.840]  it's funny because
[08:57.040 --> 09:02.080]  TV and the watch are sort of the extremes of
[09:02.800 --> 09:04.800]  computing in terms of being like
[09:05.560 --> 09:12.240]  And Apple keeps using this word intimate that the watch is the most intimate thing they've ever made intimate intimate intimate
[09:12.240 --> 09:18.920]  They keep using it, but it's true it I don't think that it's I don't think that it's like marketing hype
[09:18.920 --> 09:23.280]  I think I mean and whether the watch is gonna be that's to be personal
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.480]  Yeah, because it's so close to you. It's on your skin all the time, you know, and I
[09:30.560 --> 09:34.880]  And and the TV is the opposite it is the least
[09:35.520 --> 09:37.360]  intimate computing
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.280]  Destination that they could possibly make because you sit far away from it
[09:41.280 --> 09:46.560]  You know, you're you know, you you instead of measuring it in inches. You're passively watch things
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.920]  Yeah, right and famously you're you know, it's a passive device that you kind of you watch it when you tune out
[09:52.920 --> 09:55.880]  You know your mind, you know kind of blanks when you're watching TV
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.480]  And so it's kind of funny that those are the two things interesting
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.520]  I don't know and I wonder though if there's like a
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.560]  design connection between them though because it does seem though that overall their design aesthetic is sort of
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  zeroing in on a
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.040]  sort of style
[10:15.040 --> 10:21.920]  yeah, that's a good point and I wonder how that could be that something is as different as a watch and a TV if they
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.920]  Could share a certain
[10:24.520 --> 10:32.040]  Aesthetic, I don't know. Oh sure. Well, yeah, I would love I mean so the the Apple TV finally got a bit of a UI refresh
[10:32.040 --> 10:35.840]  But it's not I mean, it's just sort of like a new coat of paint. It's not for me
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.440]  I mean, it's just not a big it's not a huge update
[10:38.440 --> 10:44.000]  It just sort of like got rid of the the glossiness and it's and it's more in line with them like iOS 7 and 8
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  and with Yosemite, but
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.360]  Yeah, it would be really cool if it if it borrowed from the the watches aesthetic
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.560]  I really I mean so far from screenshots and from the videos I've seen of the watch. It looks beautiful. I
[10:59.120 --> 11:01.320]  Don't know and even just things like controlling
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.840]  Apple TV with with the with a watch app because the iOS app that controls Apple TV is terrible
[11:07.880 --> 11:11.320]  I mean, that's one one little bridge. But like yeah if the UI of
[11:11.320 --> 11:14.960]  Of the TV could somehow be influenced by the watch. That would be great
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.680]  But I also just see I don't know iOS apps on on the TV would be amazing
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.840]  I'm just games and all kinds of that. Do you so you have an Apple TV? I do. Yeah, I
[11:25.560 --> 11:28.600]  every time I mention being frustrated by the
[11:29.320 --> 11:35.400]  remote the physical remote that comes with oh god, and I oh I hate that it's infrared because it's like
[11:35.920 --> 11:39.600]  like our TiVo, I think we're like two generations in with
[11:39.600 --> 11:40.640]  a
[11:40.640 --> 11:47.200]  Bluetooth TiVo remote so you don't have to point the remote at anything and you get used to that you get used to not
[11:47.200 --> 11:53.840]  Having to point it and the stupid Apple TV remote and and and I always think like I'll bet it's the battery
[11:53.840 --> 11:56.780]  I'll bet the battery is weak. And that's why I can't do it and I'll buy a new
[11:57.560 --> 12:00.640]  Stupid little you know, whatever that battery is
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.560]  I'll buy a new one put it in and it's exactly the same and it's not the battery. It just sucks
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.760]  Oh, it's just finicky. Yeah, that thing is just so and it's I mean, it's only like
[12:11.280 --> 12:18.120]  Slightly better than the horrible plastic one that that used to come with the Apple TV and with and with Mac books like years ago
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.120]  Oh the white one, right, right, and it's just yeah, remember? Yeah
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.120]  yeah, just it's no good and we have a Roku 3 as well and
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.040]  You know, it's about the same price
[12:28.040 --> 12:30.040]  I think is the Apple TV and it just
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.240]  like the the interface is is ugly, but it just does so much more and it just makes me kind of sad because the the
[12:35.560 --> 12:41.920]  Controller is also like a game controller and you can plug headphones into it and it's it's not you know, sleek and sophisticated
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.600]  It's sort of chunky and sort of like a friendly design, but it's so much better like as an actual
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.140]  Remote control. It's I don't know kind of makes me sad every time I bring this up
[12:52.400 --> 12:58.080]  Especially on the show and I know there's people who who are listening right now and they're already firing up their email
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.480]  They're already writing the email to me telling me this and I'm telling you right now. Stop. Don't send me the email
[13:02.560 --> 13:07.120]  They're gonna say oh, but you use the app for the iPhone the iPhone
[13:07.120 --> 13:09.860]  Oh the app is terrible. The app is worse
[13:10.380 --> 13:15.680]  The app is worse for everything except typing passwords, right? Oh, yeah, exactly
[13:15.680 --> 13:20.920]  Well, that's you know, assuming that the the app will connect with the Apple TV, which sometimes mine still doesn't
[13:20.920 --> 13:27.280]  It'll just be like can't find Apple TV. And so it's like okay by the time that the app launches and connects to Apple TV
[13:27.280 --> 13:30.760]  I could have used a terrible little remote to do whatever it was. I needed to do
[13:32.200 --> 13:34.680]  Yeah, it's just not I don't know. It's just a stinker
[13:35.520 --> 13:37.780]  it's
[13:37.780 --> 13:39.780]  No to me though, it's it's
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.920]  It's them to me the the single biggest deal with Apple TV is the remote, honestly
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.160]  I don't care if they don't I would love it if they added apps. I'd love it if they had an SDK
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.520]  I don't but if they came out with the exact same looking and and
[13:55.520 --> 13:57.240]  and logical interface
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.040]  But just had like a Bluetooth remote that just always work like every time it just worked
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.840]  Yeah, every time I hit up it goes up and every time I hit down it goes down instead of having to
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.140]  Point the damn thing. I would be so much happier with it
[14:13.220 --> 14:15.220]  Yeah
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.080]  So anyway
[14:17.080 --> 14:23.920]  I do think I think that the watch could be that could be a huge deal like a watch thing that knows
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.240]  like I and I think this is possible that it could know like
[14:29.200 --> 14:32.620]  Not just that you're in the same house like on the same Wi-Fi network
[14:32.620 --> 14:35.440]  But if you're close enough that you could be watching Apple TV
[14:35.840 --> 14:42.960]  You know so that it would know and if there's something playing then the watch could like have the playback controls
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.960]  Automatically that would be so that'd be so great. Oh, that would be such. Yeah, it would be a game changer
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.160]  I know that that's a cliche. Yeah, I mean it would just be oh
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.200]  It would and it's um. I mean it's not far-fetched at all
[14:56.200 --> 14:58.480]  I mean it seems like that would be a pretty straightforward
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.780]  App for them to make even I mean for Apple to release natively on the on the watch would be great
[15:05.120 --> 15:08.740]  So here's hoping well. I I think Tim Cook said that it
[15:08.740 --> 15:10.640]  I don't know if it was on the Charlie Rose interview
[15:10.640 --> 15:16.660]  But one of the interviews he said like you know after they announced the watch and now that he's out and about wearing the watch
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.000]  He's even said that one of the things he does with it is control his Apple TV
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.360]  Oh
[15:22.360 --> 15:23.760]  Yes, oh, I didn't yeah
[15:23.760 --> 15:29.520]  I missed him so it's definitely I mean whether they're going to ship that in the initial version or not
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.480]  But you know they're obviously have it working. You know like as a beta. It's already working
[15:34.480 --> 15:42.560]  Oh good, and I can't help but think that it's the potential is there for it to be totally it might require a brand-new Apple
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.640]  TV, but if it's still only 99 bucks. It's only 99 bucks so so what buy a new Apple TV right yeah
[15:47.640 --> 15:49.640]  Yeah, but if it could be like
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.240]  You know I know that you're on your stupid couch watching your stupid TV so here
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.600]  Here's the playback controls for Apple TV pause, and then you can just tap your wrist to pause it and get up
[16:00.600 --> 16:02.600]  And you know refresh your beverage or whatever
[16:03.240 --> 16:05.240]  It would be so great. Yeah
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.600]  Yeah, do you guys make popcorn do you make popcorn at home? Oh? Yeah? I'd love popcorn
[16:10.080 --> 16:15.800]  Nevin does not like it because the kernel stuff stick in his teeth, but I'm a big popcorn fan
[16:15.800 --> 16:19.180]  Can I he is you know he has he's a very particular man?
[16:21.360 --> 16:23.360]  Can I tell you that I'm
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.800]  41 years old and I have only like three months ago my mother-in-law Amy's mom actually gave us this tip
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.560]  And it is like the greatest tip ever it made me think of it because we're I
[16:33.840 --> 16:37.000]  Did the idea of being lazy and just watching movies on the couch?
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.760]  Do you know this to use coconut oil when you cook your popcorn oh?
[16:42.760 --> 16:49.200]  No, oh my god. It is the secret to like what like movie theater popcorn tastes like oh
[16:50.960 --> 16:56.440]  Interesting so okay, it is that would make sense yeah, because I know that movie theater popcorn is usually vegan
[16:56.440 --> 17:02.880]  So it's maybe that's what they know it's you don't need anything, and you don't need anything else all you need is plain popcorn like just
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.980]  Whatever you know you don't have to buy any special popcorn you buy coconut oil and just salt and you
[17:09.980 --> 17:16.600]  Put and coconut oil is weird, and you buy it and anybody listening who follows this tip. I'm telling you. It's genius
[17:18.180 --> 17:24.100]  Nobody told me that's what she said she said just buy coconut oil and I went to the supermarket and I look and coconut oil
[17:24.100 --> 17:26.100]  is
[17:26.100 --> 17:28.660]  It has a melting point of 76 degrees
[17:29.380 --> 17:33.500]  So it's gonna be solid yeah, so it's very. It's like congealed. Yeah, it's congealed
[17:33.500 --> 17:38.060]  It's only it's more like it's more like butter like it's something you don't pour it you see it
[17:38.060 --> 17:45.020]  It's like a it's like a yeah congealed is the perfect word. That's normal. It's exactly right you put like two
[17:45.500 --> 17:51.680]  Teaspoons of it in your pan, and then you put the popcorn in and it it makes popcorn amazing
[17:52.620 --> 17:58.500]  It's it's exactly it is the secret to movie theater like good movie theater popcorn
[18:00.780 --> 18:02.780]  No idea where that aside came from
[18:02.900 --> 18:07.100]  But it's good. It's it's cooking with John Gruber. Yeah, exactly. That's there's like three things
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.620]  I know how to cook and one of them is popcorn and everything. I know how to cook is equally simple
[18:11.820 --> 18:16.740]  I know how to make coffee. I know how to cook popcorn right and it's just you know
[18:16.740 --> 18:22.220]  That's important in the same way that coffee is just ground-up coffee beans, and then you pour hot water on top of it
[18:22.620 --> 18:24.380]  cooking popcorn is
[18:24.380 --> 18:30.660]  Put coconut oil in a pan and heat it at medium and then pour popcorn in and salt
[18:31.300 --> 18:33.300]  so that's the extent of my
[18:33.300 --> 18:35.300]  Ah
[18:35.300 --> 18:38.020]  Cooking I'm not very talented in the kitchen
[18:38.980 --> 18:42.580]  Now we just have to find a way to remove all of the the little kernel bits
[18:42.740 --> 18:49.660]  So, uh, you know, I did something I saw something at Whole Foods where there I didn't I didn't buy it because it's it's like
[18:49.660 --> 18:55.260]  Everything at Whole Foods where it's like it's so expensive. I was like, I don't know about this. There's like a I
[18:55.780 --> 18:57.340]  Forget the name. I don't know the name of it
[18:57.340 --> 19:00.100]  But then if you look at where they sell the unpopped popcorn
[19:00.100 --> 19:06.260]  they they had a they had a special popcorn and it would they were they were indeed very tiny kernels and
[19:06.620 --> 19:12.780]  It's called like something something little popcorn and it advertises as doesn't get stuck in your teeth
[19:13.380 --> 19:19.860]  That's that's something about something about this special brand of popcorn, which is slightly more it's not like super expensive
[19:19.860 --> 19:21.860]  But it's slightly more expensive than regular popcorn
[19:23.140 --> 19:28.840]  That when it pops there is no nothing is left of the shell the entire shell. I don't know. Oh, yeah
[19:28.840 --> 19:31.920]  Just have to try it. So you may have to get that for Nevin
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.320]  Yeah, I think I will cuz I I really think he would enjoy popcorn were it not for that
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.280]  See, I would have thought that he was into popcorn, but that it was that he he put like
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.120]  Crazy flavorings on the popcorn. Oh sure
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.680]  No, I'm sure that he would really get into that like making, you know, like masala popcorn or something
[19:47.680 --> 19:51.780]  You know really interesting but um, he's just yeah, you just can't abide that
[19:51.780 --> 19:57.820]  A little kernel sticking his teeth. It's too much. Yeah, I can kind of hear that
[19:59.820 --> 20:04.580]  Everything has a downside though. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it doesn't bother me. It doesn't stop me
[20:05.500 --> 20:06.140]  All right
[20:06.140 --> 20:13.140]  Let's take a break and I will thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at hover you ever heard of hover
[20:14.180 --> 20:18.860]  hover I have heard of hover hover hover hover hover is
[20:18.860 --> 20:26.020]  The best I say this with no qualifications the best domain name registrar on the internet
[20:26.020 --> 20:29.340]  And they've been around forever. They've been around, you know, I don't know 20 years
[20:31.380 --> 20:38.180]  They're the best and it's a such a scammy business registering domains everybody else is it's all
[20:39.860 --> 20:44.500]  Crazy ads when you go to get a domain name and then after you registered the domain
[20:44.500 --> 20:51.660]  there's all these upsells on things like getting privacy for your personal information on the domain and
[20:52.460 --> 20:54.460]  paying extra to
[20:54.820 --> 20:59.500]  Secure the domain and etc. Etc. Etc. Hover gets rid of all that nonsense
[20:59.940 --> 21:04.200]  You pay one price and it's great. It's not the lowest price. That's for sure
[21:05.700 --> 21:10.820]  It's the fairest price though, and the prices are low. They're totally totally competitive
[21:10.820 --> 21:17.060]  They're very very reasonable and that's it. There's no upsell and everything is secure and you get great
[21:17.660 --> 21:19.660]  24-hour tech support
[21:19.980 --> 21:26.380]  And they have this amazing thing. I say it every time I do the sponsor read forever, but it is truly amazing
[21:26.820 --> 21:28.180]  which is
[21:28.180 --> 21:30.020]  valet domain
[21:30.020 --> 21:34.700]  Transfer so you sign up for hover you open your account and now you're a paying hover customer
[21:34.700 --> 21:41.060]  You can go to them and say look I've got all these other domains that I've registered in the last 15 years
[21:41.100 --> 21:44.140]  And some of them are over here and some of them are over there
[21:44.140 --> 21:45.700]  I want them all in my hover account
[21:45.700 --> 21:50.060]  you just give them your information at your other domain registrars and
[21:50.460 --> 21:55.220]  They go and move everything over and they switch the DNS and it's great
[21:55.220 --> 22:01.160]  Everything just happens automatically and they're they're like experts on this they do this the people who do the domain
[22:01.160 --> 22:06.720]  Transfers, that's all they do is they're like DNS experts. So they're not going to screw it up
[22:06.720 --> 22:09.000]  They're gonna do everything right and next thing
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.680]  you know all of your domains are in your hover account and they're all transferred and all the DNS is updated and
[22:16.680 --> 22:22.000]  No service is interrupted. It's an amazing thing. It sounds too good to be true. It sounds like something
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.840]  Well, you'd have to pay X amount of dollars per domain to do it
[22:25.840 --> 22:31.980]  No, you sign up for hover. You have a hover account if you have a hundred domains at some other shitty domain registrar
[22:32.040 --> 22:38.120]  Just give them your information and they'll move all hundred of them over to your hundred over to your hover account free of charge
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.720]  It's just part of being a hover customer
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.520]  super super great
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.980]  So if you want to register a domain name, or if you have domain names already
[22:49.200 --> 22:53.360]  But it's at some shitty registrar and you want to move them to someplace. That's awesome
[22:53.360 --> 22:59.800]  Move them to hover go to hover comm slash the talk show hover comm slash to the talk show
[22:59.800 --> 23:04.600]  And when you sign up, here's the here's the coupon code
[23:04.600 --> 23:11.320]  They give me one a new one for every episode. This episode's code is vodka vo d ka vodka

[23:15.080 --> 23:20.800]  so go to hover comm slash the talk show and when you sign up use the coupon vodka and
[23:20.800 --> 23:24.920]  And you'll save 10% so my thanks to hover nicely
[23:24.920 --> 23:29.480]  So here's the thing. I've been obsessed most obsessed with with the watch is the font
[23:30.440 --> 23:35.880]  Sanford now we have it. Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. Now. We have a name for it, San Francisco. So yeah, you like it
[23:37.040 --> 23:39.360]  It's pretty I really like it
[23:39.360 --> 23:40.720]  I heard from somebody
[23:40.720 --> 23:47.360]  Inside Apple a couple after it was announced and before they gave the name and I was asking like does anybody know what the name?
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.000]  Is somebody told me internally they were referring to it as?
[23:51.560 --> 23:53.560]  din vedica
[23:53.600 --> 24:00.440]  Which it makes me laugh and I think it's so true because it feels like two-thirds Helvetica one-third
[24:00.840 --> 24:05.760]  din which is for anybody who doesn't everybody knows Helvetica, but din is
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.920]  Just capital letters din. I don't even know what it stands for but it's like a font from Germany. It's like a I
[24:12.920 --> 24:20.000]  Think it would I think I think I could be making this up but I think it was created as sort of like a
[24:20.960 --> 24:24.760]  Font for signage in Germany at some point
[24:25.440 --> 24:28.880]  And it really that's what that's what San Francisco looks like
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.400]  It looks like, you know, two-thirds Helvetica one-third din and I think it's a very very very pleasant. Mm-hmm
[24:35.680 --> 24:37.840]  it's a really nice sands and
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.040]  I I've been I've been wondering if Apple would make its own it Sammy just seems so natural that it did
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.520]  That Apple would create its very own, you know, specialized answer
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.440]  and
[24:49.440 --> 24:51.960]  Yeah, it's it's beautiful. Yeah, I think
[24:52.760 --> 24:54.760]  one of the things that's so interesting is
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.480]  So Microsoft has their own UI font seg seg go sing we segue
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.920]  I don't know how you pronounce it. But yeah, it looks like fruit agar, but it's you know, it's what they've used for
[25:06.920 --> 25:09.720]  Metro and all of the modern
[25:10.360 --> 25:12.360]  versions of
[25:12.800 --> 25:14.800]  Windows and
[25:15.400 --> 25:20.480]  Google has Roboto which is their font for Android and they use it
[25:20.880 --> 25:24.960]  They use it in their iOS apps too. It's like Google's UI font
[25:25.120 --> 25:33.240]  so Microsoft and Google have their own custom fonts for user interfaces and Apple which is the most to me clearly the most
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.280]  design oriented of the major tech corporations has used
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.080]  Helvetica which is a great font, but it's funny. It's always struck me as a little I don't know ironic that
[25:44.080 --> 25:46.360]  They don't have their own custom font because they're so
[25:47.040 --> 25:54.520]  Design focused and yeah, so it's it's been a long time coming in and I'm happy that to see it is happening
[25:55.360 --> 25:57.360]  It's interesting to me that it
[25:57.360 --> 26:05.520]  That the the the kit that you download or the design over the calm design resources has two versions of San Francisco
[26:06.800 --> 26:08.800]  display and text which is
[26:09.520 --> 26:11.520]  it a lot of
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.560]  Designing fonts, you know fonts you use for graphic design come with display and text
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.200]  variants where the smaller sizes are called text and then at
[26:20.200 --> 26:27.240]  Intended for larger sizes you call it display and it changes the kerning it changes some of the letter shapes. I
[26:27.760 --> 26:31.600]  Don't know of any UI font that's had that distinction before, right?
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.840]  Yeah, I don't know. Um, I'm trying to think did you see there's a thing at least not notice
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.840]  The well somebody has a github project where you can they I don't know what what kind of
[26:43.080 --> 26:46.320]  There's some kind of hack you can do to the font files to say
[26:46.320 --> 26:54.200]  to set certain bits that make it look like the system font and then you can run you through you install this version of San Francisco and
[26:55.400 --> 27:01.800]  Reboot your Mac and Yosemite runs with that as the system font. Oh, right. Yes, I did
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.560]  I did see that. I mean I didn't I just saw it as a someone treated about it
[27:05.560 --> 27:08.120]  I didn't follow the link, but that's a cool idea. I did it
[27:09.480 --> 27:12.560]  Did you and how's it how's it going? I?
[27:12.560 --> 27:20.200]  I ran it for a day and I at first I was very very excited and I liked it and I kind of had that feeling
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.140]  Like back in the day like 20 years ago when I would run like system extensions
[27:25.140 --> 27:27.560]  That would change the look of the windows and stuff like that. Oh
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.540]  Yeah, you know, I totally felt very cool about it
[27:31.540 --> 27:39.040]  And there are certain things that are definitely nicer about it than Helvetica as a UI font, but overall it's like not quite right
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.840]  It's just a little too. I don't know. There's something about it that that
[27:46.360 --> 27:47.920]  Doesn't work
[27:47.920 --> 27:53.160]  You know, okay. It's it's I I know that with the UI version
[27:53.160 --> 28:00.560]  You know the the UI font in in Yosemite that it's not just playing Helvetica. Noia. It's it's like a yeah
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.300]  They've tweaked it, you know to their own
[28:04.400 --> 28:06.400]  yeah, just to
[28:06.400 --> 28:13.140]  Make it better for for Yosemite and in particular in a different sizes make it more legible and the shapes nicer
[28:13.140 --> 28:16.620]  But yeah, so it's like their own version, but it's still you know, Helvetica it
[28:16.620 --> 28:20.100]  Well, it makes me think though that with San Francisco that it makes me appreciate
[28:20.620 --> 28:26.620]  the way that they've sweated the details to make Helvetica Neue a nicer as the Mac system font and
[28:26.860 --> 28:34.100]  I wouldn't be surprised if in the future it it is the system font on iOS and or
[28:34.100 --> 28:37.380]  Mac too, but when if and when that happens
[28:37.420 --> 28:43.180]  They're gonna have to put that same amount of work into tweaking it to make it perfect for ya
[28:43.180 --> 28:46.420]  I was gonna say, you know, like they'll probably have to tweak it a lot because yeah
[28:46.420 --> 28:51.780]  If San Francisco if San Francisco as it exists now is made specifically for the Apple watch
[28:51.780 --> 28:56.300]  I mean it's made for this tiny screen and they haven't really put a lot of work into making it
[28:56.900 --> 28:59.920]  Viewable, you know and the larger sizes that you would use
[28:59.920 --> 29:06.160]  On the Mac or an iOS so right that would be I don't know. I could see it working nicely
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.160]  You know, yeah if they if they did
[29:08.200 --> 29:11.480]  Tweak it but you can see it working nicely as a system phone
[29:11.480 --> 29:17.000]  I think it's some weird combination of like how many pixels high the font is
[29:17.640 --> 29:23.320]  combined with the physical size like if you measure with an actual ruler how big it's going to be
[29:23.620 --> 29:26.240]  When you look at it, like it's not just like Oh make
[29:26.240 --> 29:34.240]  16 point font look perfect. It's make 16 point font look perfect at a
[29:35.160 --> 29:39.560]  Quarter of an inch high as opposed to like on the watch where it's going to be much smaller
[29:39.560 --> 29:44.280]  Right on the watch. It seems like it's really I don't know
[29:44.280 --> 29:46.360]  I remember being blown away by it in the
[29:46.560 --> 29:53.800]  Presentation and then at the event when I actually got to look at the watch the actual watches, you know hands-on it looks so cool
[29:53.800 --> 29:55.440]  I
[29:55.440 --> 29:59.460]  Seem so yeah, it looks amazing. I can't wait to actually get my hands on one and and see what it's like
[29:59.920 --> 30:03.720]  Yeah, it's been nice an adjustment away from Lucy to grand at first
[30:03.720 --> 30:09.520]  it was strange on on Mac like oh wow, there's just telemedicine everywhere and and some of the
[30:09.800 --> 30:14.360]  You know, especially like the first release like with iOS as well. Like they're just some
[30:15.280 --> 30:18.400]  Sizes at which like it wasn't really working for me at first, but I feel like now
[30:18.400 --> 30:24.960]  Um, like I don't know it's it's working really well as the system bond on the Mac. Yeah
[30:24.960 --> 30:27.520]  I definitely I like it, but it's
[30:28.560 --> 30:33.520]  It's been in a job as somebody who obsesses over type. It's been an adjustment like
[30:34.200 --> 30:36.200]  Sure, and you know
[30:38.360 --> 30:39.840]  Lucida
[30:39.840 --> 30:45.280]  Worked Lucida grand grande. It is another one of those things. I have no idea. I always call it Lucida grand
[30:45.280 --> 30:51.900]  Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm saying right now. Yeah, like do you pronounce the e on grande grande grande grande grande? Yeah
[30:51.900 --> 30:55.120]  I don't know. What do you say? It's Starbucks. It's grande, right?
[30:56.160 --> 31:00.760]  Yeah, you guys have yeah, I mean if it was in Spanish, it would definitely be grande but yeah
[31:00.880 --> 31:05.280]  Well, whatever it's called it it especially worked
[31:05.280 --> 31:11.920]  well at small sizes like you know the the the hinting work that Apple did and who you know,
[31:11.920 --> 31:16.560]  The the the people who made lucid in the first place intending it to be a great screen fun
[31:17.880 --> 31:23.340]  it really really worked well at very small sizes like for like when you're setting like
[31:24.440 --> 31:31.920]  Like a preferences dialogue and there's small text underneath a control that explains what that setting, you know in detail what that setting does
[31:32.800 --> 31:37.920]  Lucida works so well at that and whenever I see that now in Helvetica on
[31:37.920 --> 31:44.280]  You know somebody sometimes it looks a little weird not that it looks bad, but it somehow looks it strikes me as a little
[31:44.640 --> 31:48.160]  It just feels funny, but I'm getting used to it. Thanks. Let's
[31:48.680 --> 31:54.120]  Let's talk about Yosemite. So sure what are as a UI designer?
[31:54.120 --> 31:59.760]  What what is your overall impression now that we're a couple, you know, we're Yosemite is kind of settled in
[31:59.760 --> 32:04.280]  You know, what? What are your impressions overall? Um, you know, I really like it
[32:04.280 --> 32:09.380]  it's everything feels very light and it's sort of for me it feels like it's going along with like the
[32:09.960 --> 32:13.440]  You know ever-increasing thinness of the actual
[32:14.040 --> 32:16.800]  Hardware and it just sort of like helps everything feel I mean
[32:16.800 --> 32:23.960]  I like that they preserve the depth with the the drop shadows on all of the windows themselves, but then having the
[32:24.920 --> 32:26.920]  sort of translucency
[32:27.480 --> 32:31.120]  Vibrancy stuff everywhere. It's sort of at first it felt like overkill to me
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.660]  But as I've sort of adjusted to it, um, I like it it feels like yeah
[32:34.660 --> 32:38.920]  everything is like these nice little panes of glass hovering over each other and
[32:39.720 --> 32:43.060]  You know, I think it feels good. I really what I really like a lot
[32:43.060 --> 32:49.560]  There was all the really small like subtle animations that they've added everywhere that they're not big and flashy and they're not they don't
[32:49.560 --> 32:53.800]  They're not slow. They don't really they're really subtle again. So like it's like you wouldn't really
[32:54.520 --> 32:59.440]  Notice it too much but things like checking a checkbox just animates in a nice friendly little way
[32:59.440 --> 33:06.440]  You know, just even even things like like choosing something from a context menu is just slightly different
[33:06.440 --> 33:10.040]  It's just it's just a little bit more alive a little like springier if that makes sense
[33:10.840 --> 33:15.440]  And so I feel like with you somebody they've they've made they've made it
[33:15.440 --> 33:19.140]  So it you're a little bit more connected to the UI if that makes sense after
[33:20.240 --> 33:22.460]  Yeah, after like years of touch screens
[33:22.460 --> 33:29.860]  I'm feeling really connected to that. I was feeling like with with Mavericks even just feeling a little setback from the Mac
[33:29.860 --> 33:32.300]  Especially because you use a mouse or a trackpad
[33:33.420 --> 33:39.180]  Yeah, I don't know. I feel like I feel like if somebody is more I feel more connected to it. I like it
[33:39.180 --> 33:44.500]  yeah, I feel like that's it's a good point with the animation and I feel like it's interesting because
[33:45.260 --> 33:46.500]  clearly
[33:46.500 --> 33:48.380]  the iPhone and iOS
[33:48.380 --> 33:51.260]  Where we're Apple really got into that sort of
[33:51.260 --> 33:58.420]  Make things that the things you interact with on the device feel alive and feel like real things
[33:59.020 --> 34:03.060]  But they didn't do an iOS inspired
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.580]  Mac UI until now like they skipped that whole
[34:09.300 --> 34:15.380]  iOS 1 to 6 era in terms of like bringing those ideas to the Mac and they waited
[34:15.620 --> 34:17.660]  right until after iOS 7 and
[34:17.660 --> 34:23.780]  I well there was some I mean, you know, like the textural stuff was definitely bleeding over into the Mac, right?
[34:23.980 --> 34:26.780]  Yeah, but not what you see, but you know what I mean?
[34:26.780 --> 34:32.420]  Yeah, I agree. You mean like with like the trackpad and like with the gestures you can do on the mouse. Yeah
[34:32.420 --> 34:37.500]  Yeah, right and that but but also like there and there were more like textures and things in actual in apps
[34:37.500 --> 34:41.820]  Like it was starting to take on Oh texture. I see. I thought you said gesture. Yeah. Yeah
[34:41.820 --> 34:46.740]  Oh just real to though. Yeah. Yeah. I mean and I actually have really enjoyed that
[34:46.740 --> 34:48.540]  I'm really glad that that you know
[34:48.540 --> 34:53.100]  Magic Mouse and the trackpad allow so many gestures now a little bit, but I don't know
[34:53.100 --> 34:57.580]  I don't know that the textures I think the Mac was going in that way
[34:58.340 --> 35:01.420]  Anyway, you know that that with Mac OS 10 sure
[35:01.420 --> 35:08.940]  I feel like what what what Yosemite ads that's new is like what you said where where there's subtle animations
[35:08.940 --> 35:16.360]  You know like like when you click a pop-up menu and it just grows the menu grows out of the the pop-up button. I
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.160]  It's such a nice little touch. I'm a couple people have complained to me about that one
[35:22.160 --> 35:28.280]  But I really that's one of the things about Yosemite that I enjoy. I really like that animation where the menu it grows
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.280]  I don't know how else to say it. It just grows out of the button
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.880]  It grows and then yeah when you make your selection, there's just a little bit more feedback. It's just like this slight little like
[35:37.880 --> 35:43.120]  Um like flash like it's like yes, you know, I've seen your input and I've responded to it
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.120]  You know that sort of thing. It just feels more
[35:46.120 --> 35:48.720]  Yes, like like it's slightly more alive now
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.240]  Yeah, that's it's so funny that you made that noise because it doesn't make noise, but that is what it feels like
[35:54.240 --> 35:56.320]  Yeah, dude, dude. Yeah, like
[35:56.880 --> 35:58.880]  There is that sort of feeling to it?
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.520]  Do you feel though?
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.520]  as a designer that it is
[36:04.520 --> 36:11.880]  that you have like to redo everything or do you feel that it's not that much work to to
[36:12.240 --> 36:18.160]  Get like rogue amoeba zaps looking perfect on Yosemite. Is it a restart?
[36:20.320 --> 36:23.680]  Yeah, I mean there's definitely gonna be a lot of I mean if we did nothing else
[36:23.680 --> 36:25.920]  It would just have to be a lot of like reskinning everything
[36:27.080 --> 36:29.080]  And I don't I don't think we're going to go
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.660]  Like we're not gonna dive into the translucency
[36:32.660 --> 36:35.560]  Stuff too much at least not with
[36:36.540 --> 36:39.180]  With the next, you know few iterations of our apps
[36:39.900 --> 36:46.500]  We're sort of I don't know we're gonna sort of be in the middle there and sort of make things look at home on Yosemite
[36:48.320 --> 36:55.180]  Hopefully, that's the goal anyway make things look at home on Yosemite, but still look like our stuff if that makes sense and
[36:57.020 --> 36:59.020]  Yeah, so not whole hog into it
[36:59.020 --> 37:03.780]  I feel I feel yeah, I do I feel because I feel like somehow like
[37:04.300 --> 37:11.460]  Going from iOS 6 to iOS 7 for most apps was like you really had to redo the whole thing to make it feel
[37:12.460 --> 37:14.460]  Whereas I feel like going from
[37:14.940 --> 37:20.000]  Pre Yosemite Mac app to Yosemite. It's really
[37:20.700 --> 37:26.620]  It to me. It's more subtle. Yeah, it's a lot more subtle. I think it's a lot less. Yeah, it's a lot more subtle
[37:26.620 --> 37:31.820]  It's a lot less work. It just depends on your app though. Um, like something like fission. I feel like would
[37:32.420 --> 37:37.820]  Would benefit from just a little bit of reskinning but then something like piezo which I still love my little
[37:39.140 --> 37:41.140]  Recording app. It's it's very
[37:41.900 --> 37:43.780]  You know, it's all
[37:43.780 --> 37:49.220]  skeuomorphic and and cutesy and and whimsical so so it just depends on the app and and how much
[37:50.300 --> 37:54.060]  How far in either direction it already was to begin with I guess
[37:54.060 --> 37:57.180]  um, and some things will take more work and other things less work, but
[37:59.500 --> 38:03.920]  Yeah, no, I yeah like I feel like piezo is a good example though because
[38:04.660 --> 38:08.780]  Piezo, you know and I know that this word gets overused but it's
[38:09.380 --> 38:15.200]  Skeuomorphic and I Paul just I think was Paul who just blogged about it. I saw the post but it was like celebrating
[38:16.660 --> 38:22.360]  Like an anniversary or something, but it was you know mentioning mentioning the old brawn
[38:22.360 --> 38:23.960]  physical
[38:23.960 --> 38:26.520]  Radio that sort of inspired the look of it
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.960]  right and
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.520]  Which is a beautiful device super beautiful device. Mm-hmm
[38:32.520 --> 38:39.240]  I kind of feel like which they gave me so sorry the anniversary was my five-year anniversary and they gave me the brown
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.720]  Radio that inspired piezo which was an incredible gift. Anyway, I'm just throwing that in there about how awesome you know what?
[38:45.720 --> 38:49.360]  He's you know, he's not awesome. He's kind of yeah, he's kind of a dick
[38:49.360 --> 38:52.040]  Because he's so awesome
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.840]  No, the the problem is he comes up with clever ideas like that and then it makes you know
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.680]  It makes the rest of us look bad who don't have clever gift ideas
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.960]  It's true like my my idea of a good gift would be like like a gift card for the iTunes store
[39:10.600 --> 39:14.880]  Like here go buy, you know go buy the new levels for Monument Valley and
[39:14.880 --> 39:21.400]  And whereas Paul kafassas comes up with a brilliant idea like the actual
[39:22.320 --> 39:29.680]  1968 radio that inspired piezo and then ships it to you. Yeah, which is yeah terrible because it's so
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.080]  It's so wonderful that it's terrible because it makes yeah, like who can tap that right? Yeah, and then he's like, oh, yeah
[39:36.080 --> 39:38.080]  I was just donating platelets this week
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.600]  Just the nicest guy ever
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.640]  He's a great guy and it's too much. Yeah
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.400]  Exactly. He's giving you a wonderful gift while his other arm like from one hand on his phone while the other harm is is donating
[39:53.520 --> 39:54.560]  platelets
[39:54.560 --> 40:00.040]  Terrible, right exactly, but I don't you I do feel though that I can app like piezo
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.520]  kids gets away with the the
[40:03.520 --> 40:05.200]  skeuomorphic
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.360]  gimmickry still on Yosemite in a way that like on the iPhone with iowa7
[40:11.080 --> 40:17.360]  That sort of thing looks dated. I don't know. There's something exactly. Yeah. Well, I still feel like yeah, I feel like
[40:18.160 --> 40:24.760]  Because I think it's just that like the the Mac is such a it's just a much more broad platform. It's just
[40:25.320 --> 40:28.560]  there's a lot more variation I think between apps and
[40:28.560 --> 40:34.000]  And yeah, and and so it can still like I've been using it this whole time and it's still
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.180]  Cutesy for me. I'm still sort of like oh, maybe I shouldn't have gone so skeuomorphic with it
[40:39.180 --> 40:43.240]  But that's me with every single thing. I design like, you know, if it's over three months old
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.620]  I'm like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that. But um
[40:46.280 --> 40:48.840]  Yeah, I feel like it can still be at home
[40:49.840 --> 40:51.840]  on Yosemite whereas
[40:51.880 --> 40:53.880]  Yeah, anything that's that's super
[40:53.880 --> 40:59.960]  Um textured and detailed like that on iOS. It just yeah, it just looks like iOS 6 and it looks
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.360]  Really out of place. Yeah, it's it's funny because there's so many more
[41:06.140 --> 41:11.320]  iOS users than Mac users, you know, I don't know maybe by a factor of 10 at least
[41:11.840 --> 41:15.400]  but it seems it just seems curious to me that
[41:16.840 --> 41:22.560]  iOS is where Apple seems to be more radical with their UI design where the
[41:22.560 --> 41:24.360]  pre iOS 7
[41:24.360 --> 41:27.080]  UI aesthetic for iOS was way more
[41:27.480 --> 41:34.240]  Skeuomorphic and more textured and had more like oh, this is this looks like a pane of glass with a glossy
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.280]  You know effect on it
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.140]  And it's bubbly and it's textured and the texture is really really rich
[41:43.000 --> 41:51.080]  Way more over-the-top than the Mac ever got and then when they went the other way they went way more radically in the direction of
[41:51.080 --> 41:57.800]  Okay, no textures. No 3d effects. This is I know again. It's overuse word, but this is flat
[41:58.720 --> 42:02.280]  You know, the buttons don't even have outlines. They're just text
[42:07.640 --> 42:13.240]  And the Mac it both ways it never it's it's way more conservative to me
[42:13.240 --> 42:21.020]  It never went that texture before and now with Yosemite where they've sort of updated it for a modern. Look, it's it's nowhere near as radical
[42:21.020 --> 42:24.400]  As iOS 7 and I think it's it's more more pleasing overall
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.960]  Oh definitely, and I think if they really benefited from having, you know done iOS 7
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.740]  You know before you have somebody and so they sort of I mean, this is my I'm just it's all conjecture
[42:36.740 --> 42:40.540]  But I'm just guessing you know that they they had all of that experience and we're like, okay
[42:40.540 --> 42:40.700]  well
[42:40.700 --> 42:46.460]  Let's it's like the pendulum sort of swung too far in that direction like that. Let's get let's strip everything down to
[42:47.060 --> 42:49.400]  Really really minimalist design and it's like, okay
[42:49.400 --> 42:53.880]  Well, maybe that was a little too far and then if somebody feels like just just nudging it back
[42:54.760 --> 43:01.360]  Just far enough so that it's comfortable and yeah and buttons look like buttons and there are slight gradients here and there
[43:02.640 --> 43:09.960]  Yeah, it's nice and I think it works. I think it works and in some ways better and I think that's why it feels more
[43:10.840 --> 43:16.280]  Accommodating to a broader range of styles sure that it's still you know
[43:16.280 --> 43:22.240]  Like I said, like it still feels like a system where piezo as it is without any kind of you know
[43:22.240 --> 43:29.400]  New Yosemite update still looks it still looks right. It still looks like that's you know, acceptable, right? Yeah
[43:29.400 --> 43:31.400]  I hope so. Anyway, I
[43:32.300 --> 43:40.120]  Thought it was interesting. I that's sort of you know, I think I've touched on this before but like before they unveiled Yosemite
[43:40.120 --> 43:43.640]  And everybody kind of knew of course, they're going to do some sort of
[43:43.640 --> 43:51.040]  IOS 7 style update for the Mac. I really was braced for it to be a lot more radical. I
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.160]  Really thought that they were gonna flatten everything more
[43:54.200 --> 44:00.280]  You know like and like you even said like where they still have the shadow effects between windows to show you what's in front of
[44:00.280 --> 44:02.280]  I thought maybe they'd get rid of stuff like that
[44:02.960 --> 44:09.800]  Yeah, me too. Yeah, and they didn't and it even really surprises me that they still have
[44:09.800 --> 44:15.600]  So many settings and system preferences that let you the user
[44:16.040 --> 44:22.160]  you know change things like I kind of I would have bet a year ago that the the
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.560]  IOS 7 style update to Mac OS would have gotten rid of like
[44:28.200 --> 44:34.600]  The ability to change the appearance color, you know, like blue and graphic. Oh, right. Yeah between blue and graphite. Yeah
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.000]  Um, right and you can go it's it's interesting that they provided the dark theme, too
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  It's sort of that came out of nowhere because it's it's just seems very
[44:44.160 --> 44:46.160]  Counter to what Apple's done for the last
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.680]  Few years just just not allowing much appearance
[44:50.600 --> 44:58.080]  You know specialization or customization. So having like a secondary like dark theme and then of course, yeah, we were talking before
[44:59.160 --> 45:00.920]  about the
[45:00.920 --> 45:07.040]  The reduced transparency and increased contrast. Oh, well, I don't know. It's not really a hack the accessibility
[45:08.360 --> 45:11.440]  preferences that you can do to change the whole look is as like as
[45:12.160 --> 45:15.460]  A thing that now people are doing to sort of customize the look
[45:16.280 --> 45:20.360]  Themselves, which is which is fun. And then you know, I did that for a while. This is fun
[45:20.360 --> 45:26.120]  Yeah, so what it is is in system preferences if you haven't done this in system preferences goat
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.040]  Not it's not in the general pain where you set most of the UI stuff
[45:30.040 --> 45:33.600]  It's an accessibility. It's an accessibility and you
[45:34.280 --> 45:38.800]  You can check reduced transparency and then you can also check
[45:39.200 --> 45:45.800]  Increased contrast and increase to increase I increase contrast is the really interesting one to me. Yes
[45:46.680 --> 45:53.000]  Me too. Yeah, and actually if you if you select increase contrast, it will automatically select this transparency. Yes
[45:54.360 --> 45:55.880]  It's so fun
[45:55.880 --> 45:57.480]  and it's
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.640]  It's kind of wild like and you and I before the show we were
[46:03.080 --> 46:06.000]  Emailing or chatting or whatever whatever the kids do
[46:07.640 --> 46:11.120]  But but we both said the same thing like at the same time
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.860]  Which is that it looks sort of like like some kind of alternate universe
[46:16.320 --> 46:18.320]  where the original like
[46:18.760 --> 46:20.760]  1990s Mac OS
[46:20.760 --> 46:28.440]  Like evolved through to today's display technology, you know that right just completely literally like
[46:28.520 --> 46:34.960]  Yeah, like blue never happened. Like there was nothing ever like big and puffy or whimsical anywhere. I just sort of like stayed with the
[46:35.860 --> 46:42.920]  you know dark outlines around buttons and and things just sort of got more streamlined and sleek sort of and then like the yeah the
[46:43.680 --> 46:45.680]  system font changed from
[46:45.680 --> 46:52.000]  Chicago to Helvetica, it's just yeah, it's so interesting to to use though and it's it's actually really pleasant
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.920]  I really enjoyed enjoyed having that preference. It's on there
[46:54.920 --> 47:00.720]  I I used it for a while and maybe even close to a week and then I changed turned it off and now now that we're
[47:00.720 --> 47:02.800]  Talking I did it again and I'm looking at it. I'm like
[47:04.160 --> 47:05.600]  I
[47:05.600 --> 47:10.960]  Really like it. Yeah, and if you set your desktop background to like a dark gray, then you're just yeah
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.840]  It just feels like an old Mac. It's really fun
[47:13.840 --> 47:21.360]  It's a really neat effect and and school you sent me the screenshot everybody does I get it on Twitter like every three days from
[47:21.360 --> 47:25.440]  somebody over there like what what the what the hell's going on with this is when you
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.200]  Do things like what are the ways that you can bring it up like if you change the volume?
[47:30.280 --> 47:33.520]  yeah, yeah, if you if you mute your your volume and like there's a
[47:34.400 --> 47:36.440]  that icon is sort of I guess it has
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.520]  Blank pixels and and it just gives a black background where there should just be blank pixels and it's like oh, man
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.280]  What happened there? Yeah, it's like when you're just like there's like goofy little things like that. There's a few like
[47:48.320 --> 47:50.320]  buttons and like
[47:50.320 --> 47:56.440]  Sometimes finder buttons are in like save dialogues like the the buttons will be like a skew when they're when you're in this mode
[47:56.440 --> 48:01.360]  And I'm not sure why that happens. But yeah, it's just there's a few little quirky things that happen
[48:01.360 --> 48:08.160]  Yeah, there's like it just a couple of weird glitches. I mean, they're technically bug. Yeah, but it glitched
[48:08.160 --> 48:13.360]  Yeah, glitch feels like a better word. But yeah, it's like when you change the volume it's like
[48:14.120 --> 48:16.120]  the the little I
[48:16.760 --> 48:18.120]  Don't even know what you would call it
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.480]  Is it a like the little transparent heads-up display that that shows you?
[48:22.800 --> 48:29.880]  What the volume level is at as you're hitting the buttons on your your keyboard has round rounded corners
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.920]  Rounded corners and it's like when you turn this mode on
[48:34.360 --> 48:37.560]  They get completely squared off into perfect squares
[48:37.560 --> 48:44.440]  But the difference between the round right corners and the truly perfect squares is just filled in with black and it looks really
[48:44.440 --> 48:46.440]  Yeah, it's really kind of grossly
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.320]  Yeah, it's gross. It's gross. Let's face it. It looks broken. Yeah
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.220]  It's like your Mac is looking at you and it has something in its teeth and you're you want to like save you
[48:56.400 --> 48:58.500]  You want to just look at it and be like, hey
[48:58.500 --> 49:00.500]  Yeah, you got something
[49:00.820 --> 49:02.820]  Teeth right there. Yeah
[49:03.660 --> 49:06.260]  Yeah, it upsets the perfectionist in me
[49:06.260 --> 49:14.240]  But overall though, I kind of think it's a better look than the default Yosemite look which I which in turn I do kind of like
[49:14.760 --> 49:17.420]  But I feel like this is even better. Yeah, it's um
[49:18.140 --> 49:22.540]  It's really clean and and everything is like super obvious
[49:23.580 --> 49:26.860]  which I like and and things just really stand out well and
[49:26.860 --> 49:30.200]  Yeah, I like the the higher contrast. It's nice
[49:31.080 --> 49:35.920]  Looks good. I'm in so I mean, it's just one random little thing unrelated to
[49:36.440 --> 49:41.520]  most everything else but what the home like the thing that bugs me the most and it's such such a stupid little thing is
[49:41.520 --> 49:48.040]  Like the the forward and back buttons in Safari and finder just those navigational buttons. They used to be a segmented button
[49:48.720 --> 49:53.360]  Do you know what? I mean? Like the it's like a it used to be. Yeah, they used to be triangles now
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.880]  They're like back and left and right carrots. But anyway
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.200]  um
[49:57.200 --> 50:04.400]  They they're like very close together and they're rounded rectangles and they just they don't quite touch and oh that bugs me so much
[50:04.760 --> 50:06.760]  yeah, and they kind of
[50:07.880 --> 50:14.440]  But no, I know exactly what you mean is that they also sort of in in the middle where they meet there's there's like a
[50:14.440 --> 50:16.440]  little like a butt crack
[50:16.840 --> 50:19.400]  Yeah, exactly like they're not they're not yeah
[50:19.400 --> 50:21.720]  and if they were and if they were touching they'd still have their
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.320]  Rounded rectangle edges like just meeting up in a weird way and it's why isn't that a segmented button anymore?
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.720]  Like what happened right it used to just be anyway
[50:30.720 --> 50:36.400]  Or just like put them slightly farther apart or just make it a segmented button. I don't know exactly but it's like they've
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.320]  They've tried to split the difference in a weird way where it doesn't look like yeah again
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.840]  And again that I think that's the actual like that's actually what you call it in Xcode is a segmented button
[50:46.840 --> 50:50.600]  And but that's what it used to look like. It just looked like a button
[50:50.600 --> 50:56.280]  with segments to divide it whereas now it looks like two buttons that were
[50:57.240 --> 50:58.520]  inappropriately
[50:58.520 --> 51:01.560]  Placed right next to each other. Yes, exactly. Oh
[51:02.080 --> 51:04.080]  Erks me so much anyway
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.600]  Most other things are formidable and yeah, no, I totally agree with that. I don't I don't like that
[51:10.600 --> 51:12.600]  There's like a yeah like a plumber's
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.040]  Butt crack that you see at the top and I think I don't it bothers me
[51:17.680 --> 51:18.960]  Yes

[54:46.400 --> 54:48.400]  Alright icons, let's talk about icons
[54:49.280 --> 54:54.560]  I got sure so that's one of the areas like I mentioned before where I sort of expected
[54:54.560 --> 55:01.440]  Yosemite to go in an iOS iOS style way where I kind of was thinking that they're going to say
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.880]  Okay, now all icons have to be circles or something like that. Oh, I know that'd be awful
[55:07.600 --> 55:14.000]  Yeah, no, um, I'm so glad they didn't and I mean there there are plenty of circles all around the UI, but I'm so happy that
[55:14.880 --> 55:16.880]  They're still using objects
[55:17.200 --> 55:18.560]  You know in a lot of places
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.640]  I mean they do still they they are using a lot of circles and a lot of
[55:22.640 --> 55:29.280]  Like the tilted rectangle basically, but I'm liking I like that they stuck with a lot of you know
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.520]  objects or representational more representational things and just made them in sort of a
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.160]  Paired-down simplified style so that they sort of look like Yosemite, but they're still sort of fun shapes and they're not all
[55:40.720 --> 55:42.880]  They're not all one shape. That's that makes me happy
[55:43.760 --> 55:49.520]  Yeah, I it makes me when that when it when they showed it to us and you know
[55:49.520 --> 55:57.040]  one of the things I noticed was, you know, even in the like default Apple dock when you have a fresh install of Yosemite
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.840]  There's a variety of icon styles so you can see right away that there's no
[56:02.400 --> 56:07.120]  Just one style and I you know, write it right in the keynote. I thought oh, that's great
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.600]  I was totally wrong about that. And then I started like question myself. I was like, well, why did I think they were gonna do that?
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.320]  Like I I kind of thought you know, why why did I expect that like?
[56:16.320 --> 56:18.480]  Why did I expect that like?
[56:19.280 --> 56:23.520]  Because it makes me think like oh, of course, they wouldn't do that because it wouldn't work on the Mac
[56:23.840 --> 56:27.120]  But it's somehow I was dreading it and expected them to do that
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.440]  Well, um, yeah and there are I mean, I don't think that's sort of far-fetched because um,
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.640]  yeah in some ways I could see that making sense, but I'm so glad that but that's not the way things went because
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.040]  Having a dock full of circles would be really annoying you'd have to use
[56:43.840 --> 56:44.960]  um
[56:44.960 --> 56:48.640]  You know, you'd have to really use color and have a very clear very simple
[56:49.200 --> 56:52.000]  Icon, you know like iconic shape inside of your circle
[56:52.640 --> 56:54.640]  to identify your app and
[56:54.800 --> 56:56.480]  yeah, I think it would just be
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.760]  Really sort of bland and and kind of annoying to sort of figure out what is what just at a glance
[57:02.640 --> 57:10.400]  So i'm happy they they kept their they kept the idea of of different. Um shapes and using a lot of physical objects, but just um,
[57:11.200 --> 57:13.680]  yeah, just sort of reskin them and there's a
[57:13.680 --> 57:20.240]  A lot more texture and depth to them even again, even just the ones from apple let alone
[57:20.400 --> 57:22.080]  You know third parties who can do whatever they want
[57:22.080 --> 57:28.320]  But even the apple ones have more texture and depth than the icons on ios. Oh by far. Yeah. Yeah so much
[57:28.400 --> 57:34.240]  It's yeah, it's great. But it's still um, at the same time. It's still look it's definitely pared down unless you know blingy
[57:34.880 --> 57:36.080]  than um
[57:36.080 --> 57:38.080]  Than previous, uh, mac icons
[57:38.080 --> 57:43.760]  Like I was I was actually um, so I was just home in florida visiting my mom and she's still running mavericks and um, yeah
[57:43.760 --> 57:48.880]  I was really just sort of like oh, yeah. Wow, look at all these these icons like everything is just so shiny like
[57:49.440 --> 57:55.840]  Um, just the you know, giving the icons, um, just subtle makeover so that everything is more matte. Um,
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.520]  and less glossy and and just tweaking the colors and the lighting and and um,
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.440]  And shapes and sort of flattening things out. Um,
[58:05.440 --> 58:08.880]  Reducing perspective on the on the rectangles that are tilted that sort of thing
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.520]  Um, yeah, I think it's it's helped. It's a good. It's a good compromise. It's a good middle ground. I think I still have
[58:16.160 --> 58:21.280]  One of my machines the it's actually a machine I use to record podcasts. It's still running mavericks. So I still see it
[58:21.280 --> 58:23.280]  It's a macbook air
[58:23.280 --> 58:24.400]  Um, okay
[58:24.400 --> 58:28.080]  And it it like increasingly as like week by week
[58:28.160 --> 58:33.200]  It just looks like older and older and older. It looks it looks silly at this point. Yeah
[58:33.200 --> 58:35.200]  In particular
[58:35.360 --> 58:41.840]  To me it the icons really really stand out like, uh, like the finder icon. It's like why?
[58:42.640 --> 58:45.200]  Yeah, I I don't know why is it big right?
[58:45.840 --> 58:48.080]  Why did they make it look like it's made out of glass?
[58:48.080 --> 58:52.320]  I don't get it. Like there still is a lighting effect like on the new one in yosemite
[58:52.320 --> 58:56.000]  There's a very nice lighting effect. It looks like there's light coming down from the top. Yeah
[58:56.720 --> 59:02.400]  It has texture it has depth but the one i'm i'm i'm i'm not really sure what it is
[59:02.400 --> 59:04.800]  One i'm i'm looking at them side by side right now
[59:04.880 --> 59:10.240]  It's like the the mavericks one has this glass effect that just looks so like
[59:10.720 --> 59:16.960]  I can't say it better than bling bling is the exact right word. Yeah, and it's like why why did we do that?
[59:18.320 --> 59:21.920]  It's like looking back at like high school pictures and it's like why did I have a mullet?
[59:22.720 --> 59:24.720]  Why did we think that looked good, right?
[59:25.280 --> 59:29.040]  The other one that really stands out to me is the app store icon
[59:29.040 --> 59:34.000]  And like I think itunes used the same style, but it's like itunes was updated now
[59:34.160 --> 59:41.600]  It's like itunes has the yosemite icon even on the old system. But like the app store icon is this circle, you know with
[59:42.400 --> 59:47.360]  Just an incredible amount of like gloss and glass sort of
[59:48.400 --> 59:52.800]  Lighting. Oh, yes. Yeah, it has like rays and yeah, it has like this. Yeah
[59:54.080 --> 59:58.560]  Um, yeah, at least the old one had like it was all of this light and sort of in depth to it
[59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.760]  Um, and the new one is just like, you know subtle gradient. Um
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:08.720]  The the iconic, you know app store or just generic application icon and yeah big change
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.680]  Do you when you guys are working on apps?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.800]  do you do you get to work on the app icon right away or do you wait and the
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.280]  You know, is that something you do later in the process? Um, it just depends on the app
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.000]  Um, like we're already working on a new app
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.800]  I'm not allowed to talk about and i've already made the icon for it
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.240]  And we've you know, pretty much decided like yes, this is the final version of the icon
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.760]  um
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.160]  I think it just depends on where where developers are is sort of like
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.120]  we go through wireframes and we get things, you know, pretty much where we think, um, they should be and then
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.400]  Um, there's a lot more back end work and then it's sort of like okay
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.720]  Well, here's a thing that I can do in the meantime
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.760]  I mean we have we have a lot of apps and i'm the only designer so i'm sort of
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.760]  Always rotating around on what i'm working on. But um, yeah, it just depends on on the app at which point
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760]  Um, we do the icon
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.200]  There's not there's not a hard and fast like time that we that we do, right?
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.880]  you can always change it later, but I find with most designers who I know that they
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.520]  They can't stand working on an app until they have something that could plausibly be the app icon
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:18.320]  You know like oh, right. Oh, yeah bugs me so much when there's just like, uh some placeholder art. Um from the developer
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.520]  Oh, let me at least make yeah, we're out, you know, i'll at least make you know, something like here
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.120]  This this might this might be a right like in other words the best way to get some sort of
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.280]  plausible app icon idea out of you would be to
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.280]  make a
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.760]  Have engineering create a build where the icon is just like a you know, some clip art from the internet
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.560]  Because it'll it because then as soon as you see it
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.600]  You'll be like I need to immediately drop everything and make something so that the next bill. Yes
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.480]  Oh, man, but i'm so not allowed to do that. Oh, yeah
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.560]  I yeah, I have to get um
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.160]  because
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.560]  that is exactly what I would do and then so, um
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.760]  Yeah, I have to sort of be reined in on that. I was like no you can't work on the icon right now
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.880]  You have like three other things you need to do. Um, oh, that's so hard
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.120]  We really need this sign up dialogue done because we can't use the app until we have a sign-up dialing right now
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.880]  No, I have got to uh, yeah, I have to fix this icon, right?
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.080]  Yeah, we have yeah, there's a lot of uh
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.180]  Prioritizing that like we we often should have different
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.500]  priorities as far as that goes like oh, I don't want to work on the
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:34.500]  Boring, um network when preferences window, you know, I I want to make the icon
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.140]  But that's you know, that's how it goes
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:46.260]  I don't know. I I icons to me. It's it's funny because I I've always said this I think people argue about icons
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.740]  more than any other thing in
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:56.340]  Software design. I don't even say user interfaces on all the software design because it's the one it's the one thing that
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:04.260]  Even if you're not a designer, it's just a single point of entry and it represents the whole app. So it is important
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:11.060]  And oh, it's hugely important. Yeah, it's how you identify the app. It's how when you're just you know, switching back and forth
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.140]  Between apps it's like how you quickly at a glance see what that app is
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:21.460]  Reminds users. Yeah, I don't know. I have I could launch it. So it's definitely important extremely, but it's not
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.980]  Truly as important as the amount of argument that happens over
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:33.780]  Changes to icons like people are still people are still bitching about the new icons in Yosemite
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.740]  You know because you can't please everybody all the time
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:44.580]  Oh sure. So I think the icons overall I think they look much better. But like for example, here's oh, yeah
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:49.460]  I like most of well, here's one that I don't like. I don't like the system preferences icon
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.540]  Yeah, it's sort of um, it's kind of bland
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:04:00.100]  Yeah, and it's it's got like too strong of a lighting effect and too realistic of a gear. It's like
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.860]  Super photo. It doesn't fit with the it doesn't fit with the others. Yeah, it's
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:13.060]  Somehow, I don't know. It looks to me. Yeah. Well, it looks well the gradient especially like the gradient that's on the the gear
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.060]  it just looks very like
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.260]  um
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.260]  It's kind of an uncanny valley like between
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:25.860]  The subtle gradients on everything else and then like trying to go more photorealistic because it's not photorealistic enough to be like the old blingy style
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.460]  um
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:32.500]  but it's more photorealistic than the other gradients used elsewhere on other app icons and so
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:38.900]  Yeah, it's just kind of weird and then just like having it being just like the the gear being in a circle in a box
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.620]  Like that gray outer box is very bland and very boring. Yeah
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.580]  Yeah
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.620]  Yeah
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:49.220]  Yeah, and I feel the other thing I dislike is is the safari icon still I like it better than the one on ios, but
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.980]  I don't know
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:58.260]  See i've i've you know, that's interesting because I like the new safari icon. Do you yeah, I do. I I don't know why
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.860]  But I do
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:05.220]  That's fine. That's fun. But I also wish that it was on ios. I wish that they would yeah
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:11.300]  I the I guess it sort of is reminiscent of the one on ios, but the thing I don't like about the ios one
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.620]  Is that the ios one is?
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.660]  Is a circle
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:21.860]  And they've just put the circle in the in a white square
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.460]  Right. I always call them squares and it whiskus always corrects me that they're they're technically what is
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.740]  Their super ellipses. Yeah, super ellipses
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.140]  Yes
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:41.800]  Um, so it was like squares too. They wanted to be so I don't know why not just make the compass be the super ellipse
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:48.660]  You know make the whole thing blue and put the the the compass dial on that why put the circle in the square?
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.100]  It just seems exactly. Yeah seems forced to me
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:59.940]  And well and to like the the lighting effects and the coloring and the gradient on the on the one on um, the mac is is nicer
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:05.380]  Um, maybe there's just more detail there. It's sharper cleaner, but but yeah, it's weird
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:11.140]  Because it wasn't the old didn't the old safari icon on ios didn't it fill the entire uh, rounded rectangle?
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.660]  At that point it was a rounded rectangle. I think so. I could be wrong. Yeah, I think that it did
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.340]  Don't make and and then yeah
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.020]  And then they they did
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:20.340]  Yeah
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:26.740]  The the circle inside the square because that outer white square that this compass is sitting in it doesn't really do anything or make any sense
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980]  um, it just forces the
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.500]  the entire
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500]  icon to be sort of smaller, so
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:43.860]  Yeah, i'm looking at uh an old screenshot from ios 6 and yes the old safari icon the whole the blue filled filled the whole square
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.780]  Right. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:50.340]  Yeah, I feel like all they needed to do is just redraw do it the same way and just redraw it without
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.420]  Yeah, just redraw it and just yeah
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:58.660]  Make it. Yeah, exactly. Just make it matt. Make it a look at home on ios seven and eight and that's all they need to do but
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:04.100]  But here we are. It just seems to me though that people people bitch about icons and
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:09.380]  As we sit here and bitch about icons and yeah exactly people who bitch about icons
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.260]  But like I feel like people bitch about them
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:19.960]  Disproportionately to to how much they actually have to deal with them because it's so easily encapsulated
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.480]  Encapsulated, you know, it's it's like as a designer
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.640]  um
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:32.600]  It's the same thing when you ever you pick a color and it's like you'll get into arguments with you know, whether it's like a client
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.480]  Relationship or whether it's like, you know
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.080]  Like with you like where you're full-time at a place, but it's like you can get an argument over a color
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:48.120]  That will last for hours because it's so easily and comp, you know, there's there's no subtlety to it
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.640]  You can just say I don't like that color and then all of a sudden exactly
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.480]  you know
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.680]  Your your two people are jointly using the color picker to pick a new color and it just goes on
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.720]  And icons are definitely
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.280]  Yes, yes, and everyone has a very strong opinion about them like there's no one
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:14.200]  Yeah, there's no one who doesn't want to weigh in whereas you know with um, if you're designing like a sidebar or something like that
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.720]  People are you know less interested I guess but everyone wants to give their input when it's um, the icon and you know
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.120]  I mean it makes sense because it is um
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.000]  You know the gateway to the app and the thing that represents the app as a whole so it is, you know
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.120]  It's a really important thing and it tends to be more fun and more interesting. I think so people
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.760]  Just jump on that
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:42.040]  Yeah, it's like with us like you're designing a sidebar and you need like a gear button to to get to you know
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.040]  Settings for the sidebar and it's like is it lower right?
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:52.200]  Is it lower left and and if you put it in the lower right of the sidebar and somebody thinks it should be lower left
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.760]  They'll just say like gently like I don't know. Maybe this I don't know if that's right
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.720]  It feels like maybe it'd be more natural more natural if it was in the lower left and they'll say it like, you know
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.520]  Like an open-ended question like that. Whereas if they don't like the icon they'll be like this icon is terrible
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.800]  Oh, it just makes my eyes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, right. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah, you nailed it. Totally
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.880]  You don't get like the subtle sort of you know
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.360]  maybe kind of do something different feedback with icons that you get with other things like
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.520]  Should it be lower left lower right? Should we draw a box around these controls because they're grouped together?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.120]  You know things like that everybody, you know sort of does that in a more I don't know
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:40.040]  It's the feedback is always a little bit more humane with stuff like that. Yeah, it's true. Definitely
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.280]  We'll get very opinionated and very passionate about their icons
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.640]  Oh one thing about icons that I mean and this isn't I mean it's not about icon design but just one
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.480]  Subtle little thing about you somebody that I'm kind of sad about is when you drag an icon out of the dock
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.160]  It doesn't do the little poof animation anymore, but you still have the poof sound it goes
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.400]  But instead it just says remove. There's like a little
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.640]  Pop-up that hovers over that says remove and then you drag it away and it does the little poof sound
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.840]  But you don't get that little like puff of smoke animation, you know
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.640]  Oh, I miss that. That's all. Yeah. Oh that you know what it's I don't think that i'm doing it right now
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.800]  I don't think i've removed anything from my dog
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.600]  With somebody until just now I just noticed this weird remove thing
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.840]  Yeah, yeah, it's just it's a it's a little I mean, maybe it's more obvious. Um
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.360]  But come on. I mean the the smoke was it was whimsical they could have made it
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:38.120]  I mean they could have changed it like so it matched somebody or something. I don't know. I like I do like like in
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  Launchpad they kept the little um
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.960]  They kept a bit of whimsy there by having like the little the little sparklies around a new app that you haven't launched
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.800]  Yes, like in launch. Yeah, it's so cute. It's like oh I like I like little
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.360]  Like, you know, it would be overkill if it was like on it, you know in everything but just little hints of it
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.320]  You know in everything but just little hints of it here and there it's it's nice to keep things like that
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.640]  But it's yeah, but it's just funny that you still get the little poof, but you don't have the animation anymore
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.240]  But you get the sound
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.120]  Yeah, and it's a good contrast to the sparklies in uh, uh launch center
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.240]  I I sort of feel like with launch center like somebody made that animation
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.960]  I like like because I don't think it's new. I think it's I think it's the same sparkly animation that was there before yosemite
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.800]  I don't think maybe they tweaked it, but it looks very similar to me
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.800]  I can't help but think that there was somebody who made it and they loved it
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:38.220]  And then yes, you know, they're like we're gonna do this, you know, we're gonna redesign the whole os, you know for 10.10
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:44.200]  And we're gonna flatten everything we're gonna get rid of all the stuff and that they they like secretly were like, oh god
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.520]  Please don't come for the sparkly. Please don't come, you know, you leave me alone
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:54.200]  No, but nobody ever like filed a radar that it was like get rid of this, you know weird sparkly thing and they are like
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:02.520]  Their beloved sparkly thing because it it does I I like that it's there but it does kind of stick out I think
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:10.120]  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't it doesn't really fit but it's I still just like it and and I think it works because it's sort of like
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.920]  A one-off like it's just a random rare thing
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.160]  Like it's not you know, there aren't things like that all over the the os so it's fine
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.120]  It it just happens in that one place and it's fine
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:29.760]  The obvious thing to do would be to copy the iOS style and put just put a blue dot next to the
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240]  App name if it's updated
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.680]  It's a boring
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.600]  it is and it's it's just one of those funny things though where like
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.240]  Like overall like I said, you know a little earlier that overall the Mac is more to me more conservative
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.840]  UI wise than iOS, but like the sparklies in
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.880]  Launch Center is you know way blingy?
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.120]  Superbling like way more blingy even than iOS. Oh for sure. Yeah
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.560]  But it just in that one space and the rest of it doesn't look I mean the rest of it
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.840]  You know fits in fine like the icon fits in fine
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.800]  You get this, you know nice, you know frosted glass effect over here over your background and search bar up at the top
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.800]  So, I mean that's everything else looks like it. It just fits right in
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840]  But then you get the little sparklies
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.760]  Have you I this is and this is one of those things too that I wondered about and I maybe it'll never happen but I
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.040]  speaking of
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  Launch Center, I
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.960]  Sort of expected that when Apple eventually did the okay
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:47.600]  let's do a major redesign of OS 10 that I expected that the finder would be replaced with Launch Center as the
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.960]  sort of
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.720]  Interesting like starting point of the OS like when you first log in with nothing launched
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.380]  I thought that they would switch to Launch Center, which is
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.360]  You know, it's it's pretty much the Mac version of the iOS home screen, right? Exactly
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.600]  Then you know that had never occurred to me that they would that they might do that
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.000]  But it makes sense now that you that you mentioned it. That would be a good
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.840]  Sort of analogy to to the iOS home screen to be to start there
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:15.720]  well
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:21.720]  and I think I wonder and I just one of those things where I would love to I would love to just find out like
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.340]  The inside scoop as to whether they thought about it or not, but you know, they never talk about it
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.240]  but I wonder how much I wonder how much of it is that
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.680]  You know, maybe they would like to and if the Mac was a brand new thing
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.900]  That's exactly what they would do, but they can't do it because so many people save all their crap to the desktop
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:47.640]  And the desktop has to be there because they're so loaded with all the files and random stuff
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.120]  right because you know for everybody who is
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:59.620]  Technically adept enough to know that the desktop is really just a folder in your home folder, you know
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:07.100]  There's other people who if they logged in and they saw nothing but apps they would think oh my god home files on my desktop
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:11.940]  Are gone. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, yeah people would freak out. I'm sure I don't know
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:17.060]  I can't help but think that that might be the only thing that's keeping them from doing it. I don't know. Yeah
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.140]  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:26.060]  If any if anything switches more towards that or sort of moves in that direction or if they somehow split the difference in the future
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:33.700]  Do you save files to your desktop is your desktop clean or is it or is it messy my desktop right now has let's see
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.580]  Seven things on it and it's temporary things. I tend not to leave them there for too long
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580]  It's sort of something like oh I need to
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.460]  Follow up on this thing and I'm gonna leave it on my desktop
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.100]  But yeah, I sort of go through and clean things up
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:53.940]  Now and again and I don't think yeah, nothing here is is terribly old but
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.660]  Yeah, so it's not it's not perfectly clean
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:02.340]  But it's not littered with with things either and it's all all things of sort of a temporary nature that I don't
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:06.100]  Like things like if they were all deleted right now, like it wouldn't be a big deal at all
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.900]  Yeah, I was about to say that I keep a very neat desktop and I looked and I had to open a window to get
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.340]  The count I have 25 items on my desktop. So it's not needed all that's a mess
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.060]  But
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.940]  I do the same thing though where it's I think everything is pretty recent
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:27.700]  I'm looking at the dates. All right, I'm sorting by date and the oldest thing is from October 15th. So
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:33.660]  it's everything is from the last month and I do and then like I'll get in like it's like
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:39.100]  My physical office my real world this the room that I'm in as I record this right now is a mess
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.220]  It's like Andy Rooney's office. It's
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:48.240]  It's not full of papers and books and boxes and stuff. But I do I keep a neat computer and I once a month or so
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240]  I just like get everything off my desktop
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.900]  Yeah, right exactly. Me too. I just sort of go through and clean up and
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.460]  Yeah, it bugs me after a while having too much stuff there
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:07.040]  Yeah, it's like I feel like if my office is a mess at least my computer can be neat and it's so much
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:13.360]  It seems so much easier to clean up your desktop than it is to clean like a room. So I'd sure
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.480]  But it always blows me away when there's when I see people who have like
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:26.380]  Seriously, like a hundred two hundred things on their desktop like everything that they've ever done is on their desktop, right?
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:35.660]  Ah, it bothers things yeah, yeah, yeah it triggers like my OCD I
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.540]  Noticed though I did notice that
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.460]  so Jonas is 10 and he's
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.680]  starting to use a
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.980]  Mac way more than he used to used to really just use like iOS devices because he has like homework and stuff like that
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.140]  mm-hmm and
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.540]  without me ever like I never really like no
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:02.140]  Never really sat down and showed him like here's how to use a Mac. It was just let him figure it out on its own
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.380]  He just naturally
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.940]  Saves files to his desktop all of his files around stuff
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:13.920]  Interesting notes and stuff like that like plans around craft and things like that
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:19.740]  So I thought that was pretty interesting because I kind of wondered whether that was like an old-school
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:27.060]  Mac habit like from the old days that people have carried over or you know did like would somebody like him who's you know
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:32.180]  relative, you know really only started using a Mac in the last year or two would they
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:39.180]  Would they naturally do that and he does he just saved stuff to just naturally just saves files to his desktop
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.100]  I don't know why that is. Yes, it's surprising. Yeah
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:42.340]  Yeah
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:47.860]  Instead of I mean because I was I'm just thinking like if you are looking at it for the first time and you get a save
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.860]  dialogue for the first time
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.860]  You know, there's a default
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:58.220]  Directory in the sidebar called document. So I would imagine that by default people would save things to their documents folder
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.940]  But now I guess not
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:05.500]  Well, I don't know. I'm so habituated. I'm not sure like it's it's hard to be objective about it. I
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:10.500]  Wonder if it's because the desktop is like the one place where?
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:16.260]  Yeah, I know that you can you know, you can change the view options for any window in the finder to you know
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:22.420]  List or column or icon view. Yeah, but it's the one place that's always icon view and you can arrange things
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:29.420]  Spatially and say I've got this file and I want it over here on the left and it's gonna be on the left and you
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.500]  Drag it over there and it stays there as opposed to being a list
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.260]  That's my that's my hunch as to what does it but I haven't I haven't asked him
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:39.260]  Interesting. Yeah
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:44.620]  Let me take another break here and thank
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:49.060]  Our third sponsor of the show. It's our good friends at igloo
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:55.400]  Igloo is the internet that doesn't suck. That's my slogan for them
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.560]  They call themselves the internet that you'll actually like
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:07.260]  Intranets are typically ugly they're badly designed and the people on your team your company
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:13.580]  They typically wind up avoiding them and just email each other back and forth and send file attachments and they just use email for everything
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:22.460]  Igloo is totally different. It's the internet. You'll actually like and you get all sorts of cool features. They have a
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:28.540]  Twitter like micro blog so imagine like a version of Twitter that was just for your team
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.920]  Internal totally private just for your your team
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:38.760]  They have that they have file sharing you can put comments on everything
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.660]  And the design of the intranet of your igloo
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:50.800]  Can match your brand and it matches across all devices because all of their templates are responsive
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:57.580]  So everything looks good on iPads. It looks good on your phone. It looks good on your retina 5k Mac
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:06.020]  Easy to use easy to set up and it requires no technical expertise at all to set it up
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500]  They have a sandwich video
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:17.180]  For those of you who don't know that's Adam Lisa Gore's company a funny funny video that shows exactly what's different about igloo
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.620]  Compared to everything else and other types of intranets
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.800]  Go to their website and check it out and you can see this cool video
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.400]  and
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:35.360]  Here's the best part igloo is free to use for up to ten people not for a month just in perpetuity
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:42.720]  So if your team is ten or fewer people you can sign up for igloo and just use it and you'll never owe them a
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:50.160]  Nickel you just use it if your team is bigger than ten people you can try it for free. No credit card
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:56.960]  just sign up try it and have ten people use it to test it and see if it everything I say about it is true and
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:03.480]  Then once you decide to use it you pay it's really really low price per user after ten people
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.860]  I don't even know how that's possible though that if for up to ten people, you know, just use it for free
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:17.200]  So if you're curious at all, why not try it why not check it out because it's free just go sign up and try it
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.280]  It's free
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.660]  Really really cool. Here's where you go go to
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.600]  www.igloo
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.720]  software.com
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:32.940]  Slash the talk show igloo software.com slash the talk show and they'll know you came from here
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  So my thanks to igloo
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:42.600]  The other week I I had Merlin Merlin man on the show and
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:49.600]  This is what we call follow-up, I guess you're supposed to do this at the beginning of a podcast, but I forgot
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.000]  I have a note here
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.920]  We were talking about Roman numerals and what a pain in the acid is with the Super Bowl because it's like xxx xvi
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.360]  something something and you never know what Super Bowl it is and I
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.600]  said
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.600]  That when they had Super Bowl 50
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:14.120]  Which would be Super Bowl L that they should have that's when they should have dropped the Roman numerals stick and just on with yes
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.680]  Well, yeah turns it turns out Super Bowl 50 hasn't happened yet
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.760]  It's next year next year is Super Bowl 50 it's gonna be in San Francisco and
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.160]  They've already announced that that's exactly what they're going to do
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.100]  They're gonna drop the Roman numeral stick and it's just Super Bowl 5-0 Super Bowl 50
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.100]  nice
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.660]  So nice because I think that's so much better and not nice
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.380]  Because because I spent like five minutes on the podcast two weeks ago saying
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:51.820]  Complaining that that's what they they should have done a couple years ago when Super Bowl 50 happened, but it hasn't happened
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:58.140]  So let me get that out there because I keep getting email from people saying dude Super Bowl 50 is next year
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.140]  And they're doing exactly what you said. I
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.620]  Can't take any credit for it though because they asked it well before the show
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.620]  So
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.880]  The got that out there. All right. Here's a question for you. Okay
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.420]  With the
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.280]  Watch kit SDK that Apple released this week
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.260]  Apple included what they called
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:24.780]  design resources something like that the thing that they've come with the font, but it also came with a bunch of
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.980]  PSD files Photoshop files for
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:34.220]  Both software layouts and things like it's like a
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.740]  Typographic grid that shows you all of the type sizes
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.620]  And
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.420]  It's not specified by like a number like saying. Oh, give me 16 point font
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:50.300]  It's like give me caption. Give me headline. Give me. Oh, yeah
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:58.240]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, they have all of those sort of styles established and they're they're really they want you to stick with their established styles, right?
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:08.140]  Right and using those styles means that you don't have to worry about the difference in physical size between the 38 millimeter watch and
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:15.020]  Right and presumably maybe next year or two years from now, maybe there'll be a 44 millimeter watch
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:20.380]  And maybe there will be a 36 millimeter one and your your stuff will all just work because it's all
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.380]  Relative sizes and stuff like that
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:28.780]  Which I think is probably the way to go. I think it's you know, yeah, I think it definitely is
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:34.300]  Clever and yeah, that's smart way to set it up from the outset. Here's my question
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:39.060]  My question is I thought it was so interesting that they shipped all these things as PSD files
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:45.500]  Do you do you as a designer? Do you do you do a lot of your work in Photoshop? Oh, yes every yeah
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.460]  That's that's mostly what I use eight hours a day is Photoshop
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:57.760]  Yeah, there just really isn't anything that's like more versatile or better for doing what I do not yet anyway
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.460]  So yeah, I spent I spent a lot of time in Photoshop
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:06.180]  I thought that was so interesting that it was sort of to me like a concession that
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:12.000]  The Photoshop is the de facto standard UI design tool, right? Yeah, I think it definitely is
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  I mean, I think it's sort of industry standard
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.680]  But it's interesting. I mean, it's funny that but they do that with the typefaces because
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:27.080]  Just the way that Photoshop renders text is terrible. I mean, especially compared to like the way that just
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.600]  spend renders
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.920]  Plants like it's I don't know you have these different, you know, like you can you can change
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.980]  the
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:37.980]  display of a typeface from like
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.160]  crisp to strong to smooth, you know
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.460]  So and it like changes things a little bit and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but I know everything just reads so much
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:51.380]  more clearly if it's if it's rendered programmatically rather than through Photoshop and then
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.180]  In a PSD. Yeah with work working on on Vesper with
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:03.620]  Whiskas, he does everything and he's you know a total Photoshop diehard like again like yeah
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.380]  Doing work. He's eight hours a day in Photoshop
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:11.720]  And I have to always refrain from complaining about the way type looks because I know that
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:21.980]  Yeah, it's not the same rendering path it's like yeah all text is effectively like for placement only like here's how much space it
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.060]  Will take up wait until the app is actually an app and then bitch about the type
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.980]  Right this have you heard of this app sketch?
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.060]  um
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.860]  No
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.300]  that's the other app when I when I
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.980]  twittered that
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:45.220]  Pointing out that you know that Apple shipped all these things as Photoshop things and that it's the de facto standard
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:51.140]  And I got all these people saying that no everybody's using sketch these days to do
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:57.000]  I'm twisting to do UI design and it looks like a cool app. I've never used it
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.760]  But yeah, I'm looking at it now on the website and I think it looks familiar
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.720]  I think I like someone has linked to it before and I just haven't really given it the time of day yet
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.000]  but yeah, it's something to check out for sure, but you know, I
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.000]  Often look into other like UI design prototyping tools things like that
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.400]  And and sometimes I use them like supplement only but yeah, I don't know
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.160]  I just still like live in Photoshop for for most of the time
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:27.440]  no, and and you do you have like super like complex like layers and
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.400]  Yeah, well just yeah tons and tons of groups that I turn off and on for different
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.160]  You know views within and different states within a view. So
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.840]  Yeah, it's it gets pretty complicated. It's like one of my favorite things
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.900]  I don't really use Photoshop anymore personally
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:50.700]  but I like to watch somebody who's really good at Photoshop use Photoshop and then they quick click through and they have all these groups and
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:55.920]  Like all of a sudden what you're looking at on screen is like totally different and it's like well, how'd you do that? I love
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.680]  Krista, Morgan, thank you. Thank you so much for coming back. It has been telling so much for having me. Yeah, it's fantastic
