[00:00.000 --> 00:02.360]  So you have an iPhone X or X, right?
[00:02.360 --> 00:03.200]  What are we gonna call it?
[00:03.200 --> 00:04.780]  We're gonna call it the iPhone 10.
[00:04.780 --> 00:05.620]  10, yeah.
[00:05.620 --> 00:06.440]  What are you calling it?
[00:06.440 --> 00:07.280]  Are you calling it?
[00:07.280 --> 00:08.720]  Do you accidentally say X?
[00:08.720 --> 00:10.720]  I accidentally say X all the time.
[00:11.560 --> 00:13.680]  No, I didn't.
[00:13.680 --> 00:15.200]  I don't know why.
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.320]  It's because I see it.
[00:16.320 --> 00:18.000]  I see an X, I say an X,
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.800]  and I never had that problem with OS X.
[00:20.800 --> 00:23.000]  I never called it OS X.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.200]  It was always OS X,
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.920]  but I guess that's because I was counting
[00:25.920 --> 00:29.680]  and I knew that iOS or Mac OS 9 was before,
[00:29.680 --> 00:30.840]  but I keep catching myself.
[00:30.840 --> 00:31.960]  And I'm not, so if I say it,
[00:31.960 --> 00:34.280]  if I say iPhone X during the show,
[00:34.280 --> 00:35.640]  I'm not trying to be cute.
[00:35.640 --> 00:38.120]  I'm making a mistake that I wish I wasn't making.
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.000]  Understood.
[00:41.480 --> 00:42.740]  Well, you have one too.
[00:42.740 --> 00:43.580]  I do.
[00:43.580 --> 00:45.600]  I got mine yesterday in New York.
[00:45.600 --> 00:46.640]  So long story short,
[00:46.640 --> 00:48.240]  we can talk about the meta story,
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.320]  but long story short,
[00:49.320 --> 00:50.960]  there were only, I think,
[00:50.960 --> 00:54.100]  nine reviewers around the world
[00:54.100 --> 00:55.440]  who got a full week with it.
[00:55.440 --> 00:56.280]  Three in the US.
[00:56.280 --> 00:59.400]  Matthew, friend of the show, Matthew Pansarino,
[00:59.400 --> 01:01.880]  Nicole McGowan from Buzzfeed,
[01:01.880 --> 01:03.480]  who's been doing some really interesting work.
[01:03.480 --> 01:04.760]  I really like her style.
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.780]  And Lance Ulinoff from Mashable.
[01:11.300 --> 01:12.140]  So they got like-
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.600]  I'll be honest, that one surprises me.
[01:14.600 --> 01:15.440]  A little bit,
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.520]  but Lance has been getting an awful lot of
[01:21.360 --> 01:22.480]  exclusives, really.
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.920]  I mean, he had an exclusive with the
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.640]  Johnny Srouji's team for the Bionic A11 chip.
[01:33.640 --> 01:35.100]  He had one a couple of years ago,
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.720]  I think it was back around 2015,
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.200]  about the new MacBook.
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.040]  Do you remember that one?
[01:39.040 --> 01:39.860]  Yeah.
[01:39.860 --> 01:41.840]  Or he got some on the record time with Schiller.
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.500]  And then there was a third one, I forget.
[01:43.500 --> 01:45.840]  I forget which the third one was.
[01:45.840 --> 01:48.240]  Yeah, he's been doing a lot of stuff.
[01:48.240 --> 01:49.080]  Yeah.
[01:49.080 --> 01:50.820]  Two guys from the UK,
[01:50.820 --> 01:51.760]  two guys in China,
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.320]  a guy in Japan,
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.120]  somebody from Australia.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.560]  But not the usual suspects,
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.560]  not the usual round of reviewers.
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.440]  Nobody from the Wall Street Journal,
[02:04.800 --> 02:06.360]  nobody from the New York Times,
[02:07.280 --> 02:08.660]  apparently nobody from TV.
[02:08.660 --> 02:10.980]  Although I guess they sent that kid to the Ellen show.
[02:10.980 --> 02:13.180]  Did you see that kid at the event last month?
[02:14.100 --> 02:15.640]  I did.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.480]  I did not meet him.
[02:16.480 --> 02:17.300]  I did see him.
[02:17.300 --> 02:18.140]  I did not meet him,
[02:18.140 --> 02:18.960]  but I'll tell you what,
[02:18.960 --> 02:20.900]  that kid really impresses me.
[02:20.900 --> 02:22.160]  Were we talking about this before?
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.520]  I was telling you that,
[02:23.520 --> 02:25.440]  in addition to the fact that he's 12 years old
[02:25.440 --> 02:26.560]  and is a developer
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.780]  and is already a successful TV personality
[02:29.780 --> 02:31.320]  on the Ellen DeGeneres show,
[02:31.320 --> 02:33.940]  he's also a sharper dresser
[02:33.940 --> 02:35.680]  than I've ever been in my entire life.
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.000]  Yeah.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.880]  Like maybe when I got married,
[02:40.880 --> 02:42.680]  maybe there was like one or two times in my life
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.600]  where I cleaned up sharp enough
[02:44.600 --> 02:45.880]  that I could compete with that kid.
[02:45.880 --> 02:47.160]  But I love that.
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.240]  I think that's great.
[02:49.240 --> 02:50.480]  Well, it doesn't take much to address me.
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.320]  I have black t-shirt and jeans.
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.480]  So, you know, I'm good no matter what.
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.480]  But anyway, I think people were a little surprised
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.760]  by Apple's new review strategy.
[03:02.760 --> 03:06.400]  I feel like what they've done is hit the reset button.
[03:06.400 --> 03:09.160]  Like, and they've sort of used this opportunity
[03:09.160 --> 03:12.560]  with this device to completely reset
[03:12.560 --> 03:14.800]  the way that they're doing reviews.
[03:14.800 --> 03:15.640]  I agree.
[03:15.640 --> 03:16.460]  I agree they have.
[03:16.460 --> 03:17.800]  And that shows.
[03:17.800 --> 03:22.400]  It shows in the way that they started rolling them out.
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.400]  You know, we had YouTubers.
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.780]  I met one yesterday when I was getting my phone.
[03:32.000 --> 03:32.840]  Where'd you go?
[03:32.840 --> 03:34.120]  You went to Cupertino.
[03:34.120 --> 03:35.600]  Cupertino, yeah.
[03:35.600 --> 03:36.600]  Yeah.
[03:36.600 --> 03:39.800]  So it was a whole different strategy for them this time.
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.640]  And it's interesting to see it all play out, you know?
[03:43.640 --> 03:45.200]  Cause that's not something that we've seen
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.560]  from Apple before.
[03:46.560 --> 03:49.000]  I think that where they were,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.960]  I don't know how many people got like the iPhone 8,
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.400]  you know, how many people are on the,
[03:54.400 --> 03:57.220]  get like a week with the last few iPhones.
[03:57.220 --> 03:59.580]  But that number has gotten got big.
[03:59.580 --> 04:01.100]  Like I think it was up in the 30s.
[04:01.100 --> 04:03.080]  Like, I don't know if that's worldwide or not,
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.140]  but maybe just US that there were 30 some reviewers of,
[04:07.140 --> 04:08.100]  I don't know if the iPhone 8,
[04:08.100 --> 04:09.940]  but at least like iPhone 7 last year.
[04:10.860 --> 04:13.320]  And I can't help but think that Apple took a look at that
[04:13.320 --> 04:15.360]  and thought, you know what, this is too many.
[04:15.360 --> 04:17.200]  And they're all doing the same things
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.920]  and or they're doing goofy stuff, you know,
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.840]  like trying to set up face ID with a dog
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.640]  or something like that.
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.600]  And rather than, my sense is that rather
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.280]  than slowly scale that back, they like, like I said,
[04:31.280 --> 04:34.420]  hit the reset button, started over from scratch and said,
[04:34.420 --> 04:36.520]  let's have a handful of people come out
[04:37.720 --> 04:40.440]  and let's expand it to new people like these,
[04:40.440 --> 04:43.080]  the YouTube kids and whatever else.
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.160]  Well, yeah, and I guess we'll, we'll see how it all works.
[04:47.160 --> 04:52.160]  I mean, you know, like you were mentioning yesterday,
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.520]  some of the people that did the original iPhone review
[04:56.520 --> 05:00.400]  other than Steven Levy, aren't even around, you know,
[05:00.400 --> 05:02.680]  Walt's not around, but there are a couple that are,
[05:02.680 --> 05:05.120]  Ed Begg and I forget who else you mentioned in there.
[05:05.120 --> 05:08.080]  Yeah, David Pogue, the original four
[05:08.080 --> 05:09.480]  with the original iPhone were Pogue
[05:09.480 --> 05:10.560]  when he was at the New York Times,
[05:10.560 --> 05:12.560]  Ed Begg at the USA Today.
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.720]  Walt was at the Wall Street Journal at the time.
[05:15.720 --> 05:19.080]  And Steven Levy was at Newsweek at the time.
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.880]  And Levy was always sort of the exception
[05:21.880 --> 05:23.760]  where it's like back then,
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.220]  Apple strategy was three biggest newspapers in the US
[05:27.220 --> 05:28.720]  and you know, probably around the world,
[05:28.720 --> 05:31.320]  whoever writes for the biggest newspaper, that's it.
[05:32.680 --> 05:34.080]  And people laugh at USA Today,
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.720]  but USA Today is I think number one newspaper.
[05:36.720 --> 05:40.360]  I mean, you kind of can't underestimate
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.820]  how many people read USA Today
[05:41.820 --> 05:45.360]  because it's like the free newspaper in all the hotels.
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.680]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[05:47.680 --> 05:49.880]  I mean, that's huge.
[05:49.880 --> 05:53.880]  I didn't see if Ed posted something today, did he?
[05:53.880 --> 05:54.740]  I don't know, I don't think so.
[05:54.740 --> 05:56.880]  But if he did, he didn't get it till yesterday.
[05:56.880 --> 05:57.800]  So that's the question.
[05:57.800 --> 06:02.800]  The question was like the way that this used to work was,
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.440]  you know, part of it was that this phone is weird
[06:06.440 --> 06:08.320]  because there wasn't an event either.
[06:08.320 --> 06:10.400]  But you know, just as the background,
[06:10.400 --> 06:12.040]  people seem to forget the timing of this,
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.100]  but the background for the last few years of iPhones
[06:15.100 --> 06:18.180]  is that either the afternoon after the event
[06:18.180 --> 06:20.120]  or the day after the event,
[06:20.120 --> 06:22.120]  anybody who's gonna get a review unit
[06:22.120 --> 06:23.740]  comes to meet with Apple.
[06:23.740 --> 06:27.080]  You get a meeting, they give you, you know,
[06:27.080 --> 06:28.760]  tell you what they want you to know about the phone,
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.080]  ask you if you have questions,
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.520]  which is an important part, right?
[06:32.520 --> 06:34.600]  I find it so much better to ask questions in person
[06:34.600 --> 06:35.800]  than like over the phone.
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.440]  It says the guy doing a podcast.
[06:41.440 --> 06:43.040]  But you know what I mean?
[06:43.040 --> 06:43.860]  I don't know.
[06:43.860 --> 06:47.640]  I just feel like you get better answers from Apple,
[06:47.640 --> 06:48.800]  even if it's off the record,
[06:48.800 --> 06:51.280]  there's more comfort in a face-to-face meeting
[06:51.280 --> 06:53.360]  than recording or not recording,
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.760]  but just talking on a phone.
[06:56.660 --> 06:59.080]  And typically there's an embargo date about a week out.
[06:59.080 --> 07:00.880]  So maybe if it's like a Tuesday event,
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.120]  the embargo date might be the next Tuesday in the morning.
[07:04.120 --> 07:06.600]  And that's when everybody's reviews, you know,
[07:06.600 --> 07:07.800]  you can't publish before that.
[07:07.800 --> 07:09.680]  And then your review is supposed to come out,
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.120]  you know, shortly thereafter.
[07:13.760 --> 07:16.480]  And this time there was an embargo,
[07:16.480 --> 07:19.360]  but it was today at 6 a.m. Eastern.
[07:19.360 --> 07:21.360]  I didn't even get the phone till noon yesterday.
[07:21.360 --> 07:23.560]  So, I mean, it's not even, you know,
[07:23.560 --> 07:26.720]  it would be 18 hours if I stayed up all night.
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.540]  Right.
[07:27.540 --> 07:29.300]  So I chose, I did not write a review.
[07:29.300 --> 07:32.720]  I posted like a, I linked to Pansarinos
[07:32.720 --> 07:33.800]  and gave some quick comments,
[07:33.800 --> 07:35.320]  like just like three or four bullet points
[07:35.320 --> 07:37.080]  of my first thought to the phone.
[07:37.080 --> 07:38.840]  But I can't see some of the sites
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.000]  that are doing reviews already.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.840]  I just can't, I can't see how they do it.
[07:42.840 --> 07:45.280]  I just can't see how you can call it a review.
[07:45.280 --> 07:46.120]  Right.
[07:46.120 --> 07:49.720]  I did, I posted something this morning,
[07:49.720 --> 07:52.180]  but I made it very clear in the first paragraph
[07:52.180 --> 07:54.380]  and I called it a first look, not a review.
[07:55.240 --> 08:00.240]  I made it very clear that I felt myself
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.760]  that it would be irresponsible to call this a review
[08:03.760 --> 08:06.240]  when I've had it for less than a day.
[08:06.240 --> 08:08.920]  But there were some of the main features
[08:08.920 --> 08:11.300]  that I felt I could comment on.
[08:11.300 --> 08:16.100]  And, you know, those were face ID
[08:16.100 --> 08:17.680]  because I had been using that
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.280]  and all the gestures that you can use.
[08:20.280 --> 08:22.040]  So, you know, I did a first look
[08:22.040 --> 08:26.040]  and I said that I would come back in a week
[08:28.500 --> 08:30.880]  after I get a chance to really use it
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.200]  and follow up on some things.
[08:33.200 --> 08:37.160]  You know, I felt from my readers
[08:37.160 --> 08:41.740]  that was the responsible way to take care of it.
[08:41.740 --> 08:46.040]  And I just, I don't feel that I could have given
[08:48.520 --> 08:53.520]  an accurate review without some more time.
[08:53.800 --> 08:57.880]  But I can comment easily on some of the things.
[08:57.880 --> 09:00.720]  I mean, I never even get a chance to take a picture.
[09:00.720 --> 09:05.000]  I was so focused on face ID that,
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.840]  and, you know, trying to figure out
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.000]  all the different gestures that you have
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  that I never really got a chance to use a whole lot else.
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.080]  And even in the time since I posted that
[09:18.080 --> 09:21.160]  at 3 a.m. Pacific time,
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.120]  I figured some things out with face ID.
[09:25.120 --> 09:26.360]  Face ID is amazing.
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.200]  It works over 99% of the time,
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.260]  but there's those few times when it wasn't working.
[09:33.260 --> 09:38.260]  And I think I might've figured out today using it, why?
[09:38.480 --> 09:42.680]  And I think my eyeglasses that I only wear
[09:42.680 --> 09:45.600]  for reading and for typing, they're bifocals.
[09:45.600 --> 09:48.620]  So I put them down on my nose a bit.
[09:48.620 --> 09:50.360]  I think it's blocking my eyes.
[09:50.360 --> 09:52.880]  I think the rim, because they have a big rim.
[09:52.880 --> 09:53.720]  I think that's what's happening.
[09:53.720 --> 09:55.280]  It's so funny that you would say that, Jim.
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.120]  I swear to you that I ran into the exact same thing.
[09:59.120 --> 10:02.760]  I, sometimes I wear contacts
[10:02.760 --> 10:04.480]  and then I have to wear reading glasses
[10:04.480 --> 10:06.440]  and other times I wear my regular glasses,
[10:06.440 --> 10:08.800]  but then I have to, I lower them on my nose
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.640]  to look at something close up with no glasses.
[10:11.640 --> 10:14.760]  So either way, I've got glasses on, glasses off all day.
[10:14.760 --> 10:16.800]  That's my lifestyle now.
[10:17.880 --> 10:20.580]  And I had the same thing where I had my regular glasses
[10:20.580 --> 10:22.880]  down on my nose and face ID fits failed
[10:22.880 --> 10:24.720]  for like the first time today.
[10:24.720 --> 10:25.760]  And I was like, what?
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.880]  Because it was like so surprising.
[10:26.880 --> 10:28.460]  Like yesterday, it was a little, you know,
[10:28.460 --> 10:31.900]  like it kinda, I think it, it just had to get used to it.
[10:31.900 --> 10:33.740]  And I think it, you know, it continues to train
[10:33.740 --> 10:34.920]  as you use it throughout the day.
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.040]  But then like today it was like, it's just every single time
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.920]  don't even think about it.
[10:38.920 --> 10:42.640]  And then when it failed, it was like a tire screeching,
[10:42.640 --> 10:43.940]  you know, like, whoa, what the heck happened?
[10:43.940 --> 10:44.780]  But it's so funny.
[10:44.780 --> 10:46.940]  It was glasses down on my nose.
[10:46.940 --> 10:51.440]  Yeah, so I think a couple of things were happening with me
[10:51.440 --> 10:53.800]  because I have attention to wear on,
[10:53.800 --> 10:57.460]  which means that you have to be looking at your phone
[10:57.460 --> 10:59.880]  in order for it to unlock.
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.200]  So I would pull up the phone and I believe
[11:04.200 --> 11:07.440]  that I was looking without really knowing it,
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.500]  I was looking at the computer while I put my phone up
[11:11.500 --> 11:14.280]  or I was looking at the bottom of the phone or something.
[11:14.280 --> 11:17.960]  Something was going on where I wasn't actually looking
[11:17.960 --> 11:22.960]  at the camera and I wasn't aware.
[11:23.600 --> 11:26.720]  So the phone did the exact right thing
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.480]  and did not unlock.
[11:29.480 --> 11:33.160]  So it's either that or the rim of my glasses
[11:33.160 --> 11:35.720]  is blocking my eyes and I can't see my eyes.
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.920]  And you know, the angle that you hold the phone up
[11:37.920 --> 11:40.120]  and the angle that you're looking,
[11:40.120 --> 11:41.980]  because typically when I put my phone up
[11:41.980 --> 11:45.280]  to unlock it with Face ID, I'm kind of looking down a bit.
[11:45.280 --> 11:48.340]  So if the glasses are right on the end of my nose
[11:48.340 --> 11:49.960]  and it's gonna block it.
[11:49.960 --> 11:52.640]  So I think it's one of those two things
[11:52.640 --> 11:56.440]  because when I deliberately pick the phone up
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.960]  and look at it, it unlocks every single time,
[11:58.960 --> 12:00.400]  even when I do it quickly.
[12:01.320 --> 12:04.700]  So that's what I think.
[12:07.320 --> 12:09.040]  Can we just talk for a second about
[12:09.040 --> 12:11.760]  that they gave a phone to Mike Allen?
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.840]  This to me is part of the befuddlement
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.880]  over their review strategy.
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.080]  Mike Allen is now the founder of Axios,
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.840]  a new website where Ina Fried is their tech writer.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.640]  And she had even said,
[12:28.640 --> 12:31.040]  we'll have their official review coming soon.
[12:31.040 --> 12:33.280]  Presumably she didn't get one until yesterday
[12:34.360 --> 12:35.840]  with all the rest of us.
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.920]  But Mike Allen did, who is not a technology writer.
[12:38.920 --> 12:39.760]  And that's okay.
[12:39.760 --> 12:41.200]  I actually think that's kind of interesting.
[12:41.200 --> 12:43.340]  Like, I don't think you need to have like a special,
[12:43.340 --> 12:47.400]  I'm a technology columnist badge or license
[12:47.400 --> 12:49.980]  to be able to do a review of an iPhone.
[12:49.980 --> 12:52.120]  Cause iPhones are for everybody, right?
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.840]  Like it's part of the fabric of modern life today.
[12:55.840 --> 12:58.240]  So I think that the perspective of somebody
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.640]  who is not an expert and is sort of like a political
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.100]  reporter, presumably who I'll bet uses his phone all day,
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.520]  talking to sources, texting, phone calls, texting messages,
[13:12.520 --> 13:15.480]  stuff like that, email, I'm sure it's a great perspective,
[13:15.480 --> 13:17.640]  but he didn't even try to write a review.
[13:17.640 --> 13:18.640]  He just, he gave the,
[13:18.640 --> 13:21.200]  he literally gave the phone to his 19 year old nephew
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.580]  and let him tell him what he thought about it.
[13:25.440 --> 13:26.800]  Like he didn't even write it.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.260]  I don't get that.
[13:29.520 --> 13:31.240]  I didn't even know you could do that.
[13:31.240 --> 13:34.160]  I thought Apple wanted you to do the review.
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.960]  I was at Apple yesterday when that happened.
[13:37.960 --> 13:40.520]  And I can tell you, you're not allowed to do that.
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.520]  The language in the NDA is pretty clear.
[13:46.680 --> 13:49.700]  You know, it's an NDA and it's written by lawyers,
[13:49.700 --> 13:50.700]  but it's pretty clear.
[13:50.700 --> 13:52.880]  I think it says something to the effect of you're allowed
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.580]  to, you know, like your immediate family can look at it
[13:55.580 --> 13:58.520]  and see it, but nobody else.
[13:58.520 --> 14:00.520]  And you're not allowed to let other people touch it.
[14:00.520 --> 14:01.360]  Literally.
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.200]  I mean, that's, I mean, I, you know,
[14:02.200 --> 14:03.480]  does everybody stick to that rule?
[14:03.480 --> 14:06.980]  I mean, I don't think so, but at least officially, you know,
[14:06.980 --> 14:08.240]  you're not supposed to.
[14:08.240 --> 14:11.780]  So putting it in your reviews that you let your nephew
[14:11.780 --> 14:12.640]  set it up.
[14:12.640 --> 14:14.120]  Set it up.
[14:14.120 --> 14:16.600]  Well, and that to me is part of the thing is it's like,
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.560]  that's the perspective you'd want from a normal person.
[14:19.560 --> 14:20.400]  Right?
[14:20.400 --> 14:22.440]  It's hard to set up, you know,
[14:22.440 --> 14:24.680]  cause normal people have to set up their own iPhones.
[14:24.680 --> 14:28.120]  And, and to me, part of what makes face ID so interesting
[14:28.120 --> 14:30.240]  was it was incredibly easy to set up.
[14:30.240 --> 14:33.200]  It was so much quicker than touch ID to set up.
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.040]  Yeah. Amazing.
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.400]  Amazing.
[14:35.400 --> 14:38.280]  A couple of the reviewers have like some screenshots
[14:38.280 --> 14:41.720]  of the process, but basically it's like a two-step process
[14:41.720 --> 14:43.280]  to set up face ID.
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.320]  You, the front camera turns on and you can see yourself
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.880]  and it says, you know, move,
[14:47.880 --> 14:49.660]  move your head around in a circle.
[14:49.660 --> 14:52.880]  I mean, more or less like I think Panzarino said,
[14:52.880 --> 14:55.800]  Apple described it as just draw a circle in the air
[14:55.800 --> 14:56.880]  with your nose.
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.720]  Right.
[14:57.720 --> 14:59.520]  Because it's not taking your photograph.
[14:59.520 --> 15:02.020]  It's not a camera, you know, I guess it's using a camera,
[15:02.020 --> 15:06.920]  but the 3D aspect of it is it's not just like the Samsung
[15:06.920 --> 15:09.160]  phones where you can fool it with a photograph, right?
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.600]  It really is like the moving your face around in a circle
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.000]  is to let it get that 3D map of your face,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.720]  not just a two dimensional picture, but a literal,
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.080]  a real 3D map, no marketing spin on the name of this.
[15:23.080 --> 15:25.400]  You know, it really is a 3D map and then it says, okay.
[15:25.400 --> 15:27.480]  And then it says, do it again and you do it again.
[15:27.480 --> 15:28.680]  And then you're in and that's it.
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.680]  It's so much faster than touch ID, just to set up.
[15:32.680 --> 15:34.160]  Boom, you're done.
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.360]  It's over.
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.000]  There's no, you know, with touch ID, you had to,
[15:39.000 --> 15:39.840]  you set it up,
[15:39.840 --> 15:41.800]  but then you had to move your finger a different way.
[15:41.800 --> 15:44.360]  And I understand why and it's fine,
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.520]  but it's interesting when you look at what Apple is doing,
[15:47.520 --> 15:52.200]  they're actually, it's not just a picture of your face.
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.200]  They're using depth on your face to activate face ID.
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.560]  So, you know, you can't fool it.
[16:01.560 --> 16:03.580]  And I know that people are trying,
[16:03.580 --> 16:05.880]  but I'm pretty confident that you're not gonna be able
[16:05.880 --> 16:07.160]  to fool it.
[16:07.160 --> 16:10.520]  And I realized that Apple is in a weird situation here
[16:10.520 --> 16:15.080]  where they can't make these phones fast enough.
[16:15.080 --> 16:15.900]  I mean, I don't know what,
[16:15.900 --> 16:17.720]  how far out they're pre-ordered already,
[16:17.720 --> 16:20.820]  but last I looked, it was four to six weeks or something.
[16:22.880 --> 16:27.640]  So it's not like a lack of reviews today or this week
[16:27.640 --> 16:30.760]  is going to hurt the number of iPhones they can sell.
[16:30.760 --> 16:32.760]  They're gonna sell everyone they can make.
[16:33.760 --> 16:35.140]  But people are curious about it.
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.120]  And the number one thing people are curious about
[16:37.120 --> 16:40.560]  is face ID because they love touch ID.
[16:40.560 --> 16:42.880]  People have grown to love it and they're familiar with it
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.360]  and they trust it.
[16:44.360 --> 16:47.040]  And face ID is new and different.
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.920]  And every other phone that's tried to do this before
[16:50.920 --> 16:52.040]  has failed.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.040]  People wanna know.
[16:54.040 --> 16:58.680]  And so I feel like not having as many reviews as usual
[16:58.680 --> 16:59.500]  where people can say,
[16:59.500 --> 17:01.020]  look, I've been using this thing all week.
[17:01.020 --> 17:02.740]  Here's my thoughts on face ID.
[17:02.740 --> 17:04.680]  It just is unsatisfying.
[17:04.680 --> 17:06.900]  Again, you can argue, you could say,
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.640]  well, maybe I'm just being selfish.
[17:08.640 --> 17:10.640]  And I've, you know, the last couple of years
[17:10.640 --> 17:12.580]  I've had review units for a week
[17:12.580 --> 17:16.080]  and I'm jealous or bitter or whatever.
[17:16.080 --> 17:17.080]  I mean, if that's what you think,
[17:17.080 --> 17:19.900]  I mean, I can't disobeys you of the notion,
[17:19.900 --> 17:22.560]  but that's not really it.
[17:22.560 --> 17:24.440]  It's, you know, leave me out of it.
[17:24.440 --> 17:25.460]  Even if I didn't get one.
[17:25.460 --> 17:27.440]  I still, I wanna know what Joanna Stern thinks of it
[17:27.440 --> 17:28.440]  after a week, right?
[17:28.440 --> 17:31.560]  I wanna know what Neelay Patel thinks of it after a week.
[17:31.560 --> 17:33.520]  You know, I wanna know what Jason Snell thinks
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.220]  about the iPhone after a week.
[17:36.800 --> 17:37.640]  I don't know.
[17:37.640 --> 17:38.540]  I think it's so weird.
[17:38.540 --> 17:40.240]  And I think people are just unsatisfied.
[17:40.240 --> 17:41.980]  I mean, so like our day one reaction,
[17:41.980 --> 17:42.920]  we can sit here and say,
[17:42.920 --> 17:45.160]  hey, this is really good for day one,
[17:45.160 --> 17:47.080]  but it's, you know, it's day one.
[17:48.320 --> 17:53.320]  The thought on the internet is that you're,
[17:53.680 --> 17:55.920]  you didn't get one at all, which is not true.
[17:55.920 --> 17:56.960]  You did get one.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.160]  And then they think that you're complaining
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.320]  because you didn't get one early enough.
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.160]  Right.
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.120]  That's what Twitter seems to be.
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.240]  Yeah, but you know what though,
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.280]  and that's why, this is why people don't complain about,
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.960]  you know, like privately, I got,
[18:15.960 --> 18:18.480]  after I posted a few things last night about,
[18:18.480 --> 18:21.440]  oh, thank God Apple seeded these YouTubers,
[18:21.440 --> 18:22.760]  or the one that was really good was the,
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.080]  thank God Mike Allen got one.
[18:24.080 --> 18:26.040]  So that is the 19 year old nephew,
[18:26.040 --> 18:29.580]  the emoji expert can tell us what he thinks about it.
[18:30.480 --> 18:33.200]  And the reason other people don't tweet stuff like that
[18:33.200 --> 18:35.760]  is because they don't wanna deal with the blowback
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.520]  from the people who are saying that I'm bitter or whatever.
[18:38.520 --> 18:39.360]  I don't care.
[18:39.360 --> 18:41.600]  I don't, I think it's,
[18:41.600 --> 18:44.360]  I don't think this was a good review strategy for Apple.
[18:44.360 --> 18:46.160]  And again, not selfishly, I just don't,
[18:46.160 --> 18:47.640]  I just think it's unsatisfying.
[18:47.640 --> 18:51.080]  I think that, ignore me, ignore what people are saying
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.000]  about what I vlogged last night.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.080]  But I just look on Twitter and I see people
[18:56.080 --> 18:58.800]  who have tons of questions and just people,
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.360]  like the type of people who listen to the show
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.320]  and who read our websites, like they have tons of questions
[19:03.320 --> 19:05.880]  and they're not answered and they would be
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.240]  if there were a wider range of reviews.
[19:08.240 --> 19:10.640]  And I totally get the idea that Apple wants
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.520]  to expand the media that they're reaching
[19:13.520 --> 19:15.200]  and that YouTube is where young people go
[19:15.200 --> 19:18.120]  to get their news and to read, you know, to reviews.
[19:18.120 --> 19:20.560]  Like reviews that aren't on YouTube don't reach young people
[19:20.560 --> 19:22.160]  like that's all my kid watches.
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.000]  Like he's super into video games.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.600]  What would you have done differently?
[19:26.600 --> 19:29.320]  I would have, I would have,
[19:29.320 --> 19:32.600]  I would have done the expansion to YouTube,
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.560]  invite them in for the hands-on last week,
[19:34.560 --> 19:35.380]  do the same thing.
[19:35.380 --> 19:36.220]  Although I think honestly,
[19:36.220 --> 19:38.560]  I think they could have picked better YouTubers.
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.940]  I don't even think they picked the best YouTubers.
[19:45.220 --> 19:47.880]  Like MKBHD only got his yesterday.
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.960]  Why he should have, he should have the phone for a week.
[19:49.960 --> 19:50.800]  Why not?
[19:50.800 --> 19:53.500]  I can't see why you wouldn't want,
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.920]  why wouldn't you want him to have the phone for a week
[19:55.920 --> 19:57.000]  when the reviews drop?
[19:58.520 --> 20:02.440]  So I would have done it just as an expansion, you know?
[20:02.440 --> 20:04.840]  Yes, add these YouTubers and sure,
[20:04.840 --> 20:07.040]  if you want to call the list of reviewers, you could call it,
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.680]  but I'd have certainly have had more than three
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.280]  in the United States.
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.240]  That's an interesting number for the entire US,
[20:14.240 --> 20:18.080]  but you know, they had a strategy going into it.
[20:18.080 --> 20:23.080]  So I think it's important that people know
[20:23.640 --> 20:26.360]  that you did get one,
[20:26.360 --> 20:29.440]  that even though you didn't post a review,
[20:29.440 --> 20:33.840]  I mean, I had people even tweeting me today and said,
[20:33.840 --> 20:36.600]  you know, that you were upset that you didn't get one.
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.960]  And I didn't want to say, cause it's not my place.
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.720]  Well, we did get one.
[20:40.720 --> 20:44.920]  You know, it's not that he didn't, he has one.
[20:44.920 --> 20:46.640]  So, anyway.
[20:46.640 --> 20:48.560]  I actually posted, just before we started recording,
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.220]  I actually posted my reviewed roundup
[20:50.220 --> 20:51.740]  where I said that I got one yesterday
[20:51.740 --> 20:54.160]  and my four bullet points, you know,
[20:54.160 --> 20:57.760]  and then I linked to some excerpts from Panzarino's
[20:57.760 --> 20:59.800]  and Naguen's reviews.
[20:59.800 --> 21:01.800]  So as we speak, people know that I have one,
[21:01.800 --> 21:03.520]  but I wasn't going to wake up at six in the morning
[21:03.520 --> 21:05.720]  just to write, I got an iPhone yesterday
[21:05.720 --> 21:07.220]  and it's okay so far.
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.060]  Published.
[21:09.040 --> 21:09.880]  Yeah.
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.000]  But so will you post a review?
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.440]  Oh, definitely.
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.840]  I don't know who knows when.
[21:19.520 --> 21:22.560]  The way I write, it might be December, but no, definitely.
[21:22.560 --> 21:24.200]  I think it's way too interesting.
[21:25.640 --> 21:26.460]  Yeah.
[21:26.460 --> 21:29.640]  Well, I'm going to post a follow up to the points.
[21:29.640 --> 21:32.240]  I mean, if you look at what I wrote yesterday,
[21:32.240 --> 21:33.780]  most of it is on Face ID,
[21:33.780 --> 21:37.400]  just because I was so fascinated with Face ID.
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.920]  It overwhelms the initial,
[21:39.920 --> 21:42.720]  like to me, the two things that overwhelm
[21:42.720 --> 21:45.560]  the initial few hours with the device
[21:45.560 --> 21:48.200]  are Face ID and the lack of a home button.
[21:48.200 --> 21:51.380]  And we could do a whole segment on that and we will.
[21:51.380 --> 21:52.680]  But let me take a break here.
[21:52.680 --> 21:56.600]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor,
[21:56.600 --> 21:58.300]  our good friends at Squarespace.
[21:59.700 --> 22:00.640]  Make your next move.
[22:00.640 --> 22:01.840]  Make your next website.
[22:01.840 --> 22:04.900]  And when you do, do it with Squarespace.
[22:04.900 --> 22:08.120]  I keep telling you guys, Squarespace is easy to use.
[22:08.120 --> 22:09.360]  It is so easy to use.
[22:09.360 --> 22:11.160]  It is drag and drop.
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.200]  You choose templates.
[22:12.200 --> 22:15.120]  You drag the elements that you want out for your website.
[22:16.560 --> 22:19.900]  But, and I know my audience, if you are a nerd,
[22:19.900 --> 22:21.580]  like you can have it both ways,
[22:21.580 --> 22:22.700]  where if you want to dig in
[22:22.700 --> 22:24.840]  and like put your own JavaScript code in there,
[22:24.840 --> 22:26.600]  if you want to hand edit the CSS,
[22:26.600 --> 22:27.900]  you can do stuff like that.
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.360]  But it's just a powerful, powerful platform.
[22:31.360 --> 22:34.000]  And they literally let you,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.920]  they do handle everything from domain name registration
[22:36.920 --> 22:38.780]  to the actual hosting,
[22:38.780 --> 22:41.320]  where you don't have to log in with SSH
[22:41.320 --> 22:43.640]  and manage a Linux server or anything like that.
[22:43.640 --> 22:47.440]  It's all handled, all fast, all reliable.
[22:47.440 --> 22:49.360]  They have 24 hour tech support.
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.000]  If you do need help with something,
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.400]  you can get a real person on the phone, 24 hours a day.
[22:55.400 --> 22:57.480]  It's just a fantastic service.
[22:57.480 --> 23:00.500]  And I was just talking to Squarespace this week
[23:00.500 --> 23:03.640]  about what they want to do in the fourth quarter.
[23:03.640 --> 23:05.760]  And they were even saying that they're still getting,
[23:05.760 --> 23:07.400]  you think like, well, why in the world is Squarespace
[23:07.400 --> 23:08.440]  still sponsoring a talk show?
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.280]  I mean, we all know that.
[23:09.280 --> 23:11.120]  I mean, they've been sponsoring it for years.
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.920]  They're on all the time.
[23:12.920 --> 23:16.600]  But they get a tremendous response from the audience.
[23:16.600 --> 23:18.560]  They really, they are like this,
[23:18.560 --> 23:20.780]  they know how often they sponsor my stuff.
[23:20.780 --> 23:24.140]  And they also know how many people use the code.
[23:24.140 --> 23:25.240]  And it's apparently a lot.
[23:25.240 --> 23:27.200]  So I must be doing something right
[23:27.200 --> 23:28.220]  telling you about Squarespace.
[23:28.220 --> 23:29.060]  I'm telling you right now,
[23:29.060 --> 23:29.880]  next time you need a website,
[23:29.880 --> 23:30.800]  where you should go first,
[23:30.800 --> 23:32.600]  spend an hour on it at Squarespace.
[23:32.600 --> 23:37.100]  And if you're not halfway done or even fully done,
[23:38.040 --> 23:39.160]  maybe then try something else.
[23:39.160 --> 23:40.440]  But if you don't try Squarespace first,
[23:40.440 --> 23:43.440]  you're just making busy work for yourself.
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.240]  So just go to squarespace.com,
[23:45.240 --> 23:46.360]  start making your website.
[23:46.360 --> 23:47.720]  And then all you have to remember,
[23:47.720 --> 23:49.800]  there's no special code for the URL.
[23:49.800 --> 23:52.640]  Just remember the talk show or not the talk show,
[23:52.640 --> 23:55.860]  just talk show, no the, no the, just talk show.
[23:55.860 --> 23:58.760]  Use that code when you sign up to pay
[23:58.760 --> 24:01.160]  and you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[24:01.160 --> 24:03.060]  And you can pay for a whole year in advance,
[24:03.060 --> 24:05.480]  save 10%, it's like getting,
[24:05.480 --> 24:07.800]  I don't know, it's like getting more than a month for free.
[24:07.800 --> 24:08.640]  So there you go.
[24:08.640 --> 24:09.700]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[24:10.900 --> 24:12.000]  So the lack of a home button,
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.840]  that's to me is the next dominating aspect of this phone.
[24:19.120 --> 24:21.880]  And I'll just add in as a side note,
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.440]  and as a very noted critic of the notch,
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.000]  I don't notice the notch.
[24:28.000 --> 24:28.840]  I really don't.
[24:28.840 --> 24:29.960]  I still don't like it,
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.840]  but I have to say in use,
[24:31.840 --> 24:36.840]  exactly as told to me by Apple product marketing people,
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.000]  you stop noticing it.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.920]  It's like your eyes just don't go to the top that often.
[24:43.800 --> 24:45.000]  Well, and that's what I found.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.240]  And that's what I wrote yesterday.
[24:46.240 --> 24:48.680]  I wanted to get the notch thing out of the way.
[24:48.680 --> 24:50.880]  It was the first thing that I talked about.
[24:50.880 --> 24:54.940]  And I said, I look at the screen,
[24:54.940 --> 24:59.520]  I look at the content of what I'm trying to do there.
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.120]  And the notch is not part of that.
[25:01.120 --> 25:02.520]  It's not like the notch is sitting right
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.400]  in the middle of the screen,
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.240]  where you're cursing at it every time you look at it.
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.840]  I only think about it when I want to think about it.
[25:09.840 --> 25:10.720]  And I think, hey, you know what?
[25:10.720 --> 25:12.520]  I haven't really looked at that notch in a while.
[25:12.520 --> 25:13.440]  And I stare at it and I think,
[25:13.440 --> 25:14.760]  I still think it looks stupid.
[25:14.760 --> 25:15.600]  I don't know.
[25:15.600 --> 25:16.440]  I don't know.
[25:16.440 --> 25:20.480]  You're not supposed to do that, John.
[25:20.480 --> 25:23.360]  But it doesn't just pop into my head nonstop,
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.040]  like the lack of a home button does.
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.440]  The home button thing is just over and over and over again.
[25:29.440 --> 25:31.460]  Maybe like one day in, what am I at here?
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.600]  I'm at about 28 hours into using this phone.
[25:35.600 --> 25:36.680]  I believe it.
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.320]  Panzerino said it takes about three or four days
[25:39.320 --> 25:40.760]  and then it just clicks.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.280]  And then by like his sixth day,
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.680]  when he went back to his iPhone 8,
[25:44.680 --> 25:47.280]  he was swiping up instead of pressing the home button
[25:48.680 --> 25:50.200]  that your habits reverse.
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.040]  But 10 years of home button habits, it's hard to break.
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.400]  It really is.
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.400]  And I think part of doing these reviews and looking at this,
[26:02.040 --> 26:04.920]  I think that we're hyper aware
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.800]  of a lot of these different things.
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.600]  And I was so hyper aware of it
[26:09.600 --> 26:12.240]  that after a couple of hours yesterday,
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.000]  when I would pick up the phone,
[26:16.400 --> 26:18.480]  I was trying to pick up the phone
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.920]  and swipe at the same time,
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.920]  because that's the way that I've seen people at Apple do it
[26:26.560 --> 26:29.720]  and it's so quick and yes, that does work.
[26:29.720 --> 26:32.880]  So I was so aware of trying to do that,
[26:32.880 --> 26:34.720]  that I wasn't looking for the home button
[26:34.720 --> 26:36.500]  after a couple of hours.
[26:37.560 --> 26:39.560]  So that made a big difference for me.
[26:42.180 --> 26:45.960]  In practice and some of this stuff,
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.040]  it's like, I think everybody is, from the reviews I've read,
[26:49.040 --> 26:51.520]  it just seems like everybody's consensus is the same,
[26:51.520 --> 26:56.520]  is that in practice, the key to understanding face ID
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.320]  is that it doesn't feel like a step.
[27:00.320 --> 27:02.600]  It doesn't feel like one of the steps
[27:02.600 --> 27:06.040]  to unlocking your phone is engaging touch ID.
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.400]  You just stare at your phone,
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.580]  you swipe up from the bottom and you're at home screen
[27:11.580 --> 27:13.120]  or back where you were or whatever,
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.900]  wherever you were before the phone was locked.
[27:14.900 --> 27:17.360]  It's exactly, it feels exactly
[27:17.360 --> 27:19.660]  like not having a passcode, period.
[27:20.760 --> 27:21.680]  Right, yeah.
[27:22.840 --> 27:23.880]  And I think back-
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.160]  If you do it that way, that's exactly what it feels like.
[27:27.160 --> 27:29.600]  And I think back to the,
[27:30.840 --> 27:32.600]  I don't wanna make too big a deal
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.920]  out of the 10th anniversary thing.
[27:33.920 --> 27:36.480]  And I really don't think that that's,
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.880]  I think that was a goal,
[27:37.880 --> 27:40.440]  but it's not like Apple could have shipped this phone
[27:40.440 --> 27:42.800]  a year ago and held it.
[27:42.800 --> 27:45.640]  And it's not like if it had been ready a year ago,
[27:45.640 --> 27:47.160]  they wouldn't have shipped it, right?
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.440]  They weren't gonna just wait a year
[27:49.440 --> 27:51.720]  so that they could have it on the 10th anniversary year.
[27:51.720 --> 27:52.940]  I mean, nobody cares.
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.960]  But you can't help but think back,
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.200]  10 is a nice round number because of the number,
[28:00.200 --> 28:02.060]  at least in our system.
[28:04.880 --> 28:07.280]  I think back to the original iPhone
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.680]  and when it was unveiled on stage at Mac world.
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.160]  And it really was, it sounds silly,
[28:15.160 --> 28:20.080]  but one of the biggest features was slide to unlock.
[28:20.080 --> 28:21.040]  Right?
[28:21.040 --> 28:23.660]  Because it emphasized everything about the phone.
[28:23.660 --> 28:27.920]  It was the touchscreen and the whole thing is a screen.
[28:27.920 --> 28:29.000]  It's just a touchscreen,
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.080]  but how do you keep it from making pocket calls
[28:33.080 --> 28:34.880]  when it's in your purse or your pocket or whatever?
[28:34.880 --> 28:35.840]  Well, it's locked.
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.600]  And then how do you unlock it?
[28:37.600 --> 28:40.380]  There's a big button and it says slide to unlock
[28:40.380 --> 28:41.760]  and you slide it across the screen
[28:41.760 --> 28:44.080]  and you're unlocked and you're in.
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.880]  And when Jobs did it, everybody like oohed and awed
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.060]  because it looked cool.
[28:51.060 --> 28:55.680]  And it also looked like super brain dead easy.
[28:55.680 --> 28:57.800]  Like nobody even needs to be told how to do it.
[28:57.800 --> 29:00.800]  It actually told you right there in the interface,
[29:00.800 --> 29:02.800]  in the little channel that the slider went on,
[29:02.800 --> 29:04.920]  it said slide to unlock.
[29:04.920 --> 29:07.040]  And it even had like that beautiful animation,
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.800]  like a glossy like highlight that went in the direction
[29:11.800 --> 29:14.180]  you were supposed to slide the thing to unlock.
[29:14.180 --> 29:15.240]  But if you think about it,
[29:15.240 --> 29:17.620]  it was like we were so collectively,
[29:17.620 --> 29:18.840]  it's only 10 years ago,
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.000]  but collectively we as a society were so naive
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.080]  about device security that,
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.240]  I mean, I don't think I locked my first iPhone
[29:27.240 --> 29:28.440]  with a passcode, right?
[29:28.440 --> 29:31.340]  It was, you know, slide to unlock
[29:31.340 --> 29:32.920]  was the way you were supposed to unlock it.
[29:32.920 --> 29:34.400]  You weren't supposed to slide to unlock
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.120]  and then type in a code like that.
[29:38.120 --> 29:39.920]  Imagine if that's what would have happened on stage.
[29:39.920 --> 29:40.800]  That's what I'm trying to get at.
[29:40.800 --> 29:42.640]  Like if, you know, it's like, look at how beautiful this,
[29:42.640 --> 29:44.600]  you slide to unlock it and then all of a sudden
[29:44.600 --> 29:48.080]  you're typing in, you know, one, one, one, one on stage,
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.880]  like it would have ruined the effect.
[29:49.880 --> 29:52.800]  It's like face ID has brought us back to that
[29:52.800 --> 29:55.040]  where now you just have, you just slide,
[29:55.040 --> 29:56.400]  you slide up instead of over,
[29:56.400 --> 29:59.000]  but you just slide on the lock screen and you're in.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  So, you know what surprised me the most about this?
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.020]  Over all, everything is the size of the iPhone 10.
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.380]  Doesn't that shock you?
[30:13.380 --> 30:14.220]  It does.
[30:14.220 --> 30:18.600]  The iPhone 10 is more the size of the iPhone 8
[30:18.600 --> 30:20.600]  than the 8 Plus.
[30:20.600 --> 30:23.580]  In person, like I've got them right on top of each other
[30:23.580 --> 30:26.640]  right now, it's very, very, it's much closer in size
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.160]  than the numbers alone would make you think.
[30:30.160 --> 30:31.000]  Right.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.720]  And it's literally, it's literally the size.
[30:33.720 --> 30:37.080]  I have my year old Pixel, Google, you know,
[30:37.080 --> 30:39.160]  the old Google Pixel here, but I have the small one,
[30:39.160 --> 30:40.480]  not the XL one.
[30:40.480 --> 30:42.160]  It's almost exactly the same size.
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.920]  And that's a phone that I always thought
[30:43.920 --> 30:46.800]  was only very slightly bigger than an iPhone.
[30:46.800 --> 30:49.400]  In my pocket, like yesterday in New York,
[30:49.400 --> 30:51.720]  when I first got the iPhone 10,
[30:51.720 --> 30:54.380]  I couldn't complete the setup because I needed wifi.
[30:54.380 --> 30:56.720]  So I was gonna wait till, you know, take the Amtrak home
[30:56.720 --> 31:00.100]  and then do an iCloud backup once I got home.
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.360]  But I had it set up as like a new device
[31:03.360 --> 31:06.040]  so I could use it, you know, start using it right away.
[31:06.040 --> 31:09.360]  But I had my regular personal iPhone in my other pocket
[31:09.360 --> 31:10.960]  and I actually was getting confused,
[31:10.960 --> 31:12.160]  like taking it out of my pocket.
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.820]  I was like, oh, I thought that I had the new one
[31:13.820 --> 31:15.600]  in this pocket and it was the new one.
[31:15.600 --> 31:19.720]  It just felt like my old one in hand.
[31:19.720 --> 31:23.940]  Yeah, well, I've been using the Plus version.
[31:23.940 --> 31:28.940]  So the Plus in your pocket, you can feel it, it feels big.
[31:29.720 --> 31:34.720]  You know, but the eight feels normal in your pocket.
[31:36.160 --> 31:38.880]  The 10 feels normal in your pocket.
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.680]  But when you fire up the screen and you see that,
[31:42.680 --> 31:45.480]  it's just that the 10 is just all screen.
[31:46.760 --> 31:50.040]  So I really like it.
[31:50.040 --> 31:52.240]  Now, as we're talking here,
[31:52.240 --> 31:55.680]  I'm lifting my phone up and locking it over and over again
[31:55.680 --> 31:57.640]  just to see if it'll fail.
[31:57.640 --> 31:59.840]  And it doesn't, it won't, it won't fail.
[31:59.840 --> 32:01.840]  It opens every time.
[32:01.840 --> 32:02.680]  I'm gonna put my glasses on.
[32:02.680 --> 32:03.800]  I'm doing the same thing.
[32:08.160 --> 32:09.860]  There's a really neat thing.
[32:09.860 --> 32:13.560]  And it sounded like a gimmick.
[32:13.560 --> 32:14.720]  What happened?
[32:14.720 --> 32:16.120]  It just failed.
[32:16.120 --> 32:17.520]  Do you have your glasses down?
[32:17.520 --> 32:20.160]  I put my glasses on and put them at the edge of my nose
[32:20.160 --> 32:22.820]  and I purposely- There you go.
[32:22.820 --> 32:23.660]  Sound perfect.
[32:23.660 --> 32:24.480]  You know what?
[32:24.480 --> 32:27.080]  I didn't even try it and it was too late in the day.
[32:27.080 --> 32:30.640]  And it just goes to show like what folly it is
[32:30.640 --> 32:33.460]  to think that you can write a full review in 18 hours
[32:33.460 --> 32:36.840]  or whatever, is that I didn't even try it with sunglasses.
[32:36.840 --> 32:38.000]  And then by the time I thought of it,
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.160]  it was right before we were gonna start recording.
[32:40.160 --> 32:43.120]  I'll tell you what, my sunglasses, at least in my office,
[32:43.120 --> 32:43.960]  I'm not outdoors.
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.560]  I don't know if it makes a difference
[32:45.560 --> 32:47.300]  if you're actually indoors or outdoors,
[32:47.300 --> 32:50.440]  but in my office, it won't unlock when I have my sunglasses
[32:50.440 --> 32:51.880]  on.
[32:51.880 --> 32:53.840]  So I don't know if I, I mean,
[32:53.840 --> 32:55.760]  and I just have a regular Ray-Bans.
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.920]  I don't have like any kind of,
[32:56.920 --> 32:59.040]  they're not like mirrored lenses.
[32:59.040 --> 33:00.320]  They're not polarized lenses.
[33:00.320 --> 33:03.320]  They're just the regular Ray-Ban sunglass lenses,
[33:03.320 --> 33:05.320]  but it did not work for me.
[33:07.280 --> 33:11.720]  I tried to, just for fun today,
[33:11.720 --> 33:15.840]  I turned my phone, I set it down on the table
[33:15.840 --> 33:19.560]  and turned it upside down and tried to do my face ID
[33:19.560 --> 33:21.400]  upside down and it wouldn't open.
[33:21.400 --> 33:22.920]  But when I set it down on the table
[33:22.920 --> 33:24.520]  and did it right side up, it did.
[33:25.520 --> 33:27.200]  I don't know if that's a thing or not.
[33:27.200 --> 33:29.200]  I thought it was interesting how many of the reviewers,
[33:29.200 --> 33:31.880]  even with the small number of reviewers that there were,
[33:31.880 --> 33:34.960]  already found twins to test it with.
[33:34.960 --> 33:36.080]  Yeah.
[33:36.080 --> 33:41.080]  I know Lance found twins and Nicole found twins too.
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.620]  I think Panzarino was the only one
[33:42.620 --> 33:44.320]  who didn't have a set of twins,
[33:44.320 --> 33:47.160]  but in both cases, the twins were able to unlock it.
[33:48.360 --> 33:49.800]  I don't think that's that big a deal.
[33:49.800 --> 33:51.160]  I mean, it's easy for me to say
[33:51.160 --> 33:52.840]  because I don't have a twin brother,
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.480]  but I think most people I know who do have a twin sibling
[33:59.480 --> 34:01.000]  trust them pretty well.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  I mean, it's not, you know what I mean?
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.680]  Like it's not bad enough.
[34:04.680 --> 34:07.880]  It's not a problem if you trust your twin.
[34:07.880 --> 34:11.760]  I mean, they probably know your pin code anyway, right?
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.560]  I mean, if that's a big problem for you,
[34:16.560 --> 34:19.840]  then you need to use a passcode instead of Face ID.
[34:19.840 --> 34:20.960]  Right.
[34:20.960 --> 34:23.320]  I mean, I guess it could be a problem for like teenagers,
[34:23.320 --> 34:25.320]  you know, maybe like, you know,
[34:25.320 --> 34:26.660]  maybe teenagers are more likely
[34:26.660 --> 34:28.640]  to want to get into their sibling's phone
[34:28.640 --> 34:30.400]  and screw around with it.
[34:30.400 --> 34:31.560]  I don't know.
[34:31.560 --> 34:33.600]  I mean, it's, you know, it is what it is.
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.440]  Yeah, and there's nothing that Face ID can do about that.
[34:40.440 --> 34:41.280]  Right.
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.840]  You know, it's mapping the face and mapping the depth
[34:43.840 --> 34:46.960]  and doing everything that it should do.
[34:46.960 --> 34:48.860]  But if you have a twin, well, you know,
[34:49.960 --> 34:51.520]  not much we can do about that.
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.080]  Luckily you and I, neither one of us have twins.
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.020]  So I'm trying to think what else here.
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.160]  What about the gestures?
[35:02.160 --> 35:03.120]  Like which ones?
[35:04.240 --> 35:06.320]  I think that Apple, okay,
[35:06.320 --> 35:07.980]  there's two things here that I think Apple
[35:07.980 --> 35:09.420]  did a really good job with.
[35:09.420 --> 35:14.420]  One is moving Touch ID apps automatically over to Face ID.
[35:19.300 --> 35:22.340]  So when I opened my banking apps, it says,
[35:22.340 --> 35:25.780]  do you want to activate Touch ID?
[35:25.780 --> 35:28.600]  And I said, okay, this is going to be interesting
[35:28.600 --> 35:30.780]  because I don't have Touch ID on this phone.
[35:30.780 --> 35:34.200]  So yes, I do want to activate Touch ID
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.220]  and then Face ID automatically activated for it.
[35:38.220 --> 35:40.800]  So Apple automatically, you know,
[35:40.800 --> 35:43.280]  moved that over for the developers
[35:43.280 --> 35:45.940]  until they get a chance to update their apps.
[35:45.940 --> 35:49.140]  One password, when I opened it up, it said,
[35:49.140 --> 35:51.340]  do you want to do Touch ID?
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.540]  I said, yes.
[35:52.540 --> 35:55.900]  And it came up with a message that I actually posted
[35:55.900 --> 36:00.020]  in the review and said, this app is not set up for Face ID,
[36:00.020 --> 36:01.460]  it's set up for Touch ID.
[36:01.460 --> 36:03.460]  Would you like to use Face ID?
[36:03.460 --> 36:05.140]  And I said, yes.
[36:05.140 --> 36:09.200]  So either one of those two things is fine with me.
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.540]  I was just happy to see that, you know,
[36:12.540 --> 36:15.740]  for my banking stuff and for app setup,
[36:16.740 --> 36:20.860]  for using one password, I could use Face ID automatically,
[36:20.860 --> 36:21.940]  out of the box.
[36:21.940 --> 36:23.740]  You know, I don't have to sit and wait.
[36:23.740 --> 36:26.580]  Remember when we have to wait for developers
[36:26.580 --> 36:28.540]  to update their apps, to take advantage
[36:28.540 --> 36:31.060]  of some of these new features and this time we don't.
[36:31.060 --> 36:33.860]  So I think they did a really good job with that.
[36:33.860 --> 36:37.380]  It's one of those features where it's clear
[36:37.380 --> 36:40.320]  and Apple does not like to talk about timelines.
[36:41.980 --> 36:44.260]  I know from talking to Panzerino, there was a question,
[36:44.260 --> 36:46.620]  you know, that group of journalists
[36:46.620 --> 36:48.300]  who got the reviews a week in advance,
[36:48.300 --> 36:53.040]  they all met with Apple executives together last week.
[36:54.140 --> 36:56.500]  You know, like sort of like that Mac round table
[36:56.500 --> 36:58.160]  that I was at earlier in the year.
[36:59.380 --> 37:01.860]  And there was a question about how long Face ID
[37:01.860 --> 37:04.700]  was in development and they were like going to answer
[37:04.700 --> 37:06.620]  and then somebody cut it off.
[37:07.560 --> 37:09.540]  It's like, no, we're not gonna talk about timelines.
[37:09.540 --> 37:12.180]  Apple does not like to talk about how long stuff
[37:12.180 --> 37:15.860]  was in the works, but it's very, very obvious to me
[37:15.860 --> 37:20.860]  that Face ID was in the works at least as long as Touch ID,
[37:21.100 --> 37:24.580]  because everything surrounding Touch ID's APIs
[37:24.580 --> 37:28.200]  is not touch specific or fingerprint specific.
[37:28.200 --> 37:29.820]  It's, you know, like the name of the kit
[37:29.820 --> 37:31.980]  is I think biometric kit.
[37:31.980 --> 37:34.180]  Like they've had ideas and who knows,
[37:34.180 --> 37:35.620]  they might have other ideas too,
[37:35.620 --> 37:38.420]  in addition to Face ID, right?
[37:38.420 --> 37:43.140]  But they've been thinking about biometrics collectively
[37:43.140 --> 37:45.060]  rather than fingerprints specifically,
[37:45.060 --> 37:46.420]  obviously from the get-go.
[37:46.420 --> 37:47.660]  And the fact that, like you said,
[37:47.660 --> 37:50.620]  the apps just work is proof of it
[37:50.620 --> 37:52.580]  because they're just making the,
[37:52.580 --> 37:55.420]  effectively the app just says, okay, if you permit it,
[37:55.420 --> 38:00.240]  give me a biometric authentication.
[38:00.240 --> 38:03.600]  And the dialogue box they show might say Touch ID,
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.240]  but that's because the developer was making an assumption
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.640]  that they shouldn't have made.
[38:08.640 --> 38:09.740]  That's just what they typed.
[38:09.740 --> 38:12.080]  But the API they call is just saying,
[38:12.080 --> 38:13.920]  give me a biometric authentication.
[38:13.920 --> 38:16.840]  And when you use it on the iPhone 10, it just works.
[38:16.840 --> 38:18.960]  So my Amex app is exactly like that.
[38:18.960 --> 38:21.120]  So that's one of those apps that I get, you know,
[38:21.120 --> 38:23.080]  it makes sense, I guess, for something financial
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.440]  where even when you restore from iCloud,
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.660]  it doesn't remember your credentials.
[38:27.660 --> 38:29.760]  Like I had to, like, that's one of those apps
[38:29.760 --> 38:32.580]  where I had to reauthenticate.
[38:32.580 --> 38:35.480]  And when I did, it literally said,
[38:35.480 --> 38:36.460]  same thing that you're talking about,
[38:36.460 --> 38:38.400]  where it was like, do you want to set up Touch ID?
[38:38.400 --> 38:41.880]  And it even said, like, I think the OS gave me a warning
[38:41.880 --> 38:44.200]  that said this app has not been updated for Face ID.
[38:44.200 --> 38:45.720]  Do you want to go ahead?
[38:45.720 --> 38:47.040]  And I said, yes.
[38:47.040 --> 38:49.840]  And again, like you said, it just works.
[38:49.840 --> 38:53.300]  Yeah, I was very, very glad to see that
[38:53.300 --> 38:56.240]  because that makes the experience
[38:56.240 --> 38:58.540]  just seamless for the user.
[38:58.540 --> 39:00.160]  Okay, the app hasn't been updated yet,
[39:00.160 --> 39:01.280]  but Apple doesn't care
[39:01.280 --> 39:03.440]  because we have another security methods
[39:03.440 --> 39:05.760]  that's even more secure than Touch ID.
[39:07.120 --> 39:08.440]  One of the things I've been thinking about
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.640]  ever since iOS 11 shipped,
[39:10.640 --> 39:13.080]  and I guess iOS 10 was similar too,
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.280]  but I think Apple has been thinking about this for a while,
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.760]  is that when you're on your lock screen
[39:17.760 --> 39:20.160]  and you've got a couple of notifications,
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.360]  one of the things that's annoyed me ever since,
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.620]  like for the last six weeks,
[39:23.620 --> 39:26.040]  ever since I started imagining using Face ID
[39:26.040 --> 39:28.220]  is that when you tap on one of those notifications,
[39:28.220 --> 39:30.980]  like let's say, here's an iMessage from you,
[39:30.980 --> 39:32.460]  and I tap that message.
[39:35.360 --> 39:37.800]  With Touch ID, I would then have to move my thumb
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.520]  from where I touch the notification down to the bottom
[39:42.520 --> 39:44.520]  to do my fingerprint.
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.800]  Whereas now I just touch the notification
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.080]  and boom, it just opens messages.
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.600]  Right.
[39:52.600 --> 39:56.080]  Like I really do think even just one day in Face ID,
[39:56.080 --> 39:58.840]  I'm sold, it is better than Touch ID.
[39:58.840 --> 40:01.700]  And this is just the first generation.
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.240]  Well, and Pansarino made an interesting point
[40:07.240 --> 40:11.800]  that he, you remember when we moved from Touch ID,
[40:11.800 --> 40:15.240]  Gen 1 to Gen 2, I mean, Gen 2 was so fast
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.920]  that before you used to be able to touch the home button
[40:17.920 --> 40:20.280]  and just take a look at your notifications,
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.040]  Gen 2, you touch the button and you were already unlocked.
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.360]  So he said that he would be happy
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.240]  if it was somewhere in between Gen 1 and Gen 2.
[40:31.240 --> 40:34.740]  And that's basically where he felt that it landed.
[40:34.740 --> 40:37.760]  And I would, I'd say that's fair,
[40:39.620 --> 40:42.960]  but it's certainly not slow at all.
[40:42.960 --> 40:46.040]  It's not as slow as Gen 1 Touch ID was.
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.520]  Face ID is a lot faster than that.
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.680]  And I think it's, in a lot of ways,
[40:50.680 --> 40:52.880]  it's a lot more convenient
[40:52.880 --> 40:55.080]  because as soon as you pick the phone up,
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.200]  even if you're gonna use Touch ID,
[40:57.200 --> 41:02.000]  you would pick the phone up and as you're raising it,
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.280]  maybe put your thumb on it to unlock.
[41:04.280 --> 41:06.060]  Well, the same thing is kind of happening.
[41:06.060 --> 41:08.640]  You put your thumb down there and you're swiping up
[41:08.640 --> 41:13.000]  and as your phone lifts, it's unlocked, you know?
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.500]  So I don't have any problems with the speed,
[41:17.500 --> 41:20.760]  but you have to think that it's only gonna get better.
[41:20.760 --> 41:21.960]  It's not gonna get worse.
[41:21.960 --> 41:22.800]  Right.
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.720]  So the other thing that I was really impressed with
[41:26.720 --> 41:29.520]  is the amount of gestures that,
[41:29.520 --> 41:31.880]  I mean, there's a lot of gestures that we had
[41:31.880 --> 41:35.160]  with the iPhone for years.
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.000]  But if you're scrolling through your pages of apps
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.640]  and you wanna go back to the very first screen,
[41:42.640 --> 41:45.340]  you just swipe up and it'll zoom you back
[41:45.340 --> 41:46.420]  to the first screen.
[41:48.060 --> 41:49.360]  That to me is kind of cool.
[41:49.360 --> 41:50.720]  They were thinking about that.
[41:50.720 --> 41:51.880]  They know that people,
[41:51.880 --> 41:54.480]  before you used to just hit the home button
[41:54.480 --> 41:55.920]  and it would zoom you back.
[41:55.920 --> 41:58.560]  Well, now you just swipe up on whatever screen you're on
[41:58.560 --> 42:00.680]  and it'll flick you back to the first one.
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.240]  Yeah, that swipe up kind of is the new home button.
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.920]  Even in areas like that, I hadn't noticed that,
[42:05.920 --> 42:08.080]  but now that you say it, it does work.
[42:08.080 --> 42:08.920]  That's pretty cool.
[42:08.920 --> 42:11.160]  Yeah, that one, I don't know why,
[42:11.160 --> 42:14.540]  but I ended up using that one quite a bit.
[42:14.540 --> 42:16.920]  And then you swipe down from the right side,
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.680]  you get to control center.
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.400]  You swipe down from the left side,
[42:20.400 --> 42:22.560]  you get your notifications.
[42:23.400 --> 42:25.400]  So one of the things that's interesting to me
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.120]  about control center is that you don't have to swipe far.
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.880]  Like it's like, you know how like
[42:32.880 --> 42:35.280]  when you do notification center,
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.220]  it pulls down as you pull, right?
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.400]  Like if you pull down one inch,
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.560]  you only see one inch of notification center.
[42:42.560 --> 42:44.440]  If you pull down two inches, you see two inches.
[42:44.440 --> 42:47.040]  It's one-to-one with your finger.
[42:47.040 --> 42:48.520]  And I think the idea there
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.960]  is that you might just want to peek at the bottom one
[42:50.960 --> 42:52.000]  and then let go.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.960]  But with control center, it doesn't do that,
[42:53.960 --> 42:55.400]  which is what I expected it to do.
[42:55.400 --> 42:57.740]  Instead, you just sort of swipe down about a quarter inch
[42:57.740 --> 43:00.720]  and the whole control center is there.
[43:00.720 --> 43:03.580]  And the reason I think that that's a good idea
[43:03.580 --> 43:07.940]  is that it makes it a lot easier to open control center
[43:07.940 --> 43:10.040]  than I thought it was going to be.
[43:10.040 --> 43:11.360]  Yeah.
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.940]  Yeah, I don't know why,
[43:15.940 --> 43:20.940]  but I never used control center a whole lot until recently.
[43:21.240 --> 43:26.000]  And I really, I can't figure out why,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.880]  because there's a lot of good stuff in there
[43:28.880 --> 43:29.840]  that you can use.
[43:29.840 --> 43:33.000]  But I would mostly use control center
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.480]  to turn on the flashlight.
[43:34.480 --> 43:36.720]  Yep, that was it.
[43:38.360 --> 43:41.160]  That was control center for me, the flashlight.
[43:41.160 --> 43:42.680]  I could take everything else out of there
[43:42.680 --> 43:44.600]  and just put a big flashlight button.
[43:44.600 --> 43:47.760]  But now I am using control center a bit more.
[43:47.760 --> 43:50.800]  It's interesting to me how many little things have changed
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.220]  only for the iPhone 10 and not for the iPhone 8.
[43:55.760 --> 43:58.120]  For example, when you're on the lock screen
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.640]  and you want to jump to the camera,
[44:01.640 --> 44:03.660]  just without even unlocking the phone.
[44:04.640 --> 44:08.680]  On the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 and 6S
[44:08.680 --> 44:11.280]  and every other phone running iOS 11,
[44:11.280 --> 44:12.320]  when you're on the lock screen,
[44:12.320 --> 44:15.800]  you swipe from the right to the left
[44:15.800 --> 44:18.220]  and the camera slides into view.
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.560]  And you could still do that if you want.
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.280]  But they also added this little camera button at the corner
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.000]  that you can just sort of give a force press to
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.640]  and it clicks.
[44:29.640 --> 44:32.800]  It gives you some haptic feedback and you jump right in.
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.320]  And I kind of, I like that because I feel like
[44:35.320 --> 44:38.020]  that swipe gesture is often hard to make one-handed.
[44:39.120 --> 44:40.320]  Yeah.
[44:40.320 --> 44:43.580]  And I love the haptic feedback of knowing, okay, I'm in.
[44:43.580 --> 44:46.020]  So if you're not even looking at the phone,
[44:46.020 --> 44:47.440]  you already know that the camera's on
[44:47.440 --> 44:49.940]  because you get that little bit of haptic feedback.
[44:49.940 --> 44:50.780]  But it's so interesting.
[44:50.780 --> 44:52.220]  Same with the flashlight button.
[44:52.220 --> 44:53.600]  Right, it's so interesting to me though
[44:53.600 --> 44:56.360]  that that's only on the 10 and none of the other iPhones.
[44:56.360 --> 44:58.360]  I'm not quite sure why that is.
[44:58.360 --> 44:59.860]  Yeah, and the flashlight's the exact same way
[44:59.860 --> 45:01.880]  where you don't have to swipe or anything.
[45:01.880 --> 45:04.960]  You can just give it like a force tap and it clicks.
[45:04.960 --> 45:05.940]  Very nice click.
[45:07.560 --> 45:10.200]  Oh, before I forget, I don't want to forget.
[45:10.200 --> 45:12.780]  Another little feature.
[45:12.780 --> 45:15.480]  This is obviously not like a flagship,
[45:15.480 --> 45:17.520]  wow, we could talk about it forever.
[45:17.520 --> 45:19.760]  But I really, really like it one day in
[45:19.760 --> 45:21.520]  is the fact that you can wake the phone
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.520]  just by tapping the screen.
[45:23.520 --> 45:25.460]  Yes. Anywhere.
[45:25.460 --> 45:26.300]  Yes.
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.240]  That might be the one aspect of the iPhone 10
[45:30.240 --> 45:32.640]  that I'm already so used to that I could never go back.
[45:32.640 --> 45:34.920]  Even after 10 years of never being able
[45:34.920 --> 45:36.920]  to wake my phone with a tap on the screen,
[45:36.920 --> 45:38.720]  now that I can wake my phone with a tap on the screen,
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.560]  I feel like we were living like animals.
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.240]  But did you notice this though?
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.320]  That if you have notifications on the screen
[45:51.320 --> 45:56.320]  and you tap the screen and there's mail message,
[45:56.400 --> 45:59.060]  it'll say the name and it'll just say mail message.
[45:59.060 --> 46:02.600]  It won't give you the detail of what the message is
[46:02.600 --> 46:05.640]  until you lift it up and it will unlock.
[46:05.640 --> 46:06.480]  Right.
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.160]  And then it will fill in the preview
[46:09.160 --> 46:10.720]  of what the messages are.
[46:10.720 --> 46:11.560]  Well, and it's not-
[46:11.560 --> 46:13.560]  But while it's locked, it won't.
[46:13.560 --> 46:14.880]  It's not unlocking.
[46:14.880 --> 46:17.080]  It's like, you know what I mean?
[46:17.080 --> 46:20.480]  Like it's not taking you away from the lock screen.
[46:20.480 --> 46:21.840]  It's just-
[46:21.840 --> 46:22.680]  It's just-
[46:22.680 --> 46:23.500]  It's authenticating.
[46:23.500 --> 46:24.340]  Right, it's authenticating.
[46:24.340 --> 46:25.640]  And they do show it with a lock,
[46:25.640 --> 46:28.120]  but the lock animates and it swings open.
[46:28.120 --> 46:31.040]  But all it means is, okay, I know it's you.
[46:31.040 --> 46:31.880]  Yeah.
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.180]  And then it will, as soon as you do that,
[46:35.180 --> 46:37.760]  all of the messages notifications
[46:37.760 --> 46:40.640]  will fill out with their preview.
[46:40.640 --> 46:43.240]  And then you can swipe up to unlock if you want,
[46:43.240 --> 46:45.640]  or you can just put it back down.
[46:45.640 --> 46:47.240]  Apparently that was a feature before.
[46:47.240 --> 46:48.120]  I did not know that.
[46:48.120 --> 46:49.160]  I never turned that on.
[46:49.160 --> 46:51.420]  So you can do that with a Touch ID iPhone,
[46:52.440 --> 46:56.440]  but I feel like it's such a natural fit for Face ID.
[46:56.440 --> 47:00.880]  And the, what did I call the feature word?
[47:00.880 --> 47:02.080]  The attention awareness.
[47:02.080 --> 47:02.920]  The attention awareness.
[47:02.920 --> 47:04.360]  The attention awareness, yeah.
[47:04.360 --> 47:05.600]  Do you have that turned on?
[47:05.600 --> 47:06.720]  Yeah, I do.
[47:06.720 --> 47:08.460]  At least I think it's on by default, right?
[47:08.460 --> 47:10.040]  I didn't turn it off.
[47:10.040 --> 47:11.520]  It is on by default.
[47:11.520 --> 47:12.360]  Yeah.
[47:12.360 --> 47:13.180]  I went in and looked,
[47:13.180 --> 47:15.680]  because when I was trying to figure out
[47:15.680 --> 47:17.680]  those couple of times when Face ID wouldn't work,
[47:17.680 --> 47:19.500]  I thought it was my attention.
[47:21.440 --> 47:23.160]  It does work too,
[47:23.160 --> 47:28.040]  that when my alarm went off at like,
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.680]  quarter after two this morning
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.080]  to get up and post this first look,
[47:34.080 --> 47:36.160]  the alarm was ringing,
[47:36.160 --> 47:37.520]  and I get up and looked at the phone
[47:37.520 --> 47:38.960]  and the volume dimmed.
[47:38.960 --> 47:40.320]  Hmm.
[47:40.320 --> 47:42.360]  Because it knew that it had my attention.
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.540]  I was looking at the phone, the volume dimmed down.
[47:45.540 --> 47:50.540]  So even though I was tired as hell,
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.880]  I wanted to try that.
[47:52.880 --> 47:54.800]  So I actually picked up the phone
[47:54.800 --> 47:56.380]  and looked at it to see if it would work.
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.220]  And it did.
[47:57.220 --> 47:58.140]  The volume dimmed down.
[47:58.140 --> 48:00.220]  And one of the other things that it'll do
[48:00.220 --> 48:03.220]  is it will not dim the screen
[48:03.220 --> 48:05.660]  if you're viewing a webpage,
[48:05.660 --> 48:08.120]  because it knows that it has your attention.
[48:08.120 --> 48:09.280]  Yep.
[48:09.280 --> 48:12.400]  So that kind of stuff is useful.
[48:12.400 --> 48:14.720]  You often see the phone dim the screen.
[48:14.720 --> 48:17.320]  You have to tap it to bring it back again.
[48:17.320 --> 48:19.680]  But if it knows that you're looking at it, it won't.
[48:19.680 --> 48:20.740]  It's just one more step
[48:20.740 --> 48:24.360]  towards making little, helpful C-3PO-style robots.
[48:25.560 --> 48:26.400]  Right?
[48:26.400 --> 48:28.340]  Right?
[48:28.340 --> 48:30.240]  I mean, that's obviously where technology's going.
[48:30.240 --> 48:31.480]  I mean, I've talked about this before,
[48:31.480 --> 48:34.240]  but it's like, why shouldn't your phone know who you are?
[48:34.240 --> 48:35.760]  Like, I can recognize a person.
[48:35.760 --> 48:36.640]  Why can't a computer?
[48:36.640 --> 48:38.920]  Computers are very good at pattern matching.
[48:38.920 --> 48:39.760]  You know?
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.140]  It's, you wouldn't tolerate having an employee
[48:44.140 --> 48:45.400]  who couldn't recognize you.
[48:45.400 --> 48:48.240]  Like, right?
[48:48.240 --> 48:51.040]  Like, so why do none of our devices recognize us?
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.760]  Why can't my TV know that when I turn the TV
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.400]  on nine times out of 10, I want the Apple TV as the input.
[48:59.400 --> 49:02.840]  And with my wife, nine times out of 10, she wants the TiVo.
[49:02.840 --> 49:05.240]  So like, the TV should know who we are.
[49:05.240 --> 49:08.360]  And if it sees that Amy is watching TV by herself,
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.640]  as soon as she turns the TV on,
[49:09.640 --> 49:11.040]  it should switch to the TiVo.
[49:12.120 --> 49:12.960]  It doesn't.
[49:12.960 --> 49:15.360]  It doesn't, but it should.
[49:15.360 --> 49:17.040]  As soon as she walks into the room,
[49:17.040 --> 49:18.560]  regardless of what you're doing,
[49:18.560 --> 49:19.800]  it should switch to TiVo.
[49:19.800 --> 49:20.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:20.640 --> 49:23.080]  Yeah, that's pretty much what happens.
[49:28.320 --> 49:29.360]  What about reachability?
[49:29.360 --> 49:30.840]  Do you have reachability on?
[49:30.840 --> 49:33.160]  I didn't even realize, there was some speculation
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.480]  that they had gotten rid of it.
[49:35.480 --> 49:37.480]  Like, the old shortcut for reachability.
[49:37.480 --> 49:41.440]  This is the feature that like, moves the screen halfway down
[49:41.440 --> 49:43.960]  so that you can, one-handed, you can reach the stuff
[49:43.960 --> 49:45.360]  at the top of the screen.
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.480]  The old shortcut was like, I think it was a double touch
[49:48.480 --> 49:49.320]  of the home button.
[49:49.320 --> 49:50.140]  Double touch.
[49:50.140 --> 49:52.400]  Not a double tap or double click.
[49:52.400 --> 49:55.520]  It was just touched the touch ID sensor twice
[49:55.520 --> 49:57.080]  and it would jump down.
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.720]  So the new one is, it's off by default.
[50:00.720 --> 50:03.540]  If you turn it on, you go to that little home button
[50:03.540 --> 50:05.120]  indicator, what are we calling that thing?
[50:05.120 --> 50:05.960]  Do you know?
[50:05.960 --> 50:09.520]  The horizontal line at the bottom of the screen.
[50:09.520 --> 50:12.440]  I don't know. Is there a name for that thing?
[50:12.440 --> 50:13.400]  I don't know. I don't think so.
[50:13.400 --> 50:16.840]  I'll call it the home button or the home dash.
[50:16.840 --> 50:17.760]  Home dash.
[50:18.920 --> 50:21.880]  So instead of swiping up on that thing,
[50:21.880 --> 50:24.760]  which is how you unlock the phone, you swipe down on it
[50:24.760 --> 50:26.360]  and you don't have much room.
[50:26.360 --> 50:28.120]  So it's like a little short down swipe
[50:28.120 --> 50:29.520]  and it turns on reachability.
[50:29.520 --> 50:32.580]  I don't like it, but I never liked reachability, period.
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.600]  Well, one thing that I find with reachability was,
[50:38.600 --> 50:43.160]  for people using the plus versions of the phone,
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.400]  not so much for the non plus versions.
[50:47.400 --> 50:51.120]  To me, the iPhone 10 is more of a non plus version.
[50:51.120 --> 50:52.720]  It's just the screen is big.
[50:54.360 --> 50:59.360]  So physically, it doesn't feel as big as the plus phone,
[51:00.240 --> 51:01.920]  but the screen is actually bigger.
[51:01.920 --> 51:03.380]  I think that, do you think they're gonna do
[51:03.380 --> 51:04.600]  a plus size of this phone?
[51:04.600 --> 51:07.080]  I think next year they're gonna do a plus size.
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.160]  I think that they'll have a second one that's like
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.960]  6.8 inches or something.
[51:13.000 --> 51:13.840]  Don't you?
[51:13.840 --> 51:16.000]  I feel like, cause I feel like some people love the plus.
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.960]  And you know, this phone doesn't do like the two panel
[51:19.960 --> 51:22.120]  layouts for things like mail or messages.
[51:22.120 --> 51:23.520]  You know how like on a plus phone,
[51:23.520 --> 51:25.280]  when you rotate the phone sideways,
[51:25.280 --> 51:28.080]  you get like a sort of a mini iPad layout
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.120]  where you have two columns, mailboxes and messages.
[51:31.120 --> 51:32.200]  This phone doesn't do that.
[51:32.200 --> 51:34.520]  And I feel like some people love that.
[51:34.520 --> 51:37.220]  I really do think there's room for it
[51:37.220 --> 51:39.840]  because this phone doesn't feel big at all.
[51:39.840 --> 51:40.680]  No, you're right.
[51:40.680 --> 51:41.520]  It doesn't.
[51:41.520 --> 51:42.620]  I never noticed that.
[51:42.620 --> 51:46.120]  I never look at my mail or messages.
[51:46.120 --> 51:47.360]  I never do anything in landscape.
[51:47.360 --> 51:50.520]  The only thing I ever do in landscape is watch videos
[51:50.520 --> 51:52.800]  or look at pictures or whatever.
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.800]  Yeah, I don't think people do much in landscape
[51:58.880 --> 52:02.280]  to be honest, but watch movies or something like that.
[52:02.280 --> 52:07.280]  I do watch video in landscape, but that's about it.
[52:07.360 --> 52:10.880]  I never even knew that wasn't there in this one.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.920]  Never even thought to look cause I don't use it.
[52:13.920 --> 52:14.760]  All right, let me take a break here
[52:14.760 --> 52:15.640]  and thank our next sponsor.
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.160]  It's our good friends at Fracture.
[52:17.160 --> 52:18.640]  Fracture is the photo decor company
[52:18.640 --> 52:20.280]  that is out to rescue your favorite images
[52:20.280 --> 52:21.640]  from the digital ether.
[52:21.640 --> 52:24.040]  You take your photos, you send them to Fracture
[52:24.040 --> 52:25.320]  at their website.
[52:25.320 --> 52:29.160]  They print your photos directly onto glass.
[52:29.160 --> 52:31.200]  You pick the size, they have all sorts of sizes,
[52:31.200 --> 52:33.120]  big ones, small ones, square ones,
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.080]  anything you can imagine.
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.880]  Then they ship them to you and the container,
[52:37.880 --> 52:40.060]  the cardboard thing they ship it to you in
[52:40.060 --> 52:42.560]  is in fact the backing that you could use
[52:42.560 --> 52:43.800]  to hang it on the wall.
[52:43.800 --> 52:45.060]  So it's all ready to go.
[52:45.060 --> 52:48.240]  It's a very, A, the print quality is amazing.
[52:48.240 --> 52:50.680]  These are absolutely fantastic prints.
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.620]  They're also good for printing things like logos
[52:55.620 --> 52:57.880]  or app icons or something like that.
[52:57.880 --> 53:00.160]  Marco Arment has famously made a fracture
[53:00.160 --> 53:03.120]  of every one of his apps and has it hanging in his office.
[53:05.660 --> 53:07.560]  I was just visiting with a long time friend of the show,
[53:07.560 --> 53:10.000]  Dave Whiskus, in his office in New York
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.700]  and he represents a bunch of podcasts
[53:11.700 --> 53:13.720]  and YouTube shows and stuff like that.
[53:13.720 --> 53:17.980]  He's got a fracture printed out for every one of the shows
[53:17.980 --> 53:19.360]  and it looks great on the wall.
[53:19.360 --> 53:20.360]  It just looks fantastic.
[53:20.360 --> 53:22.000]  It looks very, very cool.
[53:22.940 --> 53:24.480]  There's all sorts of clever things you could do
[53:24.480 --> 53:26.200]  with a fracture other than just print photos
[53:26.200 --> 53:28.360]  of your kids and dogs and stuff like that.
[53:28.360 --> 53:30.680]  Anything you think you might want to print,
[53:30.680 --> 53:32.300]  you should think about getting printed a fracture.
[53:32.300 --> 53:33.840]  But anyway, here's what I want to tell you.
[53:33.840 --> 53:37.920]  As we record, we're recording on Halloween, October 31st.
[53:37.920 --> 53:39.920]  We're gonna try to get this show out tonight.
[53:39.920 --> 53:41.740]  I don't know when you're listening to it.
[53:41.740 --> 53:44.480]  You might be listening to it tonight on Halloween.
[53:44.480 --> 53:45.500]  Happy Halloween.
[53:45.500 --> 53:47.800]  You might be listening next week, early November.
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.900]  Maybe you're behind a few episodes.
[53:49.900 --> 53:51.480]  Maybe you're gonna listen in mid-November.
[53:51.480 --> 53:53.520]  But when you hear my voice,
[53:53.520 --> 53:56.280]  it's gonna be either November or very close to November
[53:56.280 --> 53:58.520]  and that means we're getting close to the holidays.
[53:58.520 --> 54:01.880]  These things are fantastic gifts, but they get backed up.
[54:01.880 --> 54:04.360]  Like I think once early December rolls around,
[54:04.360 --> 54:05.580]  it might be too late.
[54:05.580 --> 54:06.660]  I'm a procrastinator.
[54:06.660 --> 54:07.840]  I buy stuff at the last minute.
[54:07.840 --> 54:10.080]  You can't wait till the last minute to buy a fracture.
[54:10.080 --> 54:11.400]  So if you're listening to me
[54:11.400 --> 54:15.800]  and you're thinking about buying some friends and families,
[54:15.800 --> 54:18.440]  some fracture prints, take a moment right now.
[54:18.440 --> 54:20.640]  Pause the podcast, hit pause.
[54:20.640 --> 54:22.960]  Go order them right now or make yourself a to-do
[54:22.960 --> 54:24.880]  or whatever you do to remind yourself to do things.
[54:24.880 --> 54:27.560]  Every fracture comes with a 60-day happiness guarantee.
[54:27.560 --> 54:29.000]  You'll be sure to love your order.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.320]  They truly are amazing gifts.
[54:32.320 --> 54:34.700]  And every one of them is made right in Gainesville, Florida
[54:34.700 --> 54:38.160]  from U.S. source materials in a carbon neutral factory.
[54:38.160 --> 54:39.400]  So where do you go to find out more
[54:39.400 --> 54:40.380]  from this wonderful company?
[54:40.380 --> 54:43.680]  Go to fractureme.com slash podcast.
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.960]  That website is fractureme.com slash podcast.
[54:48.800 --> 54:50.440]  No special code for the show.
[54:50.440 --> 54:53.440]  Not, they just want slash podcast.
[54:53.440 --> 54:55.040]  But then when you do place an order,
[54:55.040 --> 54:57.500]  they will ask you a one question survey,
[54:57.500 --> 54:58.980]  which is where did you hear about fracture?
[54:58.980 --> 55:02.040]  And you can tell them you heard about it on the talk show
[55:02.040 --> 55:04.640]  with your pal, John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple.
[55:09.560 --> 55:10.400]  What else?
[55:10.400 --> 55:12.620]  I got a couple of other things to talk about.
[55:12.620 --> 55:13.460]  Do it.
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.160]  I think everybody, as far as I've seen,
[55:18.160 --> 55:20.920]  I mean, I haven't done like an exhaustive survey,
[55:20.920 --> 55:22.560]  but it seems to me that everybody
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.920]  who got one of these review units,
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.400]  either a week ago or yesterday,
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.840]  the big group of us that got them yesterday,
[55:27.840 --> 55:30.040]  everybody got the silver one.
[55:30.040 --> 55:32.200]  I don't, I haven't seen anybody post a picture
[55:32.200 --> 55:33.840]  of the space black.
[55:33.840 --> 55:35.300]  No, I got a silver.
[55:35.300 --> 55:37.000]  Yeah, everybody I know got silver.
[55:39.140 --> 55:40.920]  Renee was with me yesterday in New York.
[55:40.920 --> 55:42.580]  He got silver, I got silver.
[55:44.660 --> 55:46.000]  I kind of see why.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.060]  I personally ordered last Friday night.
[55:48.060 --> 55:50.300]  Did you order last Friday night, by the way?
[55:50.300 --> 55:51.260]  I did not.
[55:51.260 --> 55:52.100]  I did.
[55:52.100 --> 55:53.440]  I got one Friday night.
[55:53.440 --> 55:54.280]  Actually, I ordered two.
[55:54.280 --> 55:55.840]  I got one for me and one for Amy.
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.220]  We could talk about that in a moment,
[55:58.220 --> 56:00.100]  but I got the space black.
[56:00.100 --> 56:01.120]  I always buy black.
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.080]  It's just, whatever's the blackest black that I can get
[56:04.080 --> 56:04.920]  is what I get.
[56:04.920 --> 56:06.560]  Last year was the only time I had a dilemma
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.760]  because the bastards made me choose between two blacks.
[56:11.640 --> 56:12.640]  I'm glad I got jet.
[56:12.640 --> 56:14.760]  I'm glad I got the jet black
[56:14.760 --> 56:16.400]  because I feel like it's,
[56:16.400 --> 56:18.240]  and it's exactly what I thought when I ordered it
[56:18.240 --> 56:19.280]  is I kind of think,
[56:19.280 --> 56:23.080]  I think that the last year's iPhone 7 flat black
[56:23.080 --> 56:25.640]  or whatever they, matte black, whatever they called it,
[56:25.640 --> 56:26.940]  to me looked better.
[56:26.940 --> 56:30.880]  It looked more like sort of like a classic piece
[56:30.880 --> 56:33.620]  of camera equipment, like a tool.
[56:35.600 --> 56:38.560]  But that grippiness of this jet black finish,
[56:38.560 --> 56:40.760]  it exactly feels like the glass
[56:40.760 --> 56:42.580]  that they've gone to across the line this year.
[56:42.580 --> 56:44.960]  And it really, really helps holding the phone
[56:44.960 --> 56:47.980]  like when you're in warm weather or wet hands
[56:47.980 --> 56:49.800]  or something like that.
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.940]  Yeah.
[56:50.940 --> 56:52.800]  I think the silver kind of pops.
[56:52.800 --> 56:56.160]  I personally, my own taste just leans towards
[56:56.160 --> 56:58.520]  the more muted look of the space gray,
[56:58.520 --> 57:00.560]  but I feel like this silver really pops
[57:00.560 --> 57:03.700]  because the, in a way that it's just like
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.400]  almost impossible to photograph
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.160]  the way that the stainless steel sides are so shiny.
[57:10.300 --> 57:12.680]  It's like, it's just such a hard thing to photograph
[57:12.680 --> 57:15.320]  the shine of like a high gloss stainless steel.
[57:15.320 --> 57:20.320]  Yeah, yeah, it, remember when we first talked
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.320]  about the phone colors,
[57:25.320 --> 57:28.280]  I thought this one almost looked white.
[57:28.280 --> 57:29.300]  Yeah.
[57:29.300 --> 57:31.960]  You know, it kind of, to me, I'm looking at it now,
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.120]  to me it kind of does, but it has that silver band
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.180]  and I like both of them.
[57:39.180 --> 57:40.800]  I, you know, I saw both yesterday.
[57:40.800 --> 57:42.960]  I didn't know which one I was getting
[57:42.960 --> 57:45.520]  until I got home and unpacked it.
[57:45.520 --> 57:48.120]  And it, honestly, it didn't really matter to me.
[57:49.880 --> 57:52.140]  I really do like both.
[57:52.140 --> 57:54.000]  I kind of wish that the space black one
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.920]  had the space black glass back,
[57:55.920 --> 57:58.000]  but still had the shiny chrome sides.
[57:58.840 --> 57:59.680]  Hmm.
[58:00.600 --> 58:01.440]  I don't know.
[58:01.440 --> 58:03.200]  But there is, and there is, again,
[58:03.200 --> 58:04.960]  this is not an original observation.
[58:04.960 --> 58:07.160]  I'm pretty sure every review I read today
[58:07.160 --> 58:08.140]  mentioned it in some way,
[58:08.140 --> 58:11.280]  but the shiny sides really does harken back
[58:11.280 --> 58:13.360]  to the original iPhone 10 years ago,
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.920]  which had like that sort of chrome border
[58:15.920 --> 58:16.980]  around the display.
[58:19.980 --> 58:24.980]  Yeah, I love the, I love the feel of it.
[58:25.900 --> 58:27.840]  I love the look of it.
[58:27.840 --> 58:32.840]  I think mostly, as much as I love,
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.480]  and I've said before, I love the big phone.
[58:35.480 --> 58:36.940]  I don't love the big phone.
[58:36.940 --> 58:38.780]  I love the big screen.
[58:38.780 --> 58:40.760]  And this, I have an even bigger screen.
[58:40.760 --> 58:41.600]  Right.
[58:41.600 --> 58:42.640]  But a smaller phone.
[58:42.640 --> 58:46.240]  So, you know, it feels more comfortable to carry around.
[58:46.240 --> 58:48.340]  It feels more comfortable to use,
[58:49.400 --> 58:54.200]  but you actually have more viewing real estate, so.
[58:54.200 --> 58:56.200]  I'm not a bezel hater.
[58:56.200 --> 58:59.640]  I was, you know, not, I was not of the opinion
[58:59.640 --> 59:01.080]  that it was a disaster for Apple
[59:01.080 --> 59:03.640]  to stick with the same tried and true design
[59:03.640 --> 59:05.220]  with the iPhone 7 last year.
[59:06.800 --> 59:09.480]  But that, you know, and again,
[59:09.480 --> 59:11.560]  and if this phone just happened to, you know,
[59:11.560 --> 59:12.680]  let's say things had slipped
[59:12.680 --> 59:15.720]  and the only new phones that Apple had shipped this year
[59:15.720 --> 59:17.240]  were the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,
[59:17.240 --> 59:18.720]  I don't think that would have been a disaster.
[59:18.720 --> 59:20.760]  Those are, they're great phones and they look fine.
[59:20.760 --> 59:22.200]  Yes, they are.
[59:22.200 --> 59:23.520]  But using this phone for a day,
[59:23.520 --> 59:25.640]  you really do see what wasted space
[59:25.640 --> 59:27.120]  the chin and forehead are.
[59:27.120 --> 59:28.460]  Like, I don't think it's terrible.
[59:28.460 --> 59:30.080]  I don't, you know, it's,
[59:30.080 --> 59:31.680]  I guess maybe the more I use this,
[59:31.680 --> 59:33.180]  the more dated that might look,
[59:33.180 --> 59:35.680]  but it is wasted space though.
[59:35.680 --> 59:37.360]  It really does, it.
[59:37.360 --> 59:42.360]  Well, it's wasted space for what we have now,
[59:42.740 --> 59:44.740]  but you know, for the,
[59:44.740 --> 59:47.660]  for the technology that was put into that phone,
[59:47.660 --> 59:49.140]  it's needed space.
[59:49.140 --> 59:50.280]  Yeah.
[59:50.280 --> 59:55.280]  You know, I still, I mean, I love my, my iPhone 8 Plus.
[59:55.340 --> 59:56.860]  I think it's a great phone.
[59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.100]  But when I look at the chin and the forehead of that,
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.520]  and then look at this iPhone 10 with no chin and forehead,
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.780]  I think, wow, you know, that's a huge difference.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.020]  It's a good display.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.420]  It really is.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.340]  And Apple, I'll bet that in your briefing,
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.060]  they mentioned the same thing.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.420]  I think that it's almost a sore point with them,
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.820]  within the company,
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.780]  that this is not like an off the shelf Samsung component.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.980]  It's not like, you know,
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.460]  they just went in and said to Samsung,
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.620]  well, give us, you know, give us what, you know, this type,
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.340]  you know, here's, here's the OLED displays you guys make,
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.980]  give us one of the model 5A27, whatever,
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.140]  and cut to this size, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.780]  This is a totally custom designed by Apple.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.940]  Apple designed the display, Samsung just makes it.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.540]  But it's unlike anything that,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.300]  it's unlike the OLED display in any Samsung product
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.720]  because it's not a Samsung design.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.560]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.760]  And where it manifests itself to me
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.520]  is that the colors look right.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.820]  Like the app icons don't look,
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.100]  they don't have that OLED oversaturated look.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.060]  And I know that like OLED displays have gotten a lot better
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.940]  across the board in recent years,
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.980]  but I still look at like high-end,
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.220]  some high-end flagship Android phones,
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.540]  like the ones, especially the ones from the
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.220]  Korean companies like Samsung and LG.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.260]  And to me, they look too saturated.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.460]  And I think, I don't even think it's like a technical,
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.620]  I don't think it's that they are inferior.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.700]  I think it's on purpose that they're made to pop
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.740]  because for some people,
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.460]  some people like that oversaturated look, you know?
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:43.460]  And I was just talking about it on the show
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.000]  last week with Renee,
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.480]  that Google is taking some flack with the pixels
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.280]  because Google has set their color balance
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.980]  more towards like an iPhone that's not oversaturated.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.100]  And there's some people in the Google ecosystem
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.200]  who are so used to that,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.080]  or just genuinely do prefer it,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.100]  that they think that the pixels look washed out.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.660]  Whereas I think the pixels look like
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.820]  finally an Android phone with good color.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.980]  I have absolutely, one day in,
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.220]  I have absolutely no reservations whatsoever
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.600]  about the color reproduction on this phone.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.660]  No, none.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.420]  Everything looks good.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.580]  Photos look good, apps look good.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.140]  Dark apps like the Apple Watch app look great.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.760]  Light apps with a white background like male look great.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.980]  There's no weird.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.960]  You do get a blue,
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.260]  Panzerino wrote about this, I think,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.020]  but if you hold it at a really oblique angle,
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.060]  like almost like you're looking at it from the side,
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.780]  there is a slight blue shift
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.060]  that you don't get with an LED screen,
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:52.060]  but it's not like slightly off angle.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.820]  It's like truly an oblique angle.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.300]  Like so oblique that you couldn't really use the phone
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.140]  from that perspective anyway, so who cares?
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.460]  Right, yeah.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.900]  I guess the big unknown is,
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.740]  because OLED famously compared to LED,
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.100]  one of the downsides is that OLED
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.020]  is way more susceptible to burn-in
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.960]  and have like image retention type problems.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.940]  Typically after the phone or whatever the device is,
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.740]  phone, TV, whatever, is in use for a long time.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.420]  Now Google got in some trouble
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.400]  because their new Pixel XL 2 starts suffering this
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.980]  about six days in, which is not good.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.820]  Not good.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.740]  This is the sort of thing though
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.740]  that even like a full week long review,
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.980]  you can't tell, there's no way.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.620]  And I even asked Apple about it.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.660]  Like, how do you simulate like,
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.020]  and they said that their answer
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.280]  was that they put a lot of work into mitigating burn-in
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.120]  and they're well aware of it.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:51.960]  They spent a lot of time.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.420]  I was like, well, how do you simulate that though?
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.700]  I was like, you know, like,
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.700]  our Ikea used to have a robotic butt.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.420]  They're in the chair department.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.020]  There's like a chair that Ikea,
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.540]  so they don't have it at our Ikea anymore,
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.900]  but I used to love it.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.500]  And they had it in glass, like plexiglass and clays,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.880]  one of their chairs and they show how they test it.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.900]  And they had this robot butt
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.780]  that would just sit in the chair, get up, sit in the chair.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.500]  And there was like a machine calibrating it
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.460]  to say that it was like simulating somebody
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.860]  who weighs 185 pounds.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.600]  And there was a counter that incremented
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.900]  every time this robot butt sat in the chair.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.660]  So how do you test a chair?
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.400]  Well, you actually have a robot butt sit in the chair
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.420]  10,000 times or however many times I got up to.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.420]  How do you simulate a year worth of OLED use?
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.620]  And Apple wouldn't answer.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.020]  They're like, we've worked it.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.100]  Like the answer was we, secret sauce.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.000]  I have no doubt that they did.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.540]  I mean, they're very good at that, so.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.420]  I love trying to get them to answer a question
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.700]  even off the record.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.500]  Is there anything that you'll tell me
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.020]  that isn't one of your talking points?
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.620]  And the answer is usually never,
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.140]  but we shall see.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:11.980]  It's obviously one of the-
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.980]  That's why they have talking points.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.900]  Do you think, I know that with the iPhone 8,
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.260]  they improved the audio output from the speakers?
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.780]  Yes.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.620]  Who was I just listening to?
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.060]  I think it might've been Marco on ATP,
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.820]  but somebody whose podcast I listened to
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:34.360]  was saying about how they've started listening to,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.660]  like when they're in the kitchen,
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.860]  they won't even bother putting headphones or AirPods in.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.660]  They'll just play the podcast through the speaker
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.940]  like you're using like a little portable radio
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.820]  and it's actually gotten useful.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.700]  Like if you've calibrated your expectations
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.300]  for how the speaker sounds based on like the original iPhone
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.780]  and the 3GS and the iPhone 4,
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.360]  and you just think it sounds really tinny and thin,
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.580]  it's like, again, it's still a phone.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.820]  It's not like magically gonna sound like a boombox,
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.640]  but it's really pretty useful.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.700]  I find that this phone,
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.140]  I was listening to some stuff this morning,
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.180]  just again, just to try it.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.500]  And I don't know if it's any louder than the iPhone 8,
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.420]  but it's certainly louder than iPhones in the past were.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.220]  It's not just that it's loud, it's clear.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:26.420]  So, you can have loud and sound distorted and kinda awful.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.160]  The speakers in the iPhone 8 and the 10
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.740]  are just really good.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.700]  I think they're really good.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.040]  I listen to music all the time
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.980]  without my headphones on just using the iPhone.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.580]  And sometimes I'll use my Mac.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.700]  Most of the time I'll use the iPhone
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.940]  because then if I get up
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.260]  and I have a couple of great stations that I listen to,
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.340]  if I get up and do go for a walk or whatever,
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.020]  I'll just throw my headphones on.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.560]  Or if I go in the car, I just keep it playing all the time.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.140]  And when I'm at home,
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.340]  I just play through the iPhone speakers and it's great.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:09.340]  Hmm, I think big picture.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.980]  It's so interesting to me the strategy Apple has taken
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.340]  with the iPhone 8 compared to the iPhone 10,
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.420]  where the iPhone 8 is completely familiar.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.980]  I mean, sure, it looks as a new glass industrial design
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.380]  on the back and it does the wireless charging now,
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.100]  but that's just in addition to everything
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.060]  that came before it.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.140]  Like, if you're familiar with any iPhone,
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.580]  I would say from around the 5S forward, right?
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.340]  5S, I think was the first one with touch ID.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.700]  If your iPhone is a 5S, a 6, 6S, 7,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.200]  and you get an iPhone 8,
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.340]  you're gonna be completely familiar with it.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.680]  You know how touch ID works.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.480]  The basic proportions are the same.
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.840]  You know to swipe up from the bottom to get control center.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.400]  It's familiar across the board.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.640]  And there's so many little things
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.560]  that they changed in iPhone 10 all at once that,
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.640]  and to me, the box that I think Apple
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.920]  is trying to get out of with the iPhone 10
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.900]  is that when you have a super successful technology product,
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.360]  that familiarity and when it's so popular
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.480]  that the truly mass market,
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.700]  hundreds of millions of just regular people
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.480]  who aren't nerds and are not technology enthusiasts
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.120]  to use and depend on your product every day,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.560]  you break that familiarity at your own risk, right?
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.400]  And I think we've seen that with Microsoft over the years
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.000]  where Microsoft, I think has bent over backwards
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  in so many ways to maintain compatibility
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.680]  with just old versions of DOS and stuff like that.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.280]  They were limited to the goofy three character
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.460]  file extensions for so much longer
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.280]  than they had to be for technical reasons
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.120]  just because they wanted to maintain compatibility
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.140]  with old software.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.200]  And I kind of feel like the iPhone 10
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.740]  in a lot of these little decisions,
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.000]  it's things that I bet Apple has been wanting
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.320]  to do for a while but felt like they couldn't
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.520]  because they don't wanna break familiarity.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.440]  And now you can go in an Apple store
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.080]  and if you're the type of person who wants an iPhone
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.340]  that seems totally familiar to you,
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.600]  you can get the iPhone 8
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.960]  and you're not really settling for like a second tier phone.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.300]  You know, it's a very different strategy
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.040]  than when they had the 5C a couple of years ago,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.860]  which was sort of like year old tech and a plastic case.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.920]  Like this thing gets the, it's almost amazing
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.460]  how many of the features the iPhone 8 gets
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.760]  that the iPhone 10 has.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.840]  Well, and what people have to remember.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.080]  I just, I'll bet.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.840]  I would just love to hear from Apple store people
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.840]  after these are both out there,
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.840]  just how many regular people come in
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.840]  and gravitate towards the 8,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.940]  not because they don't wanna pay an extra 200 bucks
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.120]  but because they don't want something that's unfamiliar.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.640]  Well, and let's not forget that the 8
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.920]  has a lot of updated components as well.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.720]  So it's not like you're getting a 7 with a new name.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.560]  Right.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.360]  No, it has the A11 Bionic chip.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.740]  It has the, you know.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.920]  Yeah, I mean, these are powerful, powerful phones.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.960]  Right, the 8 Plus has the portrait mode
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.400]  with all the fancy new lighting effects, you know.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.840]  Yes, and I love the 8 Plus, I really do.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.520]  And the only reason that,
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.480]  you know, I keep talking about the Plus.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.480]  The only reason that I use the Plus is because of my eyes.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.640]  I have trouble seeing now.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.880]  I need glasses to read things
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.880]  and I boost up the font size and all that kind of stuff
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.780]  on the lower ones, but it's so bad sometimes now
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.780]  that it's like I get two letters a line or something,
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:03.700]  you know, so I use the Plus.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.820]  So that's what I talk about a lot
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.380]  because that's what I use.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.020]  It's one of my favorite things about all of iOS
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.720]  is the dynamic type size thing.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720]  And it's not just because I use it too.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.580]  I need it at least a couple of clicks.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.760]  I think I'm like two clicks above default,
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.460]  but I probably should go to three, but I'm fighting it.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.540]  But the thing that I love about it,
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.580]  the thing that I love about it is that,
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.740]  not just that it's there.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.860]  I mean, first and foremost, it's great that it's there
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.760]  because if you can't read, that's a problem.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.600]  And if you can read,
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.560]  it makes all the difference in the world.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560]  But the thing I love about it is that when you turn it up,
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.020]  it doesn't look like you're using
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.940]  a weird accessibility mode.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.940]  Like so many ways,
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.160]  the way software used to be written in the old days
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.900]  was everything was just right down to the pixel.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.540]  It was not, you couldn't really,
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.260]  if you'd bump the font size up one point,
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.660]  everything would, all the layout would break, right?
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.500]  Right.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.940]  And so you might have a mode like this on your software,
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.700]  but it would look janky.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.900]  It would look like you're using a special mode
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.860]  for people with bad eyes.
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:07.580]  Whereas you can turn the dynamic type up a large amount,
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.060]  and it still looks like a properly written app
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.580]  and all of Apple's apps support it.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.600]  And most third-party apps do too.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.620]  They just look fine.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.460]  They look great.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.780]  It looks like that's the way it was supposed to be.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.340]  It was supposed to be bigger type.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.220]  And I just appreciate that so much
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.020]  because it would annoy me if I needed it to read,
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.400]  but made the OS look janky.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.180]  Yeah, and to your point,
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.300]  most developers are supporting that
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.200]  and have for a number of years.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.200]  So if you need that extra big type like you and I,
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.000]  although you've got to go, just jack it up there, John.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Just stop fighting it, just do it.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.520]  I have mine jacked up and all of my things look great.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.280]  All my apps look fine, everything looks fine.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.280]  I can, actually, if I hold the phone away a bit,
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.880]  I can see if I need to, like a text message or something.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.080]  But if I'm actually gonna read an email
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.440]  or something like that, I always check it out.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.800]  If I need to read an email or something like that,
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.040]  I always have my glasses on my T-shirt collar
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.360]  under my beard.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.360]  So I'll just pull those out and put them on and it's fine.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.280]  Let me see here, what else do I got?
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.600]  So what about with Control Center in the top right,
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.400]  how are you finding that reachability-wise?
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.320]  I know that's a question a lot of people have
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.040]  because if people tend to hold the phone towards the bottom
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.520]  of Control Center, your thumb is already there.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.480]  So the old style of swiping up from the bottom
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.920]  to get Control Center, it literally moved as far away
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.800]  as it possibly could.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.800]  From where it was, yeah.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.200]  So here's the problem with me and we talked about earlier,
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.000]  I never used Control Center that much.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.680]  So as I started to use it a bit more recently,
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.680]  I just reach up, I'm trying to think now
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.920]  because I have been going in there yesterday too
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.040]  when I got this phone.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.840]  I've just been using the index finger of my other hand.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.720]  I just reach up and pull Control Center down.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.560]  Yeah, it's like, I've been trying to think about it
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.000]  and it's just one of those things that's so hard
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.840]  with just one day.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.800]  But so far, I haven't really been annoyed by it
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.480]  but I also noticed that a lot of the time
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.200]  I'm already using the phone with two hands.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.680]  And so it doesn't matter.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.120]  I think for some people who rely on it one-handed,
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.320]  they're gonna be a little annoyed.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.200]  Yeah, yeah, I suppose.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.200]  I just, it's not one of those things that I use a lot.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.400]  So I'm trying to, what if I had to reach up there
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.160]  to go to the home?
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.560]  Yeah.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.480]  Then maybe I would be annoyed with that.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.320]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.080]  But-
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.280]  True Tone is great.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.200]  It doesn't bother me.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.400]  I love True Tone.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.200]  I want True Tone in my eyes.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.200]  So my last six weeks of iPhone usage
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.040]  were whenever it was in mid-September
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.000]  when we got the review units for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.760]  I spent most of my time with the iPhone 8,
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.280]  some time with the iPhone 8 Plus.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.720]  Both of those have True Tone and I really liked it.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.440]  And I wrote my review and used them a bit more.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.720]  But then I went back to my personal iPhone 7
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.640]  and I noticed it and it was like,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.520]  I wish I missed True Tone.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.880]  But then that was like about four weeks,
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.120]  three, four weeks of that.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.640]  And then now back to True Tone again,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.280]  it's like, man, I am never not using True Tone again.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.680]  Like on the train last night on the way home from New York,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.040]  I had both phones out while I was, I needed both phones.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.960]  And it's like side by side in the harsh,
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.040]  well, not nearly harsh lighting,
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.880]  but the weird color on the Amtrak train.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.880]  It just, it's like night and day.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.200]  It's like the iPhone 10 looks to me normal
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.840]  and the iPhone, my iPhone 7 looked so blue.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.680]  It was weird.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.520]  It was crazy.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.480]  I love this feature.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.320]  I, it's hard to explain to people
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.320]  how good True Tone is just for reading,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.920]  just for looking at your iPhone.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.960]  I mean, I don't know about you,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.640]  but when I travel, I'm on a train or a plane
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.840]  or waiting at a gate,
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.840]  I'll read a lot of news, websites, what's going on.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.600]  And you notice it when you don't have it.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.160]  When your phone is hard to read,
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.160]  then you notice that strain of trying to read,
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.320]  but with True Tone, it really helps
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.320]  because it's not, it's so subtle in what it does,
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.320]  but so helpful in what it does.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.800]  So I think everything should have True Tone.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.080]  I think the last item on my list here
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.720]  is using un-updated apps, meaning third-party apps
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.040]  or even first-party because some of Apple's own apps
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.840]  from the App Store, like the Apple Store app
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.200]  have not been updated yet for the iPhone 10 screen.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.680]  I haven't spent much time with them
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.720]  because a lot of the apps, even like Tweetbot
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.200]  and some of the third-party apps I use
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.800]  have already been updated.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.280]  It's, it is weird.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.480]  I mean, effectively it just sort of letterboxes it
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.480]  with a black bar at the top and bottom.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.560]  And it really just, it doesn't look bad though.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.640]  Like the way that in past transitions like this,
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.440]  when you had to use, like when you first got an iPhone 4
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.920]  and you'd use an app that didn't have retina graphics,
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.400]  it looked like total garbage.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.040]  Like really just, like just the worst looking thing ever.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.400]  When the iPhone 5 came out and the screen changed
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.480]  from three and a half to four inches
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.040]  and they would letterbox the apps, they looked terrible
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.920]  because it just looked like they were squished
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.120]  and there was so much dead space at the top and bottom.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.000]  I would say this is the least objectionable
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.040]  when you open and of those transitions,
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.680]  when you open an un-updated app,
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.520]  it just looks like an older, like an iPhone 8.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.520]  Yeah.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.920]  You know, it's not a ridiculous.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.840]  It's not squished, it's not stretched,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.480]  it's not pixelated, it's not anything.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.560]  It's just an app.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.840]  Yeah, and you have a black chin and forehead.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.680]  Right.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.560]  So you can tell right away that, okay,
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.880]  this app isn't optimized for iPhone 10,
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.160]  but developers have also over the years
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.000]  gotten very good and very quick at updating their apps
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.840]  for new devices and new screens.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.800]  And you've been one of the best ones
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.520]  before these new screens and everything are released
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.600]  at giving people an idea of,
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.200]  okay, here's what's gonna happen,
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.400]  here's what it's gonna look like.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.640]  You know, you start getting into all that math and stuff
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.600]  that you know, resolution.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:31.760]  But that's really helpful for people to understand
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.200]  what's going to happen and what needs to change.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.720]  But I find developers are really quick to update that stuff.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.280]  As a matter of fact, I've got a couple of updates
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:46.280]  yesterday and today of apps that were updated for iPhone 10.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.720]  Yeah, I would expect that by Friday.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.800]  I'll bet every single day of the week,
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.260]  from now till Friday, your notification badge
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.600]  on the App Store app is gonna be like 20
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.800]  every time you go to load
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.960]  because everybody is submitting their things.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.200]  And Apple takes pride in that.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.820]  Apple loves to see people,
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.820]  and again, it's a culture within Apple
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.640]  to not let things stagnate.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.580]  I mean, look at how they broke compatibility
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.900]  with 32-bit apps with iOS 11.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.280]  Like that's the sort of thing that Microsoft would never do,
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.880]  at least not in the old days, right?
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.800]  Like they kept backwards compatibility with old side,
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.740]  and there's pros and cons to both strategies.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.840]  Like I'm not sitting here saying
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.300]  that Apple's strategy is always the best.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.840]  There's a couple of old apps
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.080]  that I really had great fondness for
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.040]  that it's a little sad that I can't even run them anymore
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.560]  on iOS 11, but I understand that that's progress
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.840]  and that the whole system runs better
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.060]  if they don't even have 32-bit libraries to load.
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:56.640]  If all they have to do is load one set of OS libraries,
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.880]  there's an efficiency win.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.800]  And, you know, so it's, you know.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.640]  And I'm all for that, to be honest.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.600]  I think that you need to keep moving forward
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.600]  in order to keep pushing the platform forward.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.680]  And there are developers out there that are using,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.280]  you know, in the year that an iOS is released,
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.880]  developers are pushing the limits of that platform
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.560]  by the end of the year, you know?
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.200]  And then Apple releases something new
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.780]  and gives them a bunch more headroom
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:28.720]  and, you know, developers plow in.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.200]  But if you keep adding backward compatibility into that,
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.920]  then, you know, you're holding yourself back.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.200]  Yeah, well, so what's your bottom line?
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.360]  That scratches off all of the iPhone 10-related
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:43.960]  things for me.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.800]  Well, bottom line is that for me,
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.360]  Face ID works a hell of a lot better
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.920]  than what I thought it would.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.240]  I love the size versus screen size dimensions.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.240]  You know, a smaller size phone, bigger screen.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.360]  It's, to me, a win-win, it's huge.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.200]  Love that.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.680]  There's nothing that I actually hate about the phone.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.360]  I said in the thing about the notch,
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.440]  I don't notice the notch.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.280]  If I stare at it, then yes, okay, I notice it.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:25.240]  But I look at the screen and for the content
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.480]  that's on the screen, so the notch doesn't bother me.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.880]  The notch doesn't bother me.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.880]  I see how they went with that.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.640]  There's nothing that I really dislike.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.080]  And I think the difference is that
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.600]  if you're just staring at screenshots
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:43.360]  and the screenshots show the notch, it looks ridiculous,
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.880]  right, and it's like, how could Apple ever approve this?
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.960]  But I feel like the way that it happened,
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.560]  and I know that this is a big thing within Apple,
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.400]  is to make real prototypes.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.760]  You don't just look at printouts on a piece of paper
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.520]  of what the interface looks like.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.440]  You've gotta run it on the real device.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.200]  So if it's an iPhone app, you know,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.800]  if Federighi had an interesting comment
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.000]  in the Panzareno article where they were,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.400]  their first simulations of the software
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.360]  of the iPhone X were running on an iPad
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.360]  because they didn't have hardware yet to run it on,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.720]  and they needed an iPad to get something big enough
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.520]  to have this big, tall, skinny retina display.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.520]  That was as real as they could possibly make it, right?
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.360]  So the realest they could get at that point
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.560]  was to run it on an iPad.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.400]  But then as soon as they could run it on real hardware,
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.160]  they ran it on real hardware, right?
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.160]  And I think once they, you know,
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.000]  they knew that they had this sensor package.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.840]  Here's the design.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.480]  Now, do we want to put black pixels in the corners
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.800]  to sort of disguise it or,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.280]  which is really, that's the look you get
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.120]  when you run an un-updated app, right?
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:55.960]  Correct.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.680]  Or do we want to embrace it?
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.680]  And I feel like once you're using it on a real device
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.520]  and you see what it looks like
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.120]  when they embrace the notch, it really does,
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.160]  it doesn't make the notch look good to me,
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.440]  but it really does, you just forget about it.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.280]  You really do.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.240]  I know that that's what Apple has told us
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.240]  on and off the record.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.720]  But in one day I have found that that is true.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.920]  It really is true.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.240]  And that's just such a relief to me
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.000]  because if it was like annoying me
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.040]  every moment of every day, it might be a problem.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:28.880]  Yeah.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.680]  Is there anything in your day of using it
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.080]  that you really dislike about the 10?
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.000]  That's a good question.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.560]  I'm going to keep you in suspense
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.800]  and I'm going to thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.960]  It's our good friends at Casper.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.800]  Casper is the sleep brand that continues
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.040]  to revolutionize its line of products
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.160]  to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.320]  One night at a time.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.640]  At Casper, mattresses are perfectly designed for humans,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.560]  engineered to soothe and cradle your natural geometry.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.640]  So comfortable, so nice.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.680]  You spend one third of your life sleeping.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.480]  I spend more than a third of my life sleeping,
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.640]  but most people spend a third.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.080]  So you should be comfortable.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.360]  I mean, I know it's a canard.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.560]  It's a cliche that you should spend money
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.920]  on a nice mattress because you spend
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.280]  a third of your life in bed, but really you do.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.360]  So why not get a good mattress?
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.240]  Or if you have a good mattress, but it's old,
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.520]  why not replace it with a brand new one?
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.280]  Get something nice.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.760]  Treat yourself.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.640]  Casper mattresses provide all the support
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.200]  the human body needs in all the right places.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.960]  They combine multiple supportive memory foams
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.400]  for a quality sleep service with the right amount
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.720]  of both sink and bounce.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.960]  And the thing that I like about this brand
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.160]  is that they don't make it hard to buy a mattress.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.080]  You don't have to choose between seven
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.460]  different mattress styles.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.600]  You just pick a size, get the size that your bed,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.840]  whatever size bed you have, get that size Casper mattress,
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.760]  and then that's it.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.680]  You're just getting a Casper mattress.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.580]  That's all you have to do.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.560]  Just pick a size.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560]  That is so fantastic.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.440]  Because buying a mattress from these traditional companies,
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.120]  it's confusing.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.040]  It's all these terms you don't even know,
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.360]  and here's one that's $900, there's another one that's $900.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.200]  Well, what's the difference?
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.880]  They're the same price, but one's got
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.320]  a totally different level of firmness or whatever.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.000]  Nonsense, what a waste of time.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.480]  Anyway, Casper's prices are great
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.960]  because they cut out the middleman.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.120]  They sell directly to the consumer.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.760]  They make the mattresses, they engineer the mattresses,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.360]  they make the mattresses, and then they ship them to you.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.320]  No hassle returns if you're not completely satisfied.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.680]  You get like 100 nights to sleep in the thing,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.940]  and if you don't like it, you just click a couple buttons
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.440]  on the website and a truck shows up the next day,
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.420]  they take your mattress away,
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.600]  and they give you all your money back,
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.760]  delivered right to your door in a very small,
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.140]  how in the world did they do that sized box,
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:53.820]  with free shipping and returns in the US and Canada.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:58.040]  In the US and Canada, you get free shipping and free returns.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.280]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.040]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.280]  Casper.com slash the talk show,
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.880]  and you can be certain of your purchase
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.800]  with their 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.280]  My thanks to them.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  So is there anything I do not like about the iPhone 10?
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.240]  I'll tell you, no, not so far.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.920]  I'm not completely sold on the home button thing,
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.040]  but I really do, at this point,
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.640]  I'm not willing to say I don't like it either.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.320]  I just feel like I'm in the unfamiliar,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.080]  I just have this 10 year old habit of stabbing my finger
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.220]  at the bottom of the phone to click a button,
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.560]  and there's nothing to click.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.840]  And I just do it without thinking.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.400]  And when I think about it, it's easy.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.280]  Yeah, I think that, like I said earlier,
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.200]  I think I'm so hyper aware with it.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.280]  Cannot possibly say that with any judgment, though,
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.320]  in 24 hours, I think it's gonna be fine.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:56.600]  And it fits with what I've been told by other people
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.680]  who've used this thing for a while, that yeah,
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.040]  within a week, you just start swiping up on all your iPhones
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.000]  and you're disappointed when they don't work.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.100]  Well, you remember, I remember very vividly
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.380]  because these technologies roll out one device at a time,
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.660]  and there might be a time three years from now
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:19.660]  when we're using iPads with Face ID and MacBooks
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.840]  or iBooks or iMacs with Touch ID, I mean, Face ID.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  Face ID would be so great in an iMac.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.520]  It totally, you know, how do you put a Touch ID sensor
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.520]  on an iMac when the keyboard isn't connected
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.760]  to the computer, how do you trust that wireless connection?
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.520]  Guess what, just skip it, don't even use Touch ID
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.580]  and put a Face ID sensor package in the iMac Pro.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.700]  That would be so fantastic.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.540]  It'd be great.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.920]  But in the meantime, when it's only on one device,
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.840]  when the technology is good and the design is right,
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.700]  and it's like, oh yeah, this is the way it should be,
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.280]  I remember very vividly for like a year,
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.640]  every time I go to use an iPad,
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.200]  I would just put my thumb on the home button
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.880]  and expect it to unlock and think that it's broken
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.000]  when it doesn't, and every single time, every time I do it,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.240]  and then I'd realize, oh, it doesn't have Touch ID yet.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.920]  So I think that Face ID is gonna be like that.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.360]  I agree, and that's just, it's just habit.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.480]  All right, why am I touching this button like an animal?
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.000]  The camera is great.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.480]  I mean, that's one of those areas
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.120]  where it is slightly better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.160]  because the wide angle camera is exactly the same
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.160]  and the telephoto camera is, it's half a stop faster.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.880]  It's F2.4 instead of F2.8,
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.440]  which if you don't know camera technology,
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.640]  all it means is that it can take a good picture
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.060]  in half the light that, you know,
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.940]  like wherever the minimum amount of light
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.960]  that the iPhone 8 Plus can take a picture
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.640]  with the 2X lens, the iPhone X can go halfway
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.920]  that much light further to get a good picture,
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:59.280]  which is great, and it has image stabilization
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.820]  on the telephoto lens, which the iPhone 8 Plus doesn't have,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:05.240]  but overall, the camera on the iPhone 8 is so great
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.800]  and it's so equal to the iPhone X.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.120]  And don't forget the front facing camera
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.360]  has portrait mode on the iPhone X.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.900]  Yeah, yeah, I took a couple of those.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.700]  I look, I look, I look okay.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.240]  Well, yeah, I mean, I did too, but I think that's the model.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.400]  I'm not a big selfie taker.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.940]  I do think though, I know that the billions of people are,
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:33.680]  and I know that's a very popular art form on Instagram.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.720]  I feel like the portrait mode with the, you know,
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.640]  for the selfie camera is gonna overwhelm Instagram
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.080]  as soon as these things start rolling out
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.600]  into people's hands.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.680]  Agreed, but it does work and it is beautiful.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.000]  Yeah, so I checked on the store there right now.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  If you went to the applestore.com or store.apple.com,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.960]  whatever the hell you go to,
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.500]  tried to buy an iPhone X right now,
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.760]  they're quoting five to six weeks delivery.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.060]  So that would take you into like mid-December.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.000]  That's not bad though,
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.360]  cause it was five to six weeks after the first day.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.200]  Yeah.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.400]  So that's, that's pretty good.
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.680]  Yeah, I feel like they're pretty confident
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.620]  about the ramp up.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.140]  That's, that is pretty good for a phone
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:21.080]  with an awful lot of pent up demand.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.440]  Yeah.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.960]  Trying to think what else?
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.720]  You know what I'm not a fan of?
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.720]  I am not a fan of wireless charging so far.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.520]  Did you wind up using that a lot?
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.820]  I'm gonna try again.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.620]  I have it in a place where I can put it down
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.360]  and wireless charge, but I, whenever,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.840]  I guess it's just what I'm used to,
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.440]  but whenever I go to charge, I expect it to charge fast
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.920]  and wireless charging is not fast.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.160]  I have, I have a fast charger set up
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.480]  and my wireless charger was right beside it.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.800]  So, you know, again, habit,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.960]  if I had to take my fast charger away,
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.960]  I probably would have used wireless charging more.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.800]  Yeah.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.140]  But my fast charger was right there
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.080]  and I would just plug it in.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.640]  And then by the time I realized, just say, ah.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.760]  Somebody, somebody wrote to me talking about this recently.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:21.600]  And I think I was in a context of me complaining
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.920]  that they still ship the small charger with the iPhones
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.480]  instead of the bigger one that charges faster.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.860]  And the thing that I didn't end,
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.480]  I called it like a nickel and dime move.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.400]  And then a bunch of people wrote to me and said,
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.240]  hey, you know what?
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.560]  I like the small charger because it fits everywhere
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.720]  or like women can keep it in their purse
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.000]  and it doesn't take up, hardly takes up any space.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.920]  I heard from people who like the way
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.360]  that the little charger that ships with the iPhone,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.560]  that the prongs don't fold in.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:57.140]  So you never have to screw around with bending that,
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.700]  you know, getting the prongs in or out.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.400]  It just, it, you know, it's so much simpler.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.240]  The prongs are so sturdy.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.480]  And you know, sometimes when you have another plug
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.400]  in an outlet, like you've got an outlet in the wall
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.080]  with only two plugs, but if you have a big plug into one,
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.720]  you don't have room for another big charger.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.680]  And this one will always fit.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.300]  So I've heard there's actually a lot of people
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.940]  who like the small charger, but then somebody else wrote
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:23.080]  and somebody speculated that maybe Apple ships
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.760]  the small charger because it's better
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.760]  for the long-term health of your battery
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.320]  than using the fast charger.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.840]  And I thought that was an interesting question.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.240]  So I asked Apple about that.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.400]  And the answer was, you don't have to worry.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.720]  They only support charging methods that are,
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.400]  and I asked also about wireless charging.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.280]  Is wireless charging better for the battery,
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.200]  worse for the battery?
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.100]  Is there, you know, and the gist of it was,
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.580]  one of the reasons that like they,
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.500]  it took them a while to get wireless charging
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.380]  is that they only support charging
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.940]  that they think is good for the long-term health
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.100]  of the battery of your phone.
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.700]  So if they thought that like using,
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:04.700]  if they thought that using your 29-watt MacBook charger
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.260]  to fast charge your phone,
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.860]  if they thought that was gonna be detrimental
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:10.120]  to the long-term health of your battery,
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.340]  they wouldn't support it.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:14.420]  Whether people wanna complain that,
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:16.580]  oh, the iPhone still doesn't have fast charging or not,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.500]  they wouldn't do it because they just want you to know
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.260]  that whatever they officially support
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.020]  is good for your phone.
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:22.940]  Yeah, right.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:27.300]  So anyway, I had the white Belkin key charger,
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.780]  Qi charger, whatever they call this,
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:33.320]  Qi, is that what it's called, with the iPhone 8.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.280]  And I didn't like it.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.500]  And Jason Snell had a, I loved it.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:40.120]  He had a great review of the iPhone 8 this week.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.300]  And I just, part of it is thinking,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:45.860]  because I already knew at the time that I read it
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.980]  that I wouldn't be rushing
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:51.860]  to get an iPhone 10 review out this morning.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:56.860]  And looking, making lemonade out of lemons,
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:58.720]  it'd be nice to take my time with it.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.260]  And I really liked the sort of six weeks
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:06.260]  with the iPhone 8 perspective that Jason put in his review.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.980]  But one of the points he made
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:11.080]  that I totally found myself nodding in agreement with
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:14.460]  was that he just was not that big a fan of wireless charging.
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:17.180]  And one of his points was what you said, it's slow.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.700]  So if you are gonna charge your phone, why not do it fast?
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.780]  And then he made a point, and I've seen it too,
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.100]  where at least with the Belkin one,
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.500]  you can get notifications that vibrate your phone
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.380]  and it vibrates off the sweet spot.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.980]  And then all of a sudden it's not charging anymore.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:35.500]  Like I absolutely, I thought it was my mistake.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:38.060]  I woke up the one morning when I was testing it
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.140]  and it was only, it was only at like,
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:43.460]  my phone was at like 40% and hadn't charged.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.860]  And I thought, oh, I must've put it on the pad wrong.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:50.020]  To quote and paraphrase Steve Jobs, I charged it wrong.
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:53.660]  I'm convinced now that what happened
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.240]  was it vibrated off the sweet spot.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.260]  So anyway, I've got the Mophie one now,
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:01.200]  which people are saying is better, the black one.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.220]  That's what I have, the Mophie one.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:08.220]  Now, wireless charging to me is as much a mindset
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.580]  as it is about the technology.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:15.580]  So when I was putting it down on the wireless charger,
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:19.340]  my phone was always charging.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.820]  You know, because you put your phone down,
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.740]  I'm typing on my laptop and typing away and typing away.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.780]  And then I picked my phone up for some reason,
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.340]  you know, go for a walk or do whatever.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.220]  Then I come back and you put it on the wireless charger.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:32.060]  But it's, so it's always there.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.780]  It's more of a convenience than anything.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:37.340]  So when I remembered to do that,
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.480]  the convenience factor of wireless charging did work.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.600]  But when, if I have a half an hour
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.380]  and I'm going out somewhere,
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.780]  it's going on the fast charger.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.180]  You know, cause I want as much,
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.540]  I want to apply as much charge into that as I can get.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:57.380]  So that was the dilemma for me.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.740]  Well, a lot of it was just remembering to do that.
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:03.420]  So, you know, I'll try that again with the iPhone 10,
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.400]  but what I'll do is take my fast charger away
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.620]  and put it somewhere else.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.900]  You know what I just figured out?
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.460]  I just figured out that my microphone
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.460]  is interfering with Face ID.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.260]  Cause I'm sitting here playing with this phone
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.420]  while we're talking and Face ID,
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.660]  it's like, it keeps asking me for my passcode.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.500]  And I'm like, what the hell?
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.500]  Why is it asking for my passcode?
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.780]  And I realized it's cause I have a big black microphone
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.660]  right in front of my face.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.220]  Ha!
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.540]  See, that's the, see, that's the type of thing
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.980]  you can't get in a 24 hour review.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:31.340]  You gotta use it for a week.
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.380]  Anyway, I don't have anything more about it.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:37.140]  I like this product.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.420]  I think that it is as good as advertised.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:44.300]  And I think it's fascinating how many little changes
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.060]  Apple has made to the experience,
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.340]  both hardware and software with this one phone.
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:52.500]  It is, it's for the most popular product
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.540]  the company has ever made.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:54.700]  And one of the most popular products
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.700]  any company has ever made in the world.
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.980]  It is a big change, but I think it's for the,
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.540]  I do think it's for the better.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.340]  I have no complaints so far,
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:07.980]  but it's been a day and a half.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.980]  So, but there's nothing that I've seen so far
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.380]  that would give me any pause.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.020]  I always say when in doubt,
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:16.860]  I know that people think that everybody
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.820]  who's got the word marketing in their name
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.700]  is a natural born liar.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.180]  And they're trying to sell you shit
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.460]  and tell you it's a filet mignon.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:30.460]  So Apple traditionally, trust but verify, look into it.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.420]  Don't just take them at their word,
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.340]  but for the most part, when they tell you something,
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.180]  they really mean it.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:39.180]  And so like when Tim Cook built this
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.020]  as this is the future of the iPhone,
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.940]  this is the way it's going.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.500]  After a day with it, I think it adds up.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.220]  And I think that all these little things
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.740]  like moving control center and getting rid of the,
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:51.780]  I mean, getting rid of the home button
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.100]  is obviously the biggest change.
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:59.100]  It was the central, the only two main controls of an iPhone
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.460]  were the touchscreen and the home button
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.660]  and they got rid of one of them.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.940]  Right, you could use an iPhone with broken volume buttons.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.660]  You could use an iPhone if the mute switch breaks,
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:10.900]  but you couldn't use an iPhone without a home button
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.140]  unless you turned on that goofy on-screen home button thing
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.420]  that the people in China all use.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.300]  Like even without a home button, you need to fake it.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.140]  And that's just,
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.820]  it was not the real iPhone experience using that.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.900]  And now they've gotten rid of it.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.220]  And it's hard to overstate how fundamental a change that is,
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.260]  but I think they have a good idea here.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.260]  So do I.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:37.620]  All right, Jim, everybody can read your fine work
