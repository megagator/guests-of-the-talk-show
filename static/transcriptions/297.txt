[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  Oh, David Smith. How's your week been? Boring, probably.
[00:03.200 --> 00:07.200]  Yep. Nothing going on. It's just the beginning of fall. Things are quiet.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.320]  You know, the leaves are turning.
[00:09.280 --> 00:10.400]  Feet up on the ottoman.
[00:11.120 --> 00:16.000]  Yeah, that's me. It's just finally cool enough that I can get a fire going in the fireplace,
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  and I can just sit by the fire and read a casual book or something like that.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.280]  Dig into a long novel that you've been saving up for a while.
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.440]  Or the opposite of that. I think the scene we just described is the exact opposite of
[00:29.440 --> 00:31.360]  how the last week has been in my life.
[00:31.360 --> 00:37.520]  Yeah. Isn't that always the truth, though? I mean, I know it's like the human condition,
[00:37.520 --> 00:42.080]  where if you had released new apps and it didn't seem to go anywhere,
[00:42.080 --> 00:46.400]  went over like a lead balloon, you would think, wouldn't it be great if one of these apps had
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.120]  been a hit? Wouldn't it be great? And now that your app is a hit, wouldn't it be great to just
[00:51.760 --> 00:53.840]  have a week by the fire?
[00:53.840 --> 01:01.360]  So as we record this episode on Tuesday, the 29th, it'll be out tomorrow, probably the 30th.
[01:02.960 --> 01:10.720]  The top downloaded free app, top app right now in the App Store is your app, Widget Smith.
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.160]  Yes.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.560]  And it has been the top app since...
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.840]  Friday the 18th. So about a week and a half ago.
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.800]  So it's been at the top of the list for a week and a half.
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.400]  I think there's a good chance it'll still be at the top of the list tomorrow when this comes out.
[01:27.120 --> 01:29.600]  Congratulations. In all seriousness, joking aside...
[01:30.800 --> 01:38.160]  Wow. Yeah. I mean, it's been completely surreal. It's one of those weird places where it's not
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.400]  like this is one of those situations either where I just started doing this, and then it took off
[01:42.400 --> 01:48.480]  in a wild way. I've been making apps in the App Store since the beginning, since 12 years ago,
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.280]  essentially. And I've seen this happen to other people, and it's always like, oh, that's nice.
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.440]  I wonder what that's like. And you never really ever actually think that it's the kind of thing
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.120]  that would actually happen to you. And to actually be in a position where I made something that's
[02:03.120 --> 02:08.400]  sitting at the top of the charts and has remained there, it was certainly never the plan or the
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.360]  expectation, but it's kind of surreal to be the situation I find myself in now.
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.200]  So I made the joke, but not even a joke. It's a humorous observation that it was my
[02:19.200 --> 02:26.720]  teenage son who came to me shortly after the release of iOS 14. So you've been number one
[02:26.720 --> 02:34.400]  since the 18th. That's a Friday, you said. And iOS 14 came out famous.
[02:34.400 --> 02:35.680]  Wednesday, I believe.
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.640]  Yeah, famously, because the event was a Tuesday. And then
[02:38.640 --> 02:45.840]  we had듈 say we, I don't have an app, so it's not even really me. I'm using the royal we here.
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.160]  You, developers, had something like 21 hours or something like that.
[02:51.840 --> 02:55.440]  And realistically, it was less than that even, because we had to submit,
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.440]  get through App Review, and then be ready for the apps when iOS was actually released the
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.440]  following afternoon. So it was like, I think I had my submissions made within maybe about
[03:07.440 --> 03:09.200]  four hours of the event going up.
[03:09.200 --> 03:15.280]  So you had your submission in the queue four hours after the announcement.
[03:15.280 --> 03:15.680]  Yeah.
[03:15.680 --> 03:17.680]  So luck favors the prepared.
[03:21.600 --> 03:27.680]  I do think, so let's just say, so my son came to me, and this is like, probably around the
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.600]  time that it hit the number one on the charts, maybe like by the weekend, where it was like,
[03:31.600 --> 03:35.760]  hey, have you heard about these iOS 14 widgets? And I was like, yeah. And he's like,
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.760]  have you heard about this app, WidgetSmith? And I had this in a footnote. I was like,
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.000]  yes, I have. And in fact, and then he just rolled his eyes.
[03:46.880 --> 03:50.000]  I was going to tell him how I knew you, and you're a swell guy, and
[03:52.000 --> 03:52.640]  it doesn't care.
[03:52.640 --> 03:57.920]  Yeah, it didn't really care. I thought maybe he had me, I think. And somebody on Twitter was like,
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.440]  does how often does your son think he can sneak something iOS related by you? And I said,
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.400]  actually more often than you'd think, because he thinks that I only follow the boring stuff,
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.400]  and that he can alert me to when something actually interesting happens.
[04:12.400 --> 04:16.240]  Sure. Or maybe he was sad that you hadn't told him already.
[04:16.240 --> 04:16.960]  Yeah, maybe.
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.840]  Why didn't you give him a heads up? This was coming. He could have been the cool kid on the
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.520]  block who knew it before anyone else did.
[04:23.680 --> 04:31.120]  It's, you know, I say it's, it is surprising, right? Like you did not, you maybe you thought
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.320]  you had something, right? What were you thinking? So, WidgetSmith is obviously an all new thing,
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.760]  because it's entirely predicated on a feature that only exists in iOS 14.
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.840]  Yeah. And so, I mean, WidgetSmith is in many ways like the spiritual successor to another
[04:47.840 --> 04:52.800]  app that I made and launched in the spring called WatchSmith, which was an app all about
[04:52.800 --> 05:00.560]  making custom complications for the Apple Watch. And when I made that, that app launched,
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.000]  and it did reasonably well, but nothing like, it didn't like, you know, set the world on fire or
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.240]  anything. It was just like, it was a power, it was like a niche tool for power users, essentially,
[05:08.240 --> 05:13.920]  was the way that I have it in my mind and the way that it kind of manifested itself in the
[05:13.920 --> 05:19.440]  market as a result. And when widgets were announced, and I was like, okay, like, I have
[05:20.160 --> 05:25.120]  a lot of the infrastructure in place for how you would build an app that does this kind of thing,
[05:25.120 --> 05:31.040]  where a complication and a widget are functionally and even programmatically very similar in sort of
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.920]  concept. And so I was like, well, let's just take what I built there and put it into widgets
[05:36.720 --> 05:41.280]  and kind of see what happens. And if I'm being completely honest, my expectation
[05:41.280 --> 05:47.760]  was that, like, my personal goal was that WidgetSmith's sort of downloads and subscriber
[05:47.760 --> 05:53.520]  base and everything would be about half of WatchSmith. And that was what I was going
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.560]  into with, because I thought it was like, well, this is like a power user feature,
[05:56.560 --> 06:02.800]  like, who's going to want these like power user widgets on their phone? Like on the watch,
[06:02.800 --> 06:06.560]  at least it's like a thing that, you know, the complication system is really limited.
[06:06.560 --> 06:11.840]  But on your phone, everyone's going to use the widgets that come with the apps that they use,
[06:11.840 --> 06:17.440]  that why would they use mine, you know, if they're like my calendar widget versus Apple's calendar
[06:17.440 --> 06:22.160]  widget, or my photo widget versus Apple's photo widget. And so I had no expectations for it.
[06:22.160 --> 06:25.760]  And it was just something that I was like, well, I'm in the place that I can do this,
[06:25.760 --> 06:30.320]  like, I have the infrastructure, I have the code, I know what I'm doing enough that it's not a crazy
[06:30.320 --> 06:35.200]  ask. And so I launched it with sort of no expectations. And, like, the initial first,
[06:35.200 --> 06:40.160]  the first few days before it really kind of blew off, like blew up was, you know, sort of
[06:40.160 --> 06:44.480]  fulfilling my expectations. It was like, this is kind of it's finding its niche, I had some
[06:44.480 --> 06:49.600]  good feedback and was like, amongst the people who are very power usury and care a lot about,
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.480]  you know, very particular things. And that was where I was expecting. And that's kind of where
[06:54.480 --> 06:58.160]  I was expecting it would go. And it would just cruise along, you know, less than some a lot of
[06:58.160 --> 07:02.240]  my other apps, but just, you know, part of the portfolio. And that's great. Like, I absolutely
[07:02.240 --> 07:07.200]  no expectation that it would take off in the way that it did. And it came as a complete surprise
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.120]  and is still like something that I can only sort of like something every now and then I just like
[07:11.120 --> 07:14.880]  open the App Store and just like scroll down to make sure that it's actually real. Like,
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.640]  like, this isn't some big con that like is being played, like played on me because I had no
[07:20.640 --> 07:25.120]  expectation of it. And it yet it seems to be true. It seems to be actually what's happening in the
[07:25.120 --> 07:32.400]  world right now. It is interesting. It's an interesting comparison, because famously,
[07:33.520 --> 07:37.360]  and I would like to talk about the watch stuff separately. So we'll, we'll come back to this,
[07:37.360 --> 07:46.160]  you know, in a somewhat organized fashion that this show usually proceeds. But there is a so
[07:46.160 --> 07:53.680]  famously six years in, seven years in, I guess, what are we with the watch? I guess six years
[07:53.680 --> 08:00.400]  since it was announced and we're at six or seven years. It's a series seven watch. So presumably
[08:00.400 --> 08:06.160]  that's no series six series. I have to say it slowly. So as not to trigger our friend,
[08:06.160 --> 08:15.440]  the electronic widget. Yes. Series six watch watch OS seven. So it's the sixth year. Yeah.
[08:18.080 --> 08:24.240]  Famously, which is where I'm going is we don't get custom watch faces. No.
[08:25.520 --> 08:29.840]  There's a friend of mine named Marco Arment, who's are you familiar with Marco?
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.720]  I am familiar with his work. Okay. So Marco is a watch nerd and is also
[08:34.720 --> 08:39.840]  very fussy about things. And he complains endlessly about Apple's built-in watch faces.
[08:42.880 --> 08:49.600]  I think that's a long story. Why can't apps just make their own faces period? Why with,
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.520]  you know, if we have, and we keep hearing these numbers with all this, the lawsuits with Epic and
[08:55.520 --> 08:58.640]  stuff like that, that there's, I don't know, a hundred thousand apps going through the app store
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.280]  a week and there's over a million in the store of, you know, this is pick a category calculators,
[09:05.280 --> 09:14.800]  right? If you tried to use every single iOS calculator, there's gotta be hundreds of them,
[09:14.800 --> 09:21.600]  maybe thousands, I don't know, of varying degrees of design quality. Why aren't watch
[09:21.600 --> 09:26.560]  faces the same way? Why aren't there thousands, tens of thousands of watch faces?
[09:26.560 --> 09:33.280]  Why can't the Dallas Cowboys have an app where you can have a custom Dallas Cowboys watch face,
[09:33.280 --> 09:40.240]  et cetera? You can't. That's just not the way watch faces work. And a couple of years ago,
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.000]  they've added, they began adding complications, which is sort of the closest apps get to being
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.680]  able to be on watch faces. Right. But even there, it's sort of, you're playing within these
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.680]  very limited confines, right? It's not really like you have a complete canvas to write on?
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.880]  No. No. I mean, it depends a lot on the watch face. And that's where it gets really crazy
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.320]  making on the watch, is some of the watch faces, you have a reasonably big canvas,
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.760]  like on some of the modular faces where you have a big rectangular block that you can pretty much
[10:17.760 --> 10:25.200]  take over the face with. But on most of them, you get a little teeny little circle that you
[10:25.200 --> 10:29.440]  have to put your entire complication into. And so it's really not, there's only so much that you can
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.720]  do within that amount of space. We're talking about, I don't even know if it's like 50 pixels
[10:34.720 --> 10:42.080]  by 50 pixels or points, I guess. It's a very small space that you actually have to play with. And so
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.480]  you're definitely not creating a custom watch face. At the most, you're just creating a custom
[10:46.480 --> 10:50.880]  way to display some kind of data there, or some kind of information.
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.720]  And so in addition to the very limited set of rules that you have to,
[10:54.720 --> 11:02.480]  confines you have to play within visually, you also, I don't know if you have to, I guess.
[11:03.120 --> 11:09.600]  I don't know what the rules are. So there's also a wide variety of, and again, I'm laughing because
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.960]  I don't have to make all the complications, but there are a very wide variety of complication
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.720]  sizes, right? And then like upper left corner can be different than upper right corner because
[11:21.760 --> 11:29.360]  on some of the watch faces, they curve to fit the corner. Different sizes and joy of joys.
[11:29.360 --> 11:38.800]  There's actually two entirely different sets of watch sizes. There's the old series one or zero
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.880]  through three size with the square corners. And then starting with series four a couple of years
[11:44.880 --> 11:52.160]  ago now, the four, five, six, and it turns out much of the consternation of developers such as
[11:52.160 --> 11:58.000]  yourself, series three remains in the lineup at 199. And so therefore you can look forward to
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.200]  years and years of supporting those extra complication sizes. In addition to that,
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.240]  there are rules about how often, not even rules really, it's sort of all up in the air.
[12:08.240 --> 12:15.120]  How often does the complication update? So a complication, the way the complication
[12:15.120 --> 12:20.080]  system works is you provide like a timeline of information you want to display on it.
[12:20.880 --> 12:27.440]  And you can update that. When you create the timeline, you can have things as often as one
[12:27.440 --> 12:34.640]  per minute. And you can create up to a hundred of those. So if I'm at one minute by minute
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.720]  sort of accuracy, I can create a hundred minutes of things that will be shown on the display.
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.880]  And then I can update or change what my timeline is maybe every 15 to 20 minutes if the battery's
[12:46.880 --> 12:51.920]  full. And if the battery starts to run down, then who knows what. And it'll just sort of,
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.320]  the watch will get to your update or your request for an update whenever it feels
[12:56.960 --> 13:00.640]  like it's appropriate, which may or may not be anytime soon.
[13:00.640 --> 13:05.920]  Trenton Larkin Right. And so this is just a microcosm,
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.840]  but this watch complication situation is sort of a microcosm of the modern era of developing
[13:12.400 --> 13:20.080]  third-party software where the rules aren't exactly defined. Like there might have been
[13:20.080 --> 13:27.360]  before in the old days, something where you could write software for X, some sort of component,
[13:27.360 --> 13:33.840]  and you can't just update constantly. You only get a sliver of time, but that time would be
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.280]  determinate. You would know once a second, or even if it's once a minute. Once a minute,
[13:39.280 --> 13:46.080]  you will get a slice of time. You can update, and you can count on it. Every minute on the
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.160]  minute you're going to do this. Maybe you will know. Maybe you could say, hey, I don't need to
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.240]  do it on the minute. Everybody might want to do it on a minute. You could just update me, say,
[13:54.240 --> 14:00.400]  15 seconds after every minute. Do me at the 15-second mark. But then every minute at 15
[14:00.400 --> 14:06.160]  seconds after the minute, your whatever it is would get up. Widgets or complications on the
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.400]  watch aren't like that. They're sort of indeterminate, and the system manages it,
[14:10.400 --> 14:17.200]  and you just sort of raise your hand and make a request. I would like to update on this period.
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.760]  And the watch is like, okay, we'll deal with it.
[14:19.760 --> 14:28.240]  We'll take it under advisement. And the intentions aren't hostile towards
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.360]  users. I was going to say towards developers or users. I'll just say towards users.
[14:36.160 --> 14:43.040]  And however hostile it is towards developers, it's in the mindset of doing what's best for
[14:43.040 --> 14:50.240]  the users, which is to extend battery life and manage this sort of calculus of, well,
[14:50.240 --> 14:57.520]  let's let these things update as often as possible while also maximizing battery life,
[14:57.520 --> 15:02.960]  which is a very complicated calculus. And therefore, they don't reveal the formula.
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.040]  Yeah. And I think it's different on different devices. I think on a Series 3 Apple Watch,
[15:09.040 --> 15:14.400]  and part of why I'm so sad that it's still there, a Series 3 Apple Watch with its CPU
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.080]  and its performance characteristics and its battery life, I think it will have a different
[15:18.080 --> 15:24.560]  recipe than what a brand new top of the line Apple Watch is going to be able to do. There's
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.720]  a wide variety there, and I just have to kind of code my thing so that it's flexible as much
[15:28.720 --> 15:34.640]  as I can between those with kind of no expectation of when I'll actually be able to do what I want to
[15:34.640 --> 15:46.240]  do. Right. And that's sort of where, at a hardware level, Apple Watch is going, right? Because,
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.800]  yes, famously, when the watch first came out, apps were very slow. And that was really,
[15:52.800 --> 16:00.320]  really more of a watch kit problem where the third-party APIs were really, really rubbish,
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.440]  to put it mildly. And in hindsight, what's the등ell, why were they so bad? And I think
[16:05.440 --> 16:10.960]  it basically드gain, we're never going to get a real explanation from Apple because Apple never
[16:10.960 --> 16:18.960]  explains itself. But I think it's pretty obvious that the basic idea was we can't open up the real
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.720]  APIs that Apple itself was using for the built-in apps because either they're not ready, they're not
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.640]  ready, they're not up to our standards, or we can't trust third parties with these APIs to manage
[16:30.640 --> 16:40.720]  energy the way we are internally. So the APIs, the real ones, we can't open. But apps, quote-unquote,
[16:40.720 --> 16:49.440]  apps are so super important to iPhone and iPad, we need apps for Apple Watch. And so there was this
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.200]  push and pull where one side is saying we can't open up the real APIs for battery life and
[16:55.200 --> 17:01.920]  whatever other reasons, but we have to have apps on the, for lack of a better word, marketing side.
[17:01.920 --> 17:08.800]  Okay, we'll make this other set of APIs that we can trust them with, and they were really slow.
[17:08.800 --> 17:19.920]  But even, let's just say, go up to Series 3, just the basics and the APIs got better. People don't
[17:19.920 --> 17:25.040]  typically think of their watch as fast or slow anymore, right? Like what you want to do on your
[17:25.040 --> 17:33.520]  watch is fast. So all of the improvements to the chips aren't in the들t's always been an issue
[17:33.520 --> 17:42.240]  with battery-operated devices, laptops to phones to tablets, to manage efficiency over time,
[17:42.240 --> 17:48.400]  both with increasing performance, because you want to do some things faster and whatever, but also
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.960]  using the efficiency to extend battery life. With the watch, it's really all about battery life.
[17:53.600 --> 18:00.400]  Yeah. I mean, I think it's clear that that's the gating factor for any new thing that Apple is
[18:00.400 --> 18:04.160]  trying to do on the Apple Watch is defined by the battery, because the batteries in the Apple Watch
[18:04.160 --> 18:09.200]  are just so much smaller physically. There's only so much space you have if you're going to strap
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.800]  something to your wrist to try and squeeze battery into. And all of the features and all of the
[18:14.800 --> 18:22.000]  things that they're trying to do have to also work on a device where it's inconvenient for it to run
[18:22.000 --> 18:30.480]  on a battery in a way that feels more manifest than it is even with your laptop. Like if I'm
[18:30.480 --> 18:34.800]  sitting at my laptop and I'm working and I'm running Xcode and it's churning through my
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.000]  battery and I'm like, oh man, I need to plug in, I just plug in and it's fine. But if I have to
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.160]  do that with my Apple Watch, I have to take my Apple Watch off and put it on a dock,
[18:44.160 --> 18:49.200]  and I can't wear it for 45 minutes, and it completely eliminates the use of it.
[18:49.200 --> 18:53.760]  And even a phone, the number of times I've used my phone plugged in because it was low on battery,
[18:53.760 --> 18:58.320]  but I still wanted to use it, that's fine. But a watch, it has to work. And ideally,
[18:58.320 --> 19:01.040]  it has to work for at least whatever, 18 hours a day.
[19:03.680 --> 19:08.720]  If you recall, back in the old days when we had airports, it would often be a common sight to see
[19:08.720 --> 19:18.640]  somebody camped by a wall outlet using their phone while it's plugged in. I'm trying to avoid the
[19:18.640 --> 19:24.880]  puns with the word complicating, but I'm going to go ahead. Complicating factor with the watch is
[19:26.800 --> 19:34.080]  the health tracking features of the watch. Once you get hooked on them as a user,
[19:34.080 --> 19:37.920]  you feel like you're getting robbed. Like if you have to take your watch off and put it on
[19:37.920 --> 19:43.840]  the charger for 45 minutes, and while you're doing so, you are standing and moving around,
[19:43.840 --> 19:50.080]  you feel like you're getting robbed of stand hours and exercise time.
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.640]  Yeah. Or even worse is the situation where you go for a run or a workout or something,
[19:54.640 --> 19:59.840]  and you run three or four miles, and it runs out of battery when you're a quarter mile from the
[19:59.840 --> 20:05.440]  house. And it'll save the data, sort of, but it feels like you're being robbed. These steps
[20:05.440 --> 20:12.480]  didn't count. These calories aren't being counted towards my red ring. It's definitely, you feel
[20:12.480 --> 20:16.560]  personally affronted if you aren't getting credit for the things that you're earning,
[20:16.560 --> 20:19.280]  or you feel like you're earning when you're wearing your Apple Watch, for sure.
[20:19.280 --> 20:24.800]  Yeah. And I've had that happen, not for a while, because battery life has gotten better
[20:24.800 --> 20:29.120]  in the last few years, but I've had that happen during a workout, like on a jog,
[20:29.120 --> 20:37.600]  where that's when it's run out. And it feels like triply angering, right? It's like, I was running,
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.480]  I was actually out jogging, I'm sweaty. I really deserve those credits.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.520]  And it's not there. And I think to their credit, certainly they've done a great job
[20:47.520 --> 20:53.280]  for preserving that battery life, but it's come at a very tricky balance that they have to try
[20:53.280 --> 20:59.760]  and balance and find how much power, how much capability, how much utility can they put on the
[20:59.760 --> 21:04.880]  watch while still doing all these things. And I think also, the thing that's crazy with the Apple
[21:04.880 --> 21:10.720]  Watch and the battery life side is how it is constantly doing things. It is always trying to
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.480]  make sure, like, did you just fall down? Did you just fall down? Did you just fall down? It's
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.080]  monitoring you as long as you're wearing the watch. It's doing that. It's taking your heart
[21:20.080 --> 21:27.280]  rate once every six minutes. It's doing stuff persistently in a way that certainly doesn't come
[21:27.280 --> 21:33.120]  free. So it's not like a situation where I close my laptop lid, and it pretty much just goes to
[21:33.120 --> 21:39.200]  sleep, and it's not doing anything. The Apple Watch, if anything, other than the screen being
[21:39.200 --> 21:46.000]  lit up, is doing just as much most of the time than it would be when you are actually actively
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.120]  interacting with it. Are you washing your hands? What about now? Yeah, what about now? Nope.
[21:51.680 --> 21:59.040]  Nope, doesn't seem like it. Nope. What about now? So anyway, that's a long digression to come back
[21:59.040 --> 22:07.440]  to what my main point is, which is that one way to think about iOS 14 widgets is that they are very
[22:07.440 --> 22:20.240]  much like watch complications in so far as there are limited sizes. There are some serious
[22:20.240 --> 22:27.360]  limitations on well, I effectively they're mostly inner non interactive, like you can't make buttons
[22:27.360 --> 22:33.040]  that do things on widgets. They're sort of like information panels, which again, it's a lot like
[22:33.040 --> 22:43.200]  watch complications. They kind of update on the system's schedule, right? Yeah, they do. I mean,
[22:43.840 --> 22:51.200]  pretty much everything we just said about watch complications applies to iOS 14 widgets. I guess
[22:51.200 --> 22:57.760]  the sizes are easier to deal with, right? Where you just sort of have, you know, they're just set icon
[22:57.760 --> 23:07.280]  sizes, you know, a one icon size versus, you know, a row of icons. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sizing is a
[23:07.280 --> 23:12.160]  bit funny with widgets, because there's three different types, like a small, medium and a large,
[23:12.160 --> 23:19.280]  but the actual size that each of those are very wildly between which phone you actually have,
[23:19.280 --> 23:25.920]  or if you're on an iPad. Like if you have an iPhone SE, the size of the widget is different
[23:25.920 --> 23:30.880]  than if you're looking at that widget on, you know, a 10R or one of the larger screen.
[23:32.080 --> 23:37.440]  I think there's like six different sizes, like actual point sizes that they have. It certainly
[23:37.440 --> 23:41.600]  is easier because you have so much more of a margin. You're not trying to squeeze something
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.920]  into the difference between 44 points and 50 points. You're talking about the difference
[23:45.920 --> 23:52.640]  between 170 points and 179 points or something like it's much that difference matters a lot less.
[23:52.640 --> 23:57.920]  Yeah. But if there's certainly still that, you know, there's certainly a variety you have to
[23:57.920 --> 24:03.760]  accommodate for. I do not want to go too deep down this digression and famous last words for me. But
[24:04.400 --> 24:11.280]  one of the things I've been doing all summer is I've been running iOS 14 betas and still now with
[24:11.280 --> 24:18.720]  the release version, I'm running it on an iPhone XR. And my regular phone, my main phone that I've
[24:18.720 --> 24:30.160]  used for the last year is an iPhone 11 Pro. And the difference between the Pro and the other,
[24:31.520 --> 24:38.000]  the iPhone X wasn't called the iPhone X Pro, but the OLED ones, which are now called Pro,
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.640]  run at retina 3X. And the XR and the regular iPhone 11s, which aren't OLED, they're regular LCD,
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.320]  run at 2X retina. But the difference when you really dig into the point size, you know, like,
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.400]  oh, well, that means one point is two pixels on the 2X one and one point is three pixels on the
[25:00.400 --> 25:08.640]  other one. But the actual difference in sizes is really kind of wild. Like if you run both phones
[25:08.640 --> 25:14.800]  at their default sizes, like accessibility wise for text size, just don't bump up or bump down
[25:14.800 --> 25:19.520]  the text size that all run everything. It's sort of the default. And don't, you know, if you're
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.440]  running on one of the phones that has scaling available, don't set scaling to anything.
[25:23.440 --> 25:29.520]  The difference in sizes of text between the two is quite different. It's very, it's not like,
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.160]  oh, you have to sort of be a type nerd to notice that it's, no, it's like actually very different.
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.640]  And something like widgets, I can see exactly where you're going with that.
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.240]  Yeah, like it's a very, I think it speaks to just, it's the difference of 2X and 3X,
[25:46.240 --> 25:52.880]  but it isn't that the 3X screen has a resolution, has a sort of a dots per inch on the screen.
[25:52.880 --> 25:54.000]  Right.
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.360]  That is commensurately more detailed. It's higher, but it's not like if 1X was the thing,
[26:01.360 --> 26:06.000]  and then we doubled the resolution, and then we tripled the resolution, it isn't actually
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.280]  doing those changes. And so controls definitely look different, and it feels very different.
[26:13.280 --> 26:19.440]  Like I actually was in the same circumstance. Like my testing phone over the summer was a 10R,
[26:19.440 --> 26:26.880]  and going from that back to my 11 Pro feels really, even the keyboard is slightly different.
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.560]  It's not like things are totally out of whack, but it's like I feel different. Things are just
[26:32.560 --> 26:39.760]  a little bit weird in a way that when we went from the 1X to 2X originally, like with the iPhone 4,
[26:39.760 --> 26:46.240]  it really was, everything stayed the same size, everything just got sharper. Whereas now between
[26:46.240 --> 26:54.960]  2X and 3X, that's not the case. Things are physically different, like the actual size
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.360]  of something that's 100 points tall is very different between the different devices and
[26:59.360 --> 27:05.200]  the phones. And so when you're designing something that has to work across all of them,
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.720]  it has to be reasonable at all the extremes of that, even if at a point level you're
[27:10.720 --> 27:11.520]  exactly the same.
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.640]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, and it actually is counterintuitive where the 3X ones, the point size
[27:16.640 --> 27:24.320]  is physically bigger. And so like 16 point type is the default text size on iOS, it always has
[27:24.320 --> 27:33.280]  been. 16 point type is bigger on an iPhone 11 Pro than 16 point type on an iPhone 11,
[27:33.280 --> 27:39.920]  physically bigger. And you therefore get it's not just that the iPhone 11 has a bigger screen
[27:39.920 --> 27:46.480]  than the non-Max 11, it actually packs the pixels or the points in more. So you get like
[27:46.480 --> 27:53.680]  significantly more lines or words on a line in an email or an Apple note than when you're
[27:53.680 --> 28:00.480]  viewing the exact same email or Apple note on the other device. And you would think maybe
[28:00.480 --> 28:03.760]  it would be the other way because you think, well, it's 3X, so it must be, they must have
[28:03.760 --> 28:09.040]  more pixels per inch too, but it's actually different. And it's all very strange and so
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.320]  different from the old days where you could just count on an iPhone screen being an iPhone
[28:14.320 --> 28:18.400]  screen. And like you said, even when they went Redna, you just kept everything the same
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.640]  physical size and just doubled the resolution and made everything sharper.
[28:22.640 --> 28:27.040]  Brian Kardell Yeah, it went from like, it was 324 by 480, I think was the original iPhone.
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.040]  And then it's just like when they went to 2X, they just doubled that and kept the screen
[28:31.040 --> 28:31.840]  exactly the same size.
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.680]  Trenton Larkin Right. And then even when they went with the iPhone 5, when they went to
[28:35.680 --> 28:40.640]  a different aspect ratio, they just added pixels at the top. They didn't change the
[28:40.640 --> 28:46.240]  size of anything. They just, you know, so the keyboard was actually the exact same width.
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.560]  It just, you know, just they just added pixels at the top. Now we're in a new world.
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.040]  All right, let me take a break before we continue and talk about our friends at Eero.
[28:55.600 --> 28:59.520]  Oh, man, these days, your house isn't just your home. It's everything. It's your office.
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.560]  It's your school. It's your podcast studio. It's a movie theater. It's a restaurant.
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.880]  That's what my house is all those things right now, literally right at this moment today.
[29:10.800 --> 29:14.640]  Anyway, all of these activities, they put a strain on your Wi Fi. It's not good.
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.800]  If your Wi Fi doesn't reach every room in your house, or even worse, if it only reaches room or
[29:18.800 --> 29:26.400]  two, you need solid Wi Fi in your whole house. Eero is an Amazon company, and they their whole
[29:26.400 --> 29:30.800]  product line is set up to solve this problem. They cover your whole home with fast, reliable
[29:30.800 --> 29:36.720]  Wi Fi inside and out and it's super easy to set up. You got rooms with bad Wi Fi or no Wi Fi
[29:36.720 --> 29:42.480]  dropouts in certain rooms. Eero can help make every square foot of your home usable.
[29:43.840 --> 29:50.240]  It's really great. You're listening to me speak right now over an Eero Wi Fi connection. You just
[29:50.240 --> 29:56.560]  plug one into your modem. You plug other ones in around your house. Their app is how you configure
[29:56.560 --> 30:01.200]  everything in the app is always been great. But it's really gotten better in the last year. It's
[30:01.200 --> 30:05.520]  a total rewrite. It's even better than ever. And it has all sorts of amazing features where you
[30:05.520 --> 30:10.080]  can see what every single device in your home that's connected to your network is doing.
[30:10.800 --> 30:16.000]  And you can manage the ones you can take your kids devices and put them on a certain plan so
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.560]  that they can't get on the Wi Fi after certain times. And it's all this stuff that sounds like
[30:20.560 --> 30:25.360]  advanced features. The app makes it super, super easy to manage. But the app also is the thing that
[30:25.360 --> 30:31.920]  makes it easy to add other Eero base stations around your house. Their website can make it
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.880]  really, really easy to figure out how many you should order based on the size of your house and
[30:36.880 --> 30:42.720]  how many floors you have, etc. And it really is just a great service. They also just this week
[30:42.720 --> 30:47.520]  came out with all new base stations that I think it's the version six or something like that. Just
[30:47.520 --> 30:51.600]  go to their website, you'll find out all the details on the new hardware that they have.
[30:51.600 --> 31:00.000]  Go to here's the website to go to Eero, Eero.com slash the talk show, Eero.com slash the talk show,
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.160]  and use that same code the talk show at checkout and you will get free next day shipping with your
[31:06.160 --> 31:12.160]  order. So as you you can just pause this podcast right now. Spend 15 minutes order up some Eero
[31:12.160 --> 31:18.480]  stuff and it'll be at your house tomorrow. That's that's amazing. With that code Eero.com slash the
[31:18.480 --> 31:23.360]  talk show, get free next day shipping. Go check them out. I recommend it. I would recommend them
[31:23.360 --> 31:30.640]  even if they were not a sponsor of the show. It's a great product. All right. So you've had
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.480]  do you think here's here's another angle I've been going with. Do you think you would have had
[31:34.480 --> 31:42.000]  the idea for widgets myth if you hadn't already done watch Smith? That is a that is an interesting
[31:42.000 --> 31:50.640]  question. I don't think it would have ended up in the same way that I did that it did. Ultimately,
[31:50.640 --> 31:56.160]  it did because the thing that happened with watch Smith that I like my goal with that app was to
[31:56.160 --> 32:02.640]  try and make essentially like let people make their watch faces like their own. Like I wanted
[32:02.640 --> 32:07.200]  you to be able to control the typefaces, the colors, the data, how it was structured,
[32:07.200 --> 32:12.400]  how it was laid out. There's a tremendous amount of like especially on the watch. It was something
[32:12.400 --> 32:18.480]  that I started to notice is that like I got really picky about exactly how I wanted things to look
[32:19.200 --> 32:24.640]  in a way that I care about more on my wrist because it's something that's it's funny. It's
[32:24.640 --> 32:27.440]  a bit of a cliche. This is like it's a fashion thing, but it's like something I want to look
[32:27.440 --> 32:32.720]  good. Like I actually care like if I'm going to have the date or the temperature shown on my
[32:32.720 --> 32:38.160]  watch face and I'm like going out to a nice dinner back when that was the thing we did
[32:38.160 --> 32:43.360]  and I want it to look nice. Like I'm wearing my Apple watch rather than my fancy watch because
[32:43.360 --> 32:51.200]  I want to close my rings, but I want it to look just the way I want it to look. And I think the
[32:51.200 --> 32:57.840]  result of that sort of that ultimate desire that in the watch I was so like I got so specific about
[32:57.840 --> 33:04.400]  it is that I went through probably like five or six different editor screens of how can I make
[33:04.400 --> 33:11.840]  this something that isn't like totally intractable to a common user that is actually that is a clear
[33:11.840 --> 33:18.240]  straightforward like way that I can create this complexity and give you so much choice and let
[33:18.240 --> 33:22.320]  you choose the typeface and let you choose the colors and let you choose exactly what is shown
[33:22.320 --> 33:26.080]  and what's shown here and what time it's like appearing on your screen and all of the things
[33:26.080 --> 33:34.480]  that ultimately like WatchSmith ended up being it was be that level of sort of sophistication
[33:34.480 --> 33:39.200]  that I needed to squeeze into something that was usable was something I don't know if I would have
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.760]  had the time or the sort of idea about with widgets if I hadn't gone through that for the
[33:45.760 --> 33:49.920]  watch because the watch is so much more constrained and every little thing and every
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.960]  little tweak and that adjustment that you make mattered so much more there so that when I was
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.400]  doing it and applying it to widgets it made sense to just carry it over like I'd come up with a
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.360]  design that I feel like made a lot of sense and was intuitive and gave you that balance between
[34:05.360 --> 34:12.400]  power and flexibility that you know sort of applied immediately and directly to widgets and
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.600]  so but if I hadn't if I hadn't sort of just have gone through all that process with WatchSmith and
[34:17.600 --> 34:22.960]  with complications in mind it would have been hard for me to come up with it for something like
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.160]  widgets where I feel like in my mind anyway originally it's like I think that San Francisco
[34:28.160 --> 34:32.800]  Rounded is the best widgets font probably like I think it is it just looks gorgeous on the home
[34:32.800 --> 34:38.080]  screen I think and there's a very good chance that I would have just sort of asserted that and set
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.840]  that as the default even if I'd had the idea for an app like Widgetsmith and said like that's that
[34:43.840 --> 34:47.760]  I think I think that just looks gorgeous and I would have missed out on the fact that while that
[34:47.760 --> 34:53.520]  is gorgeous and I think if you know if I'm Alan Dye sitting in my white studio designing widgets
[34:53.520 --> 35:00.320]  for Apple's built-in apps that's probably what I'm going to use the reality is once I had my mind
[35:00.320 --> 35:03.840]  open to the fact that it's like well what happened like what other fonts are there what other fonts
[35:03.840 --> 35:08.160]  would look interesting and how can I add them into the application then you start to be like actually
[35:08.160 --> 35:14.400]  this is where the real magic starts to happen that you can make it look like it isn't just an Apple
[35:14.400 --> 35:19.280]  widget that it isn't I'm not like there there's a value and a utility in standing out from the
[35:19.280 --> 35:25.920]  system in potentially even being slightly like conflicting with the the way the system widgets
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.840]  look that that is that that is a benefit and not a drawback that's you know and some of like and
[35:31.840 --> 35:37.040]  well why the app originally seems like it really took off was because that was the case that I be
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.400]  any created it had so much flexibility and it had so much choice in it that you could really expect
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.720]  people felt like they could actually express themselves with it that they could find a font
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.600]  that suited them and if you're a San Francisco rounded person like great that more power to you
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.400]  but if you're a New York person or if you're you want some kind of some of the more silly and like
[35:56.400 --> 36:01.920]  esoteric fonts that I have in there or whatever that might be like great like you do that if that
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.920]  makes you happy that every time you pick up your phone you want it to look like that but I really
[36:05.920 --> 36:11.440]  don't think I would have necessarily had the sort of the expectation or the imagination to invent
[36:11.440 --> 36:16.880]  this if I hadn't had to do it for the watch if I hadn't had to do that for complications because
[36:16.880 --> 36:20.560]  they felt like a fashion item they felt like something that had to have that level of
[36:20.560 --> 36:28.480]  customization anyway and I'm there I wasn't competing with other text most of the time that
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.320]  a lot of the a lot of the watch faces it's just clock hands and so a lot of fonts I feel like
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.560]  look good on the Apple watch in a way that or feel at home and anyway on the Apple watch in a
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.040]  way that that isn't quite the same on an iPhone because there's so much other system text that's
[36:43.040 --> 36:49.760]  always on the screen as well hmm I yeah that's an interesting answer I I could see that and
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.800]  there was definitely something where you were playing around with custom watch faces even
[36:56.800 --> 37:03.760]  though it's not something you can do like it's not like Apple let apps do it but you were playing
[37:03.760 --> 37:10.880]  around with with it anyway knowing that it wasn't something that you could ship as a feature in an
[37:10.880 --> 37:17.680]  app but just what if we could let's just play with it and uh Stephen Troughton Smith uh you know
[37:17.680 --> 37:26.240]  famed hacker and troublemaker on Twitter was was messing around with the same ideas yeah well he
[37:26.240 --> 37:32.160]  was the one I think he came up with in his like spelunking prowess was able to work out a way
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.880]  to hide the system time inside of a watch kit app which is typically not something that's possible
[37:38.880 --> 37:43.680]  that typically there's always the time shown in the top right corner of an Apple have a watch app
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.760]  when it's shown and he and his like you know I have no idea what code like you know he shared
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.000]  the code publicly for how to do it and it's some kind of weird you know you just like dive deep
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.400]  down into the view hierarchy and find this one particular view that happens to be the clock
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.720]  and you know make it hidden or whatever it might be and as soon as he had done that then it yeah
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.600]  then it yeah it's like I always spent a good part of like three or four months just making custom
[38:05.600 --> 38:10.400]  watch faces like that was became my hobby to to do and I yeah you can't publish them they don't
[38:10.400 --> 38:16.640]  exist they're just you know watch apps and you can for a while I actually use them as my main
[38:16.640 --> 38:22.800]  watch face because what I would do is if you start a workout inside of you know in my little
[38:22.800 --> 38:29.120]  like custom watch face app um it would continue it would remain on the screen even when the app
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.120]  was you know you lower your wrist and raise your wrist if you ever have a workout app running
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.760]  the workout app is what shows on the screen rather than the clock and if you turn off the
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.640]  high heart rate uh workout mode so typically like typically during a workout it collects
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.400]  your heart rate like multiple times per second it's continuous you know continuously monitoring
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.240]  you can turn that off for power saving reasons so I would just turn that off and essentially just
[38:52.240 --> 38:58.080]  have you know a walking workout running on my wrist um all day so I could have my own custom
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.240]  watch face and I did that for a few months and eventually I kind of lost interest because
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.760]  it felt like it while I loved making them I never you know no one no one should be doing what I'm
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.560]  doing right this like it's completely absurd that I'm running a workout the entire day just so that
[39:12.560 --> 39:20.800]  I can have a custom watch face on my apple watch yeah but don't you think that doing that exercised
[39:20.800 --> 39:31.600]  certain design muscles in your head because it it got you I know I know people like to
[39:31.600 --> 39:36.960]  dunk on Malcolm Gladwell and he's got that thing with the you know you need 10,000 hours of
[39:36.960 --> 39:43.360]  practice before you get good at anything and it's you know he tries this I think the my criticism
[39:43.360 --> 39:53.920]  of him is he tries to make he tries to turn very correct uh feel of a thing ideas that are true
[39:53.920 --> 40:00.240]  into think of it rules right like there is no magic 10,000 hours thing but there is truth that
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.720]  you get better at what you do I mean that's you know that and it's easy to forget that right but
[40:06.720 --> 40:15.360]  so you spent all of this time obsessing over making entire watch faces and it surely gave you
[40:15.360 --> 40:22.560]  insight into oh I all of a sudden you realize why apple does x y and z with theirs it's like
[40:22.560 --> 40:28.320]  oh I was always bugged by that but I now I see why because when I don't do it it's it stinks
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.760]  you know yeah and working out how to like yeah there's there was definitely a element of you
[40:33.760 --> 40:40.400]  start you don't really understand something until you've like really had to like build it from the
[40:40.400 --> 40:46.560]  ground up and kind of really gone into it and unmade all the mistakes and yeah like made watch
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.040]  faces that look terrible or work out how to like even the simple things that seem simple of like
[40:51.040 --> 40:57.200]  how do you lay out the numbers on a clock yes it is incredibly hard and like how do you make that
[40:57.200 --> 41:04.960]  like because 12 like like 12 and 11 and 10 have multiple digits but they need to look balanced
[41:04.960 --> 41:10.000]  and reasonable next to like the twos and the threes which don't have that and the apple watch
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.640]  is like you know the modern apple watches are they're not square they're oblong and so you
[41:14.640 --> 41:19.680]  need it to look reasonable and not like yeah and then I think to your point it's that that
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.040]  experience is what ultimately I think made me want to get into complications in a big way and not just
[41:25.040 --> 41:30.400]  view complications like I think before I made watchsmith complications for me were just kind of
[41:30.400 --> 41:36.400]  a they were just pure simple basic data display and that's all I ever wanted that I ever used
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.120]  them for and like the way apple builds complications is you can use one of apple's
[41:41.120 --> 41:47.360]  like pre-built templates which are just typically just text for the most part for a lot of them or
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.440]  at the very like they're there you have a stack of text or you can have a gauge with text inside of it
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.160]  um or those types of like there's a couple of pre-built things and when I got into
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.320]  watchsmith I didn't I realized I'd learned in like I had an I had enough of an insight from
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.000]  my experience with the custom watches that's like I didn't want to just be limited myself to that
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.040]  and so all of I like all of the complications in watchsmith are actually under the hood rendered
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.320]  as images and just display it as images like I'm just making bitmaps and show and like putting them
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.040]  into the screen because that was the only way that I could give the flexibility and control that I
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.080]  actually wanted and it's because it's the case like the control that I learned I wanted from
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.120]  years of making or from all you know from the experience of making custom watch faces and making
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.280]  those mistakes and kind of having that sense of like you can't actually do cool stuff with this
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.960]  like I that was where I had the first idea for I wanted to I'm one of my one of the features of
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.560]  watchsmith is you can make it that the complication sort of moves around the watch hands as they move
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.680]  um so like the classic thing is if you have the date on your complication and you have the hand
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.600]  of the watch sweep over it ordinarily it's hidden which is kind of seems silly on a digital watch
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.440]  that I can't read the date right now because it's 315 right like like that doesn't make any sense
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.960]  why I want to know the date it's being displayed but it's being obscured by this digital hands like
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.200]  in a real watch fair enough but so like in watchsmith I move it out of the way I do the
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.120]  math to work out like where the hand is at any given time and I just shift the shift it down and
[43:17.680 --> 43:22.080]  you know and what in the system I have I'm limited because obviously I can't get outside of my circle
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.720]  but right it's like I can do stuff like that that I just don't think I would have thought of
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.000]  otherwise and I think yeah it's it there's definitely an element of it's it's not 10,000
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.560]  hours because I think that rule loses track of how useful that time is how actual productive what
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.920]  have you learned from that experience because I could spend 10,000 hours like make doing bad work
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.320]  and it doesn't make me amazing at work um it's like it hopefully you've learned something along
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.880]  the way and I can you know in this case yeah it's like I did a lot of work on custom watch faces
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.720]  that informed the work I did making custom complications which then informed my work making
[43:56.720 --> 44:02.560]  custom widgets right it's like maybe you are a very good graphic designer you know and you do
[44:02.560 --> 44:10.800]  things and you've never but you've never made a business card for somebody uh and you make
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.240]  somebody somebody says hey I need business cards you design some business cards for them
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.800]  um you don't need to do 10,000 hours of business cards before you can become as good at designing
[44:21.680 --> 44:26.400]  business cards as you're ever going to get you know you you you whatever your skill is as a
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.080]  graphic designer and typographer you you can max it out on business cards pretty quickly
[44:32.080 --> 44:39.200]  because it's a very limited uh you know it it's a very small complication in graphic design terms
[44:39.840 --> 44:46.400]  but your first couple of cards aren't going to be great you're going to realize that oh this text
[44:46.400 --> 44:52.480]  is way too big like wow the text on a business card needs to be tiny oh that's that I would have
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.680]  never thought I need to set eight point type that eight point type seems like a footnote but that's
[44:57.680 --> 45:04.720]  really what you need etc and then you can run into problems like uh oh it turns out that business
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.120]  cards get scuffed up you know and the corners turn in you kind of don't want to put anything
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.160]  close to the edge because uh you know people put them in their pocket and then they get all
[45:14.160 --> 45:19.840]  bent up and you kind of want everything in the center etc yeah um yeah but you don't need 10,000
[45:19.840 --> 45:25.040]  hours but you do need to make some you know yeah and making entire watch faces can make you a lot
[45:25.040 --> 45:30.960]  better at making complications yep the other thing that I find interesting about it is that it's
[45:32.960 --> 45:40.240]  you essentially have to suss out the and I mean you in specific with with the idea of apps like
[45:40.240 --> 45:47.280]  widgetsmith and watchsmith you kind of have to suss out the rules as they are and there's no
[45:47.280 --> 45:54.000]  point and this is where I think your personal disposition really is just so perfect for these
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.280]  type of apps where sure you have complaints about what apple allows and doesn't allow
[45:59.840 --> 46:02.880]  and you'll make them clear you know you're not it's not you're hiding them you know
[46:03.440 --> 46:09.760]  but rather than just bemoan the fact that you can't make entirely custom watch faces
[46:09.760 --> 46:15.600]  and just say this stinks apple is being obstinate I'm gonna go pout for another year and hope that
[46:15.600 --> 46:24.240]  watch os8 lets me make watch faces you you just say well what are the rules what what how does
[46:24.240 --> 46:31.360]  the whole thing work and then once I understand the rules what can I do yeah and I think I mean
[46:31.360 --> 46:37.200]  the reality is I mean I've been doing I've been in you know been making apps for apple's platforms
[46:37.200 --> 46:42.640]  for a long time and I've seen I've seen what the outcome of having that approach where you just
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.560]  get grumpy about what you can't do rather than try and really see what you can do and what
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.920]  how can you be creative with the tools that we do have and like there's so much more of an
[46:53.920 --> 46:58.960]  opportunity in that than if you it's so easy to get stuck and say you know I really want to be
[46:58.960 --> 47:03.840]  able to show that you know show the time in a complication but apple doesn't let you do that
[47:03.840 --> 47:08.880]  they only let you you know update your complication once every 15 minutes I can't do that and it's
[47:08.880 --> 47:11.840]  like well they have this timeline thing which I don't think really is intended to be updated
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.160]  every minute but if I use that in the kind of like you know like push the limits a little bit and
[47:16.160 --> 47:19.600]  I've definitely run into issues in this but it's like conceptually it's like if you just say like
[47:19.600 --> 47:23.680]  well what is the best I can do it's like and I can't have seconds on my clock but I can have
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.800]  minutes and like if that's good enough then um then that's great and I think that's you know
[47:28.800 --> 47:35.040]  so often in this like in this game it's the reality is is things are like apple will change
[47:35.040 --> 47:39.920]  over time like I used to think that watch kit was all we were ever going to get and to some
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.520]  degree that I thought like I'm just gonna have to make the best of it and I've made all manner of
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.560]  kind of awful watch kit apps because that was the best I could do and like then when SwiftUI came
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.120]  along and Swift and suddenly I can make an actual watch app it's like wow this is amazing and I have
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.880]  all this head start because I didn't get just like stuck in the mud about the fact that I couldn't do
[47:58.880 --> 48:12.320]  animation before I love the idea I like when all computer systems are sort of like this and maybe
[48:12.320 --> 48:20.400]  all real games are too but like I used to back in the day I used to play a lot of simulated sports
[48:20.400 --> 48:26.880]  games on the old Sega Genesis I love John Madden football and NHL hockey yeah and the thing about
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.680]  both of those games and I don't know what to to what degree it's still true because it's like when
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.440]  I see screenshots of Madden today it just looks it just is it it's the graphics are stunning but
[48:37.440 --> 48:43.680]  it's like photo it looks like a televised football game whereas back in the mid to late 90s they were
[48:43.680 --> 48:51.520]  you know they look like Sega Genesis games they were clearly designed to sort of as you'd first
[48:51.520 --> 48:58.240]  start playing it they would kind of look like real games and the way you would play the football game
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.520]  was the way that teams in the real NFL would play football but when you got good at the game
[49:03.520 --> 49:12.320]  you realized which plays worked and what they did and you'd end up playing a game if you if
[49:12.320 --> 49:18.800]  two good players played each other it was exciting and it was a terrific it was terrific sport but
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.000]  what what you'd watch was nothing like real football and nothing like real hockey the
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.080]  hockey game would actually much more like basketball because scoring was way too hot
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.520]  was way higher and you'd play these you know you you'd play like two minute periods or something
[49:33.520 --> 49:39.520]  and just to try to help make it seem more realistic like seconds in the hockey game
[49:39.520 --> 49:45.920]  were like maybe half a second you know the clock went way faster just to try to help keep it
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.960]  realistic quote-unquote realistic but it looked nothing like but it was a terrific game it's
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.440]  everything in computers and like sort of what you're doing to me is sort of figuring that out
[49:55.440 --> 50:02.800]  right it's like you're making things with certainly with watchsmith in particular that maybe they're
[50:02.800 --> 50:08.560]  not designed for but they are it's all within rules you're not yeah you're not using undocumented
[50:08.560 --> 50:16.400]  apis it's not like the way that i you could you could sometimes just get in a groove in the hockey
[50:16.400 --> 50:22.880]  game and score then they drop the puck at center ice and if you had the timing just right you could
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.560]  get it again make a certain move and it was like unbeatable and you could sort of get in a groove
[50:28.560 --> 50:35.200]  and it you weren't cheating you didn't like hack your your cartridge you just sort of figured out
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.760]  this is within the rules of the game and the system here's how it works and now you could
[50:39.760 --> 50:46.080]  have a date complication that moves out of the way when the hour hand or the minute hand reaches
[50:46.080 --> 50:51.920]  15 minutes after the hour yeah exactly like there's it's very much i mean this is the part
[50:51.920 --> 50:59.760]  of my job that i enjoy the most is it's finding those unexpected like ways around that it's like
[50:59.760 --> 51:03.440]  you call them kind of like they're hacks but they're not like hacks in the way that i'm
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.680]  actually like hacking the operating system right that i'm finding these like weird workarounds
[51:07.680 --> 51:12.080]  that work and are consistent and like are performant and all the things that you need
[51:12.080 --> 51:16.880]  them to be but are definitely not you know what those what the feature was intended for
[51:17.680 --> 51:21.600]  and you know like that's a that's a pattern that i've seen many i've had to use many times because
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.720]  that's the only way to actually i feel like like to make things that are really interesting and
[51:26.720 --> 51:31.760]  new that aren't that are then that are different than um kind of what other people are doing
[51:31.760 --> 51:36.080]  because otherwise you know it's easy to do the obvious thing that's the common case that
[51:36.080 --> 51:41.520]  apple is designed the api for but it's much more fun to make the thing that is not at all what they
[51:41.520 --> 51:44.800]  intended for and they're surprised you know and they always have that line at the end of a thing
[51:44.800 --> 51:47.920]  we can't wait to see what you do with it and you're like i don't think they meant this
[51:49.760 --> 51:57.040]  but i think in some ways maybe they are you know what i mean maybe you know like in the way that
[51:57.040 --> 52:03.280]  they definitely wouldn't be if if what you shipped or somebody shipped was well i found a jailbreak
[52:03.280 --> 52:09.200]  and i've you know used it to open up the latest version of ios and now i have my own jailbreak app
[52:09.200 --> 52:14.960]  store no people at apple probably overall are not excited to see what you're able to do with it
[52:14.960 --> 52:19.760]  but i think that by staying within the system but finding
[52:19.760 --> 52:27.440]  possibilities it's not an exploit right it's it's unforeseen possibilities within the rules and again
[52:27.440 --> 52:35.040]  if the rules were all designed with things like performance in mind and you're not doing anything
[52:35.040 --> 52:40.080]  that's unperformant or well he's doing this he shouldn't be able to we didn't envision this and
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.200]  it's sucking the battery down they're going to change the rules right yeah um i think they are
[52:45.200 --> 52:49.920]  kind of excited to see stuff i'm sure they are like it it's i mean maybe it's it's not there are
[52:49.920 --> 52:52.640]  certain people within apple who i think are probably think it's really cool and there are
[52:52.640 --> 52:57.520]  people who are like what that was not within the design spec that we had when we had the meeting
[52:57.520 --> 53:02.320]  six months ago about what people were going to be able to do this was not what they were supposed to
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.960]  be able to do like i think that's more what i mean that i think then i think they're have you know
[53:06.960 --> 53:10.560]  their feedback i've gotten over the years from doing this kind of stuff from apple is that they
[53:10.560 --> 53:16.880]  generally do like it because i think it also is an escape valve for all features they don't want to
[53:16.880 --> 53:25.520]  make mainstream but they can point to things that are on these edges that take a lot more work like
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.160]  it's not easy to do what you know it's like this is the hard way to do it but you know they don't
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.280]  want to make custom watch faces but if you can find ways to make complications really capable
[53:35.280 --> 53:40.080]  then you're kind of releasing a little bit of that pressure right because if they're pulling back a
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.800]  little bit on actually maybe we don't need custom watch faces maybe we can just make complications
[53:44.800 --> 53:54.080]  a little bit better yeah it gets to a very old bit of advice which is that when you're reporting
[53:55.440 --> 54:02.720]  a bug or a feature request to a developer as a user you can you can sit you can propose
[54:02.720 --> 54:08.320]  an idea and and it's not that it's unwelcome but that a lot of the times even if you're going to
[54:08.320 --> 54:17.040]  propose a solution start by describing your problem in as much detail first yeah and it's
[54:17.040 --> 54:22.720]  that description of the problem that's often more interesting to the developer than the proposed
[54:22.720 --> 54:30.000]  solution because there might you know and again that might be it where it's like well
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.840]  wait i've got this i don't know like uh what's the bike riding app stevia strava strava i you
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.320]  know i would i don't even know if strava has complications i assume probably they do probably
[54:44.960 --> 54:51.520]  or you know uh you know whatever it is but maybe your idea is i wish strava could have their own
[54:51.520 --> 54:56.480]  watch face because i would like something when i'm riding my bike i'd like this information from
[54:56.480 --> 55:03.360]  strava there um but say the problem first and maybe there's a better answer where they could
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.400]  integrate it into the workout app that is shown when you're on your bike doing a workout or maybe
[55:08.400 --> 55:15.040]  the answer is they could do it with a complication and and put it there and yeah that sort of
[55:15.040 --> 55:22.800]  description um definitely i think is right up the alley of the the solutions you've had with
[55:22.800 --> 55:27.280]  widgetsmith and watchsmith it's like i think it's i would just like to have a custom thing in the
[55:27.280 --> 55:32.720]  corner you know yeah and it's like i want it to end this i mean what i love in watch os 7 is that
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.280]  now you can have multiple complications from the same app um which is which is a huge boon for for
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.520]  me and what i'm doing here is where it's being able to like now i can i can take over a huge
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.640]  proportion of the watch face and it's not it's not a custom watch face but it's for other than
[55:48.640 --> 55:53.200]  the time everything on the watch face can be something i render um and like that's a huge
[55:53.200 --> 55:58.560]  opportunity and a huge canvas for for me um like like i just have to let go of the fact that i
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.440]  should you know use their hands for the for the time and or their numerals but other than that
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.240]  everything else i can do yeah that was a weird limitation and and there's certain you know and
[56:08.240 --> 56:15.280]  you can sort of see it with some of apple's complications like uh breathe uh which to me
[56:15.280 --> 56:23.120]  as i i i mean if you love the breed thing you know you know more power to you but it's like
[56:23.120 --> 56:31.760]  i i don't know i i've been using this uh the new s6 i i'm just gonna say s6 review unit watch since
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.400]  since i got it a couple weeks ago and i set it up as new and i've been running it as default
[56:37.040 --> 56:42.160]  and it's like the breathe things i have once an hour i don't even know how long it's been
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.800]  the breathe things i have once an hour i don't even know how often they come up but by default
[56:46.800 --> 56:50.800]  it's like all of a sudden i'm working and i get a tap and i look at my wrist and go what's that
[56:50.800 --> 56:56.960]  and it's like hey why don't you take a break and breathe for a minute and it's like f you that is
[56:56.960 --> 57:02.880]  my i want like a big fu button every time that comes up until i you know broke down and i was
[57:02.880 --> 57:06.960]  like all right enough of my running with all these defaults i'm turning this off yeah um
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.160]  but with the complication you could see why you would even if you want to have the breathe
[57:12.160 --> 57:17.360]  complication on your watch face you'd only want one there's no reason to put it in two corners
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.400]  but even with some of apple's i'm surprised they didn't foresee the need like weather right like
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.640]  i don't know how did they get around that before so whether so apple has their apps have been able
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.800]  to export multiple complications since the beginning that's always been so that when
[57:32.800 --> 57:37.680]  primarily it was shown through things like weather where you would be able to show like the uv index
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.680]  and the temperature in right in two corners and that was always the way that only apple's apps
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.360]  could do that i say they like they had the ability to export multiple complications but
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.400]  for a third-party app it was always just one per type right um and so we could show multiple
[57:54.400 --> 57:58.960]  complications on a watch face if it happened to support multiple types so like if you know in the
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.200]  modular one you have the big rectangle and you have the small circle and like i could take one
[58:03.200 --> 58:09.280]  of each but i couldn't take you know two circles or anything like that before watch os6 ah that
[58:09.280 --> 58:16.640]  makes sense um yeah and i guess that they weren't thinking and again literally watch smith is
[58:16.640 --> 58:24.800]  because it's as it's not about a specific type of complication it's you know all sorts of
[58:24.800 --> 58:31.760]  all sorts of complications everything from weather to exercise information you know etc
[58:31.760 --> 58:36.240]  astronomy tides i have all manner of like every anything i could think of it's like
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.280]  it's very much a kitchen sink right so it's very natural that somebody who's into that
[58:41.280 --> 58:45.760]  would want to have more than one of the same size on their watch face because it's not duplicating
[58:45.760 --> 58:54.880]  information at all because it's sort of a it's an inverse of the typical relationship where um
[58:56.240 --> 59:02.640]  you know i was going to say weather but that's a bad example but you know sure but like i think
[59:02.640 --> 59:07.600]  your example of something like strava or something where maybe you're going to show like the number
[59:07.600 --> 59:12.320]  of miles you've biked this week or whatever that might be like there's a limit to the number of
[59:12.320 --> 59:18.000]  places that you're going to want to devote to your biking activities but if you know if for the other
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.040]  things where you have yeah it's like when i have so many different types of data like i i you know
[59:23.040 --> 59:27.280]  i want to have the moon phase because i think it looks pretty and i want to have the sunset time
[59:27.280 --> 59:32.480]  and i want to have the temperature and i want to have the date um and like if i want to i want to
[59:32.480 --> 59:37.360]  have all those on the screen at the same time because sure why not um and so like it definitely
[59:37.360 --> 59:43.040]  it lends itself to having multiple instances of those things and i could in theory before i could
[59:43.040 --> 59:48.960]  have made like dozens of different apps for everything but like that just logistically
[59:48.960 --> 59:52.880]  would not have been feasible and i'm so you know glad i didn't never had to go down that road
[59:53.760 --> 01:00:02.960]  um with the fonts thing i know that and i i feel like the idea that you're going to customize the
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.760]  you you have quite a bit of fonts you can choose from for the widgetsmith widgets yeah uh i'm
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:16.160]  reminded of and and i know i asked you this before the show is do your roots on the apple platforms
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.680]  go back to the classic mac os era and they don't and michael simmons and i were did enough
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:26.640]  reminiscing about it on the last episode of this show but one of the simplest things that you could
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.600]  do on the old classic mac os is we had a there was a clock up in the upper right corner and i
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.280]  actually forget whether it was from apple and it was in the system or if it was a third-party thing
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.480]  or not but it was or if it started as like a lot of things did started as a third-party thing and
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:49.680]  then apple put it there um but it was much like the mac os 10 clock where it was upper right
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:55.600]  corner in the menu bar and you'd have options for you know do you want the you know all the stuff
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.880]  you'd all the various options you want ampm do you want 24 hour time do you want the colon
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.400]  to blink you know yeah everybody you know it's where it's the same sort of things right you're
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.440]  very familiar with all of these options and some people some people definitely want the colon to
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.000]  blink and other people if the colon blinks they will go insane right yeah just literally one of
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.120]  the smallest punctuation characters other than a single dot in the entire keyboard and if it's up
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.320]  there blinking it'll drive them insane i personally am not a blinking colon person
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.440]  but it doesn't drive me crazy but i know that there are people who are irate but one of the
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.000]  other things so so far so good you think okay clock in the upper right corner what's new the
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.680]  other thing was that i think it was the third-party thing but it was very common but you could also
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:54.480]  pick what font the clock the digital clock in the corner was sure and it always seemed crazy to me
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.040]  and this you know what did i pick i picked the system font right if so like in the chicago 12
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.720]  era it was chicago 12 and then when they changed it to charcoal i changed it to charcoal and it
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.840]  just was the exact size and shape of the system font and if it wasn't going to be the system font
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.560]  and sometimes when i'd play with it it would be like a a smaller version of the system font like
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:25.600]  um the system font in that era chicago 12 that was the menu bar font and that's the famous you
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:32.080]  know the font that we all had on the ipods when the ipods first came out like the finder for file
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:38.880]  names would use uh geneva which was their sort of bitmap version of helvetica well that was sort of
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.840]  a system font too it wasn't the same font it was geneva versus chicago but it was what the system
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:51.280]  used for lists of things so you might set your clock to be geneva nine point font and that still
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.440]  looked like it was part of the system right it's like instead of and i thought you know i remember
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.200]  when i was playing around with it like oh that's kind of clever because it's not really a menu it's
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.040]  just a clock so maybe it should be geneva nine and it just gets you as it as an avid user into
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:13.360]  that thinking of like junior level ui designer um which is fun and really is like a great gateway
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:20.960]  into thinking like a software designer um which again i think is is where this tremendous
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.760]  enthusiasm from widgets is what that's tapping into but what always struck me and i saw a lot
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.600]  of people's clocks over the years because i spent a lot of time as like the resident hey my mac isn't
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.960]  working right get gruber over here to fix it type and then at some point you know in the late 90s
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.360]  was even doing like freelance consulting where people would call me in and i would actually
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.640]  make money doing it and you get to see a lot of people's you know what extent you know a lot of
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.320]  desktops and i was always interested in it like what do people have people would pick the craziest
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  fonts for the clock it was all over the place again and it wasn't like oh it's like everybody
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.720]  likes uh like zap chancery right like certain other fonts over this i forget if that was one
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:13.040]  of the fonts but you know a font like that like a calligraphy font yeah you couldn't you whatever
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.480]  however many fonts people had that you no idea there was no accounting for the taste in clock
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.480]  font people love to pick fonts like that the rest of the system was all the regular system font it
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.680]  wasn't like they installed an extension that would change their system font for everything
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.280]  including the menu bar and dialogues and everything nope just the clock but maybe they
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:45.200]  wanted it to be times italic yeah you know and i was always fascinated by it and so as i see
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.640]  people's enthusiasm for picking custom fonts for their widgets that of a you know not like oh
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:58.880]  um i was i know i i think your software update added uh that the first update to widget smith
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.600]  added a few more fonts like din what are the new ones din is one of the new ones i have din i have
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.560]  oh gosh i've been adding like i mean this is where it gets a little like comedic in some ways for the
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.200]  number of different fonts so like right now you can have regular san francisco san francisco
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.200]  rounded new york san francisco mono futura then i have my silly ones noteworthy marker felt chalk
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.920]  duster typewriter then i have palatino gilson's copper plate and din right um that's a good
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.960]  variety and those are all built-in fonts right that's yes and i i say this as a question but
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:39.760]  i happen to know that they're all built into the system um yeah uh but let's just say din for
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:49.120]  example though din is a font that is as san francisco has evolved it's gotten a little bit
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:56.560]  more of its own character um but i know i happen to know that internal to apple as apple was working
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.560]  on the font we now know as san francisco um before it officially had a name it was sort of like a
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.320]  skunkworks project for years because when it first we first saw it when the original apple watch
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.400]  debuted and it was the it it's always been the system font on apple watch and it was the first
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:21.920]  time we saw it and i remember being in the audience at the event um and it's you know of
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.360]  course that's the sort of thing i think of is they announce is what at the it was the weird event
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:33.360]  that they only had they only had one event there at the college in cupertino the danta auditorium
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.400]  and they start showing screenshots of this new product apple watch and i'm like looking at it
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.560]  and i thought that my first thought was oh wow they're using din yeah and that's what i thought
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.600]  the font was and i was like oh it looks din looks great on a watch this is great and then they'd
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:57.840]  show more screenshots and i saw at least a couple of characters that i knew weren't din but i was
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:05.840]  stymied i was like i have no idea what this font is um and it admits all of the wow there's ten
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.320]  thousand questions about this product it's not even shipping for six months but there's a hands-on
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:16.800]  area across the street we can go and holy cow i'm across the hands-on table area from gwen stefani
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.320]  wow this is bizarre uh that's true story i'm like they're trying on apple watch as i look up and
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:28.240]  who's trying one on across the table from me it's gwen stefani i'm like this is bizarre that's not
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.680]  that's not normal this is not normal for apple event it's gotten a little more normal in the
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.520]  years since as it's been they've gotten a little more celebrity laden one time i was with uh i was
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:47.440]  with someone and we're outside and uh are you a sports fan uh i would say i'm a passing sports
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.080]  all right well i enjoy watching sports but i'm not like devoted to any particular sports me and
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:58.320]  clayton morris who used to be at fox news we were outside just getting fresh air outside the bill
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:04.560]  james civic auditorium uh you know it wasn't like five minutes before start it was like i don't know
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.880]  20 25 minutes before the event was supposed to start but we had seats already and we just went
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:16.880]  out to get fresh air and uh barry bond and joe montana come in together right past us
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.000]  what is quite a combination of characters it's right it's unbelievable it's like what what do
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.240]  we do and uh nothing we just you know just kind of give them the look like hey we know who you
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.840]  guys are maybe the greatest baseball player of our lifetimes and the greatest football player of our
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.720]  lifetimes just walking by together like you know it's cool there they go right in there to find out
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.040]  about new iphones anyway uh all these questions about apple watch i have the biggest one perhaps
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.680]  the biggest was what is this font and i figured out you know by looking at the the actual hand-on
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.720]  ones it was like god this is something new um but internally to apple it was some designers before
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.320]  they knew the name called it din vedica it because it was sort of at a basic level not that it's a
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.120]  rip-off it's a very original font that's serving apple very well and evolving in very good ways
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.120]  but if you need to just a starting point to understand san francisco it's sort of half
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:28.160]  din half helvetica yeah um so offering din as an option fits in but offering fonts like new york
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:35.360]  which is sort of a times sort of serif font you know and uh what are the the handwritten one
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:44.400]  marker felt it's like marker felt and uh noteworthy noteworthy right yeah like they are definitely not
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.600]  they do they have they well you could say that like san francisco is you know din and helvetica
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.320]  um send a mission together like marker felt and noteworthy are they have they have they share no
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:02.640]  common ancestors no but in the font tree so but this is so offering those as options so those
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.800]  those handwritten silly fonts i don't know how you would describe friendly whatever adjectives
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:18.320]  not my cup of tea personally but i also totally understand what it's like to have a strong
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:29.680]  personal preference for fonts and if that's what pleases you more power to you right like
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.000]  so i i've gotten tweets from people like this must be driving you nuts seeing people you know
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.720]  use crazy ugly fonts to make their widgets and no it doesn't at all right like what drove me nuts
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:48.480]  for years would be like when the built-in notes app only offered i think it was noteworthy maybe
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.600]  it was marker felt maybe they changed it over the years i forget i think it might have been marker
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.080]  felt at first but yeah i think it was marker felt to start with and then they offered an option like
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:06.080]  not to use it and you could use helvetica instead and it was like a prototypical or hypothetical
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:12.240]  glass of ice water in hell um but that was because everybody had to use it right if the notes app is
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.280]  you get marker felt whether you like it or not then the fact that i don't like marker felt make
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.880]  gives me strong feelings and makes me write very angry posts on on my website but the fact that
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.720]  somebody is allowed to set it as an option doesn't bother me at all i say more power to you i hope you
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.840]  you know i i could see why maybe you enjoy that yeah and i think it's what you were saying about
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.560]  the clock right it's that sense of like you know you can't even predict it like it's not something
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.800]  that oh you see someone there's like button-down businessman you know oh he's gonna want like a
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.040]  very button-down business font or he's gonna want new york because that's like reminds him of the
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.120]  new york times i don't know like like you can't guess this is just as just as likely he's running
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.000]  around with marker felt and that's what he thinks is fun and it's like he could be even like it's
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.720]  sometimes you get the impression it's like i you i'm you know i'm using this font ironically i think
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.960]  it's ugly and i like that it's ugly right i like that it's silly it doesn't it's like i'm not
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.400]  trying to make this gorgeous i'm trying to make this um funny and i'm it's like it's a little
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.440]  joke that i'm playing on myself every time i i pick up my phone and you know it would be like if
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.400]  if you if i you know if i made ariel one of the options and you set that as your your widget font
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.160]  right you would be playing a little joke on yourself every time you picked up your phone
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.760]  and maybe it would make you laugh for a while and eventually you'd go crazy and you'd change it but
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.800]  like if that made you if they put a smile on your face even once like sure why not
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.280]  ariel's maybe the exception see now maybe you've now maybe you've pushed my button
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.360]  well that was though i will say that was one of the so i don't like i don't like april fools like
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  i think they're completely like silly and pointless the only april fool i've ever thought
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:53.360]  of that i would ever actually like do as a developer is that i would add ariel as an option
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.280]  but only if you select it on april 1st right like that is the one it only works for that one day but
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.640]  there you on one day a year you could use ariel and it would only be for um only be on april 1st
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.840]  somebody so here's my here's my necessary digression on ariel and why i would make an
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:19.120]  exception here ariel is a rip-off of helvetica and that's that is this is a fact not an opinion
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.600]  and it was helvetica has been a very famous typeface since before computers it was a sensation
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:37.200]  from when it debuted in 1968 i believe um and when true type type fonts became a thing on computers
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:44.240]  apple licensed the real helvetica and it became the default like document font it's like it like
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:50.240]  in text edit and going back to the classic mac os with teach text and every every mac
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.120]  word processor i've ever used mac write even microsoft word if you try a new word processor
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:04.480]  and type command n what is the font in the new window by default it's helvetica 12. microsoft
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:12.240]  decided not to pay to license helvetica and instead commissioned a rip-off that's ariel
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.760]  they decided it would be cheaper to do their own and so the only ways that and so it's a rip-off
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:24.240]  in that it has the same metrics as helvetica and to most people's eyes it looks the same and it's
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:32.480]  supposed to look largely the same and then they just changed a few letters to you know to not try
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:40.720]  to make it a copy copy but just sort of uh well it's inspired by copy like the capital r and ariel
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:48.480]  looks really stupid and the capital c looks really bad and the lowercase t has a pointy top for
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.280]  unbelievable you know it looks like a toothpick at the top and a typeface where none of the other
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:00.800]  characters do this um my opinion and i believe this i'll go to my grave is that anybody who says
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.960]  they like ariel what they mean is they like helvetica and they don't see the difference and
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:12.240]  if anybody ever says i would like you to do this make this for me and use ariel 12 you as a designer
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.320]  are committing a crime if you don't just set it in helvetica 12 and assume that they they're
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:24.560]  getting what they wanted um for example i just read a story yesterday that is in his debate prep
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  that joe biden uh somebody sent this to me i should link to it from daring fireball that joe
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:35.840]  biden his favorite typeface is ariel 14 and they're like oh who's group we're gonna vote for now
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:41.680]  but my my my take on that is that i could see why joe biden likes that as a typeface because it's
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:47.680]  just plain right it's a very plain font and so when he says i would like my my materials set in
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:54.800]  ariel 14 whoever he says that to should just set it all in helvetica 14 and joe biden will be even
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.640]  better off than he was before and will be happy as a clam yep all right all right let me take a

[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.960]  let's let's talk about all of the various things that widget smith offers right now so what are
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:33.120]  the features that what what what things can you put in a widget smith widget sure so it's like
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.600]  sort of the core conceit of the app is that i wanted to just let you make as many widgets as
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:44.640]  you want and have them do whatever you want and so you can add widgets of any particular size of the
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.240]  small medium and large that you want and then you can schedule those widgets to appear or just have
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.680]  a default and they'll just always be displayed but you could have but if you want you could say like
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:59.440]  i want my widgets to you know during the workday show one thing or during the um you know sort of
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.120]  during the evening show something else and it's like the types of widgets that i've sort of have
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.720]  in it are you have things that are like time based so you know like the time a clock the fuzzy time
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.400]  that kind of thing or the date or a calendar a bunch of stuff with photos you can show a photo
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.680]  with you know text layered on top of it your battery things that are coming up on your calendar
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.400]  things that are in your reminders list weather tides and sort of astronomy data so like the
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.400]  moon phase or um like the sunrise and sunset time and so like those are all the kind of like
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:38.800]  sort of essentially my goal is to try and capture basically all the data sources that exist in iOS
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.360]  as much as i could you know so in terms of tapping into the system calendar and the system reminders
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.880]  list and um just trying to be as comprehensive as i can and i mean the reality is you know
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:54.960]  these this is the list of things that i was able to get you know ready in time rather than
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.720]  necessarily the full list of things that i could have imagined or you know dreamt up i still have
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.240]  a whole bunch of stuff but it's like to start with and the things that i think most people use it for
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:10.240]  is like to show those kind of basic data and even just probably the most popular widget is just
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.480]  showing the date and showing it in an interesting way because for each of those types of widgets you
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:20.560]  can choose the font the color if there's a border around it the time of the things like like we
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.480]  were talking about earlier like the time format you know do you want to have 24 hour time do you
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.800]  want to have the system defaults time do you want to have like a full pm written out or just one is
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:35.120]  like a single a or a p like and basically my goal is that you can configure basically everything
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.640]  about it like do you want the text on the bottom do you want the text on the top like whatever it
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.560]  might be that's kind of like the core conceit of the app and the features it has i don't know why
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:51.040]  i was in college and at the student newspaper and the editor a few years ahead of me scott smith
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:20:02.800]  um turned me on to uh just using a and p instead of am pm and his argument was well they both have
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:09.200]  an m so you're just wasting you're wasting space i was like huh never thought of that and then ever
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:15.920]  since now for 25 years and counting i get frustrated when software doesn't let you do it
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:23.440]  and i understand why because it is standard just to have the am and the pm but i the fact that you
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.920]  you you know yeah i'll handle that case you know it's not that rare right it's not like there's two
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:38.640]  of us out there who do it but um it but in it so those are the data sources we've talked about
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:46.080]  fonts you've added a couple already even since launching uh and of course color yeah oh boy
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:54.320]  colors i'm like you gotta you gotta love that my very first app update after like it kind of like
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.960]  well it's like in the way the story went crazy it's like the place that widget smith had its like
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.080]  15 minutes of fame moment was on tick tock where it got picked up by kind of the the impression
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.400]  i get is it's very much like the fashion beauty vlogger kind of community seems to be kind of the
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.200]  place where it um uh the place where it hit in a way which is definitely not a audience in a
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.240]  community that i have no experience in whatsoever um but that's apparently where it got picked up
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.680]  and as you may imagine my very first app update added a collection of pastel colors um as pre-built
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.520]  options um to the application where it's like all of a sudden now you have this beautiful pastel
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.920]  orange and yellow and pink and blue that were not the colors that i was um envisioning when i was
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:45.520]  making the app but they're in there now so how did you get the feedback for that was it because
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:50.880]  people wrote to you or because you were like watching their tik toks where they said this is
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.960]  great but i wish it had well the story for that is actually but we're even more of a like a
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.640]  roundabout thing where so the on the friday that it ended up getting like having its explosive
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.320]  moment like early in the day so when i launched an app you know it has it always will have kind
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.560]  of like a contact me button where it'll be like you know tap here and send me an email basically
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.920]  and i collect you know customer support and get feedback that way and you know widget smith was
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.080]  no different and about sort of just after lunch on that friday i thought that all of a sudden my
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.320]  app had gotten like like somehow that email address that support address had gotten sucked
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:34.320]  into some kind of spam bot or something right because i suddenly like the usual first week
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.920]  of support i get are from people in the apple tech community and many of them know me by name
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.520]  and are like they're writing a letter if you know with feedback or comments or bug reports
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.760]  whatever it might be they're writing it to me they'll be like hey underscore you know congrats
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.400]  on the app i ran into this issue and it's like to me and all of a sudden around midday i started
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:58.880]  getting the opposite of that which was these very short poorly written like uh kind of a slightly
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.760]  incoherent things that i was getting from addresses that didn't look like my own the normal
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.320]  kind of community and audience that i was getting i was like oh gosh like somehow this address has
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.520]  gotten kind of pulled into something that's not what i am you know like somehow it's kind of you
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.440]  know some spam bot is just sitting there and thinks it's funny to just keep sending me these
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.760]  kind of emails and not as like disparage those but it's like it's a very different kind of email
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.120]  than i'm used to and that just kept building over and over like throughout that day and it's like
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.280]  it just become more and more problematic in the sense of i'm like what do i do with these and like
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.240]  and and at some point later in that afternoon someone i think on twitter just sent me a link to
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.800]  um in one of these one of the videos on tick tock that i think was like the one that was
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.200]  had sort of the biggest views at this point and at that point it was you know had several million
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:52.800]  um views at that point um and it all of a sudden was like oh this is starting to make sense as to
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:24:00.320]  why my support queue is now just filled with emoji everywhere and it is a totally different um you
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.560]  know like audience that i'm used to and it isn't necessarily that they were asking for pastels it
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.680]  was more i interpreted the audience and the way that they were using it um to be that they were
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.520]  they they would appreciate if there was an increase in the pastel palette um within the
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:19.120]  application and so i just i did i did that on my own prerogative and it's it hit out hit very well
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:24.080]  like that feedback was very well received and then immediately like i think the second or third
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:31.120]  update was i built a custom color picker um so that you could really dial it into exactly like
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.880]  whatever it is color you want um because it became very clear that like my pre-built basics where
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.120]  it's like would you like it in red or green or blue like this isn't going to cut it we're going
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.400]  to need like to really go down that road but i had that like i i just discovered it in a weird
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.240]  like someone was like hey you seem like you're doing well on tiktok and i'm like i i like i know
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.160]  what tiktok is it's not like i like have no concept of it but i don't have an account i've
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.920]  never used it um and so it just like out of nowhere essentially this was this sort of happening
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.800]  in this in this community that i'm not really a part of or sort of have a connection to and it
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.160]  wasn't really until it sort of spilled over into twitter where which is a community that i do
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.640]  typically like have experience and will like have it you know have a have a presence in that
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.680]  i actually was like oh this is what's happening and then that's where like all of a sudden my
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:26.240]  you know sort of shift towards um cuter fonts and more pastel colors became something that
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.720]  seemed like an obvious move yeah and that's a you know it's sort of what i was talking about
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:41.120]  too where a good developer doesn't just take requests it's you listen to the reason right
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:49.760]  and so even if like you sussed out oh i can i can suss out from this that a variety of pastels
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:56.400]  would go over fantastic with this crowd it's not because they said i would like you to add pastels
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:02.080]  you you have to just sort of read between the lines you know and it's like maybe in the same
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:11.120]  way that a good wedding dj doesn't just take the request for specific songs but is like oh these
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.960]  people are ready to dance you know yeah you know i think you you think more like that and you're
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:23.600]  steering their desires that way um was the custom picker hard i don't even know is that like a
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.600]  is that a standard thing in swift ui it's not a standard thing it's completely well there is
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.640]  a standard one in swift ui but i couldn't use it because of the way that my editor is sort of
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.240]  structured it just wouldn't have worked it would be this kind of like weird odd odd man out um in
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.160]  my picker so i just built a custom one and i mean it's like is it hard i don't know it's like i've
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:48.320]  been doing this a long time so it's like it wasn't it wasn't straightforward but it was not like
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.920]  something that was insurmountable because the nice thing with color at least in this it's like it's
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:58.160]  relatively you know it's a constrained problem set like there's only um like for my purposes
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.560]  there's only so many colors that i need to display and i can kind of relatively easily come up with a
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:09.120]  way to you just drag your finger along on the picker um and that's a fairly intuitive thing
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.440]  rather than you know going down the road of like rgb or something which is not like a very user
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.680]  friendly thing of like they don't know how much red did they want in their color they just want
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.920]  to see it on the screen and drag their finger over towards it and be like oh there it is like i want
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:29.600]  this one i find like talking to my son uh i mean he's nerdier than most like he's not really into
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.120]  programming at all yet maybe he's actually taking computer science for the first time now in 11th
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:43.920]  grade nice um what do you think the language is java still no better great oh python yeah python
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.280]  python i thought it was i my hope was oh i hope it's i hope it's python i don't even know python
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.840]  but i was hoping it was python because i don't really know it but i know enough about it to root
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.280]  for it and i know it's a good language uh and i thought well if not python hopefully javascript
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:06.080]  please not java please not java yeah it was python uh and his textbook is the o'reilly python book
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:13.440]  and it's like oh well that's a good book yeah um but even he knows rgb like it's like a gamer
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.960]  thing because like you learn the rgb color so you can program your keyboard to light up the right
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.800]  colors but it actually is surprising talking to him about it that like there's a surprising number
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:32.400]  of people who all of a sudden you know they know hex values for rgb colors you know and it's like
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.120]  oh i'm surprised that you know that okay uh sure you know but it's not a particularly humane way
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.680]  to describe color no it's like that that's not a that that's definitely not something that it is a
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.560]  it is a tool of trade not a um something that a normal person should be expected to know that
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:57.520]  you know the exact x value of the color that they want 4a 525a yeah uh so
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.720]  i'm trying to think what else there's left to talk about here so all right let's talk about
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:16.320]  the monetization sure so this it seems like and is this like you said earlier that you
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:22.400]  you kind of thought maybe widgetsmith would be less popular than watchsmith um yeah they share
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:30.640]  a monetization strategy and in fact pool together sure so the basic idea they're free apps and
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.680]  certain of the features are unlocked through a what do you call it a pro account a premium
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.920]  account i think it's i call it like widgetsmith premium it's like a membership or subscription to
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:48.560]  the app and um it is uh i think two two dollars a month or twenty dollars a year um
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.680]  and among those are weather and the tides which i guess is that the same data source or is it
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.880]  different it's it's two separate data sources um like the tie data is coming from a like a tie
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:08.400]  yeah a tie data source and then the weather is a separate thing yeah um and that's it it's very
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:16.320]  simple you know there's no oh you pay a dollar to get colors and you pay three dollars to get
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:23.440]  weather and that renews because it's subscription it's just yeah one thing it's a membership and
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.320]  it's a membership and then the only choice is do you want to pay monthly or annually
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.440]  and get a you know save 20 i love that you're very precise and say that you save 19
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.760]  yeah well then i mean i gotta say just as a sort of a brief digression on that it's like that
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.720]  screen is the one that i feel like i agonized over more like i i try and be you know thoughtful
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.360]  about my design and a lot of things and but that's the screen that i think i agonized over the most
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:57.440]  because i don't want to be like it's very easy to be misleading or to be manipulative or to be
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.240]  like having people sign up for things that ultimately they're going to regret
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.480]  and there's i mean there's countless scams and things in the app store that are that way and
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.920]  it's like the opposite my goal and my design is the opposite like and maybe you could some some
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.840]  people might be might say it's like i'm like it's a bad design in that way but it's like my goal is
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.520]  it's like it is very clear what you're signing up for it is very clear what it costs it is like
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.280]  clear the difference between the monthly and the yearly where it's like if you know if you
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:32.000]  if you have like even with the monthly it's like i show you the monthly price times 12 right and
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.920]  i say it's going to cost this much a year and so it's like very clear that it's this is what's
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.720]  going to happen because the last thing i want it's like what i want is to have everybody who
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.120]  hits that button and starts subscribing to the app they know exactly what they're in for they're not
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.120]  going to be surprised they're not going to be upset like that's the thing that i ultimately
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:54.160]  want there because i'd rather have fewer customers that were happier than like somehow you know end
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.360]  up with all these customers who are like why am i being charged for your app like this is this is
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.800]  not what i want um and so like my goal with that was definitely very much to just be as
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.400]  straightforward and clear as i can it's like if i rather than saying you're saving 20 it's like
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.240]  no you're actually saving 19 because if i start to lie if i'm lying to you and saying it's 20
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:14.720]  percent right then i'm lying to you like i'm already i'm already off to a place that like i'm
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.800]  that that's not true you're actually not saving 20 you're saving 19 right i and the buttons are
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.880]  the same size you're not like steering people towards a big sign up for the year versus sign
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:34.960]  up for the month uh or vice versa they're the same size the uh 23.88 per year annual cost of the
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:43.200]  monthly is printed in a very normal sized font the norm the same font as everything else the only
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:48.240]  actual small print is the actual you know what should be small print the your purchase will be
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.680]  applied to your itunes account and the confirmation of your purchase subscriptions will automatically
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:57.440]  renew you know that it there's nothing hidden in the small print it's a very honest exchange um
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:03.120]  and again it's beautifully simple where you're either in the membership or not the free version
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:10.720]  is extremely useful in both cases uh yeah you know and yet the you know it's it's sort of
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:19.520]  i i you know it's a very good balance where it is very useful as a free app and therefore it is
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.880]  very popular as a free download but yet what is there to be paid for is a reasonable amount of
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:34.960]  money it is you know what about 20 bucks a year um for anybody who does sign up and gives features
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.000]  that people would actually want right yeah and it's it's what i like to spray i ended up with this
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.080]  is it's i it's it's it's like selling march selling like essentially like selling digital
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:55.120]  goods is always a weird business because it doesn't cost me anything to like let you access
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:00.240]  pink like right the fact like the fact that the if like in theory i could have like put pink behind
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.480]  a paywall and you have to like pay a dollar to unlock pink like okay great or blue or whatever
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.320]  color that might be like that doesn't but i feel that feels like a weird business to be in i mean
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.800]  this this is sort of like a broader discussion of like a lot of the apps that are making most
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.200]  of the money on the app store are these consumable like in-app purchase like things where you're
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:24.880]  buying gems that are just bits in a database like but they're creating this big cost to them and
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.800]  it's like i don't ever feel great about that and instead it's like i feel much better about a
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.480]  business where whether entire data costs me something and so i can't provide it to you for
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.440]  free like that's it's unreasonable and certainly i'm not giving it to you at cost like that's not
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:46.960]  what it costs me to provide you know um to provide that data but it feels reasonable to pay for that
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.560]  i need you to pay for it on an ongoing basis so it's a subscription and then that's the audience
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:58.640]  that is sort of is is my you know is the audience that i'm sort of charging for and if you are a
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.200]  user who just wants to support the app and just wants to like pay for it and never use you know
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.160]  weather and tides like great that i appreciate that that's wonderful but i feel if you're
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.480]  someone who wants weather data i feel good about charging you for that and it's nice and sort of
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.120]  simple and straightforward it's not trying to be manipulative or problematic in a way that i feel
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:23.360]  like so so much of the app store is and it means that i'm avoiding a lot of the things that you
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.400]  know would sort of sort of go down a path where you can make a quick buck but end up in a way
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.960]  worse place people it sounds like we're you know you and i are getting ready to move to some kind
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:43.280]  of hippie compound but you can't you can't put a price on what it's like to sleep good at night
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:50.480]  yeah you know uh you know it's you know trying to scoop up every available penny you could make
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:57.200]  if you tried to do everything short of like towing your line against tricking people into
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.280]  paying for something gets you dangerously close to trying to move the line of what constitutes
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.400]  tricking or not whereas if you're kind of trying to stay as far away from the tricky line as
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.560]  possible you're almost certainly are leaving money on the table that you would have picked up
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.120]  but you're probably not leaving any money on the table from people who definitely wanted to buy it
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.160]  and they're the ones you feel good about and there's so many normal businesses in the real
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.760]  world where you never have to worry about it like if you run a restaurant nobody like gets tricked
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.120]  into coming into your restaurant to eat you know like i didn't what i didn't know i had to pay for
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:42.080]  this dinner what why am i paying for this steak i thought it was free yeah yeah that's yeah it's
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.680]  like the end that's the expectation and there's a straightforwardness like you walk into you walk
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.000]  in the door and they hand you a piece of paper that has the name of the food and how much it
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.560]  costs and it's very straightforward and you'd be surprised if you like order the you know you order
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:58.640]  the hamburger and it says it's fifteen dollars and at the end of the meal they're like that will be
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:05.040]  yes seventeen dollars a month for the rest of like your life it's like what that would be a surprise
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:09.040]  that would not be what you expected for but that's not what happens because or like next month when
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.960]  you're when your credit card bill comes and you've got another charge from the place you ate a month
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.360]  ago and it's like what i didn't know i didn't know i was subscribing to a hamburger from the place
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:23.920]  i'm not even that was at an airport over in uh down florida i why why am i subscribed to a hamburger
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:28.320]  yeah but i feel like so often that happens in the app store though like that kind of thing can
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.600]  happen where there's so especially with subscriptions it can very easily be something
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.920]  that you don't really know what you're signing up for yeah totally all right let's talk a little
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.800]  bit about weather i don't think people understand that weather data costs money to developers
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.760]  and it does there is no well there's some free weather info but quote-unquote free and there's
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.800]  a reason why weather apps are usually paid and if they're not paid are sort of a cesspool of
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.720]  privacy invasive shenanigans yeah where they're just trying to get your location data basically
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:13.440]  yep because uh yeah and this this is a it once you think about it everybody if if you
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.360]  dear listener of the talk show have never really pondered this you're going to your mind's about
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:25.920]  to be blown because if you think that there are a bunch of scammy ad network type of businesses
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.800]  hundreds and hundreds of them out there that really would like to have your location data
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:39.680]  and you know that all these apps system-wide have really been locked down in terms of anything that
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:45.280]  has location data you have to ask the user for permission for and it's very easy to go check in
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.840]  the privacy section of settings which apps have location data which ones have used it recently
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:58.080]  and how to turn it off and you think you know it's hard for scammers to get into it what apps
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.840]  do you grant location to well of course you grant it to your weather app right yeah because you want
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:10.880]  weather where you are and it makes you know other than like um turn by turn directions app i can't
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.720]  think of another genre of app where granting location data is more essential to it i guess
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.400]  the pokemon go right and like ride hailing maybe yeah ride hailing right but that's again that's
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.160]  sort of mapping right like it's just a ride hailing is almost just a variant of turn by
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.600]  turn directions it's yeah giving them turn by turn directions to get to you you know yeah um
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.600]  so guess what there's an awful lot of weather apps that have made arrangements and deals
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.200]  and and if you have a free third-party weather app on your phone you've probably are giving up
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.480]  your location data to outfits that you probably don't want to give your location data to
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:56.800]  yeah i mean i can speak from experience that that is something that at any time there are p there
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.960]  are companies that exist and i get you know solicitations for this kind of stuff as a developer
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.080]  that anytime you have an app that accesses location data that they were more than happy to
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.080]  pay you for that data and you'll just they'll basically say oh it's you know it's no big deal
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.560]  you just drop our sdk into your application right and it'll you know because you've granted
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.040]  permission we'll just collect the data and you know send it off and you'll get a check each month
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.840]  and like it absolutely exists and it's something and it's like i don't think that's what people
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.760]  are signing up for when they're hitting like you know show me the location show me the weather data
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:34.560]  for where i am right now yeah so this had this whole direction got me thinking and when apple
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:42.960]  bought dark sky earlier this year um it made me wonder i was not surprised because i've always
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.640]  i've been a fan of dark skies ever i think since they did launched it's fantastic service and i
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:56.880]  love their predictions uh you know for near-term precipitation and they've been uncannily accurate
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:02.400]  for the most part over the years and when they're not it's never like i i feel ripped off it's like
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:08.160]  if they say hey rain starting in five minutes and it doesn't rain it looks it sure as heck looks
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.520]  like it's about to rain right yeah uh and there have been times where they've said dark sky has
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.480]  given me an alert like rain starting in 10 minutes and i look up and i'm like they're nuts there's no
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.760]  way it's going to rain in 10 minutes and sure as hell 11 minutes later it's raining and it's like
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:31.680]  where did this come from um but anyway i wonder if apple's long-term plan on this is to provide
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.080]  weather services at the system level i mean i i it definitely was something that came to mind for me
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:45.600]  that's like as someone who uses it that like i could see apple trying to get to you know sort of
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.680]  i don't know how like if you were not sure if they would ever require it like that feels like
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:57.680]  tricksy but it's definitely a thing of if they can get off people off the need for um you know
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.640]  it's like for for a third-party developer to have to pay for weather data like that certainly seems
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.200]  like a good benefit i mean my suspicion though is honestly is that they don't like that in the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.240]  weather app it has the weather channel logo in the bottom right corner i know and yahoo or the yahoo
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.200]  logo or whatever that is like i think the reality is they just view that as it's like why do we have
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.560]  on like one of the most used apps probably like i got to imagine it's like messages and then weather
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:28.720]  are probably the two most used apps um on ios like that we have some other company's logo
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.320]  prominently in the corner of this app at all times and i got to imagine they just want to
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.480]  not have that there it have you ever asked the your your home assistant your dingus for the
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:46.480]  weather um like if you have home pods and you ask hey what's what's the weather i don't know what
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:52.160]  the rules are because it doesn't seem like they always tell you but sometimes they'll be like the
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.160]  weather today in philadelphia will be 71 degrees with 30 chance of rain when a low temperature
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:04.880]  in the evening down to 57 my weather data is provided by the weather channel and it's even
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.680]  worse than the logo right because the logo at least they can make small and stick in the lower
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:16.720]  corner but to actually have to say it out loud right yeah like i just i got to imagine that has
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:23.440]  more to do with it because i think they like i would love for them to provide it and i mean in
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.720]  some ways of course that would make a bit of a conundrum for me because part of the way that
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:33.040]  i've sort of structured my things is that right data has a cost but like i and i'm not as if they
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.480]  did they could certainly go down that road now that they own dark sky and that they have that
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.320]  data and they have it um in in a sort of in a broader way but yeah that's in my mind they're
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:46.080]  just gonna they just want to get rid of that logo as soon as they can yeah well that's where i was
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.520]  going with it is that if so it's it is admirable that you're not charging for access to more than
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.680]  say the eight primary colors and i say that i say admirable in that i i i like your thinking i don't
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.480]  think there's anything wrong personally with apps that do that we actually had tossed that around
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:08.320]  with vesper as a an idea before you know we just gave up the ghost but that maybe we would have a
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:15.360]  paid subscription thing that would have alternate themes for vesper um and that wasn't necessarily
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  no marginal cost because we were thinking you know like maybe it would be fonts that we had
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:25.040]  to license to include sure um but it might be you know it might be stuff like colors where
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:32.160]  literally it's not a marginal cost to us to offer a red yeah but you know you have to charge for
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:38.320]  something you know and it and it felt better than charging for sync i don't know yeah and i think
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.520]  or more for sink or something like that when i think about that though is it's the
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.720]  like it's great to reserve the ability to charge for things in the future right um like when i'm
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:55.440]  coming into something like this it's like i want to have a business model up front that like i'm
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.640]  accumulating enough revenue to keep the lights on and to have a you know have a reasonable business
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:07.280]  but it's offset just as much by creating goodwill and the opportunity in the future that if at some
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.160]  point whether data is becomes free for me and it becomes a little silly that i'm charging for it
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:15.760]  then at that point it's like there i'm sure there are other opportunities and there's other things
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.240]  or even in the near term like one of the obvious things that i should probably be starting to do
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:27.760]  is you know work with designers and have like theme packs or things that are you know like that
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:33.520]  kind of a purchase within the application yeah where it's a it's it's what i like about that
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.800]  what i like about that is it's like it's it's a truly premium upsell in a way that it isn't like
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.320]  i'm charging you for red it's like i'm charging you for here's this designer who has created this
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.840]  gorgeous you know set of borders and colors and backgrounds and wallpapers and you can
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:55.840]  buy them as a unit and you're getting something that feels nice not something that feels like i'm
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.960]  being cheap yeah yeah yeah exactly like if it was like a custom border design that made it seem like
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:08.080]  a very fancy certificate of authenticity you know yeah like my widget is completely certified yeah
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:14.000]  you know and people might might have fun with that um yeah yeah and i i do think you know
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.600]  that well here's here's my other question about weather before i get off the weather the other
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.280]  thing i wanted to pick your brain about is that widgetsmith defaults to feels like temperature
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.440]  yes instead of actual temperature i get a lot of feedback on this okay so i as a weather app
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:40.160]  aficionado i have mixed feelings about this yeah i'm curious why why that's the default that's
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:48.800]  almost never the default sure so this is one of those cases where that every weather app i ever
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:55.840]  app i ever use where it's an option that i can display the actual temp like the sort of i guess
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.880]  the scientific temperature or the apparent temperature i always set it to apparent temperature
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:07.280]  because as a person existing in the world that's the temperature that actually is meaningful to me
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:13.040]  that if it's gonna if i go outside and it feels like a hundred then i want to know that it feels
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:19.360]  like 100 not that it is 90 like i just for as a pro like that's what i want to know when i look
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:26.480]  at the weather app and when so i'm always like flipping that switch and so as a developer that's
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.120]  one of the places where i'm just being a little opinionated and saying i think this is actually
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.160]  what you want that when you say you want to know the weather you actually want to know what it's
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.400]  going to feel like if you go outside not what you know a thermometer sitting outside is what it
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.800]  would tell you and so in the same like what you were saying earlier of like tell me the problem
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.720]  don't tell me what your solution is to the problem like the problem you have is what it's going what's
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.760]  it going to feel like if i go outside and i can answer that question people have worked this out
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.720]  with you know fields like temperature and wind chill and heat index and all that and so i'm
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.400]  actually i think that's a better answer and some people get really upset about that when they
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.200]  realize that like why does it's you know it's like my thermometer outside on my deck says that it's
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  80 degrees but your set your you know your thing says it's 90 degrees and it's like well it's
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.360]  because it's super humid outside and if you go outside you're gonna it's gonna feel like it's 90
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.040]  and so that's why there's an option to do it like i'm to let you you know i made it so that you can
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.880]  optionally turn it off but as a default i i firmly believe that apparent temperature is what everyone
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.680]  should think about because that's actually what people care about okay i was on board with you
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.920]  and on that team all summer long earlier this summer i switched all of my apps that i and i
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.040]  switched between a bunch that all of them that support feels like i switched it feels like i
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:51.280]  had it on my watch and i was like this is this is fantastic and there were days and it was summer
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:57.360]  and it was you know it's the east coast so you know usually it was my feels like would say hey
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:04.720]  it feels like 95 even though it's only 84 and that's a big difference and it's the difference
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.880]  between pleasant and unpleasant and it would be right and i was like i everything should be like
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:17.680]  this and then i ran into a couple of days in a row where it was wrong and it would be like it
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.360]  feels like 94 and say oh that's miserable and i was like well i gotta go out anyway i go out and
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:29.040]  it was beautiful and it was like and it's the it really the the feels like was just in my opinion
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.360]  wrong it didn't feel like it at all and i don't know what and i was talking to uh ryan jones who's
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.080]  the developer of uh weatherline one of my favorite third-party weather apps and he was like he just
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:46.080]  it was one of our typical chats where it was either going to be really long and he was like
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:52.560]  oh don't even get me started yeah and it basically he was like i think all the effort i put into
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.080]  weatherline you could put into i i would like to put into a new formula for feels like to actually
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:05.600]  get it right like sure that's how hard it can be and i concluded by the end of summer that when
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:12.960]  feels like is wrong is worse and therefore outweighs the benefits of one feels like is
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.680]  better and that what i kind of want and none of my apps seem to do is is to find the perfect balance
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.880]  of showing me both at once it's like it seems like most apps either show you one or the other
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.280]  or they show you one of them big and then the other one is like small print at the bottom
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:35.680]  you know like weird um but it can be very wrong it's that's that's my complaint with it is that
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.960]  sometimes it'll say it feels like blank and it's like no it actually feels like the actual
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:46.640]  temperature yeah and i mean there are so many solutions to this that are tricky like it is it
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:52.800]  certainly thinks it's not like perception is a hard thing to measure something like you know
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.200]  so there's something like weather that and like some people like don't mind the humidity nearly
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.760]  as much as others and say that they're going to feel it differently right um and i mean i think
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:07.440]  of like the national weather service they have have you ever seen their graphical forecast no
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.080]  i don't think so so they have let me see if i can quickly bring one up but so they have this
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:19.120]  forecast that is um very very sort of like economic in terms of the way that it shows
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:24.320]  um it shows you with the weather data and what i've always thought is interesting with the way
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:29.760]  their economy of kind of like how they do it is the heat index or the wind chill is only shown
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:38.160]  when it's like beyond a certain amount different than the typical um and it's when it's a typical
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:42.640]  amount different from the like the actual temperature and i feel like there's a certain
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:47.760]  maybe something in there that i think they may be sort of hitting on um but like they
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:53.840]  it's like there's a certain balance where yes you only want it to show when it's me gonna tell gonna
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:52:00.240]  tell you something that you really need to know like when it is actually um like you're gonna
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.160]  walk outside and you're gonna be like i thought it was 72 and you walk outside and you're miserable
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:09.360]  right you're like i want you to tell me that right um right now right like so maybe there's
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:13.600]  something like that where you only show it if it's different among like above a certain amount
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:19.120]  yeah and so you're you're trying to optimize for the surprise factor right um yeah that makes sense
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:24.000]  to me or if it's above like only tell me when the heated like if the heat index is above 95
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.600]  say yeah like at that point switch to using that or i don't know but it's it's a it's it's it's
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.480]  it's a problem i've struggled with um for for how to how to show that data in a way that is
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:41.040]  reasonable yeah it's a complicated problem anyway now that you have a weather app effectively
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:47.280]  effectively welcome to the club yeah i've been in the club for a while yeah i guess so um
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:55.840]  uh so i guess last but not least i just again i'm not trying to get actual numbers but no no
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:02.960]  that's fine but you're you know but it a reasonable it emits this avalanche of downloads
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.840]  you're also getting a somewhat commensurate increase in number of people who are actually
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:13.840]  signing up it's not just all people using the free app it is actually a hit product for you
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:18.240]  yes no it is certainly um it is certainly converting well like at every rate that you
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:21.600]  would sort of usually expect for this kind of thing because right you know in a normal
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.560]  application you only you know it's like it's you kind of expect that the majority of your users
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:30.880]  aren't going to subscribe aren't going to pay aren't going to be doing anything like that
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:35.360]  but you just hope that you know a certain percentage of people are and that is seemed
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.560]  to be sort of the case with this um that people aren't you know enough of enough people want to
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:46.000]  see that data or support the app or for whatever reason they're they're signing up um that they
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.800]  you know that they're doing it never had you know and i was worried when you know when it
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:57.360]  had its crazy kind of like like the the first like i don't even know 24 to 48 hours of this app
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:02.240]  where where it kind of really took off were unlike anything i've ever seen in 12 years of making apps
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:06.800]  for the app store where it's like the number of downloads i was getting in an hour is like
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:13.120]  collectively what it usually takes years for all my other apps put together that's insane
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.960]  you know like it's one of these things like i don't have a concept of how to like even really
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:23.680]  sort of deal with that and my fear was that obviously you'd have this huge spike like absurd
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.600]  numbers like you know tens of millions of people downloading the app and then all of a sudden it
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.480]  was going to fall off and you know no one was going to subscribe and it would have just been
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.280]  like huh if you remember that funny day that i had like crazy downloads and then nothing nothing
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.520]  like nothing changed in my life right like that was kind of what i was at least the pessimist in
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:45.920]  me was certainly had that little like you know fear in the back of my mind right but that's like
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.920]  i was thankful to see that even as it's sort of settled down and it isn't cool i mean it's
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.520]  i kind of feel like you know when you see people like going off to climb mount everest they have to
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.360]  go up to different camps along the way yes and they'll like go up somewhere and they'll like
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.520]  spend a week and then they'll go to the next one and they'll spend a week yeah like i feel like
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:10.320]  i'm in one of those base camps now where the like early like when in those first few days it was i
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.120]  was up on everest like i'd never seen anything like this this is way up high and it's like i've
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:21.280]  come down from there but i'm just like hanging out at like advanced base camp now like it's it's not
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.240]  normal by any definition of what normal would be um but it's like it's continuing on and having a
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:31.760]  life and having conversions into subscriptions and doing the things that make it a sustainable
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:38.080]  business and not just being you know crazy up crazy down huh that was funny and i just go back
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.840]  to you know my other apps yeah well it i congratulations it is well deserved but just in
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.520]  terms of how bananas it is here's i'm lee i'm looking at the live top chart for free apps right
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:59.120]  now yeah and as we speak the list is number one widget smith two zoom and again this is in
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:06.720]  coronavirus with back to school and all of this stuff going over zoom three is your arch rival
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:15.600]  color widgets um but you know similar similar oh sure basic same basic idea is is yeah an app about
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:25.600]  widgets um for discord uh very very popular chat talking chat app five tick tock which has been
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:30.800]  threatened to be removed from the app stores which in addition to its popularity has prompted
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:40.240]  its downloads six youtube instagram gmail have you heard of gmail yeah snapchat and then number
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:46.480]  10 is facebook and then 11 is messenger and it goes on from there now of course some of this is
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.160]  it doesn't mean that widget smith is more popular than facebook uh obviously facebook's downloads
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.840]  are suppressed and instagram etc are suppressed on a daily basis significantly by the fact that
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:05.840]  there are billion literally billions of people who already have them sure but it puts it into context
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:12.560]  i mean that some of these apps are not like the others in this list right one of these apps was
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:17.600]  made by a single person like working at a computer in his basement and the other one is made by
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.760]  like some of the most valuable companies in the world right that i mean i i think i'm pretty sure
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:30.560]  that facebook has more than one engineer working on their main app i hope so i think so uh it's
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:36.960]  just it's just really really awesome to be talking to you and have you not just on the list but at
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:44.320]  number one it's really a lot of fun but part of that is uh before we go into the final section
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:51.200]  i want to talk about sleep tracking um but before we get there just your your basic strategy has
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.040]  been so interesting to me over the 12 years you've been working on the platform i was it a recent
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:01.600]  tweet somebody i just saw a tweet from you where you were like you mentioned that you've had 59
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.960]  apps yeah was that reason yeah that was a couple days ago when i was just kind of like reminiscing
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:14.080]  on the 12 years that it has been to get me to here was that it's yet i've made 59 apps over the last
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:21.680]  12 years you know i i think it tell me if you disagree in any way but i think a basic description
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:31.840]  of your your strategy from the beginning is to come up with ideas for smaller apps that you could
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:42.160]  do by yourself relatively quickly and see how see what's popular see what sticks and you know and if
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:49.040]  it gains traction or some angle of it gains traction then go with it and if not move on to
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:54.880]  another idea like you all 59 apps are not still actively maintained and available in the app store
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:04.080]  um it it is a a sort of you know you your strategy is to be a singles hitter not a home run hitter
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:09.120]  and spray a lot of singles and get on base as often as you can and good you know in baseball
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.600]  good things happen you know yeah as opposed to well i'll just sit there and keep trying to hit
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:19.200]  a home run and wait till the bases are loaded you know yeah um i mean let me keep going with
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:24.480]  my analogies here you if you're playing tetris you're you're trying to clear lines as you go
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:30.400]  you're not saving a column over on the side going for waiting for a couple of big four and a row
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:40.400]  pieces to to get the four in a row things you're clearing rows as you go uh and you know i i to me
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:46.080]  this is the payoff that you've been waiting for you keep working on good ideas you keep trying
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:52.000]  them you're you know you're there on day one right and in terms of that whole debate of
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:58.400]  hey why were developers so mad that they only had uh 24 hours notice for ios 14
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:06.720]  uh because they're it's good to be there on day one yeah right and it's i've benefited from that
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.520]  many many times like one of my other popular apps pedometer plus plus is like a step counter and it
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.560]  was the first app that ever used the motion processor in the iphone 5s and because it was
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:24.000]  the first it did well and it's you know that's a skill it is a tremendous skill you you you're
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:30.080]  prolific as you know and i'm not trying to uh uh puff you up just because you're the guest on my
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:34.960]  show but there's a prolificness to it and but if you think about it just the amount of time you've
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:42.480]  spent on the infrastructure of setting up the metadata in the app store to get 59 apps adds up
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.400]  weeks of time well i have my 10 000 hours of uploading screenshots into itunes connect
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.960]  right right i have been doing that far more than i wish i would have been able to
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:57.920]  right you've got you're you're really good at launching a new app yeah um
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:05.120]  you know you never know what what's going to hit you know it's yeah it's always true and i think
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.600]  i think it's like it's one of those things where my goal and what is like a i have a really short
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:14.640]  attention span and i love like the thing i enjoy most is making new apps if i'm honest i really
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:20.880]  don't like maintaining apps like i i love making them i love the idea i love having seeing like a
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:28.320]  wwdc keynote is probably like my favorite two hours of the year in my work that i love seeing
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.800]  like these are the new things and coming up with what's possible or as we were talking about
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.600]  earlier what's maybe not so possible in what they're hoping for but saying that i could make
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:43.920]  happen yeah um i love that process and i love doing that and i have a short attention span and
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:51.040]  i get bored maintaining something and so i i like that process and it means that yeah it's like i've
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:56.080]  gotten good at knowing how to turn apps around very quickly i've gotten good at knowing how to
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:01.600]  launch apps how to what are the features that are actually going to be meaningful for an application
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:06.640]  what is something that if i actually make it's like there's there's there's a very fine line
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.520]  between knowing what's a good version one feature and what's a version 1.1 feature and because half
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.640]  the time i never build the 1.1 it's important to know that difference and to know that it's like
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.800]  this is not something that i need for version one and i should push it to the side and wait
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.560]  um on it and that has allowed me to be able to be in the position where it's like i've launched 59
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:33.200]  apps i would say all but maybe six of them are were complete flops from a like a financial a
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.680]  business whatever perspective like i learned a lot from them so it's certainly like i and it
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.160]  benefits me now when i'm making an app like widgetsmith that has touches so many different
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:49.120]  parts of the of ios and all of the the system that i've built a calendar app so i can if i want to
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.360]  add calendars to widgetsmith that's easy i've done that before i have all this code i know where all
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:57.760]  the weird bugs are i've worked around them before if i want to interact with you know weather data
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.720]  like i built a weather app years ago and i've i've done this before i know how to do it and
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:09.120]  i can build that experience and i think it's a model that works well for the like i feel like
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:15.600]  indies kind of traditionally like like the traditional mac or apple indie is the person who
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:22.160]  is has like their one thing that they almost like slavishly work on and develop and you have like a
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:28.080]  james thompson who's worked on pcalc for like timing material like i don't know how long he's
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:34.160]  like timing material like i don't know how long he's been working on that 30 years just 30 something
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:41.120]  like that like it's it's and he is like that path i would be have lost my mind i'm glad it works for
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:48.160]  him that's great but for me i i'm always looking and interested in the new thing and i look like
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:53.520]  i am already in the midst of all of this with widgetsmith like the you know biggest app in the
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.840]  like in the world right now i'm already starting to think about new apps i want to make and in
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:03.200]  anything the maintenance and the management of widgetsmith is a burden rather than a blessing
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.560]  like i that's just who i am and that's how i've gotten to be um to where i am and it's a it's
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:15.200]  a situation too where i think it's worth saying that i'm i feel very grateful for the ability
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.560]  to do what i do and i think it is largely based on the app store and on apple and what they do
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:28.720]  for a developer like me the fact that i can launch 59 apps over 12 years and i'd like the i'm not the
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.080]  infrastructure and everything is in place for me to be able to do that and they take care of the
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:37.760]  billing and they take care of all of the things um that allow a one-man shop like it's just me
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:41.920]  in my you know like in my basement writing code i don't have a big infrastructure i don't have a big
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:49.520]  staff it's that i don't think would it be possible in in a world that wasn't like the app store and
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:53.920]  it's something that i feel very grateful for and like sometimes i get to be in my bonnet around
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:58.160]  all the stuff that's been happening with the app store and epic and all the like shenanigans it's
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:04.880]  like i'm able to do what i love doing because the app store is the way it is and it works for people
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:10.400]  like me to have just as much standing as all the other apps you just listed in the top 10 of the
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:15.760]  app store right now like i have just as i have just as much sort of claim to that top chart as
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.960]  they do and it doesn't matter that they're google it doesn't matter that they're facebook
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:23.680]  like i'm just a guy but the app store is a great leveler in that way and so i feel very grateful
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:29.040]  for like that apple has created it and sort of is something that exists for me yeah that's well
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:35.520]  said i mean and it must be gratifying too because the nature of widgetsmith is such that what people
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:43.920]  are enthusiastic for about it means they they see it all the time right it's it is not like
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:51.040]  like uh pcalc just just to toss out another example beloved i've had i've been using pcalc
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:59.280]  i think for close if not 30 years close certainly close at least 25. uh i go days and weeks maybe
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:04.880]  even at a time without launching pcalc because i have nothing to calculate right whereas a widget
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:09.760]  on your home screen there it is on your home screen and where do people really if they're
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:16.880]  really going to spend time to tweak and customize the color and the font and the size and and you
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:21.920]  know sit there and really get in there and and futz with it where do they want it they want it
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:25.600]  on their first home screen right or the second one one you know where they're going to see it
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:29.760]  all the time so there you've got this thing that they see all the time you know that which is super
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:36.400]  cool like put aside just the uh you know the financial aspect of it like that's just cool
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:44.320]  when you realize holy crap there are you know the x thousands of people looking at my thing
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:49.600]  all day every day and it's in the device in their pocket yeah and it has the app of the
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:55.120]  name of the app right underneath every widget which is really awesome which is i get a lot
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.360]  of requests that i'm like oh man can't you hide that it's like i a i can't because that's just
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:05.520]  not the way apple like has built the widget system and b if i could i would not there you go there's
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:10.240]  the first time you've been a little selfish on the entire a little bit a little bit in this that's
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:15.360]  one thing that i am very grateful that every single time i see a screenshot of someone being
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.760]  like hey look at this cool thing i did with my home screen there it is widget smith right there
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:26.080]  go to the app store search for it and get it you know it is it's very cool it is a very nice way
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:32.000]  of uh you know people don't have to you know they there's a thing they can search for right there
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.240]  uh all right let me thank our third and final sponsor of the show it's our good friends at
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.920]  squarespace oh man speaking of customizing your stuff how about your website you want to customize
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:46.960]  your website well if you have a squarespace website you can customize everything you can
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:56.240]  start with a slew of award-winning templates that are already pre-designed that scale from big

[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:09.520]  and just anything you do you do it right there in the browser what you see is what you get
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.640]  as you're designing your website you're looking at exactly what everybody else will see
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:21.680]  when they see your website minus like the edit buttons that's it uh could not be easier if you
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:27.120]  are the sort of nerd who knows what css and html and javascript are and you want to get in there
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.800]  and mess with the code you can do that too but if you don't even know what those things do what they
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:38.480]  mean you don't have to you'll never see it that's the the range that squarespace covers everything

[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.760]  widgetsmith uh for a while you'd think it would be an original name for a couple of hours at
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:34.800]  least over the weekend you could you could find another widgetsmith in the app store i wrote about
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:42.960]  it uh yeah i i don't expect you after all of your kind words about the opportunity that the
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:49.680]  app stores afforded you i'm not asking you to to complain but it's got to be frustrating right
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:56.560]  that had to be like oh man like if you're you're you're set up you're saying oh man widgetsmith
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.160]  is flying high this is going to come to an end one of these days i'm going to be knocked off the
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:07.440]  number one spot it's going to happen anyway right yeah for it to be knocked off the number one spot
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:14.160]  by a rip-off app that hurts it hurts right there's no simple way to say it's like it's just it hurts
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:21.120]  like it was it was painful to see that and if i think i think that is most hurtful about i mean
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:24.880]  i've had many copy kits i've had to kind of like deal with in in the years of the app store it's
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:31.040]  like the most hurtful are the ones that are poor knockoffs like yeah like like it's it's like what
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:37.440]  you were saying about ariel right it isn't like it isn't like what what it isn't like knocking me off
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.400]  in a way that it's like taking what i did and doing it better right right like i've had like
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:47.920]  that kind of a scenario it's more like ah man i should have thought of that like that feeling
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.480]  is not great it's not a nice feeling but it's like okay that's fair it's like when you're getting
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:59.760]  ripped off by somebody who it's clearly just this thing is popular let me just grab its name throw
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:05.280]  together if like a basic app that will get just enough utility to get past app review and throw
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:10.800]  it in the app store and try and just it's much more like it feels more like stealing than about
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.200]  like you know being inspired by something or imitating it or those types of like the more
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:22.640]  positive versions of like clearly i'm sure there are countless people making widget apps right now
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.440]  right like that would be foolish if there weren't if if you if you had an idea for one or you're
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:31.920]  going to think like i'm going to cash in on this market like of course people are doing that but
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:38.320]  it was hurt it was hurtful and what was difficult about that one is that it was such a poor copy and
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.120]  it wasn't being it wasn't like hard working and it wasn't thoughtful and clever and i think that
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:47.280]  was the part that was like harmful about it and i think i mean it's like to complain it's like
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:53.680]  certainly i wish that apple their infrastructure was such that that didn't happen in the first
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.720]  place that they caught that kind of thing and you would it's like you got to think there's a way and
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:04.000]  a mechanism and a business process that they can catch this stuff rather than having it had to
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.680]  always be reported and i could imagine there's there's always going to be situations that fall
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:15.920]  outside of the like process that they come up with and there's always going to need to be a report
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:19.840]  this app system to deal with the cases that for you know if you're copying an app that isn't
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.800]  particularly popular um like it might not you know draw to their attention that there's actually
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:29.360]  isn't this other app that has the same name or whatever that might be like there but you got to
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:35.600]  think that like if they were thoughtful about the names or the keywords and things like that for the
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:42.400]  top 100 apps in each of the categories so that's something like i mean like 2600 apps or something
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:49.120]  maybe like it's not an inconceivable number that you'd have to wrap your head around and like to be
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.720]  thoughtful and to be protective of those names um like it seems like something that they should be
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:01.200]  able to do and i think like if anything while i'm frustrated by it it's like the only thing that i
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.400]  see that's particularly encouraging to me about all of the controversy that we've been dealing
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.000]  with this summer with like the app store and whether there should be a 30 cut there should
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:17.040]  be alternative app stores and all of these things like i take hope in that apple in the 12 years i've
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:23.920]  been doing this seems to do their best work when they are under pressure and they have to prove
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.320]  that they're living up to the ideals that they always market themselves as having
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:35.360]  and the apple says the app store is the place you go because of trust and privacy like like privacy
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  trust and trustworthiness are like the things that it's there for and trustworthiness is a
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:47.200]  bit in question if you're allowing copycat clone scam apps to exist in your platform like that's
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:51.840]  clearly just problematic for that and it's i'm sure apple was embarrassed that they let this
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.960]  through and like my hope is that they actually have pressure now because they keep putting up
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:01.120]  these like marketing websites that say like the app store is amazing and i agree the app store
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:07.280]  is amazing i just you know like saying its praises a few minutes ago but now i think they what i like
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.760]  and what i'm encouraged by is like they have to prove that now and so this happened once
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.920]  like i don't expect this is going to happen again for widgetsmith i got to imagine there's someone
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:22.560]  who got a very stern talking to you by somebody who's like this is embarrassing two days before
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:27.760]  this we published this whole big new like website on our on apple.com saying how great then
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.200]  trustworthy the app store is and then this happens two days later this can never happen again and
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:40.080]  that pressure is great yeah i agree with that that's a good take and i do think that it is an
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:47.680]  it's an interesting way to keep them on competitive on their competitive toes as they
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:55.360]  have less competition directly at least that they're not an underdog right yeah and i'm not
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:00.160]  i don't want to definitely don't want to devolve this into an argument over a monopoly what the
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:08.880]  word monopoly means but there is less competition in the phone space right like you know you're
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:15.120]  talking about developing on the platform for 12 years we're we're old enough now where for us 12
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:20.160]  years doesn't seem like that long right for my son who's in 11th grade it seems like he probably
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:27.600]  barely remembers or doesn't remember what it was like before iphone um but i remember when it when
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:35.760]  the iphone was new and felt i felt even before it came out just what in that wild crazy interim
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.520]  where apple had announced it at mac world but it wasn't even shipping until june uh
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.000]  it was a wild time and i thought this is a surefire hit this is going to be great i cannot
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.880]  wait for this and i remember thinking they're going to do apps there's a famous not famous
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.480]  famous to me but like merlin man was doing podcasts on the mac world show floor and
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:04.560]  grabbed me and jason snell and interviewed us on it was like a 10-minute podcast and jason snell
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:09.440]  and i like merlin asked us if we thought they were going to have apps and we didn't even think
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:14.640]  about that at the time and within like five or six minutes now and i had talked ourselves into uh
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:18.720]  yeah they're going to do apps there's going to be apps eventually like it has to be
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:23.600]  and it's it's a great five minutes of podcasting because it was like an hour after the thing had
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:30.160]  been unveiled to the world um but at the time there were you know the palm was still real and
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:35.920]  and they eventually came out with the palm pre which was a great platform and unfortunately
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:42.320]  too late right it did did you really i did i was my first my first job my first job when i was in
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:47.200]  high school was making apps for the palm five and the palm but that's not the palm pre you know
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.080]  i had i also made apps for the palm pre but oh okay well it was a good i loved you know and it
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:58.320]  blackberry was still a thing and they had apps and nobody knew and and nokia tried to get you know
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:05.680]  it was all up in the air whether we were going to settle on uh monopoly a duopoly a triopoly
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.280]  you know with this was mobile maybe going to be different you know like you had pocket pc right
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:18.400]  at micro's microsoft was getting into the sort of the spaces with pocket pc and for for a you know
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:26.560]  about 15 years you know from the early 90s until the mid 2000s when we called the non-phone one
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:33.760]  pdas and it was a separate category but it you know clearly was meant to converge there were
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.200]  never a dominant platform you know and you never knew and you know we've settled into a thing and
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:43.920]  it's probably the way most markets settle in where there's fewer competitors than not but something
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.920]  has to keep apple on its competitive toes right otherwise complacency is inevitable and and i
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:54.160]  think that the pressure on the app store the upside to it is i agree with you completely that
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:18:01.840]  it's a way to to inspire apple to up its game across the board with everything related to the
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:08.160]  app store even if nothing changes regulatory or legal wise as to what they're required to do
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.680]  yeah that that pressure and that sense of like you can't be an underdog when you're the biggest
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:20.720]  company in the world but you can still feel like you have to prove yourself yeah and that desire
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:26.720]  is only good right and only positive and if apple continues to hold themselves to high standards and
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:32.160]  then the world holds them to those like that's that's a great situation for for apple and for
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:38.880]  the world yeah i i when i was in high school i was a huge larry bird fan and i and i devoured
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:45.040]  his autobiography after he retired and he talked about how he he was in and if you search youtube
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:52.160]  for like uh larry bird trash talking he's like widely regarded as as both one of the greatest
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:56.960]  basketball players of all time but almost certainly the greatest trash talker of all time
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:03.040]  yeah and he said in his book that he did it because he felt he needed he'd be playing and
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.120]  he'd realize look at the other team's lineup and realize that there he knew in his heart there was
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.000]  nobody on their team who could cover him nobody who he really respected as his peer as a player
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.400]  like okay if he's playing the lakers and magic johnson's on the other team or he's playing the
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.720]  bulls and young michael jordan is on the other team and he could tell how good jordan was going
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:26.080]  to be sure or dr j you know any of those classic players sure he had no problem getting fired up
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:33.200]  but he's playing i don't know denver nuggets you know and it's like yeah you know who knows uh he
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.440]  he'd fire himself up by going over to the other bench before the game and picking out who's going
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:41.920]  to cover him and say like you better hope the cup hope they don't put you on me because i'm going
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:47.920]  to torch it and they just say that to fire himself up i i feel like you need to do something like
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:52.320]  that when you're on top you know and i don't think it's follow through he's embarrassing himself
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:59.360]  yeah so i don't think apple's gonna trash talk but they need to do something inside the locker room
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.640]  effectively you know like that's the other thing with sports is most players don't say things
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:08.320]  inflammatory because they don't want the other team to put the quote up on the chalkboard or
[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:12.720]  the whiteboard i guess they have now you know hey this guy on the other team said we can't pitch you
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:17.360]  know well how do you feel about it you know and it fires you up apple kind of needs to do that
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:20.640]  like these people say they're not you know developers say they're they're not getting
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:26.320]  value from the app store let's prove them wrong yeah and i think that's that's good for everybody
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:32.080]  yeah and then but my last the last thing on the rip-off story is just that so many people whenever
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:36.080]  these things come up say well what do you what do you expect apple to do even the richest company in
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:39.840]  the world there's if there's a hundred thousand new apps coming or updates coming through the
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:43.440]  app store every week and there's over a million apps in the app store how can they possibly
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:49.680]  compare every single app against every other one that's not how you would police it that that makes
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:21:00.880]  no sense it's you you start with the most popular apps right and so like if the 57,263rd most popular
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:10.080]  app gets ripped off that shouldn't happen there should be a good way for the the rightful developer
[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:16.800]  of that app 53,000 levels down in the popularity charts to register the complaint when they notice
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:21.680]  it and have it taken care of in a fair and judicious manner but in terms of like catching
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:26.960]  this stuff before it even happens starting with the most popular apps would be the way to go
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:33.360]  because who did why would you want to rip off the 53,000 most popular app right whereas maybe
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:39.920]  the most popular app number one maybe you'd want to rip off yeah there's a value in that that is
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:47.040]  tangible and real and obvious uh so that that would be my argument against why we should expect
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:54.320]  better from apple all right last segment i want to talk about sleep tracking now you have an app
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:22:01.280]  sleep plus plus merlin man speaking of merlin man uh he was on the show uh about a year ago and
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:05.840]  turned me on to sleep tracking and i don't know how you know this is typical of when merlin's on
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:10.800]  the show i have no idea how we got there and it seemed bizarre to me it just seemed again like
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.400]  with the breathe thing i don't know it doesn't seem like something i i go to sleep when i'm tired
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:20.720]  i wake up when i'm when i wake up yeah um merlin said i should i i guess i'd been having some sleep
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:26.720]  problems which is rare for me usually i sleep like a baby he said you should get uh sleep plus plus
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:35.360]  uh i got the sleep plus plus this was not you know a year ago i or watch os didn't have built-in
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:41.920]  sleep tracking but it no uh but sleep plus plus could track your sleep uh and there are other
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:49.280]  sleep tracking apps uh i enjoy i stuck with it i still do it to this day i enjoy it uh
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:54.960]  i do notice some trends i don't really have any sleep problems but i enjoy it uh i don't really
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:00.560]  understand how it works now and i need you i need you to explain explain it to me so you're asking
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.840]  like how watch os 7 sleep tracking well i start with how did how did it work how did sleep plus
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:14.960]  plus track my sleep before watch os 7 sure so the way so sleep plus plus originally i used to use
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:19.200]  do kind of like this thing where on the watch you would like start us you would say when you went to
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:24.000]  bed and say when you um woke up like you had to physically tap a button on the on the watch and
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.680]  that was because of a few if you did that it meant that i could access kind of they would have this
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:35.760]  power efficient way of showing me your motion during the night and i could use that to kind
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:41.120]  of infer roughly how well you slept and i knew the duration of your sleep because you've said
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:44.640]  you know i just went i went to bed i just i'm going to bed and you tap it when you wake up
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:50.080]  and that works well and probably in some ways gives you more accurate data but for most people
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:54.400]  they don't want to have the last thing they do before they go to bed is hitting a button on their
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:58.960]  watch and the first thing they do when they wake up is to hit another button so it doesn't really
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:04.320]  scale very well and so instead what eventually i did is i worked out a way to like an apple watch
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:11.360]  when it's attached to you attached to your wrist is always collecting a variety of sort of health
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:16.560]  and fitness metrics so it's always collecting your step count so it's trying to estimate essentially
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:21.040]  does it seem like you're walking and if you are walking you know how many steps have you taken
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:25.840]  it's also collecting your active calories which is what is shown in the red ring
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:32.800]  of your you know in the activity app and it's about every six minutes or so it'll take a heart
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:39.520]  rate reading assuming your wrist is still and is you know close enough like the watch is snug
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:44.000]  enough to your wrist that it can get a get a reading it'll record one about every six minutes
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:53.360]  and essentially what i did is i used those three metrics to be able to pretty accurately estimate
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:59.600]  when it seems like you're in bed and it's to seem like when you are awake and moving and you know
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:04.880]  a lot of that's just a bit of clever heuristics and looking at the data and you know for a while
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:11.120]  i had um the years of the time that i've been recording all these nights for myself using the
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:15.120]  old version where i was like manually starting and stopping and i could use that to kind of build my
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:20.800]  model um the sleepless plus is based on and i would use that you know i can use that data to
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:26.960]  is infer things about your night um i personally it's like as far as i can tell any app that
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:33.120]  tries to tell you like in the in very great detail the sleep stages you're in and all the kind of deep
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.240]  sleep analysis stuff based on just automatic sleep tracking on an apple watch like i'm a little
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:42.400]  suspect i don't really see that as something that's possible with what that data is but it's
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:49.680]  definitely possible to be able to identify when you're asleep and roughly are you sleeping well
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:54.560]  or not like are you restless or are you awake are you you know every time you get up to use the
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:57.920]  bathroom in the night you're going to take steps and so i can say oh it looks like you're taking
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.000]  steps clearly you're not you know you're not walking unless you're sleepwalking like you're
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:09.360]  not you're you're you're awake and so that's what sleep plus plus does to sort of create that model
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:13.760]  and to get the data and then once you have the data then it's just the fun part of showing it
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.400]  in ways that is useful trying to show you trends trying to give you a sense of your habits and your
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:26.000]  patterns because sleep is kind of a weird health metric because you can't change it as easily as
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.760]  you can for a lot of things like if you're trying to close your exercise ring you can go for a walk
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:37.200]  you if you're trying to hit 10 000 steps you can go for a walk you can do things in a proactive way
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:42.240]  but like saying telling someone you're not sleeping enough like there's there's things they
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.760]  could do to influence that but if they're a new boy like if they're a new parent like what are
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:52.800]  we gonna do like i'm sorry like i i have a newborn who wakes me up every two hours yes i'm sleep
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:58.320]  deprived and like i can measure that for you but mostly what i can do is just give you a sense of
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:02.320]  when you wake up in the morning and you're like i am a wreck like why am i and you look at the
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.400]  thing and it's like yeah that's because you slept three hours last night like that's a useful bit of
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:11.200]  information that i can at least affirm you with but you know sleep tracking is weird in that way
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:17.680]  and i think that has led to why apple's implementation of sleep tracking is so weird so
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.760]  that's a good example to me of like the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:29.920]  which i guess the line is usually kind of fuzzy you know where where does an algorithm turn into
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:37.520]  a heuristic but like inferring when you sleep from a bunch of data that isn't really directly
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:44.240]  measuring sleep is you know that that's a heuristic where you could be wrong um yeah i
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.400]  would have never used it in the first place if i had to start and stop it automatically sure it's
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.480]  it's just i just wouldn't remember to do it and it's like you know and i wouldn't i wouldn't
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:56.880]  remember i don't know which end of the sleep i'd be less likely to remember i guess at some point
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:02.240]  during the day i'd remember oh i woke up and i guess i could go back but yeah especially the
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:06.880]  going to sleep part it's like the whole point of going to sleep is oh i'm fading off here you know
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.880]  i'm yeah falling asleep i better turn out the to put the ipad down and just close my eyes it's
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:21.840]  like i don't remember anything um so i i you know that i use the app because i've sent you feedback
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:30.160]  over the last year including features my quotes were my quotes were wrong in one point i
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:38.320]  miscapitalized a word i believe well and the big one was uh uh up till four in the morning you
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:43.760]  would get it would classify like if i went if i fell asleep at three in the morning yeah it would
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:50.560]  count as last you know wouldn't say technically by the by the book that's uh tuesday or wednesday
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:57.600]  morning but you would classify it as tuesday night and i yeah i would write you and complain
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:04.400]  when i went to bed at like 415 that i was yeah being put into the wrong my cutoff for the
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:09.040]  previous night's cut like was it was two was two or it was apparently not generous enough
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:15.520]  that in my mind people falling asleep at 415 are not considering that the night before sleep but
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.760]  apparently i was wrong on that one
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:28.320]  uh so i've i've been a big fan but what now i watch os 7 officially supports sleep tracking
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:36.800]  yeah at the system level how what is new from the system level and what's new from you for you as
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:43.920]  is this conducive to to sleep plus plus or is this sort of uh sleep plus plus has sort of been
[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:49.760]  sherlocked so that question is the easier one so sleep plus plus is the downloads have been up
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:54.800]  since watch os 7 came out so it's clearly not like if it's sherlock it's sherlock in the best
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:59.200]  way possible that is involving more people downloading it where it's if apple if anything
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:04.240]  apple has created awareness that sleep tracking is a thing you want to use your watch for which
[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:08.560]  previously i had to convince people that that was possible and that they should try and like charge
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:13.120]  your watch when you're showering so that you can wear it overnight like i had to kind of do that
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.040]  kind of messaging and convince people that like well i charge my watch overnight if i don't charge
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:21.040]  it overnight when my when am i ever going to have my watch charged and right you've quickly realized
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:23.600]  that if you charge it like when you're getting ready in the morning and before you're getting
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:30.480]  ready for bed it's very easy to typically like for a normal person to have um your watch charged but
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:36.560]  i think what's apple doing it is just what's tricky about it is they're i think they're
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:44.000]  limited by the battery life of the apple watch and the level of analysis in detail they can pull out
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.440]  of you while you're sleeping that for all their fit like their fancy algorithms and for all they're
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:54.480]  trying to do like their machine learning and it's you know sure second to none but the reality is
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:31:01.440]  they're still only collecting motion data heart rate every six sec every six minutes and that's
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.600]  it like if you imagine the sensors that are active during the night and i suppose they could potentially
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:11.040]  be using the microphone i'm not sure about that but um there's there's a limit to what they can
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:17.120]  do with that and so i there they i think decided early on it seems or at least at this point is
[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:22.640]  they're not going down the road of clinical analysis of your sleep they're not trying to
[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:29.280]  um so in my in my development work for sleepless plus for a while i was wearing a variety of like
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:32.560]  dedicated more dedicated sleep tracking devices and there are ones that do
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:37.520]  continuous heart rate monitoring throughout the night and so this is you know essentially the
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:42.160]  mode that your watch is in when you're running a workout it's running a mode like that continuously
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:47.280]  and so it's having it's tracking your heart rate you know multiple times per second and if with
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:51.120]  that kind of data if you have continuous heart rate data you can really start to get into the
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:56.080]  weeds potentially about sleep stages and you know rems rem sleep has a different heart rate
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:32:02.640]  and respiratory rate um than slow wave sleep or then light sleep or they can very easily tell when
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:08.560]  you're awake and when you're asleep because motion is a pretty bad metric for awake and asleep because
[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:12.080]  if you're lying in bed reading and especially if you're reading on something like an ipad where you
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:16.480]  don't have to move your wrist to turn the page like you could very easily be lying in bed
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:21.840]  completely still um but be completely awake and there's no way for the watch to know that other
[02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:26.320]  than heart rate because your heart rate goes down when you fall asleep right um and i think because
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:30.960]  apple doesn't want it they don't have the battery budget to run the heart rate data all night long
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:37.440]  they are limited in kind of mostly they can just do the kind of things i do in sleepless plus
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:42.720]  where they can say you went to it seems like you slept about this long and you were generally
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.760]  asleep in ways that we can be confident about about this often and i think that's meant that
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:53.280]  they instead rather than being a clinical approach with sleep tracking they're going the behavioral
[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:57.920]  model for sleep tracking and they're just trying to do all the things that they can say it's like
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:03.120]  we're going to influence you can you know make good make good choices to help you wind down and
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:07.360]  kick off this shortcut an hour you know it's now it's time for wind down and you'll get a little
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:13.600]  like tap on your wrist and say hey you said you wanted to go to bed at 10 o'clock it's 9 5 9 30
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:19.600]  maybe you should you know calm down would you like to listen to some calm music like like they're
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:25.120]  going down that road where it's it's very much like this behavioral modification version of sleep
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.680]  tracking which i think makes sense because of the data they have and because of what they could show
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:34.400]  you they can't they don't like they don't over promise and say that it's a really powerful sleep
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:38.560]  tracker because it isn't there are better sleep trackers out there if you actually are like if
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:43.520]  you have sleep apnea and need to track your sleep in great detail the apple watch is not the device
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.240]  for you but what they're saying is the sleep hopefully the apple watch ends with sleep tracking
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:55.440]  on the apple watch and watch os 7 it'll encourage you to sleep more and to have better sleep sort of
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:01.120]  patterns and hygiene that you're going to turn off your phone earlier and you're going to go to bed
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:05.920]  at a more consistent time which are the actual changes that you can actually make to your sleep
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:10.320]  you know you can't change if your kid wakes you up in the night but you can certainly like turn
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:14.880]  off the turn off your phone an hour before you go to bed and not just like stay up late reading
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:19.600]  twitter or watching movies like that's a choice that you can make and so they can encourage you
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:24.560]  there but like and then for the actual data perspective like my model gets a little bit
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:29.520]  better because now they're also recording the apple watch records when it thinks i'm asleep
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:37.280]  and so that is a confirmation or a adjustment that i can feed into my model because if i didn't think
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.520]  you were awake but the apple watch does think you're awake there's a very good chance they're
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:47.920]  right and i'm wrong because they're operating at a much lower level even if not with necessarily like
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:52.160]  way more data they have they definitely have a better amount of data and certainly you know
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.400]  better machine learning and you know a giant team of data scientists i'm sure who's like finally
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:00.800]  tuned their model i'm just like a guy in my basement writing codes so you know you gotta
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:06.720]  imagine their data is better than mine so my model got better in watch os 7 but for people who just
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.560]  want to track their trends and get a sense of like when do i go to bed on tuesday nights
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:14.800]  like the health app is like hopeless for that kind of stuff and so sleepless plus
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:20.720]  is an app that is useful for everybody even if they do have watch os 7 and use the system sleep
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:25.520]  tracking right like maybe tuesday nights is your basketball league line or your volleyball and you
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.000]  exercise it but it's you know it's for working professionals and you play late games and you
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.320]  you're exercising late in the day and oh wow look at that i every tuesday night i actually
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:41.760]  i wind up sleeping earlier because i did this exercise even though it was later at night or
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.320]  maybe vice versa maybe you come home and you're excited because you were you know one way or the
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:51.840]  other you might notice a trend um yeah yeah i don't know why i kept up with it i honestly i
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:36:00.160]  enjoy it and uh you know i i it it's just interesting to me and i did notice some trends
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:04.960]  you know i i don't know if it's because of it i i have been going to bed earlier and i'm looking
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:12.000]  at my last seven days i'm nowhere close to 4 a.m so sure that's good i don't need to like undo the
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.840]  john grouper feature where i think i pushed that to 6 a.m no but uh it is interesting and i'm glad
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:24.160]  to hear it you know that it's like to raise the awareness um i find it fascinating to do it
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.760]  uh and i think like with all of the apple watch sensors i'm not sure any one of them
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:37.200]  is more accurate than a dedicated sensor right like the pedometer aspect is pretty close
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:44.000]  in my opinion like the times where i've actually like like at disney world or something like i
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.080]  haven't done it in years because it's a guy just it was too accurate but like where you could go
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:54.080]  on google maps and measure a long walk yeah and see what the watch said the watch was accurate
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:59.200]  enough where i i don't know that any kind of pedometer would be more accurate but like for all
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:05.760]  most of the sensors sure you're going to get a more accurate blood oxygen level from a dedicated
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:11.600]  blood oxygen sensor than the one on the watch but it's good to have it on the watch right and
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:17.840]  i think with that it's what the value of the sensors on the apple watch is they're sort of
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:21.440]  the fact that they're always happening in the background and you don't have to think about it
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.000]  you don't have to go and look and like if you had a blood oxygen sensor you could have one of
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.040]  those little like finger clippy things that you picked up at cvs pharmacy like you'd have to go
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:36.560]  and remember to use it regularly for that data to be useful whereas what the apple watch is doing
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:40.640]  is it's always it's just always on in the background there's like this ephemeral data
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:46.960]  collection that you can then go back and look at and that's i think where it becomes really
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:51.280]  powerful it isn't that it's the best at any one of those things necessarily like i think of you
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:56.320]  know in the way that apple would say that they have the best camera in the world like they would
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:59.280]  like i mean that's a comment that they would say and they really mean it like when they say that
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:02.880]  they're the best camera company in the world like they mean it right and i don't think they would
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.720]  say that they are the best sleep tracker in the world and if they do they're being a bit
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:12.240]  disingenuous because a dedicated you know a device that is doing huge amounts of things
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:16.080]  and it's probably like you know the size of a small ipad that you have to like strap to your
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.200]  head like that's probably going to be able to get more data out of it but it's a good device it can
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.880]  give you enough data to encourage behavioral change and to give you awareness because i think
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.080]  to what you're saying it's like you don't know why you do it but you still kept up with it with sleep
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:35.360]  tracking it's i what i've seen time and time again from customers is it's just making something making
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:39.440]  you aware of something that you otherwise would never be aware of because you're never going to
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.200]  like write down every morning when you wake up when did i go to bed when did i wake up and just
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:48.000]  keep track of it like you're never going to do that so it's never going to be a data that you can
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.760]  be aware of and so once it's something that is measurable and is measurable in a way that is
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.320]  ephemeral that you don't have to do any work for you just if all you have to the only work you have
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:01.440]  to do to be to track your sleep with sleep with a apple watch is make sure that it's charged before
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:06.800]  you go to sleep and you just get into a few habits with that of charging it and you'll be fine yeah
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:11.840]  and once you've done that now that data is there and you don't have to check in on it all the time
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.480]  like if you didn't open sleep plus plus for you know three weeks and then you open it again i'll
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:20.800]  still have all the data that has been collected during that period and it's available to you and
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:26.240]  if you're curious about it or you just it becomes a thing that you're aware of and it helps you make
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:31.040]  choices that are like there's like it's not like it's punitive but like if you don't get a lot of
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:36.000]  sleep you know the the line in sleepless plus that was that night will turn you know a subtle shade
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:41.680]  of red and it'll be like hey maybe that wasn't so good and it's not going to be mean about it like
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:45.760]  it but it's just saying hey that's a choice you know like a situation you found yourself in
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.240]  and it could be better and that's because you don't have to think about it don't need three
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.880]  slices of pepperoni pizza at 12 30. yeah it's like i do that i will say the other thing i got
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:03.840]  confused about upgrading to i watch os 7 which i did by starting with this new review unit watch
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.800]  was yeah i went through like i said i set up the defaults and the def you know i was interested in
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.160]  the sleep tracking feature and they were like you want to track your sleep and it's like okay and
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:17.280]  it's like what time do you usually go to bed and you put it in and then all of a sudden without
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:22.960]  really asking for it i was set up with the hey it's an hour from now you want to go to bed you
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.680]  want to start winding down and it like locks your phone out and it's like i i don't want this i find
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:33.600]  it patronizing i'm a grown man i don't need to be told to go to bed and again if you like the
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:38.240]  feature maybe you know maybe you do need it maybe you get distracted and you're you know you play
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:42.880]  video games late at night and it's helpful for you to have your watch say hey maybe you should
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:46.960]  go to bed and you lost track of time i'm not saying you know i don't want to be too judgmental
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:52.720]  about it but i hate the feature sure um but i also feel like part of that is apple's desire to save
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.720]  battery life because you go into that sleep mode on the new on watch os 7 and it turns the always
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.800]  on display off and you have to tap it to see something and you can see why apple as a company
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:10.560]  that wants to both encourage people who are interested to wear their watch all night but also
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:15.760]  doesn't want people to feel like now they don't know when to charge it to encourage them to use a
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:22.160]  mode where the screen goes completely off even with a quote unquote always on display yeah and
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:27.120]  i think it's that sleep like mode i mean previously i've always had to just put it in like i got into
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.840]  the habit i always flipped my watch into theater mode right like when i got into bed because that
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.400]  was just the way you had to do it before right um but like what's weird with the sleep mode is
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:43.200]  the way that apple tries to schedule it and have it be this automatic thing where like i find it
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.160]  kind of annoying where like it also it turns off the sleep mode in the morning based on the time
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:53.520]  that you've said that you typically wake up yeah and i've definitely had times when i've like
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:58.320]  you know like i've i'm sleeping in for whatever reason like i went to bed late or i was up in the
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:04.480]  night with the kid or whatever it is and i'm i feel like i've been woken up by the bright light
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:09.680]  of the always you know like yeah my new apple watch has a very bright always on display which
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:13.040]  they talked all about it in the thing like it's twice as bright or three times as bright or
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:18.400]  whatever it is like that's they are true because in a dark room it has woken me up and it's like
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:23.360]  that is not i did not set an alarm i did not want this bright blaring light to be like you know i'm
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:29.120]  from my wrist as i'm like lying you know my arms next to me on the pillow like and so i i wish that
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:34.880]  wasn't they didn't quite go down that road of it being so scheduled and so like it's like no when
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:39.840]  i go to bed i'll hit the button i'm in a dark room it's going to be very obvious that i have not put
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  it in sleep mode yet and in the morning when i wake up it's going to be very obvious when i
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:49.280]  look for the time and my screen is black and raise turning my wrist it still is black i'm going to
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:52.960]  remember to turn off sleep mode and so i think that's like i've turned almost all of that off
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:57.520]  at this point for myself like i had it on just so i'd know how it worked but for myself i've
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:01.200]  turned it all off and i just manually put it in sleep mode and manually take it out of sleep mode
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.840]  in the morning yeah that's what i do too and the only thing i automate is i automate do not disturb
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:10.240]  which is what i've been doing ever since it was a feature what i say just don't send me notifications
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:16.560]  between this hour and that hour but then other than that i i manage it manually um yeah yeah and
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:22.960]  god help you i mean the worst only thing worse than your always on series 6 bright display waking you
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:29.200]  up in the middle of night is waking up whoever you are in bed with yes that would it's it's not what
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:35.040]  you want right why is there a b why is there this beaming like beacon of light stuck in our bed this
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:40.160]  is not this is this is not sustainable it is it is an inner but it's it's always like be careful
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:44.320]  what you wish for it's like i've been clamoring for an always-on display since the very first
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:49.360]  watch i spent an embarrassing amount of my series zero watch review complaining about the fact that
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:54.480]  the display isn't always on and i thought it was nothing but upside once they get the battery life
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:44:00.160]  to the point and then i went to bed with a very bright watch and i was like oh there is a downside
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:06.400]  yeah yeah all right for sure well you have been extremely generous with your time in an
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:12.000]  extraordinarily busy week uh and it was but what a great time to have you on the show for the first
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.200]  time david uh i really appreciate it uh so your apps what i mean 59 apps we can't talk about all
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.080]  of them but there's widget smith and watch smith and sleep plus plus which we've mentioned any
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.640]  other apps you want to toss out there i think the only other app that i think is like that's been
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:33.360]  sort of a standby for me for many years is pedometer plus plus which is my step counting
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:38.240]  app and i feel like those four widget smith watch smith sleep sleep plus plus and parameter plus
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:42.320]  plus that's like that's my business at this point those are the ones that have survived out of the
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:46.880]  59 yeah you know what and speaking about you know you said how you did a calendar app and that
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:53.200]  helped you with widget smith being so it hooked into the health system had to have been a huge
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:59.760]  leg up because that's just not not apple's fault it is complicated because it has to be complicated
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:08.560]  for privacy reasons alone right yes it is it is one of the more sort of convoluted systems for
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:15.680]  a good reason and i think it's they do a really good job of making it usable but also yeah there
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.480]  are a lot of weird edge cases in the health system that i've spent a lot of time and a lot of gray
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:30.000]  hairs on right with pedometer plus and gray hairs plus plus yeah podcast wise you do have a podcast
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:36.560]  with marco armand under the radar which you can you can search for in your podcast app of choice
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:44.400]  which is probably overcast i hope so and it will probably show up as the number one hit and not
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:51.360]  number two from an app called under the or a podcast called under the radar color podcasts
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:58.560]  yeah uh thank you so much for being here what else oh of course twitter you are underscore
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:06.560]  david smith yeah where the underscore is an actual underscore yeah um it reminds have you ever seen
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:15.040]  there's an old uh uh i think it was mcswiney's internet tendencies where there's like 10 worst
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:20.160]  email addresses in history to read over the phone oh i think i've seen this kind of thing yeah where
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:25.680]  it's certain certain punctuations and things or is it actually a word or is it right it's a mixture
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:32.800]  of like you know u-n-d-e-r-s-c-o-r-e yeah underscore but then you know anyway i'll put
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:39.200]  it in show notes i swear it occurred to me whether whether or not your underscore in underscore
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:45.280]  david smith is an underscore or the the word but yeah people will find you anyway thank you so much
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:47:03.040]  it has been a pleasure
