[00:00.000 --> 00:06.360]  So, before I came down here to the old podcast dungeon, Amy asked me, she goes, who's on
[00:06.360 --> 00:07.360]  your show this week?
[00:07.360 --> 00:08.360]  And I said, Moltz.
[00:08.360 --> 00:11.360]  And she goes, ugh.
[00:11.360 --> 00:16.640]  And I said, I just tell her I said hi to, I gave her a look and she laughed, you know,
[00:16.640 --> 00:18.280]  she just gave that great Amy laugh.
[00:18.280 --> 00:22.760]  And she goes, honestly, I don't know why I did that, I love Moltz.
[00:22.760 --> 00:25.480]  She goes, actually, of all the boring people you have on your show, Moltz is one of the
[00:25.480 --> 00:27.480]  few I like to hang out with.
[00:27.480 --> 00:33.920]  She doesn't want to listen to me talk, that's all.
[00:33.920 --> 00:35.320]  It was a very funny reaction.
[00:35.320 --> 00:39.640]  But you know, it was just like, listen to me talk for like two hours or whatever.
[00:39.640 --> 00:45.040]  There's literally nobody who I could say who's on my show that she wouldn't go, let's give
[00:45.040 --> 00:49.400]  that reaction to.
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.960]  I bet she wouldn't do it to serenity.
[00:50.960 --> 00:52.600]  No, no, probably not.
[00:52.600 --> 00:57.720]  And you know, maybe not if I had somehow got Rian Johnson back on the show.
[00:57.720 --> 00:58.720]  Yeah, maybe.
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.720]  Yeah.
[00:59.720 --> 01:03.160]  That's still kind of amazing.
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.160]  Isn't that still kind of amazing?
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.960]  That's still really amazing.
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.280]  I tell people, I'm sometimes on a podcast that Rian Johnson was on.
[01:11.280 --> 01:12.280]  Right.
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.800]  No, no, you know, I wasn't at the same time as he was.
[01:16.800 --> 01:17.800]  Now I've mentioned it.
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.400]  Now I have to put it in the show notes and I have to dig it up.
[01:20.400 --> 01:27.680]  I'm so I'm getting bad at just crossing things off my to do list.
[01:27.680 --> 01:33.960]  Do you find that you're more organized or less organized or the same as when you were
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  younger?
[01:34.960 --> 01:38.040]  Probably about the same, which is not great.
[01:38.040 --> 01:39.720]  I suspect I'm getting worse.
[01:39.720 --> 01:46.200]  Like I've been meaning to put those old episodes from when I was on the mule, quote unquote,
[01:46.200 --> 01:49.520]  network into my RSS feed for the show so that they're there.
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.760]  Because I have them all.
[01:50.760 --> 01:51.800]  They're not lost.
[01:51.800 --> 01:57.200]  And you can get them now at the Internet Archive, which is such a wonderful resource.
[01:57.200 --> 01:59.200]  But right now, it's you know, they're not really there.
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.000]  So I've had I'm so proud of it.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.360]  I had Rian Johnson on my podcast.
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.460]  And right now that episode at the peak, you can't get that one.
[02:08.460 --> 02:09.460]  Not through the feed.
[02:09.460 --> 02:11.000]  You have to go to the Internet Archive.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  Okay.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.740]  I really ought to fix that.
[02:15.740 --> 02:18.460]  That would be way I would think that would be one that people would want to hear.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.440]  The first one with me on it.
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.520]  Don't worry about that.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.040]  I don't know.
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.520]  I just I think I'm just rocketing to I don't you know, I don't think I've had a shortage
[02:32.520 --> 02:40.980]  of crotchet enos, but I just feel like I'm getting angry old man at a frightening clip.
[02:40.980 --> 02:43.640]  Like I today I had to go to the bank.
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.380]  And during fireball is a LLC.
[02:48.380 --> 02:55.760]  And every couple of weeks, I write a check to myself, and it's all a little bit confusing.
[02:55.760 --> 03:01.840]  Because I'm signing a check, john Gruber to john Gruber, and then endorsing it on the
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.600]  back as john Gruber and it also feels a little it all feels a little shady.
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.600]  You know what I mean?
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.560]  Like it just seems like I don't even know what check kiting is, but it seems like maybe
[03:11.560 --> 03:17.000]  that's it.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.560]  And it it took like 15 minutes.
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.960]  It's like I had to wait in the line or as I say, you have to do you do you do this like
[03:24.960 --> 03:29.460]  you have to do this physically and I have to go I do because my bank has like a stupid
[03:29.460 --> 03:32.520]  small limit on what you can deposit electronically.
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.800]  Like I can't we can't deposit more than like a $500 check or a $300 check electronically.
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.360]  I have to so really what the long story short is I should find a new bank is what I should
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  do.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.760]  Yeah.
[03:46.760 --> 03:48.280]  It also seems weird.
[03:48.280 --> 03:49.600]  And maybe there is a better way.
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.300]  Maybe I'm just a big dummy that you know that there should be you know, my business account
[03:53.300 --> 03:57.220]  and my personal account are at the same bank and maybe there's a better way than writing
[03:57.220 --> 03:58.220]  a check.
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.220]  I don't know.
[03:59.220 --> 04:03.000]  I guess I am a sole proprietor.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.240]  So I just you know, it all pretty much almost goes into the same pot.
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.480]  I mean, I have separate accounts, but it doesn't really really matter as much for that situation.
[04:13.480 --> 04:21.080]  But but like even my credit union has a great iOS app and they don't you know, let me like
[04:21.080 --> 04:28.000]  I've deposited checks of like, man, a lot vast sums of money.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  I don't know.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  Yeah, sure.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.880]  You know, it just seems not that much but yes, it just seems like it would I gotta look
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  into it.
[04:34.880 --> 04:37.880]  I'm just it but it's just one other one of those items on my to do list like figure out
[04:37.880 --> 04:41.720]  how to do banking better and it's like just vague enough that it never really feels like
[04:41.720 --> 04:45.440]  today's the day where I'm gonna spend all day banking.
[04:45.440 --> 04:46.440]  Yeah.
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.480]  But that's that's always the thing with with the stuff that sticks down around the bottom
[04:49.480 --> 04:56.640]  of the list is like that stuff tends to just never get done right.
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.640]  What else is new?
[04:57.640 --> 05:00.080]  You got your home pun?
[05:00.080 --> 05:07.800]  I did not order a home but I'm waiting to hear I my my use case is pretty specific for
[05:07.800 --> 05:13.800]  it I think cuz I don't I don't picture I don't know we don't sit in the living room and listen
[05:13.800 --> 05:20.380]  to music that much right maybe we would if we had one but we I actually listen to music
[05:20.380 --> 05:26.600]  mostly in the kitchen and I've already got a sonos in the kitchen which I like and my
[05:26.600 --> 05:32.200]  so my use case for the thing is probably like more like a like a soundbar for the for the
[05:32.200 --> 05:37.680]  TV so I don't know that works right that's well see that's the thing I mean right now
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.120]  and I'm not sure that it is because it's just AirPlay one right and I don't really trust
[05:42.120 --> 05:48.940]  AirPlay one very much so I've not had a great experience with AirPlay one right like that's
[05:48.940 --> 05:56.580]  one of the it's it's an interesting product and I feel like the the ways that everybody
[05:56.580 --> 06:03.120]  is the complaints that everybody has about it are it's it just feels like we're on a
[06:03.120 --> 06:07.520]  merry-go-round it's the same thing every time Apple releases any product right like it doesn't
[06:07.520 --> 06:17.520]  have any input other than AirPlay so you can talk to it and it'll if you have Apple music
[06:17.520 --> 06:23.740]  it'll play the music from the your cloud and otherwise you can AirPlay to it it's an AirPlay
[06:23.740 --> 06:31.080]  speaker and that's it there is no line in as as the autofiles would say and people some
[06:31.080 --> 06:37.640]  people seem irrationally angry about that it but there are other products that have line
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.180]  in you know so I don't know I'm not quite sure why people are angry and it dropping
[06:43.180 --> 06:48.480]  everything except the wireless over-the-air connection feels like a very Apple thing to
[06:48.480 --> 06:54.600]  do yeah definitely I could definitely that's not I mean I wouldn't that's not something
[06:54.600 --> 06:58.080]  like where do you I don't know I guess you could put you could put a physical line from
[06:58.080 --> 07:03.800]  your TV or something in right I mean you're not you're not gonna hook up your iPhone right
[07:03.800 --> 07:12.080]  for us so I ordered one and it was funny because I didn't know if it was gonna be like a midnight
[07:12.080 --> 07:18.160]  thing they just said it was going on sale Friday and so I thought maybe like the phone
[07:18.160 --> 07:23.080]  it would have to be at like 3 a.m. Eastern midnight Pacific time so I stayed up and I
[07:23.080 --> 07:31.120]  was very tired and it nothing happened you know there was no way to buy and I waited
[07:31.120 --> 07:35.800]  like 20 minutes and I was it was I mean like there I really didn't have a choice I could
[07:35.800 --> 07:41.020]  either like go upstairs and go to bed and fall asleep or I would fall asleep right there
[07:41.020 --> 07:47.560]  on the couch because lights were going out woke up in the morning and it was on sale
[07:47.560 --> 07:52.160]  and doesn't seem like there's any kind of shortages or anything no it's still delivery
[07:52.160 --> 07:58.920]  February 9th yeah which I don't think is necessarily a sign of poor sales I think that because
[07:58.920 --> 08:05.440]  all the rumors I had heard from multiple little birdies were that the entire holdup versus
[08:05.440 --> 08:11.760]  you know why it was late from last instead of shipping as promised and questions a promise
[08:11.760 --> 08:18.000]  but as intended before the end of the calendar year 2017 was software quote-unquote software
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.720]  I don't know if it was if it's the software on the that runs on the in the HomePod I don't
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.280]  know if it's the software and the servers that connects you know makes all the Apple
[08:28.280 --> 08:33.560]  music stuff work just software but that make you know that would explain why the hardware
[08:33.560 --> 08:43.240]  is shipping in quantity yeah and I don't I mean right now I don't expect it to be that
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.960]  sought after right right I mean because it does seem like you know it's a fairly expensive
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.440]  device and particularly for the category and it seems like like for me it's something that
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.960]  you might want to read a few reviews of before you pull the trigger on yeah I I think it's
[08:55.960 --> 09:02.600]  funny Rene was on the last episode and we talked about it I do think it's funny I mean
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.000]  even the name AirPod and HomePod I'm probably going to slip up and call the damn thing AirPod
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.160]  twice during the show but I think they're obviously intended as siblings right one is
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.040]  the little little guys that go in your ears and one you know sits on your countertop or
[09:19.040 --> 09:27.560]  your tabletop but they're so similar in spirit and I kind of feel like the way that like
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.360]  when AirPods first came out now they were hard to get they were they were very you know
[09:32.360 --> 09:37.720]  were delayed and weren't available widely available but I feel like you see them more
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.460]  and more of these days and I just feel like that's the sort of that's the sort of uptake
[09:41.460 --> 09:46.880]  I if HomePod is successful and and I think that's what's interesting about is to me it's
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.440]  a huge F I really this is a very hard to predict it's very hard for me to predict how this is
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.040]  going to do but if it is a hit I don't think it'll be an instant hit I think it'll be the
[09:56.040 --> 10:01.800]  sort of thing where somebody gets it and then you're over at their house and you hear it
[10:01.800 --> 10:08.960]  and you see how easy you know it's fun to just tell it you know hey dingus play whatever
[10:08.960 --> 10:17.840]  and it works that that's how it was with TiVo for me and Amy like I remember when I first
[10:17.840 --> 10:23.320]  went to work at barebone software back in 2000 Rich Siegel invited us to his house for
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.840]  dinner because we just moved from Philadelphia up to Massachusetts went to his house and
[10:27.840 --> 10:31.640]  I specifically remember must have been the fall because the Yankees were in the playoffs
[10:31.640 --> 10:37.160]  and there was so we watched a bit of baseball but we were blown away by TiVo we were like
[10:37.160 --> 10:42.200]  holy cow I got heard of it I had a new basic idea and you could fast forward commercials
[10:42.200 --> 10:47.440]  and pause it whatever but once you saw it it's like oh my god this is nothing like what
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.740]  I like a VCR right and we went out the next morning and bought a TiVo like I feel like
[10:52.740 --> 10:57.280]  HomePod could be like that for some people yeah yeah there's certain I mean there's certain
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.480]  things that you kind of just have to get we were talking about before that when the shuffle
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.820]  came out we had our friend Albert over for dinner and we were sitting around talking
[11:08.820 --> 11:12.080]  and Karen said something derogatory about the shuffle it's like she just thought it
[11:12.080 --> 11:15.680]  was stupid and we had some music playing and he said he's like well it's just you know
[11:15.680 --> 11:18.500]  plays this place a shuffle list and he's just like yeah I think that's dumb that's all that's
[11:18.500 --> 11:24.440]  all it does and she's and he said what are you playing right now oh yeah it's a shuffle
[11:24.440 --> 11:35.800]  list and that's almost always what we play right and so I got a shovel it is funny too
[11:35.800 --> 11:42.720]  it's because when we were kids everything you couldn't shuffle there was no way to show
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.080]  yeah everything was you had to hit the fast forward button on the tape thing to go to
[11:47.080 --> 11:54.240]  the next song right which would chew up your tape half the time right so I you know I can
[11:54.240 --> 12:02.360]  spend opening a thing of the show complaining that I spent five minutes at a bank but meanwhile
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.860]  I spent my entire youth rewinding and fast-forwarding cassette tapes to listen to music and never
[12:08.860 --> 12:13.840]  thought twice about it did you ever have eight track no I never had eight track we had a
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.360]  car we had one car that had eight track in it briefly I think I think it like broke down
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.280]  really quickly and and we ended up not having it for more than like a year or something
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.160]  like that and I just I don't even know how that worked but it was just it was very strange
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.080]  like it was I think it was yeah I guess it was just eight eight separate it was like
[12:31.080 --> 12:37.080]  tape but it was eight separate tracks at once and you could just flip between songs that's
[12:37.080 --> 12:44.380]  what I just pick up a song midway through depending on I I isn't isn't it the case too
[12:44.380 --> 12:48.720]  that a track was had much higher fidelity than cassette tapes I think it might have
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.760]  yeah I mean the name alone makes it seem like it did but and and cuz cassette tapes were
[12:53.760 --> 13:00.280]  just terrible just absolutely dreadful technology they were they didn't have they didn't sound
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.880]  great they were you had to rewind and fast-forward them they would you could make your own you
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.480]  could make your own playlist right exactly that was the that was the hook I was the thing
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.040]  to get about that you know that was like you know it created a whole I've been creating
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.540]  a play a playlist creating a mixtape for somebody that was a whole thing I used to I used to
[13:19.540 --> 13:26.500]  have I'd be listening to the radio and I would have a tape in my player ready to go and then
[13:26.500 --> 13:31.760]  every time it got to the end of a song I would move my hand over just in case the next song
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.040]  was a good one and then I if it was I would hit record and want to get it you know and
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.040]  so I had these tapes where I had all this music I'd taped off FM radio and the beginning
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.320]  of every song is sort of like that that like Oh cut off either cut off or like the cross
[13:48.320 --> 13:59.940]  fade between songs you know like and those are the days those were the days that's what
[13:59.940 --> 14:08.280]  kids boy boy are we getting old all right let me take a break here and thank thank our

[15:17.840 --> 15:25.680]  after either before or after a workout and egg white protein in particular is stands
[15:25.680 --> 15:33.280]  out as an exceptional source of protein very easy for your body to absorb I've had a couple
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.440]  of these I like them a lot I didn't know what dates tasted like I don't remember if I've
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.480]  ever eaten dates and so these are great dates are great dates are amazing they're really
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.600]  good really really good so you get the convenience of a bar where you just look oh you don't
[15:49.600 --> 15:52.960]  have to cook anything you just open it up and eat it but it tastes really great and
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.400]  it's not like you're eating like a candy bar this is not junk food there's no added sugar
[15:57.400 --> 16:04.440]  like I said you can get 25% off your first order that's a lot you can save a lot of money
[16:04.440 --> 16:12.120]  go to our x bar dot com slash talk show and enter that code talk show at checkout to save
[16:12.120 --> 16:23.200]  25% really excited about the sponsor I find you buy a lot of stuff online I buy so much
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.520]  we don't it's like it's gotten to the point Amy and I went shopping last weekend and we
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.000]  were like you know what when's the last time we went shopping together like just browsing
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.720]  oh yeah like you just don't do it well yeah we certainly don't I mean we don't do it together
[16:37.720 --> 16:44.960]  anymore right it's like too much credit no you go do that I gotta go do this other thing
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.080]  I don't know how picky they're gonna be I'm gonna the I'm supposed to tell you what my
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.360]  favorite rx bar that I've tried so far I haven't tried all 11 but I will tell you that the
[16:52.360 --> 16:58.340]  one I like the best so far is chocolate sea salt I love chocolate and salt go with so
[16:58.340 --> 17:02.720]  well together yeah yeah I don't know I don't know when I found out that dates were dates
[17:02.720 --> 17:05.640]  like I mean I would have thought for years that dates oh god I don't want to get a date
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.160]  that's not terrible yeah yeah and then I think we get this cereal this some like nut crunch
[17:11.160 --> 17:15.960]  thing that had dates and I was like man these are really good I don't I don't know where
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.280]  I got the idea I got the idea that they were like prunes or something right well they're
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.480]  dried but that's but it's well yeah and the only other thing I remember about dates of
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.760]  course is the great scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark oh yeah yeah sure maybe that I wonder
[17:31.760 --> 17:37.680]  if that had a bad effect on I think date sales I think it might have poisoned my brain for
[17:37.680 --> 17:43.400]  those of you who don't recall there's there's a monkey bedeviling Indiana Jones throughout
[17:43.400 --> 17:48.880]  the movie and an assassin comes in to kill Indiana Jones and pour some poison on some
[17:48.880 --> 17:55.600]  dates spoiler alert yeah and then a monkey eats a date and I'll leave the pun up to your
[17:55.600 --> 18:04.120]  imagination anyway dates amazing file that under 40 some years of wasted opportunity
[18:04.120 --> 18:12.280]  it's true like how much stuff else out there that I'm supposed to have been eating for
[18:12.280 --> 18:18.120]  the last 30 years that I just have filed away as something I don't like I don't know there's
[18:18.120 --> 18:22.800]  a few things I mean I think there's a few things that I don't like that I but I definitely
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.480]  know I don't like them yeah like I've tried them I've tried them recently I don't think
[18:27.480 --> 18:33.780]  I don't think there's a thing that I've had for ever I'm not crazy about cherries I've
[18:33.780 --> 18:39.040]  never been crazy about cherries just because that was like always the flavor of medicine
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.480]  hmm when I was a kid and so I always sort of associate it with some like oh god I gotta
[18:44.480 --> 18:53.780]  take this crap because I'm sick but my my my new exception is um uh liquor soaked cherries
[18:53.780 --> 19:00.060]  are really good you get in a drink you know and they're like they're really dark and they're
[19:00.060 --> 19:04.640]  full of like bourbon or something yeah so not like a not like a maraschino cherry you're
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.760]  talking about like it no not like a maraschino cherry but like a like a liquor infused cherry
[19:08.760 --> 19:16.440]  yeah that does it does sound good um friend of the show uh scott simpson is is a you as
[19:16.440 --> 19:22.140]  you probably remember is a very very big fan of the maraschino cherry yes right what was
[19:22.140 --> 19:27.000]  the drink that the that the boys made they made uh the aunt nancy remember isn't that
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.380]  yo yeah is it from the show yeah from uh you look nice today the boys came up with their
[19:31.380 --> 19:37.800]  signature cocktail of the podcast I believe in aunt nancy is quote a fistful of maraschino
[19:37.800 --> 19:47.520]  cherries and then maker's maker's mark to garnish I think I think so that sounds familiar
[19:47.520 --> 19:54.200]  and it fits because scott has a knack of finding the worst bars yes um possible he you you
[19:54.200 --> 20:00.580]  you go to a town with scott and he will just instinctively um wander into the most horrible
[20:00.580 --> 20:04.840]  bar you could find and not not horrible and like oh my god it's a terrible dive um but
[20:04.840 --> 20:11.800]  just crappy like um you know tgi friday's kind of bar yep yep like a like a tgi friday's
[20:11.800 --> 20:18.160]  that uh hasn't been inspected in a few years and which is which is to say a tgi right right
[20:18.160 --> 20:23.160]  and the town everybody everybody in whatever town it is just assumes it's been closed for
[20:23.160 --> 20:28.160]  a while so they haven't sent an inspector yeah I've been out with him I've been out
[20:28.160 --> 20:32.600]  with him and he literally will order a drink with a fistful of maraschino cherries and
[20:32.600 --> 20:37.880]  then the bartender will you know start plopping like two or three in and and scott is so great
[20:37.880 --> 20:41.080]  it's not it's not like he's bossing them and telling them what to do he's like oh no no
[20:41.080 --> 20:44.520]  I'm so sorry uh I literally meant a fistful put a whole fistful in
[20:44.520 --> 20:52.520]  I don't know maybe that's a good way of getting a snack while you're yeah well that's part
[20:52.520 --> 20:56.320]  of his you know you get a free like you know you might have to pay for a bowl of uh pretzels
[20:56.320 --> 21:04.360]  or something yeah that's just part of the drink they charge extra for that uh home pod
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.400]  we were talking about so people some people uh got access last week apparently a friend
[21:09.400 --> 21:16.920]  of the show serenity caldwell had a write-up at uh i'm more um I think it was brian heater
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.580]  had a write-up at tech crunch seems like people like it it sounds like what people got was
[21:21.580 --> 21:28.960]  sort of a similar demonstration as the one we had it back at wwdc where they had side-by-side
[21:28.960 --> 21:37.360]  comparisons but including now the google home max which is actually 400 more than a home
[21:37.360 --> 21:46.680]  pod not sure what to say though if without me having heard one so i don't know i am looking
[21:46.680 --> 21:50.540]  forward to it though so it doesn't i mean it sounds like there's a few things to pull
[21:50.540 --> 21:57.040]  out of some of this information just that it it will play you don't have to have apple
[21:57.040 --> 22:03.760]  music per se no because it'll play icloud music library stuff that's subscribed to via
[22:03.760 --> 22:10.120]  itunes match yes that's it was a surprising source of confusion i really do think entirely
[22:10.120 --> 22:14.740]  apple's fault i mean it's all straightened out now i think and certainly will be straightened
[22:14.740 --> 22:23.720]  out before people get these home pods but there was it was like in their fervor to emphasize
[22:23.720 --> 22:30.240]  apple music and encourage people you know that that the two things go hand in hand you
[22:30.240 --> 22:34.400]  know that if you have home pod you'll love apple music and if you have apple music you'll
[22:34.400 --> 22:41.120]  love a home pod um it seemed to get it almost came out as though the only thing i could
[22:41.120 --> 22:47.580]  play it was apple music and that is not not the case so if you have like itunes match
[22:47.580 --> 22:52.560]  and i or i whatever it's called it's there's a lot of different things there but icloud
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.840]  music library isn't that what it's called yep so if you have icloud music library and
[22:56.840 --> 23:03.160]  you have songs uh you know like bootlegs or just for whatever reason music that's not
[23:03.160 --> 23:10.740]  in icloud or or itunes store or apple music it'll play it and you don't have to airplay
[23:10.740 --> 23:16.800]  it to do it you can just tell siri and she'll play it which is as you would expect you would
[23:16.800 --> 23:21.240]  like i wrote on daring fireball when it when it sounded like maybe it didn't work that
[23:21.240 --> 23:26.200]  it was kind of confounding because the entire stack is apples like they're not you know
[23:26.200 --> 23:33.760]  i mean i i itunes is apple's thing so it ought to work yeah you'd think and it apparently
[23:33.760 --> 23:38.440]  it well it's at least supposed to so you know how well it works we'll have to see but it
[23:38.440 --> 23:44.000]  does it does work yeah and then you can you know you can airplay from whatever you can
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.720]  airplay from yeah i'm i'm really looking forward to it i've said this before but we have uh
[23:49.720 --> 23:57.520]  we have the amazon echo in our kitchen and um you know amy spends a lot of time there
[23:57.520 --> 24:02.000]  it's you know it's like a nice room it's got a big island thing in the middle you can hang
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.560]  out uh and you know she listens to music on the echo and i think it sounds terrible you
[24:09.560 --> 24:15.400]  know i don't know how much better right like i don't know how much better home pod really
[24:15.400 --> 24:21.600]  will sound compared to an amazon echo in our kitchen you know i remember the demo i got
[24:21.600 --> 24:27.360]  at wwdc and it clearly sounded better i mean but you know and and you know it to amazon's
[24:27.360 --> 24:33.720]  credit they don't really bill it as a as yeah being a music it's clearly way cheaper too
[24:33.720 --> 24:41.440]  right it is way cheaper it is a lot more like sort of like a good clock radio type thing
[24:41.440 --> 24:47.920]  but for us and you know it really was you know we we were on the cusp thinking about
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.060]  getting a sonos uh back when they announced it and so put it off but i will wait for this
[24:53.060 --> 24:59.120]  thing um so i'm looking forward to it so we'll definitely have one in the kitchen whether
[24:59.120 --> 25:05.440]  we like it enough that i'll get one from my office i don't i don't know yeah and well
[25:05.440 --> 25:10.220]  i mean i think well again those are separate zones right so you wouldn't be trying to play
[25:10.220 --> 25:14.960]  necessarily the same stuff to each to both of them at the same time no it is that you
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.980]  can't that you can't do until you get your plate too yeah and uh yeah that's a weird
[25:19.980 --> 25:24.760]  thing too like so you can't do multi-room audio that would be like playing like for
[25:24.760 --> 25:30.280]  a party or something playing the same song in multiple rooms at the same synchronization
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.780]  right and that's the thing that's the thing i could see us doing um i think that we because
[25:34.780 --> 25:37.960]  currently we just like we have a party we play the music from the sonos in the kitchen
[25:37.960 --> 25:41.420]  um and most people frankly it's a party most people hang out in the kitchen for you know
[25:41.420 --> 25:47.320]  whatever reason um but uh you know i would think that we would want to you know have
[25:47.320 --> 25:53.660]  it in the living room too yeah uh i'm still curious how they're gonna do it in the stores
[25:53.660 --> 26:03.500]  i i i really am it because it's those apple stores are so noisy and yeah and acoustically
[26:03.500 --> 26:10.180]  are seem like nightmares because it's hard floors hard tables i don't i think the walls
[26:10.180 --> 26:16.380]  are hard aren't they a lot of them have like the it just glass front you know yeah a big
[26:16.380 --> 26:21.980]  it just sounds like a loud like a wide open thing to the mall right so you know i i i'm
[26:21.980 --> 26:27.460]  really curious about that and you know as usual apple is you know they don't they won't
[26:27.460 --> 26:31.300]  tell you well they'll we'll find out when they're in the stores what whether they're
[26:31.300 --> 26:36.000]  actually you know who knows maybe they won't really be able to play them it just seems
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.180]  weird it seems like a hard product to sell given their they let you play with the apple
[26:41.180 --> 26:47.060]  tv yeah but that's not noisy right no i know i mean i know yeah i mean i was wondering
[26:47.060 --> 26:52.700]  about that at the time too how they were gonna demonstrate that but they just have it there
[26:52.700 --> 27:01.620]  and you know you know and it's like a different retail setup you know you could have like
[27:01.620 --> 27:05.320]  a fake living room you know like when you go to ikea there's you know they have little
[27:05.320 --> 27:10.280]  fake kitchens and you can pretend like you live here and i don't see how apple could
[27:10.280 --> 27:16.040]  do that effectively it in the apple store well i'm sure you've been to i mean years
[27:16.040 --> 27:22.060]  ago going back in time again those stereo stores where they have the sealed off rooms
[27:22.060 --> 27:26.380]  yeah because that was a little you know like you buy you buy the components separately
[27:26.380 --> 27:31.300]  and get you know you get your tape deck you get your um receiver and then then you gotta
[27:31.300 --> 27:35.180]  buy the speakers you gotta go into the room to try the speakers out because you gotta
[27:35.180 --> 27:40.700]  get the right and they would have like a little uh like an apparatus where they could switch
[27:40.700 --> 27:45.020]  you know like uh they wouldn't have to plug and unplug them they'd have like a little
[27:45.020 --> 27:51.540]  abcd type thing and they could turn a dial and and i don't know i i don't think i don't
[27:51.540 --> 27:55.420]  know of any place that does that anymore maybe their place is in big bigger cities than than
[27:55.420 --> 28:00.380]  where i live but but but the one place that they do have stuff like that still is um like
[28:00.380 --> 28:06.820]  the car stereo places yeah yeah yeah i guess they would wouldn't they yeah because i was
[28:06.820 --> 28:11.220]  in one of those like a few years ago that that business seems like it's still still
[28:11.220 --> 28:16.540]  relatively the same because the aftermarket car stuff you know people people still do
[28:16.540 --> 28:22.140]  that a lot i mean they i guess people still do speakers too but i had probably less than
[28:22.140 --> 28:27.460]  they used to because it seems like people are switching to these these sort of connected
[28:27.460 --> 28:32.820]  devices that are yeah somebody was just telling me i i knew i knew that it was a thing i was
[28:32.820 --> 28:37.700]  it somehow i don't forget if it was on my podcast or where but somehow it came up where
[28:37.700 --> 28:44.160]  i was talking about the fact that we have a our one car is a 2006 and and therefore
[28:44.160 --> 28:50.820]  pre is it was predates not just the iphone but it was also it didn't even have the 30
[28:50.820 --> 28:56.340]  pin connector like the 2007 models came with a 30 pin connector and i remember thinking
[28:56.340 --> 29:00.420]  like man that would have been sweet and i think we've had this car so long we've had
[29:00.420 --> 29:04.660]  this car so long where i went from having a pang of jealousy that we didn't have a 30
[29:04.660 --> 29:10.300]  pin connector to hook up like an ipod uh to now being wow did we dodge a bullet on that
[29:10.300 --> 29:17.060]  one yeah right like all those hotels that are the uh but anyway somebody mentioned connector
[29:17.060 --> 29:21.540]  yeah somebody mentioned that you can go to one of those car stereo places and get like
[29:21.540 --> 29:26.580]  a carplay setup like you don't have to you know it i guess this all came up in the aftermath
[29:26.580 --> 29:34.180]  of the bmw thing where bmw was rumored to begin charging 80 a year just to keep your
[29:34.180 --> 29:41.620]  carboy working uh and somebody said that you can just go to and buy an aftermarket carplay
[29:41.620 --> 29:45.640]  thing and that a lot of them are better because the car makers don't screw that's what i should
[29:45.640 --> 29:49.300]  do eventually kind of wondering how that works with like it seems like all these i mean like
[29:49.300 --> 29:53.780]  you know i now have an integrated screen in the car so i got a new car a couple years
[29:53.780 --> 29:59.540]  three years ago something like that um but yeah but prior to that i had a you know you
[29:59.540 --> 30:03.220]  need to have your car get you you have to have your um stereo get stolen that's what
[30:03.220 --> 30:08.300]  you need that's what happened i guess it happened to me and then i got because i had i had the
[30:08.300 --> 30:12.420]  tape deck thing where you just you know like you put a tape deck and you push that thing
[30:12.420 --> 30:19.580]  into the tape deck to play um you know and then it's just a wire that you connected to
[30:19.580 --> 30:23.220]  your iphone yeah that's what we've got i've got that's what we've got is that what is
[30:23.220 --> 30:27.700]  that what you're still doing yeah our car has it you definitely need to get your stereo
[30:27.700 --> 30:36.420]  stolen our car has uh like a six disc ct player and a cassette tape player uh god i got mine
[30:36.420 --> 30:41.020]  got stolen and i was like oh yeah i'm getting bluetooth it's funny we've gone in the course
[30:41.020 --> 30:46.020]  of half an hour we've gone from me thinking cassette tapes were like like a relic of my
[30:46.020 --> 30:50.500]  childhood to me acknowledging that realizing you're still relying on that technology right
[30:50.500 --> 31:00.380]  the car that's right above me right now is still has that technology you should look
[31:00.380 --> 31:10.180]  into that probably should uh go write yourself another check all right let me take another
[31:10.180 --> 31:17.940]  break here and thank our next uh sponsor it's our good friends at squarespace look it's
[31:17.940 --> 31:23.260]  a new year maybe you've got some uh you know to do's maybe one of the things you've you've
[31:23.260 --> 31:26.820]  been meaning to get to is start a new website for something maybe it's you want to do a
[31:26.820 --> 31:34.180]  podcast maybe you want to start a blog maybe you've got uh like online portfolio you want
[31:34.180 --> 31:39.760]  to put together professionally sort of like have a website stand as your resume and example
[31:39.760 --> 31:44.820]  of your work if you need a new website you should look at squarespace first you really
[31:44.820 --> 31:50.100]  should they handle everything you can do your domain name registration there they do all
[31:50.100 --> 31:55.540]  the hosting you don't have to worry about anything when something unexpected comes up
[31:55.540 --> 32:02.080]  like this uh whole meltdown inspector thing you're you're not stuck being the system administrator
[32:02.080 --> 32:08.420]  updating linux kernel on your server and restarting it and hoping that everything still works
[32:08.420 --> 32:14.020]  squarespace handles all of that technical stuff for you it's all abstracted behind this
[32:14.020 --> 32:20.460]  behind the scenes and it just works and their hosting is terrific uh it is super fast every
[32:20.460 --> 32:26.420]  squarespace site i've ever seen is super zippy everything is really really fast and the interface
[32:26.420 --> 32:35.420]  for doing the creative stuff is so amazingly drag and drop it's almost as somebody who
[32:35.420 --> 32:41.940]  a career ago was building websites professionally when everything had to be done through html
[32:41.940 --> 32:51.340]  and css javascript and doing the code it actually blows me away how wizzy wig the web can be
[32:51.340 --> 32:55.200]  for dragging elements around it really feels like almost like using a desktop interface
[32:55.200 --> 33:03.100]  like a desktop app to design and manage your website so go check them out squarespace squarespace.com
[33:03.100 --> 33:10.240]  is where you go and when you enter the code talk show no the just talk show one word at
[33:10.240 --> 33:14.900]  checkout you will get 10 off you can go there get a free trial use it for a couple weeks
[33:14.900 --> 33:23.220]  and then when you pay remember that code talk show um i don't have much else to say about
[33:23.220 --> 33:26.260]  home pod i feel like we got to get we got to get them before we can talk more about
[33:26.260 --> 33:34.020]  it i had this on my list of topics did you hear that the iphone 10 was cancelled i i
[33:34.020 --> 33:46.420]  had i had heard that this is still a thing yeah people yeah i mean so ming chi kuo said
[33:46.420 --> 33:56.380]  wrote in one of his famous notes that because of weak demand and i think he only said in
[33:56.380 --> 34:06.340]  china yeah uh that the iphone 10 would not be continued and i forget his exact words
[34:06.340 --> 34:14.780]  but he said something about um summer um that they would stop that just didn't say stop
[34:14.780 --> 34:19.820]  production he said something he said something vague though it it renee and i talked about
[34:19.820 --> 34:24.860]  it last week but it's the week in a week since it's it's just now it's just part of the air
[34:24.860 --> 34:29.380]  out there that people think the iphone 10 has been cancelled when what it really was
[34:29.380 --> 34:32.740]  was something something to the effect of if they're not going to keep selling it after
[34:32.740 --> 34:36.620]  the 2018 phones come out yeah they'll stop production at some point in the summer because
[34:36.620 --> 34:43.260]  they'll have enough of them to sell up until september whatever the date is september 20th
[34:43.260 --> 34:48.540]  or whatever it's going to be you don't stop making them when you stop selling them right
[34:48.540 --> 34:56.300]  but then it quickly it quickly the story so spun out of control and became uh that they're
[34:56.300 --> 34:59.980]  going to stop selling them as soon as they stop making them in the summer and that we're
[34:59.980 --> 35:05.860]  going to have like a week's long gap with no iphone 10 and then it quickly changed to
[35:05.860 --> 35:13.420]  there it being cancelled right now in january it's any minute imminent like i think i said
[35:13.420 --> 35:19.420]  i think i saw someone say like you know shortly or imminent or something just like yeah um
[35:19.420 --> 35:23.740]  but in i mean within the last few days though also i've seen a whole bunch of things that
[35:23.740 --> 35:29.100]  said that it's actually selling quite well right and it's all it's it's like clockwork
[35:29.100 --> 35:36.020]  i uh every january it comes at these these bullshit reports come out that say that that
[35:36.020 --> 35:41.580]  there's uh production is being you know apples have told its suppliers that it's cutting
[35:41.580 --> 35:51.820]  uh forecasts uh well so you you'd retweeted ryan jones right um who did plowed through
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.540]  some of the numbers and so the wall street journalist he says the wall street journal
[35:55.540 --> 36:03.620]  says iphone 10 q2 cut was from 40 million planned to 20 million and he points out that
[36:03.620 --> 36:09.260]  usually apple the last two years apple sold about 50 million in that quarter right and
[36:09.260 --> 36:13.900]  does that make does 40 million for that quarter make any sense whatsoever did they really
[36:13.900 --> 36:17.820]  i mean do you think they really thought that they were going to sell right like 80 percent
[36:17.820 --> 36:22.220]  of their sales were going to be iphone 10 right so no i mean it seems like 20 million
[36:22.220 --> 36:32.700]  is actually what it would have realistically been yeah uh i think it was and i think it
[36:32.700 --> 36:41.780]  was atp tipster um i believe who um asked me whether i thought this was malfeasance
[36:41.780 --> 36:51.540]  or um are these suppliers just being cherry picked and you know as apple like uh moves
[36:51.540 --> 36:56.700]  you know who you know who here's the company that makes the volume buttons and they're
[36:56.700 --> 37:03.020]  gonna you know tim cooks figured out that they could save five cents per button if they
[37:03.020 --> 37:09.740]  go to somebody across town and so they cut the supplies from company a and increase the
[37:09.740 --> 37:14.620]  ones from company b but company a has no idea because apple of course is it's probably a
[37:14.620 --> 37:19.220]  nightmare to deal with because they're so they're so secretive and they're so good at
[37:19.220 --> 37:23.980]  being secretive so company a just hears oh we don't need as many volume buttons as we
[37:23.980 --> 37:28.940]  thought we would from you anymore and then they go and blab to somebody that hey the
[37:28.940 --> 37:36.620]  iphone 10 they're cutting the production in half um and i i think it's more malfeasance
[37:36.620 --> 37:41.900]  i'd really do like i really do think it's people spreading rumors either for competitive
[37:41.900 --> 37:46.940]  reasons or you know like to short the stock um because you know and the reason why is
[37:46.940 --> 37:53.500]  because you never hear from the other suppliers you never hear uh some other suppliers say
[37:53.500 --> 38:02.780]  oh well i sounds to me it sounds to us like uh iphone demand is doubled i i guess if i
[38:02.780 --> 38:07.740]  want to try to find a way if i try to you know devil's advocate try to try to figure
[38:07.740 --> 38:14.900]  out maybe it it could be that the suppliers who get the increased demand you know from
[38:14.900 --> 38:20.420]  apple uh are so happy about it and they don't want to piss apple off so they keep their
[38:20.420 --> 38:26.820]  mouths shut and it's the supplier who apple cuts the demand is sour grapes and then they
[38:26.820 --> 38:32.380]  go and talk to the wall street journal i don't know i guess that's possible but it seems
[38:32.380 --> 38:36.260]  to me like if you want even if you still have 20 million it doesn't i mean the thing that
[38:36.260 --> 38:42.780]  drives me crazy is like most of this stuff comes from financial analysts right and these
[38:42.780 --> 38:48.780]  and i mean i think he does i mean he does a pretty good job basically you know as far
[38:48.780 --> 38:52.100]  as they all go he does a pretty good job but a lot of these a lot of these guys just they
[38:52.100 --> 38:58.260]  get out there and they say like the craziest i mean like what's his name um uh chaudhary
[38:58.260 --> 39:08.060]  yeah trip i mean yeah i mean how does that guy view his what is his game there in saying
[39:08.060 --> 39:12.340]  the crazy stuff that he does i mean i guess he's just he doesn't he doesn't care about
[39:12.340 --> 39:15.580]  that but it just it seems like if you're a financial analyst why would you say stuff
[39:15.580 --> 39:22.420]  that is demonstrably wrong all the time how does that make a good case for people uh you
[39:22.420 --> 39:28.020]  know like subscribing to your your material or investing through you right i i have no
[39:28.020 --> 39:34.260]  idea like i i guess i can see why somebody would want to pay for ming chi kuo's stuff
[39:34.260 --> 39:39.100]  because well it seems like he i'll you know he's not perfect but a lot of his stuff what
[39:39.100 --> 39:48.420]  i don't know 60 70 right uh and you can kind of uh you can kind of see the you know from
[39:48.420 --> 39:51.620]  his history you can see which are the type of things he's speculating about and which
[39:51.620 --> 40:00.300]  ones are not you know i mean like the basically like if he says something's going on at fox
[40:00.300 --> 40:04.700]  con you can be pretty sure about it you know there's some people you know he's more or
[40:04.700 --> 40:11.940]  less taking fox con people out and getting them drunk and and they tell him secrets those
[40:11.940 --> 40:19.980]  people need a drink too all right i just i i googled my uh i i did a search here for
[40:19.980 --> 40:32.500]  some trip trip claims here's one i wrote in uh january 20 12th january 2016 so that was
[40:32.500 --> 40:40.680]  two years ago uh trip claim chaudhary woke up from another bender garrett cook reporting
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.600]  for yahoo finance last week in a recent note chaudhary called for the quote completely
[40:45.600 --> 40:54.420]  clueless end quote tim cook to be replaced he cited a culture of quote bozos end quote
[40:54.420 --> 41:02.900]  at apple destroying 486 billion dollars in shareholder value under cooks management 486
[41:02.900 --> 41:11.340]  billion dollars there is hope though for apple's management and it starts with jonathan rubenstein
[41:11.340 --> 41:18.540]  taking over do you remember this yeah yeah yeah it's unbelievable cook needs to be replaced
[41:18.540 --> 41:25.140]  and mercifully noted cook can quote go back to his operations role sure now that's that's
[41:25.140 --> 41:32.040]  how that works so he just you just get demoted back to the role that you had it wouldn't
[41:32.040 --> 41:37.980]  be humiliating at all no no and you know and certainly figuring out the um you know like
[41:37.980 --> 41:42.240]  his salary and his benefits that would be very easy you just you know roll them back
[41:42.240 --> 41:47.380]  to what he was getting before i forgot that i wrote this is so good so my my quip on this
[41:47.380 --> 41:53.220]  post was has anyone considered the possibility that quote trip chaudhary doesn't actually
[41:53.220 --> 41:58.200]  exist and is really some sort of experiment to test whether the business press will question
[41:58.200 --> 42:05.700]  anyone claiming to be an analyst no matter how i name their statements yeah i mean you
[42:05.700 --> 42:08.960]  know the thing the famous one was when he said that apple needed to release a watch
[42:08.960 --> 42:21.700]  within like 60 days or it was going to go out of business that's that's true and that
[42:21.700 --> 42:27.080]  guy probably makes a decent living you know he probably does quite well i think and it's
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.780]  clearly i mean you know and so i i assume that this is some sort of performance art
[42:31.780 --> 42:36.940]  right i mean he's they did and they definitely do this you know they it's the same thing
[42:36.940 --> 42:41.980]  with like people who like are selling books um who will come out and say you know like
[42:41.980 --> 42:50.360]  somebody has like some book about the techno you know like the top seven tips from smartest
[42:50.360 --> 42:55.020]  man and technology managers in silicon valley or something like that and so they'll in order
[42:55.020 --> 43:00.860]  to to pump the book they'll make some crazy claim about apple and and you know put down
[43:00.860 --> 43:07.020]  at the bottom so it's you know i so and so is the offer of the new book whatever yeah
[43:07.020 --> 43:12.100]  um so there's there's definitely that going on and i i just assume that he has decided
[43:12.100 --> 43:15.580]  somehow that and some of these other ones have decided that they're that's going to
[43:15.580 --> 43:21.840]  be their thing i guess so it just doesn't make sense to me it doesn't make sense to
[43:21.840 --> 43:26.680]  me either because you sound like an idiot if i were that accurate writing it during
[43:26.680 --> 43:33.180]  fireball like i i it would be like i'd have like three viewers and one of them would be
[43:33.180 --> 43:38.220]  my mom you know what i mean like who would read it who would wait drip showery would
[43:38.220 --> 43:48.420]  read it um like if our podcast if my podcast word is regularly wrong and profoundly is
[43:48.420 --> 43:54.540]  that like wouldn't people be furious like if i if i if i was railing that tim cook is
[43:54.540 --> 43:58.860]  a bozo who needed to be fired wouldn't people be furious he'd be like i cannot listen to
[43:58.860 --> 44:02.320]  this guy anymore i mean maybe people think they can't listen to me anymore regardless
[44:02.320 --> 44:11.820]  but uh all right let's shift from bozos to somebody who's really smart did you see this
[44:11.820 --> 44:18.540]  twitter thread uh a woman who i guess she'd recently left apple yeah bethenny bonjourno
[44:18.540 --> 44:29.900]  um i'm curious what she's working on because she and another long time uh apple employee
[44:29.900 --> 44:38.340]  just left and are doing something together um but anyway she tweeted uh now that she's
[44:38.340 --> 44:50.020]  out of apple and can talk uh about uh the ipad launch uh and she told this great great
[44:50.020 --> 44:57.460]  story um one she says that steve carefully chose the the lark i don't know how to pronounce
[44:57.460 --> 45:07.380]  this lara lay corpusia chair but it's that chair that you know a sort of uh very modern
[45:07.380 --> 45:15.620]  leather chair um but there were a sea of them and each one was carried out so he could inspect
[45:15.620 --> 45:21.780]  it in the stage lighting did it have the right coloring was there where in the right places
[45:21.780 --> 45:28.740]  did it have the right sit when the third party developers were brought in this sounds like
[45:28.740 --> 45:32.580]  a nightmare this is the one part oh yeah when third party developers were brought in a few
[45:32.580 --> 45:39.460]  weeks before the event they were told they were only flying in for the day for a meeting
[45:39.460 --> 45:43.180]  and when they found out they would be stuck there for weeks we had to take them to target
[45:43.180 --> 45:49.820]  to get more clothes and other necessities i guess you know i mean like yeah you gotta
[45:49.820 --> 45:53.180]  do what you gotta do right i mean like i see this is you know i think this is it kind of
[45:53.180 --> 45:57.300]  acid you know like a real jerk move by apple really right but i mean i guess if you're
[45:57.300 --> 46:03.520]  the developer you gotta make that decision on the spot and kind of go well my family's
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.060]  gonna be really angry with me but if this you know we're gonna be on stage at the launch
[46:09.060 --> 46:15.020]  of this freaking device it makes me wonder whether that's the sort of thing that is different
[46:15.020 --> 46:21.400]  in the post steve apple like was it like without steve jobs there would they really do that
[46:21.400 --> 46:26.020]  would they really fly people out thinking it's a one-day meeting and then say look you
[46:26.020 --> 46:29.380]  have here's the opportunity you have to say yes or no right now you can spend the next
[46:29.380 --> 46:35.200]  three weeks and build an app for this device um which we're not going to really show you
[46:35.200 --> 46:42.380]  yeah right right which is like underneath some like thing right i mean like they were
[46:42.380 --> 46:48.940]  covered up right they were like in a case that disguised the real stuff and if you do
[46:48.940 --> 47:00.780]  this we might we might show your app on stage if we like it maybe yes or no are you in that's
[47:00.780 --> 47:07.540]  amazing um let's go to target so the third party devs were escorted and monitored at
[47:07.540 --> 47:12.820]  all times we all signed up for shifts even on the weekends they weren't able to bring
[47:12.820 --> 47:17.860]  their phones into the workroom or use wi-fi and the ipads written in stealth cases so
[47:17.860 --> 47:24.220]  they couldn't see the industrial design before the event um i i knew a little bit about this
[47:24.220 --> 47:29.980]  because uh a friend of mine jennifer brooke was at the new york times at the time and
[47:29.980 --> 47:37.460]  actually was on stage at the ipad you know that the new york times app was shown so i've
[47:37.460 --> 47:42.220]  heard this same story from her perspective as somebody found out she was spending three
[47:42.220 --> 47:47.980]  weeks in a windowless room at apple i think that's the other part i don't think bethany
[47:47.980 --> 47:53.780]  mentioned that it was windowless because they didn't had to be nobody could look at it see
[47:53.780 --> 47:58.780]  an ipad yeah it was crazy but then here's the one i love this is the story i love this
[47:58.780 --> 48:04.700]  at one point steve wanted to turn ui kit elements orange not just any orange he wanted a particular
[48:04.700 --> 48:10.700]  orange from the button on a certain old sony remote we got a bunch of remotes from sony
[48:10.700 --> 48:17.980]  with orange button to try and find the right one in the end steve hated it it's the greatest
[48:17.980 --> 48:23.580]  i i when i retweeted it i said there are entire books about steve jobs that have less information
[48:23.580 --> 48:28.820]  yeah and that one that one tweet i just love it and i don't know how close she was to running
[48:28.820 --> 48:35.060]  out of 280 characters um but it looks it's a pretty long tweet so i'm guessing it was
[48:35.060 --> 48:40.140]  close i i don't know if it's forced brevity because she was running out of characters
[48:40.140 --> 48:46.180]  or not but it's such great writing that it's just this whole saga about this particularly
[48:46.180 --> 48:50.420]  orange and changing the whole interface and i guess the idea was that instead of like
[48:50.420 --> 48:57.260]  mostly a blue interface of of the iphone you know like when you you know back pre i07 when
[48:57.260 --> 49:06.860]  you would tap a row it would light up blue right like in a ui table view and i'm guessing
[49:06.860 --> 49:11.940]  that he had it here he had the idea that to make the ipad like a sort of orange based
[49:11.940 --> 49:16.780]  interface and i think i had a sony remote control with the orange that he's talking
[49:16.780 --> 49:21.700]  about i know i used to have a trinitron and it did have a very nice orange for the power
[49:21.700 --> 49:27.900]  button uh i kind of think i know which you know maybe not the exact model but i know
[49:27.900 --> 49:34.900]  the the basic vibe of the orange that she's talking about uh and i can see i was a good
[49:34.900 --> 49:43.460]  idea but i just love that sentence in the end steve hated it never mind and i'm sure
[49:43.460 --> 49:49.020]  that happened a lot i mean i mean you know it happens it happens and it happens in software
[49:49.020 --> 49:52.140]  development i mean you know like you spend a bunch of time working on something and then
[49:52.140 --> 49:58.860]  you're like no that's that's no good but particularly with him i'm sure and he you know he had a
[49:58.860 --> 50:03.700]  very very particular idea what he wanted and then decided that he was wrong in the end
[50:03.700 --> 50:09.020]  i think that with him too it was also the case that things like that could happen closer
[50:09.020 --> 50:14.500]  to the end you know like at any point like it might be like literally like one week before
[50:14.500 --> 50:18.100]  they're supposed to unveil it and he's like i want the whole thing orange and then everybody
[50:18.100 --> 50:24.920]  scrambles for 72 hours finding old remotes on ebay and finding an orange and then trying
[50:24.920 --> 50:29.620]  to figure out how to translate the orange from a real rubber button to an on-screen
[50:29.620 --> 50:33.740]  button that's backlit and to have it come across the same way and then they hook it
[50:33.740 --> 50:40.460]  all up and steve takes a look at it and says i hate it this is terrible i just love it
[50:40.460 --> 50:45.420]  though it's and and the thing about steve jobs that i love about that story is the phrase
[50:45.420 --> 50:51.460]  i don't know who invented the phrase but the the the idea of uh strong opinions loosely
[50:51.460 --> 50:57.220]  held in other words you're gonna have an opinion be be adamant about it but also don't be so
[50:57.220 --> 51:03.980]  egotistical as to refuse to change your mind right like that was like his unbelievable
[51:03.980 --> 51:09.260]  like tim cook has said this so so many times and and in so many ways but his steve jobs
[51:09.260 --> 51:15.340]  his ability to change his mind might have been the single single most genius thing about
[51:15.340 --> 51:22.680]  about the man like yeah because and i think it was infuriating it could be at times because
[51:22.680 --> 51:26.400]  i feel like at at the point where he hates the orange he's like who's the moron to spend
[51:26.400 --> 51:29.900]  all this time making this orange why did you waste the time and it was like uh that was
[51:29.900 --> 51:36.180]  you well people and people always wanted to call him a hypocrite too like or or you know
[51:36.180 --> 51:41.740]  contradictory because he would say that you know that's that's that thing's terrible our
[51:41.740 --> 51:44.920]  competitors had that thing it's awful and then you know three years later they introduced
[51:44.920 --> 51:52.160]  the same thing i had that thought too when when these tweets came out and i was rereading
[51:52.160 --> 51:56.940]  them and i thought hey you know what this is the first time i heard a story about steve
[51:56.940 --> 52:03.460]  jobs and i just my first reaction was laughter and not sadness and i thought that's you know
[52:03.460 --> 52:12.180]  like i like we've kind of crossed it's been enough time where it's you know sounds morbid
[52:12.180 --> 52:17.500]  but it's like i already he he my my first thought isn't sadness it's like of course
[52:17.500 --> 52:23.540]  he's dead already you know he's he's filed away as someone who's no longer with us i
[52:23.540 --> 52:27.240]  think the chair the chair thing is sort of the only thing that gives me you know a little
[52:27.240 --> 52:31.980]  bit of that feeling just because he was he was pretty sick yes yeah and yeah and he could
[52:31.980 --> 52:35.420]  not he couldn't stand for the whole thing i also but at the same time they were also
[52:35.420 --> 52:38.860]  pitching it as a device that where you're just gonna be sitting on the couch using this
[52:38.860 --> 52:44.780]  thing i had a lot of the a lot of the um the art that they released was just like people
[52:44.780 --> 52:49.580]  sitting around in the ads where people sitting around with it like we we i think we joked
[52:49.580 --> 52:54.540]  about this like you know it was in that you know for people who wear jeans it was in that
[52:54.540 --> 53:01.220]  sort of like uh fold that is on the front of the jeans when you sit down right like
[53:01.220 --> 53:06.700]  that was that was the ipad stand i i think it's interesting because he was sick at the
[53:06.700 --> 53:11.660]  time it was even a little surprising i think he was actually on a medical leave at the
[53:11.660 --> 53:18.820]  time and uh in 2010 so he he died yeah he might not have been yeah ceo back then he
[53:18.820 --> 53:26.320]  died at that point died in 2011 so he he lived about another year and a half um but he obviously
[53:26.320 --> 53:31.280]  you know in hindsight we now know he wasn't doing well and you know he was very thin and
[53:31.280 --> 53:37.060]  so we all from the outside suspected you know might be what actually happened a recurrence
[53:37.060 --> 53:43.640]  of cancer um and we've heard stories that yes he was it was physical you know because
[53:43.640 --> 53:49.020]  he was frail um that he needed to sit he couldn't stand for a whole keynote but i think that
[53:49.020 --> 53:53.940]  even if he had been healthy i think that there still would have been a they still would have
[53:53.940 --> 53:58.260]  had the chair i think he still would have demoed the ipad sitting down it just wouldn't
[53:58.260 --> 54:03.940]  have been out of necessity it would have been like you said this is it's just the posture
[54:03.940 --> 54:13.700]  to to to use it i mean you can i mean i certainly walk around with an ipad a lot it's you know
[54:13.700 --> 54:18.840]  certainly a better device for walking around within a laptop but uh you know it's definitely
[54:18.840 --> 54:25.040]  more of a sit-down type thing yeah what a great story trying to think about what else
[54:25.040 --> 54:34.100]  i have on the old uh old agenda were you at that yes i was there okay and uh i started
[54:34.100 --> 54:41.620]  going to the one that i was lucky for was the iphone the mac world expo because that
[54:41.620 --> 54:45.860]  was that might have been the first it might have been the first mac world keynote that
[54:45.860 --> 54:54.660]  i saw in person like 2006 or i guess it was 2007 yeah 2007 was right around the time when
[54:54.660 --> 55:01.980]  and it was not ridiculous that during fireballs revenue could justify me buying an airplane
[55:01.980 --> 55:08.260]  to hit across the country you know so i've i was within you know i i don't think i was
[55:08.260 --> 55:12.540]  at the one a year prior to that i think i was watching on you know so it was pretty
[55:12.540 --> 55:17.780]  cool that uh that i got to see that one but by 2010 i think i was in regular attendance
[55:17.780 --> 55:22.740]  for all these events yeah okay it was weird it was fun i do the thing i remember specifically
[55:22.740 --> 55:29.380]  about it was being in the room and it the people it was a topic of conversation do you
[55:29.380 --> 55:32.500]  think steve jobs will be here do you think he'll be here because we knew he was on leave
[55:32.500 --> 55:40.380]  um you know so i didn't have my hopes up i thought you know probably not um but then
[55:40.380 --> 55:45.240]  we came out it was like a moment in the room you know like because it was a surprise nobody
[55:45.240 --> 55:49.300]  knew if it was going to be steve or not and i think he said something to the effect of
[55:49.300 --> 55:54.460]  hey i didn't want to miss this uh you know tim's doing a great job running the company
[55:54.460 --> 55:58.500]  i didn't want to miss this event though you know it's like we're very excited blah blah
[55:58.500 --> 56:04.100]  you know yeah but there was definitely it was an extra buzz because you know people
[56:04.100 --> 56:10.220]  knew there was a lot of weird i mean like a lot of crazy speculation about the device
[56:10.220 --> 56:15.140]  before and there was a lot of speculation about the iphone too but i don't think i don't
[56:15.140 --> 56:21.620]  think in the same weird way that that ended up being wrong yeah because there was a lot
[56:21.620 --> 56:29.220]  of emphasis placed on publishing around the iPad and like is this going to save publishing
[56:29.220 --> 56:35.140]  yeah and it you know it certainly didn't um and it's a successful device and it's great
[56:35.140 --> 56:40.260]  at many things but it was not it was not some sort of uh godsend to the publishing industry
[56:40.260 --> 56:45.100]  it's a very steve jobs device i mean and the backstory is that when he first went on a
[56:45.100 --> 56:54.420]  medical leave in 2009 i think that might have been when he had the liver transplant um but
[56:54.420 --> 57:00.140]  when he came back to work he was obviously you know you know i don't think it's i don't
[57:00.140 --> 57:03.700]  think it's you have to be a doctor to realize that after a liver transplant you may not
[57:03.700 --> 57:12.180]  have the highest energy levels yeah and so he you know he had limited time you know limited
[57:12.180 --> 57:17.140]  focus he couldn't you know he he you know as you may or may not know steve jobs had
[57:17.140 --> 57:21.540]  his fingers in a lot of a lot of the pies at apple when he came back after his liver
[57:21.540 --> 57:26.060]  transplant he more or less was like let's do this tablet thing you know and that was
[57:26.060 --> 57:32.340]  that was his baby um yeah and you know in hindsight what came out is so so totally steve
[57:32.340 --> 57:38.900]  jobs in some ways more than the iphone i think because i think the iphone is sort of it's
[57:38.900 --> 57:44.940]  so genius but it's for everybody whereas the ipad is a little bit more not for everybody
[57:44.940 --> 57:51.200]  right you know i think the fact that we're still debating it you know 10 years later
[57:51.200 --> 57:54.660]  how much you know how much work can you do on an ipad and stuff like that i think but
[57:54.660 --> 57:58.580]  a lot of it you know goes back to steve but you're exactly right about the publishing
[57:58.580 --> 58:02.620]  and that was the weird thing about being at the event too being in the press because there
[58:02.620 --> 58:09.940]  was this consensus up leading up to the device that this was great journalism is in so much
[58:09.940 --> 58:16.060]  trouble you know all these people you know that you know literally it was it's it's the
[58:16.060 --> 58:19.860]  group of people who were there the media people all thought that this device was going to
[58:19.860 --> 58:25.740]  save their jobs they really did i i mean that's not an exaggeration they it was like hey what
[58:25.740 --> 58:30.020]  they did for the it's what they did you know when the music industry was collapsing under
[58:30.020 --> 58:34.580]  piracy apple saved them with the itunes store they're going to do that with this uh and
[58:34.580 --> 58:41.720]  then we'll go back to having a safe secure job for the next 20 years and then the event
[58:41.720 --> 58:46.380]  came and went and that it was it was really it was griping people and they were like well
[58:46.380 --> 58:52.140]  wait a minute and they're like replaying like the new york times demo because they did you
[58:52.140 --> 58:58.180]  know they did have a demo and the new york times is a news publication but they were
[58:58.180 --> 59:01.620]  there was so many people talking and they were all like well wait they didn't there
[59:01.620 --> 59:05.580]  was nothing there about how they're going to make money from this and it was like nope
[59:05.580 --> 59:13.160]  yeah that's not their problem i mean it's a nice experience i mean i think reading the
[59:13.160 --> 59:21.300]  new york times on an ipad is a very nice experience yes in their in their app and and like kind
[59:21.300 --> 59:30.180]  of the best has the best parts of reading it uh physically as you could do electronically
[59:30.180 --> 59:35.060]  have you noticed this more and more i've noticed that um do you ever you ever hear of an app
[59:35.060 --> 59:42.540]  called nuzzle and uzzl i've heard of it yeah it's a really good app and i almost worry
[59:42.540 --> 59:49.020]  that i like it a lot and i almost worry that it is like in the back of my brain i've got
[59:49.020 --> 59:57.260]  this idea that i've got a job that can't be replaced by a robot
[59:57.260 --> 01:00:02.940]  surely my job can't be right and it's like there will be days that go by where everything
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:08.340]  i posted during fireball i first became aware of through nuzzle like basically you log in
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:15.380]  with your twitter credentials and you're just a glorified nuzzle but it's it's a really
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:22.960]  clever idea so you you you granted access to your twitter account i'm 99 sure that it
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:29.980]  does not do anything stupid like tweet i'm i'm using nuzzle join me because i certainly
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.740]  haven't seen it in your history if that's right i would have i would have deleted it
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.860]  in anger if if that had happened so you don't you know that's always my concern when you
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.500]  log in with twitter is i'm always and i have no idea irrationally afraid of it i'm irrationally
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.200]  afraid of some service and tweeting one tweet from my account but anyway that just goes
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.220]  through all of you know your followers and if enough you can adjust the thresholds but
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:00.960]  if like three or four of the people you follow i'll tweet the same url it bubbles up in your
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:07.580]  list and sometimes you get notifications and it seems to me like their hit rate on whether
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:13.460]  i'm actually glad i got the notification or not is amazing it is absolutely amazing it
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.180]  sounds like something if it was done poorly it would it would be infuriating but it's
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.460]  done well and their hit rate on yes i'm glad that you gave me a notification about this
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:30.140]  news story is is amazing anyway the one the thing that made me think about it was you
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.580]  said the new york times is a nice app to read the thing the downside to nuzzle is that when
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:41.500]  you're in the nuzzle app they don't use the modern i'm gonna mess up the term but you
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.940]  know how there's like a modern way to put webkit in an ios app and in the old way like
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.700]  the old way is just sort of a dumb web view and the new one is like you got like a nice
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:56.660]  little mini version of safari and so it has your content blockers and and etc the nuzzle
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:03.860]  one is is just like an old dumb web view and so i see more online ads than i think i usually
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.380]  do because i i don't try to block ads i just have odd blocker set up just to get rid of
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:15.820]  annoying ads um but they've the way that online ads are now is like if you just touch it somehow
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:21.580]  it instantly takes you to the thing and they put them at the bottom which is where the
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:28.540]  sharing control auto hides right so it's always it's like it's it's it's like the world's
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:34.780]  worst video game trying to tap at the bottom to bring up the sharing button but not tap
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:42.100]  the ad and i'm really bad at this video game like it's like the opposite of those like
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:50.060]  tap the monkey yes it's the opposite it is like you don't tap the monkey there are times
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.380]  where it seems to me like i didn't tap near the ad and yet somehow here i am going to
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:03:00.180]  this stupid ad that i don't want to see yeah i'm sure the touch target is like way beyond
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.060]  i find it because it all this all came into my mind when you said it's do you like reading
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.520]  the new york times and in the app and i do too and i find sometimes on their website
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.140]  now especially on the phone they have too many things in the middle of an article be
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:19.460]  they ads or like call outs to other related news stories but meanwhile i i just want to
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.980]  keep reading right i'm reading the story i'm engaged it's this is an interesting story
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:31.060]  and now i've got to scroll past all of this stuff and figure out where where to rejoin
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:40.680]  the story and i feel like their app is better at that than their website yeah uh i i actually
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:49.140]  i i cancelled my subscription a few weeks ago yeah because i got mad at them but how
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:54.300]  was it as nightmarish as people say the the the the downside to the new york times is
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:04:00.020]  uh do they have an itunes version or can you only subscribe through their website uh you
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:05.860]  well or call yeah you can subscribe to the website or call i don't uh pretty almost positive
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:11.260]  you cannot subscribe through itunes right so don't the new york times has a note you
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.100]  get it they make it very easy to sign up and they make it apparently very very hard to
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.380]  it's like comcast right yeah was it hard you had to you have to call so the trick is that
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:25.820]  you so yeah i mean they say that you you have to call them um and then you know be berated
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:32.780]  by somebody um to you know like trying to cajole you into into staying on as a subscriber
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:38.860]  uh but you can also do it through uh web chat ah is that what your site so i did it i did
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:44.400]  it that way and and you still get you still get them they still try and you know they
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.100]  offer you they apologize profusely or you know like maybe you've misunderstood what
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.980]  you read about the you know the nice nazi gentleman um but uh you know here's you know
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:59.540]  like how about if we give you like a year of like you know at a reduced rate or something
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:10.540]  like that it's like nope that's one nazi too many one is one too many did you watch the
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:16.420]  the state of the union that's right trumpy i try i there is not enough liquor in the
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:22.900]  house for me to do that and there's a lot of liquor in this house uh i missed it live
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:29.540]  i was uh traveling and i came voted i tivoed it i had amy tivo i requested that she tivo
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:39.120]  um i would you do that to yourself and cracked open a beer and i started i started just a
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:47.620]  beer and i started watching and uh i was okay with the the five minutes later you're shaking
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:54.760]  a martini i i was okay with the opening and and it's like you know i'm i don't i don't
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.060]  like the guy i i didn't like george w bush either and but i always watch george w i always
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.460]  watch the state of the union i feel like it's something you know civic responsibility yeah
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.320]  civic responsibility and when george w bush would get up there and dick cheney's behind
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:15.180]  him because the vice president sits behind him uh i would think i don't like these guys
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:20.340]  but i would i thought to myself that's this is the nature of a democracy though i've you
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.980]  know yeah i've got decades ahead and there will be times when there's a president that
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:30.060]  who i like and respect and there will be presidents who i disagree with and that's just the way
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.420]  it goes so i was okay with that part of it like i don't like trump i don't like mike
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:40.900]  pence i think he's really weird i think they're doing some bad things but the the whole intro
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.520]  part you know like here he is the president of the united states and he comes in and people
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:51.980]  are clapping and he's soaking it up but then he starts talking and then he opened his mouth
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.980]  he he did this thing amy why amy was already asleep but she watched some of it live and
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.920]  she had to stop too i i i don't know how far i got into i think i got about 20 minutes
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.160]  i had to turn it off and it was it was either that or like you said go make a martini bush
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.420]  used to make me angry too but i i did watch a few of of his at the at least and i would
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:16.140]  you know like yell at the television and stuff like that but i could i could watch him um
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.680]  the thing i can't i can't even listen to him the thing that got me and amy noted the same
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.160]  thing and she's like did you notice this thing where he he'd say something and it would be
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.660]  an applause line for like the republicans in the audience and they'd they would break
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:36.100]  into the speech with applause uh and when that would happen he would back away from
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:42.880]  the podium and clap himself and you can just imagine a way you know like the the trumpy
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.280]  way that he like kind of takes two steps back and gets a smirk on his face and he starts
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:54.160]  clapping for himself he clapped in his own speech like that i couldn't take it i i had
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.580]  to i had to shut it off yeah it was just it was torture i really and the other thing that
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:08.180]  got me was it was it was a bizarre combination of he would say things that it's clearly not
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:14.420]  that's not what you're doing you're you you i don't know you say you're protecting the
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:19.660]  environment you're not actually actually you're the epa chief is actually like ripping out
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:25.380]  regulations to keep water clean you're not doing selling off public you know vast swaths
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:29.300]  of public land right development you're saying that you're doing this great work for the
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.180]  public land and environment and you're actually doing the opposite and that made i couldn't
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.860]  take it and then the other thing is that he would say things that it's like yes that's
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:48.460]  exactly why i hate you like he was very clear about uh non-white people not not being welcome
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.780]  like yeah that's just the part where i had to i had to shut it off it was talking about
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:58.140]  immigration and and he says something like uh this is for citizens but he's complaining
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.780]  about the fact that immigrants citizens of the united states who are immigrants from
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:08.340]  other countries are allowed to bring family members over he's like they're bringing over
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:13.740]  all of these people but these are any any you know he lied too because he was he uh
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.380]  expanded the list of people that you're allowed to bring over and this is there's another
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.820]  it does a great twitter exchange about this today like there's a woman who said that he
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.100]  lied and you know because that's not true that these are all these other you know like
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:32.140]  he's more different distant relatives you're allowed to bring in um and some somebody actually
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:40.060]  actually heard her actually at heard i can't say that right obviously um and uh she just
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:50.500]  replied i'm a fucking immigration lawyer oh my god that's so great well but do you really
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.380]  do what do you really know about immigration yeah right right you know nothing about this
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:10:02.500]  says guy with 18 followers on twitter right actually oh my god all right let me take a

[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:57.660]  how about the super bowl you excited about the super bowl no it is a weird it's weird
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:03.980]  being a non-eagles fan in philadelphia with the eagles in the super bowl um if the city
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:09.860]  is nuts and deserved oh i would imagine yeah because philadelphia is sort of a long-suffering
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:17.060]  town the the i think the last big team championship was the phillies in 2008 and then prior to
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:22.340]  that uh i swear to god i think it was i'm not making this up i think it was the 1983
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:30.160]  sixers so it's quite a long stretch there whereas when i was a kid philly was like championship
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.860]  city the flyers won in 77 the phillies won in 80 the sixers were fantastic every year
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:41.280]  uh and won in 83 and then they had this long stretch and now and the eagles have never
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.840]  won a super bowl they've won what the weird thing about the super bowl is that it the
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.280]  they only started calling it the super bowl 52 years ago prior to that it was just the
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:57.180]  nfl championship game so the eagles won that at some point in the 60s but the 60s is a
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:09.660]  long time ago a bit and uh patriots i think the patriots have won once or at least uh
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:15.560]  so there's a very interesting you know boston and philly are good natural rival towns it's
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.540]  not quite up to the level of like new york and philly new york and philly was pretty
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:28.100]  it's pretty always pretty exciting but boston's pretty good and um uh it's such a strange
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:34.820]  mixture of one team that is literally there every single year yeah right right and yeah
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:38.540]  i mean and now you i mean what's funny is like i think for some reason hank has latched
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:43.360]  on to the patriots huh and i don't i don't i think maybe it's because um his cousin who
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:51.340]  he loves uh my brother lives in vermont and um he so my nephew tends to like boston area
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.880]  team so he's a big red sax fan and um and i don't i don't know if he's like much of
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:01.320]  a patriots fan frankly though um but i think maybe hank has like uh got the gotten the
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.900]  idea that he is yeah um and i also think it's a it's just like he knows that it's something
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:13.140]  that makes people mad so so he likes to say you know like boy i hope the patriots beat
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:18.260]  so you know whoever um so he's he's rooting for he's rooting for the patriots which is
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.880]  you know i think clearly the wrong team to root for but it's a good feeling i my my
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.180]  beloved dallas cowboys used to be that team you know in the 90s they were almost unbeatable
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:32.220]  the only team that could beat them was the san francisco 49ers and then whichever there
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:37.860]  was like a five-year run in there where whoever won the nfc championship between san fran
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:49.060]  and dallas would then go on to steamroll the buffalo bills yeah yeah uh it's such a strange
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.620]  dichotomy though the eagles fans are so desperate for a championship and and i honestly i it's
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:59.140]  a football town i think of all the teams in philly the one that has the most fans is the
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:04.620]  eagles uh people are nuts for the eagles here they're in particularly nuts for this team
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.980]  right any eagles team that was going to super bowl would be popular but they really there
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:13.060]  seem to be some characters on this team that really the the city just loves um yeah i forget
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.860]  a lot i mean there's a lot of eagles fans in new jersey too oh tons tons i mean like
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.500]  i would think that they're more i don't know the demographics but i would think there are
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:24.440]  more eagles fans in new jersey than there are like giants fans uh that's you know it's exactly
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.260]  what you think geographically you know there's parts of so just you know further north is
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:33.020]  yeah you know further north of new jersey is you know it's like which networks do you
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:37.580]  get you get do you get new york channels or philly channels the lousy parts of new jersey
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:44.340]  for the giants and the good parts are for the eagles uh i forget his first name but
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:49.220]  it's you know you know how he longed the tv announcer he used to we were kids he was uh
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:54.980]  um all pro on the raiders his son is on the team i think he's chris long um i think that's
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:01.620]  his name but he donated his uh his whole salary to like schools he's you know like in the
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.980]  10th year of his career and he's you know he's like i've made tons of money playing
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.260]  football so here i'll just give my money only donate my whole salary this year to like schools
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.840]  like people love this guy of course right i mean that's amazing what a pretty cool thing
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:24.100]  to do uh so anyway i i fear for the soul of the city if they if they lose in the property
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.940]  i don't think property if they win i think that it might i i think the property might
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.880]  be more of a problem if they win i think that if they lose people are just it's gonna just
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.540]  crush their they won't have the the spirit to go riot yeah usually yeah usually i mean
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:44.340]  the one the one uh counter example i can think of that rule is is uh vancouver right didn't
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:50.000]  vancouver lost the oh yeah yeah championship yes like trash to the place yeah really to
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.320]  really trash the place i mean like like wow that i mean like like calling it a riot was
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:02.100]  not an exaggeration that was bad news i mean and i don't get i know i don't i don't sanction
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:07.180]  either one really but when i kind of understand i feel like i understand the winning thing
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:10.720]  a little bit more maybe which doesn't i don't maybe that doesn't make sense did you see
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.040]  the thing where they have to uh they have to grease the poles here in philly yes the
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:22.100]  chrisco cops it's syracuse would know it's like an italian thing and you know it comes
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:29.660]  from south philly and in italy they uh there's like a tradition of uh like on like a like
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:34.340]  if there's like a uh some holiday you know and it's in italy there's you know like in
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:39.780]  the godfather there's going to be a singing and dancing and a parade and um and one of
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:45.900]  the traditional contests is like uh climbing up a greased pole like how who can climb to
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:50.740]  the top of a greased pole so the fact that the cops are are greasing the poles that's
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:57.140]  not really stopping anybody like they i think i'm stealing paul kafass has tweeted me like
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:02.020]  a thing about how that it's like a tradition in in south philly italian festivals to climb
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.860]  a greased poise like they train for this
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:16.980]  good luck with that i remember when the phillies won in 2008 i went out and um the big street
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:22.540]  here is broad street where people go to celebrate and there was a young man who was at the top
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:28.420]  of a light pole and there was a cop standing at the foot of the base a woman and i said
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.380]  to her i said are you just waiting for him to come down so you can write him a ticket
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:38.340]  and she goes yep and i was like and you're just gonna wait and she's like yep i told
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:46.660]  him not to go up she's like i gave him a chance and he that's great i've got a theory here's
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:51.940]  my theory my my my are you gonna watch the game do you watch the super bowl um yeah we'll
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:57.660]  probably yeah we usually we usually watch um just because yeah um it's just and uh yeah
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:03.980]  so we may actually go over to karen's parents house um their apartment and watch with them
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:09.160]  here's my theory i come up with a theory about why the patriots will lose every year and
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:15.380]  i'm often wrong much to the detriment of my wagering but i've got it that's why he had
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:20.780]  to go to the the bank that's why i had to go i i think i've got this one figured out
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:26.740]  we'll see how this stands up here's my theory john my theory is that i salute the patriots
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.420]  for being very good every year and and that's hard to do in any sport and it's particularly
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:37.400]  hard in the nfl the nfl is a sport even if you're not a fan it it's a sport where teams
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.540]  come out of nowhere like in the team that was good last year might not be good this
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.420]  year just one year to the next you know the eagles were were like seven and nine last
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.820]  year this year they were 13 and three they're heading to the super bowl it happens all the
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:54.580]  time somehow the new england patriots under bill belicheck and tom brady they're god damn
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:59.900]  it they're good every year so i salute them for that it is no other team has a stretch
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:06.460]  like they've had in the last 15 years but i my theory is that the price of being very
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:11.860]  good every year means that they are never great because to be great you have to load
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:17.380]  up for one year and then you know you'd lose the guys next year i looked up there there's
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:22.660]  the belicheck brady teams like the the final score of their super bowls win or lose it's
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:29.180]  like three three four three point two three point losses to the giant a four point win
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.940]  every game is three or four points it's always close they never have one of those teams that
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:38.100]  that loads up and you know wins 55 to 10 or something like that so that's my my theory
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.660]  is that they're always are you what you're gonna you're gonna try and beat the spread
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.740]  is that well the eagles are getting four and a half points so i think i think it's just
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:50.700]  i think it's a sound financial investment uh to wager on the on the eagles and even
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:57.380]  if you think even if you think uh you can't bet on eagles because somehow some way belicheck
