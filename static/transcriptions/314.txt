[00:00.000 --> 00:02.720]  So does this mean that you're not coming to my beach house this summer?
[00:02.720 --> 00:05.880]  No, I'm definitely coming to your beach house this summer.
[00:05.880 --> 00:10.600]  But I thought of that, I thought of that where the last few times that you've been on my
[00:10.600 --> 00:16.400]  show, it's always been me and you recording at, you know, while I've been at your house.
[00:16.400 --> 00:20.240]  But it's like, I would like to talk to you.
[00:20.240 --> 00:26.640]  And the other thing, and it really riled me up, is that I think you're really wrong about
[00:26.640 --> 00:27.640]  the air tags.
[00:27.640 --> 00:32.480]  I thought, look, the accessory, the design of them not having like a key loop.
[00:32.480 --> 00:33.480]  Is that?
[00:33.480 --> 00:34.480]  Yes.
[00:34.480 --> 00:35.480]  Yes.
[00:35.480 --> 00:36.480]  We'll get to that.
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.480]  We'll get to that.
[00:37.480 --> 00:38.480]  And talk about—
[00:38.480 --> 00:39.480]  That's gonna be our two-hour conversation.
[00:39.480 --> 00:40.480]  Right.
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.600]  So we talk about privilege, right, and, you know, privilege is a real thing.
[00:44.600 --> 00:53.960]  But my privilege is that when I get particularly riled up about an episode of ATP, I can get
[00:53.960 --> 00:55.920]  one of you on my show.
[00:55.920 --> 00:56.920]  I can get you—
[00:56.920 --> 00:59.320]  You can't fool us for two hours.
[00:59.320 --> 01:03.760]  I think you're wrong about putting a hole in the air tags.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.320]  I think the air tags are fine.
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.320]  I think they're fine.
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.800]  And your take for those—and I do, I always assume that most people who listen to my show
[01:11.800 --> 01:14.180]  listen to ATP as well.
[01:14.180 --> 01:18.360]  But your take on the air tags, I don't even want to put words in your mouth.
[01:18.360 --> 01:21.600]  Your take, though, is that they're poorly designed.
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.600]  Yeah.
[01:22.600 --> 01:28.440]  My take is the industrial design of them is just not good because such an incredibly common
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.000]  use case is you want to attach them to something somehow.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.760]  And the way, you know, if you look at like tile and all the other things that have done
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.160]  similar kinds of trackers before, they all have like a key loop hole in them.
[01:41.160 --> 01:44.700]  There's always like a hole in the corner or something where you can loop a key ring through.
[01:44.700 --> 01:48.840]  And you look at all the air tag accessories that are out there, and they're all basically
[01:48.840 --> 01:54.360]  ways to add a key loop by like having to encase the entire thing in some other layer of some
[01:54.360 --> 01:57.820]  other kind of material and then have a key loop off to the side or something like that.
[01:57.820 --> 02:02.480]  And so it could just save so much bulk and so many of these like high priced accessories,
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.280]  which I kind of cynically think maybe that's why I decided this way.
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.680]  But you know, there's—it's clear to me that this would be a much more functional object
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.340]  if it had a loop built into it that you could just loop any key ring through.
[02:15.340 --> 02:20.000]  But instead, they've made this like perfect, you know, UFO shape that you—it's not even
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.360]  flat on the top and bottom.
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.960]  So you can't even easily stick it to things like it's just it's kind of it's kind of a
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.680]  ridiculous object for the actual use cases in which I think it's actually going to be
[02:29.680 --> 02:30.680]  used.
[02:30.680 --> 02:38.440]  All right, so my counter argument is, I mean, I guess in theory, if it had a hole in it,
[02:38.440 --> 02:39.840]  that would be better.
[02:39.840 --> 02:42.200]  If it was exactly the same as it currently is.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.840]  That's my argument.
[02:43.840 --> 02:50.440]  But I don't know, I don't know how that would work with the replaceable battery pack, right?
[02:50.440 --> 02:56.520]  It's like, it's like all of a sudden, that seems that seems to make it more complicated.
[02:56.520 --> 03:03.520]  And the other the bigger factor is that okay, don't judge the accessory market by what's
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.320]  going on right now on June 20.
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.320]  What is it?
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.320]  21st?
[03:09.320 --> 03:10.320]  Or May 21.
[03:10.320 --> 03:11.320]  May.
[03:11.320 --> 03:12.320]  Close enough.
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.080]  If it was June, I would have missed WWDC already.
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.280]  You can tell how rattled I am after this week.
[03:17.280 --> 03:27.020]  But on May 21 2021, you can't judge the accessory market because you know that there are going
[03:27.020 --> 03:36.920]  to be like $3 rings on Amazon, as soon as probably by the time this episode comes out,
[03:36.920 --> 03:37.920]  you know what I mean?
[03:37.920 --> 03:40.560]  Like by next week is it's going to happen any day.
[03:40.560 --> 03:46.120]  All they were waiting for was to find out exactly how big these things are.
[03:46.120 --> 03:48.740]  And it's it's going to be much cheaper.
[03:48.740 --> 03:53.940]  Like to me, where your argument falls apart is the argument that hey, all of these rings
[03:53.940 --> 03:59.800]  that you put around the air tags cost like 20 bucks, which I agree is actually you know,
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.800]  too much.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.800]  And that's part of the argument.
[04:02.800 --> 04:04.720]  The other part is that it bulks it up.
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.400]  And it makes it you know, by definition, if you have to have some some kind of material
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.440]  that wraps around the air tag, you're basically adding a second casing to the air tag in at
[04:13.440 --> 04:15.240]  least most of its dimensions.
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.400]  And then you have to then have some other thing protruding from that to be able to offer
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.400]  a ring attachment.
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.440]  Yeah, but there's so it makes it big, but they're so small, you know, it's like a minimal
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.800]  ring with with a key ring attachment, to me is not going to make this too big.
[04:32.800 --> 04:34.040]  I don't know.
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.920]  You know what this product, it wouldn't surprise me if this was a Johnny I've like farewell
[04:38.920 --> 04:41.720]  product because it was designed a long time ago.
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.140]  We've heard all these stories about how like it was designed and ready to ship like two
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.140]  years ago.
[04:45.140 --> 04:47.240]  It was ready to go a while ago.
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.720]  This is maybe this is like the final Johnny I've send off.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.120]  We thought it was the Mac Pro.
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.120]  Maybe it's this.
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.460]  Well, and people have been like, like squinting at the fine print on like the little stickers
[04:56.460 --> 05:01.940]  on the boxes and and they do say there's some that I think they say like, copyright like
[05:01.940 --> 05:07.860]  2019 Yeah, I think it is.
[05:07.860 --> 05:13.360]  And there was a similar sentiment about the the new Apple TV, which we will get to that
[05:13.360 --> 05:15.680]  is on the schedule for the show.
[05:15.680 --> 05:22.640]  But the the Apple TV box that I got from Apple says, and the reason people are saying like,
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.120]  hey, when the hell was this supposed to come out?
[05:25.120 --> 05:29.000]  Because it says on the back of the box, you turn it upside down and it's like, hey, you
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.720]  can get great stereo, surround sound or whatever they call it, you know, awesome audio out
[05:35.720 --> 05:41.720]  of your home pods, the ones that are the full size home pods that are just discontinued.
[05:41.720 --> 05:45.440]  People are like, hey, maybe this was supposed to come out a while ago, but it does say copyright
[05:45.440 --> 05:51.420]  2021 on the back of the home pod box or Apple TV box, I can verify.
[05:51.420 --> 05:57.640]  So even if it's a little awkward that they're advertising how it works with full size home
[05:57.640 --> 06:06.200]  pods, which have been discontinued now for a couple of months, whatever degree of left
[06:06.200 --> 06:11.600]  hand not knowing what the right hand's doing within Apple on that it's it's all within
[06:11.600 --> 06:12.940]  2021.
[06:12.940 --> 06:19.400]  You know, but but the air tags thing having like a 2019 copyright is like, Hmm, I don't
[06:19.400 --> 06:20.400]  know.
[06:20.400 --> 06:27.600]  I there is sort of, you know, the the the other complaint that I do agree with.
[06:27.600 --> 06:30.960]  Is I kind of feel that they should be completely flat.
[06:30.960 --> 06:38.200]  I do feel that the fact that the the air tags are sort of, like you said, UFO shaped, you
[06:38.200 --> 06:39.200]  know, they're like capsules.
[06:39.200 --> 06:40.920]  I don't know what you want to call them.
[06:40.920 --> 06:41.920]  Right?
[06:41.920 --> 06:42.920]  It's a spree candy shape.
[06:42.920 --> 06:43.920]  Yeah, that's what it's gonna be like.
[06:43.920 --> 06:47.400]  It's a it's a if you ever had a spree candy, it's that exact shape just a little bigger.
[06:47.400 --> 06:48.400]  Okay.
[06:48.400 --> 06:49.400]  How about this?
[06:49.400 --> 06:54.620]  Can we take an aside and talk about the fact that Siracusa didn't know what a spree was?
[06:54.620 --> 06:55.620]  He knows everything.
[06:55.620 --> 06:56.620]  How did he not know?
[06:56.620 --> 06:59.140]  How do you not know what a spree was?
[06:59.140 --> 07:03.000]  sprees are where they they were like my favorite candy.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.640]  Yeah, when you get like the bag of Halloween candy, like after trick or treating, like
[07:06.640 --> 07:08.640]  I think the sprees were one of the first things to go.
[07:08.640 --> 07:09.640]  Right?
[07:09.640 --> 07:14.280]  Because like, you know, you got like your Reese's peanut butter cups, which is the Yeah,
[07:14.280 --> 07:15.960]  that's obviously tier one.
[07:15.960 --> 07:16.960]  Right?
[07:16.960 --> 07:18.160]  Snickers.
[07:18.160 --> 07:19.160]  That's tier one.
[07:19.160 --> 07:20.640]  Yeah, it's up there.
[07:20.640 --> 07:21.640]  Yeah.
[07:21.640 --> 07:23.920]  For me, a Snickers is is way up there.
[07:23.920 --> 07:26.960]  But the sprees are way at the top, right?
[07:26.960 --> 07:32.420]  And like, if we call the 50 yard line for a Halloween candy, I would call the 50 yard
[07:32.420 --> 07:34.640]  line at a sweetheart, right?
[07:34.640 --> 07:39.400]  Because sweethearts are like, ah, it's like, it's good enough to eat, you're always going
[07:39.400 --> 07:40.680]  to eat them.
[07:40.680 --> 07:46.960]  But it's like, it's just it's it's just like sugar packed into a into a tablet.
[07:46.960 --> 07:47.960]  You know what I mean?
[07:47.960 --> 07:51.480]  It's sweethearts are kind of like filler, like it's like, it wasn't bad filler that
[07:51.480 --> 07:52.480]  you're not going to eat.
[07:52.480 --> 07:55.440]  You're still gonna eat it, but you're not looking forward to like devouring all the
[07:55.440 --> 07:56.440]  sweettarts.
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.440]  Yeah.
[07:57.440 --> 07:58.440]  It's sprees.
[07:58.440 --> 07:59.440]  Those are going first.
[07:59.440 --> 08:00.440]  Oh, it's sprees.
[08:00.440 --> 08:01.440]  We're assuming you're out of peanut butter cups.
[08:01.440 --> 08:02.440]  You're up for the sprees.
[08:02.440 --> 08:03.440]  Oh, the sprees are fantastic.
[08:03.440 --> 08:08.840]  And the other thing too, is aside from Halloween, when you had a couple of bucks to buy candy,
[08:08.840 --> 08:12.100]  a roll of sprees, man, that that was great.
[08:12.100 --> 08:16.920]  And it bought you so much social capital, where you could like, somebody be like, Oh,
[08:16.920 --> 08:17.920]  you have a roll of sprees.
[08:17.920 --> 08:18.920]  Can I have one?
[08:18.920 --> 08:22.440]  And you'd be like, Yeah, and then you get easily shared.
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.680]  Yeah, easily shared and just really fun candy.
[08:26.680 --> 08:37.240]  I cannot believe that John Siracusa, of all people, a consumer of North American pop culture
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.200]  had no idea what a spree was.
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.320]  And the other thing, it really bothered me that neither you nor the what's the other
[08:44.320 --> 08:47.760]  guy's name?
[08:47.760 --> 08:49.800]  What is I'm so sorry.
[08:49.800 --> 08:52.520]  I can't Casey lists.
[08:52.520 --> 08:53.520]  Yes.
[08:53.520 --> 08:54.520]  Casey lists.
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.520]  Casey lists.
[08:55.520 --> 08:56.520]  Oh, my God.
[08:56.520 --> 08:57.520]  He's gonna kill you.
[08:57.520 --> 08:58.520]  That's it.
[08:58.520 --> 08:59.520]  He's on his way to your house.
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.640]  I'm not good with names, Margo.
[09:02.640 --> 09:03.640]  He's fully vaccinated.
[09:03.640 --> 09:04.640]  Now you got to watch out.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.640]  You can travel now.
[09:05.640 --> 09:10.320]  But neither you nor the other guy called him out on not knowing what a spree was.
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.180]  To me, that should have been like lift, lift the needle off the record.
[09:14.180 --> 09:15.660]  The show is over.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.960]  How do you not know what a spree is?
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.320]  You should have paused the show and made him go out and buy some sprees.
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.080]  Because I kind of feel like he would have been like, Oh, oh, those are sprees.
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.080]  Okay, I got him.
[09:28.080 --> 09:29.880]  You know, he did know what they were.
[09:29.880 --> 09:31.500]  But again, maybe not.
[09:31.500 --> 09:34.560]  Maybe he grew up in like a weird neighborhood where there was like no sprees.
[09:34.560 --> 09:35.560]  I don't know.
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.640]  Sprees are great.
[09:36.640 --> 09:37.640]  He grew up on Long Island.
[09:37.640 --> 09:39.320]  They have regular candy here.
[09:39.320 --> 09:41.000]  Like it's not that different.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.760]  It was a great description.
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.420]  As soon as you said it, I'm listening to your show.
[09:45.420 --> 09:48.600]  And as soon as you said, it's sort of like a spree.
[09:48.600 --> 09:51.560]  I was like, yes, that's, that's the perfect description.
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.560]  And it is a little weird that neither side is flat.
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.600]  Even the silver side underside is perfectly flat.
[09:58.600 --> 09:59.600]  And I was like, that's perfect.
[09:59.600 --> 10:02.160]  And he's like, I don't know what a spree is, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.160]  And it's like, what the?
[10:03.160 --> 10:07.440]  And all of a sudden, I just lost the track of the AirTags discussion.
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.440]  And I'm like, how do you not know what a spree is?
[10:10.440 --> 10:11.440]  Yeah.
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.960]  And it's like, I feel like it's like, it's, it's very kind of stereotypical Apple design
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.120]  of six years ago of like, it's, they made a beautiful object in a category where the
[10:23.120 --> 10:26.360]  beauty of the object is, is not that important.
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.280]  And what is important is like the real world kind of ergonomics or functionality of the
[10:31.280 --> 10:32.280]  thing.
[10:32.280 --> 10:36.720]  And I feel like not having a key loop really, or a keyhole, I guess, a loophole, whatever
[10:36.720 --> 10:40.840]  they call it, the hole in the plastic, you could loop a key ring through not having that.
[10:40.840 --> 10:46.000]  I think is one of those areas where like, I think if Apple redesigned this product next
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.640]  year, you know, new Apple seems to be kind of writing old wrongs, you know, in a lot
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.400]  of ways with like the laptop stuff and the keyboards and, you know, the rumored port
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.400]  changes.
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.880]  And, you know, obviously the whole M one series of stuff like it seemed like they're really
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.100]  they're going through like writing old wrongs.
[11:01.100 --> 11:05.700]  And I feel like this product looks like it was made two years ago, or three years ago
[11:05.700 --> 11:09.660]  by the old design team that was more obsessed with looks and functionality.
[11:09.660 --> 11:14.080]  And that maybe the new design team ever since Johnny went into the sky, maybe they wouldn't
[11:14.080 --> 11:15.800]  have put out this exact design.
[11:15.800 --> 11:17.680]  It would be better.
[11:17.680 --> 11:18.680]  That's the thing.
[11:18.680 --> 11:22.400]  It would be better if it had an integrated hole.
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.080]  There's no how can you argue that it wouldn't be better if it was exactly the same, no difference
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.200]  except an integrated hole.
[11:30.200 --> 11:35.960]  And and if somehow when you take the back off to swap the battery, if if there's only
[11:35.960 --> 11:42.840]  one way to screw the back back on and the one way is that once it's back on, the hole
[11:42.840 --> 11:44.680]  is perfectly oriented.
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.320]  In fact, maybe it would even be better because then it would prove that you've screwed the
[11:49.320 --> 11:51.780]  back on the right way, right, right.
[11:51.780 --> 12:02.460]  But I do feel though, that there's going to be a gazillion $3 AirTag holders and AirTag.
[12:02.460 --> 12:06.840]  You know, like your example of putting it on the bikes on the island, you know, there's
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.400]  gonna be there's gonna there's gonna be just give them a month or two, right.
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.380]  And there's gonna be like a gazillion ways to do it.
[12:16.380 --> 12:23.720]  It is sort of the, again, to bring up Syracuse, to me, it is sort of the naked robotic core,
[12:23.720 --> 12:29.140]  like they know nobody's going to use these things other than like what putting them in
[12:29.140 --> 12:34.240]  your purse or your laptop bag.
[12:34.240 --> 12:38.920]  Most use cases require some kind of attachment.
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.060]  I just don't think it's as bad as as you make it out to be, though.
[12:44.060 --> 12:48.260]  It's just, yeah, it's it's the in reality, this is not a thing that's going to massively
[12:48.260 --> 12:50.000]  impact my life.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.260]  But it just seems like a weird misstep.
[12:53.260 --> 12:54.840]  That's so obvious to me.
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.840]  Yeah.
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.880]  Well, and it to me, the the the the product that it brings to mind is the the Apple TV
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.960]  remote, which I just wrote about God.
[13:05.960 --> 13:10.840]  But that's the one where it's like, do you even use the goddamn thing?
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.840]  How can this be?
[13:11.840 --> 13:12.840]  You know,
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.400]  can we just celebrate?
[13:14.400 --> 13:15.400]  That's fine.
[13:15.400 --> 13:16.400]  I don't have mine yet.
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.600]  But can we can we celebrate that era is finally over?
[13:18.600 --> 13:20.360]  It's so happy.
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.980]  It's the greatest thing in my life.
[13:21.980 --> 13:23.920]  It's so great.
[13:23.920 --> 13:25.600]  So is it really as good as you as you wrote?
[13:25.600 --> 13:26.600]  Yeah, it really.
[13:26.600 --> 13:27.600]  I Well, of course.
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.840]  What do you think I'm going to do lie about it?
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.920]  I just I almost can't believe it.
[13:32.920 --> 13:36.120]  Like until I have it in my hand, which is probably not going to be until tomorrow, I
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.520]  I'm just not going to believe that they could possibly have fixed this, this, you know,
[13:40.520 --> 13:42.440]  six year long mistake.
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.240]  But I guess again, this is like this is Apple writing old wrongs.
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.080]  And this is, you know, it's been a repeating pattern.
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.660]  You know, they, they fix the butterfly keyboards, they fixed a lot of, you know, laptop issues
[13:51.660 --> 13:53.840]  with the M one stuff.
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.160]  They are allegedly about to kill the touch bar and make laptops even better.
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.240]  And like, it seems like this is really like on a good path here of like, okay, there were
[14:02.240 --> 14:03.540]  some mistakes made.
[14:03.540 --> 14:07.840]  They took a suspiciously and frustratingly long time to get fixed.
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.160]  But at least now they are finally getting fixed.
[14:11.160 --> 14:12.160]  Yeah.
[14:12.160 --> 14:14.760]  Well, let's see what happens with their tags.
[14:14.760 --> 14:15.760]  I don't know.
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.120]  It is you think we're ever gonna hear about them again?
[14:20.120 --> 14:27.080]  You know, I wonder because it is it's it's also a very curious device for Apple, right?
[14:27.080 --> 14:33.000]  Because it's not really a peripheral to a thing.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.520]  Like it really, it really does seem like the sort of thing that would be better if they
[14:38.520 --> 14:44.280]  just and I can't even think of another example where this applies, where it would be better
[14:44.280 --> 14:54.560]  if they just purely published a specification for here is how you can make a tracker that
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.600]  contributes to the find my network, rather than them selling them themselves.
[15:00.600 --> 15:03.480]  You know, it it.
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.320]  But on the other hand, maybe they felt like they really had a good idea.
[15:07.320 --> 15:08.880]  I don't know.
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.440]  Well, certainly, you know, I'm sure they thought that, you know, they would rather have the
[15:14.440 --> 15:18.360]  control over the design and over the product and everything that integrates with their
[15:18.360 --> 15:21.120]  system so tightly, like they'd rather have that control themselves.
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.080]  You know, it has so much tight system integration with like the setup little overlay thing and
[15:25.080 --> 15:27.520]  the constant Bluetooth network.
[15:27.520 --> 15:29.240]  And you know, the kind of low power Bluetooth network thing.
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.000]  I mean, I think the only reason we didn't get it earlier was because, you know, probably,
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.360]  you know, part of it was probably because of COVID delays and something.
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.000]  And in this case, the exposure notification API that they developed for COVID is based
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.260]  on the same network and technologies that these use.
[15:46.260 --> 15:50.500]  It's basically that network just used in a slightly different way.
[15:50.500 --> 15:52.640]  So like, it seemed like they had a lot of this stuff in place already.
[15:52.640 --> 15:56.400]  And the fact that this seemed to be ready to go two years ago, I think maybe what held
[15:56.400 --> 16:02.400]  them back was antitrust stuff coming up with and knowing that tile was going to be one
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.480]  of the companies that was going to really get up their butts about stuff that maybe
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.520]  Apple thought, okay, let's wait until we have the third party accessory program out the
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.320]  door first, before we release ours.
[16:13.320 --> 16:16.520]  I think that's probably, you know, if there were any delays from COVID, you know, add
[16:16.520 --> 16:17.740]  that to it.
[16:17.740 --> 16:22.700]  But I think both of those factored into why this product seems to have been just waiting
[16:22.700 --> 16:24.900]  to be released for almost two years.
[16:24.900 --> 16:28.320]  I definitely don't see them only doing the third party thing.
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.420]  Because this is the kind of thing it's just like how, you know, Apple makes so many like
[16:32.420 --> 16:37.400]  weird little like leather pouches and stuff for other devices that I don't know why anybody
[16:37.400 --> 16:40.240]  would buy based on how what they are and how much they cost.
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.300]  But like, you know, they make a lot of accessories that we don't usually even talk about that
[16:44.300 --> 16:46.460]  aren't barely even worth mentioning.
[16:46.460 --> 16:48.920]  But they do make a ton of accessories.
[16:48.920 --> 16:50.240]  Sometimes they're they're pretty nice.
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.240]  I use some of them myself.
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.960]  I even use that weird flip open white MagSafe charger duo thing like I actually bought two
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.400]  of those.
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.400]  And even though there was like 100 bucks or whatever 130 bucks for those, it was I felt
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.440]  like such a jerk buying those but they did solve a need that I had at that time very
[17:08.440 --> 17:09.440]  well.
[17:09.440 --> 17:11.040]  So I don't regret having bought them.
[17:11.040 --> 17:17.400]  You know, it's like Apple has this whole world of kind of weirdly expensive kind of weirdly
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.140]  limited sometimes accessories that we don't usually talk about.
[17:21.140 --> 17:26.460]  And I think the air tags would have probably just been that and all the stuff that goes
[17:26.460 --> 17:31.680]  that attaches to them would have probably just been more of that category of thing.
[17:31.680 --> 17:35.040]  Had they not been seemingly delayed for two years without explanation.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.560]  Like that's, you know, see also air power, right?
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.560]  Just that had a different ending.
[17:39.560 --> 17:44.020]  But like what made these products interesting to all of us tech nerds out here talking about
[17:44.020 --> 17:46.560]  this is like, why haven't they released that yet?
[17:46.560 --> 17:47.560]  What happened?
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.440]  You know, and that the question of what happened is a much more interesting story than the
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.200]  actual products once we actually have them in our hands because like, oh, okay, well,
[17:56.200 --> 17:58.040]  it's a tile but made by Apple and better.
[17:58.040 --> 18:00.120]  Okay, well, not a very exciting product.
[18:00.120 --> 18:01.780]  But hey, if you need it, it works.
[18:01.780 --> 18:08.200]  The other thing I think the antitrust stuff probably figured in and I think that the privacy
[18:08.200 --> 18:18.100]  like anti anti stalking stuff, yeah, figured in and it seems like they didn't really figure
[18:18.100 --> 18:24.120]  that out until very recently and not that they didn't think about it all along, but
[18:24.120 --> 18:29.560]  that they didn't figure out what best to do about it.
[18:29.560 --> 18:35.380]  Like I feel like there's, to me, there's a sense of okay, let's say that the the air
[18:35.380 --> 18:40.440]  tags were ready to go 18 months ago, and they could have shipped them like a year and a
[18:40.440 --> 18:43.280]  half ago.
[18:43.280 --> 18:49.120]  It seems to me like the contingent with an apple that not that there was a dispute, I
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.280]  bet everybody was like, yeah, we don't want these things to be used for stalking people
[18:53.280 --> 18:55.640]  or tracking them against their will.
[18:55.640 --> 18:59.200]  But the what do we build in?
[18:59.200 --> 19:08.320]  How do we how do we accommodate that use case, which is an anti use case, maybe took longer
[19:08.320 --> 19:14.160]  to come to fruition and actually ship then then they anticipated?
[19:14.160 --> 19:16.440]  Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me at all.
[19:16.440 --> 19:20.240]  Because certainly, like that's that's one angle that you would you could totally foresee
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.520]  them having developed this product 95% of the way and then at the very end, somebody's
[19:24.520 --> 19:27.920]  like, wait a minute, what what about this use case?
[19:27.920 --> 19:31.240]  And they're like, Oh, no, we have to figure all this out.
[19:31.240 --> 19:34.880]  And then, you know, holding it back until they really have a good solution for that.
[19:34.880 --> 19:37.200]  And that's, that's a very complicated problems, problem space.
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.520]  I mean, you know, Apple does things under a lot more scrutiny than anybody like, you
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.200]  know, Tyler, anybody smaller, heck, even Android makers have way less scrutiny on them than
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.500]  Apple does.
[19:46.500 --> 19:51.160]  And so, you know, they have to think about things and design for things and accommodate,
[19:51.160 --> 19:58.000]  you know, failure modes and flaws, way more carefully and with way more diligence than
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.940]  almost anyone else in the business, like, you know, if Apple releases something that
[20:00.940 --> 20:04.840]  has a problem, it's going to be a headline everywhere, it's going to be like, you know,
[20:04.840 --> 20:05.840]  breaking news.
[20:05.840 --> 20:10.800]  Whereas, you know, if if somebody much smaller releases something that can be used by stalkers
[20:10.800 --> 20:14.440]  or whatever, like, it would it wouldn't even make the news at all.
[20:14.440 --> 20:18.880]  Well, and there's art there have already been a couple of stories, you know, like Fast Company
[20:18.880 --> 20:23.840]  had a story, I forget who else did, but there've already been a couple of stories like, hey,
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.540]  you could use air tags to stalk somebody.
[20:27.540 --> 20:31.420]  And so we haven't even gotten to the point where somebody's actually done it, it's going
[20:31.420 --> 20:32.420]  to happen.
[20:32.420 --> 20:34.200]  There's no doubt about it, right.
[20:34.200 --> 20:40.880]  To me, Apple's perspective on this is probably, look, even if we don't get into this, these
[20:40.880 --> 20:49.300]  devices already exist, why should we stay out of this just to avoid the stalking situation?
[20:49.300 --> 20:54.600]  It all leads to the sort of thinking like, ah, yeah, I can sort of see why they sat on
[20:54.600 --> 20:56.360]  it for a year and a half, you know?
[20:56.360 --> 20:59.740]  Yeah, like they had to, I mean, look, there was there was even like the drama with the
[20:59.740 --> 21:04.300]  Australian Safety Commission, I forget the actual name of it, but it's like the Australian
[21:04.300 --> 21:06.740]  version of like the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
[21:06.740 --> 21:11.600]  And they determined that it was too easy to get the battery out for like children to get
[21:11.600 --> 21:12.600]  the battery.
[21:12.600 --> 21:13.600]  Right, right.
[21:13.600 --> 21:17.180]  And because it's a lithium battery, and the positive and negative terminals are very physically
[21:17.180 --> 21:18.180]  close to each other.
[21:18.180 --> 21:22.320]  And so you could theoretically take it out, short circuit it with some small piece of
[21:22.320 --> 21:25.480]  metal and have like a heat or fire risk on your hands.
[21:25.480 --> 21:30.060]  So you know, even that got criticized like instantly upon its release.
[21:30.060 --> 21:33.260]  So yeah, they definitely have a lot of scrutiny on them.
[21:33.260 --> 21:39.220]  I almost feel like, you know, we've we have had this kind of line in our head for a while
[21:39.220 --> 21:40.220]  as Apple commentators.
[21:40.220 --> 21:43.420]  Like, you know, Apple only interest markets where they can make a big difference or whatever,
[21:43.420 --> 21:46.780]  or their core companies, they really, they really want to focus on their core competencies.
[21:46.780 --> 21:50.260]  And that's why they don't make Wi Fi routers anymore, or printers or whatever, right.
[21:50.260 --> 21:53.060]  But you look at this, you're like, well, did they really need to make this?
[21:53.060 --> 21:59.220]  I mean, on one hand, it is way better, way better than anything else out there because
[21:59.220 --> 22:01.220]  of the integration it has with the system.
[22:01.220 --> 22:03.980]  And that's something like, you know, tile and anybody else trying to make these things,
[22:03.980 --> 22:06.980]  they will never be able to match that unless they just go into the MFI program of just
[22:06.980 --> 22:09.700]  making these things which commoditizes their entire business.
[22:09.700 --> 22:14.380]  No one else running a regular third party app on iOS could ever make a system that finds
[22:14.380 --> 22:15.880]  things as effectively as these do.
[22:15.880 --> 22:20.740]  It's just not accessible to third party apps on that level, which is its own potential
[22:20.740 --> 22:23.620]  antitrust problem, but that's different discussion.
[22:23.620 --> 22:27.700]  So on one hand, you can say Apple can make a difference here and they made a product
[22:27.700 --> 22:32.980]  that is way better than what anything else out there can be without using like GPS and
[22:32.980 --> 22:33.980]  stuff.
[22:33.980 --> 22:38.660]  But it almost, you know, a lot of Apple's recent moves, and this might lead to a larger
[22:38.660 --> 22:41.340]  discussion, but a lot of Apple's recent moves.
[22:41.340 --> 22:42.340]  Remember that that story?
[22:42.340 --> 22:43.340]  I forget where this was from.
[22:43.340 --> 22:48.860]  But there was a story back like in the 90s or whatever, where I think it was like somebody's
[22:48.860 --> 22:54.340]  grandmother was describing Bill Gates as like, he's the kind of kid who would come over to
[22:54.340 --> 22:57.820]  your house and for dinner, and he would say, Oh, I'll take all the potatoes.
[22:57.820 --> 22:58.820]  Yeah.
[22:58.820 --> 22:59.820]  Yeah.
[22:59.820 --> 23:00.820]  Remember that?
[23:00.820 --> 23:01.820]  It was O'Reilly.
[23:01.820 --> 23:04.380]  What's the guy?
[23:04.380 --> 23:07.180]  Who's the guy who's the founder of O'Reilly?
[23:07.180 --> 23:09.180]  You know, the Tim O'Reilly.
[23:09.180 --> 23:10.180]  Yeah.
[23:10.180 --> 23:15.360]  Tim O'Reilly said that he said that when he was describing the Microsoft antitrust case
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.080]  to his mother, she said he sounds Bill Gates sounds like the sort of fellow who would come
[23:20.080 --> 23:23.260]  over to your house for for Thanksgiving and say, Oh, thank you.
[23:23.260 --> 23:29.380]  I'll take all the mashed potatoes and like at the beginning of the Thanksgiving dinner.
[23:29.380 --> 23:32.380]  And it's like, uh, yeah, leaving nothing for anybody else.
[23:32.380 --> 23:33.380]  Right.
[23:33.380 --> 23:37.820]  And I feel like that that is really how Apple is starting to seem.
[23:37.820 --> 23:42.820]  I think Apple's looking around any industry that they could possibly get into at this
[23:42.820 --> 23:44.940]  point that that looks lucrative to them.
[23:44.940 --> 23:48.180]  I think they're very hungry for all of the money.
[23:48.180 --> 23:51.900]  And because and on some level, you can kind of understand like from from a like, you know,
[23:51.900 --> 23:56.780]  business financial perspective, they, they need growth to keep their investors happy
[23:56.780 --> 23:59.380]  and the stock and everything else that they need growth.
[23:59.380 --> 24:03.460]  But they're already such a massive company with so many massively profitable businesses
[24:03.460 --> 24:08.380]  that in order to get growth, they have to keep doing more and more stuff, much of which
[24:08.380 --> 24:10.580]  will be kind of gross.
[24:10.580 --> 24:14.300]  And so like, that's why like, you know, they keep launching all these businesses that they're
[24:14.300 --> 24:18.960]  just moving into whatever areas they can because they're really hungry for an ever increasing
[24:18.960 --> 24:19.960]  amount of money.
[24:19.960 --> 24:24.540]  And so on one hand, this looks like, okay, they make a meaningful difference to this
[24:24.540 --> 24:27.580]  to this category of product and making one that works better.
[24:27.580 --> 24:31.820]  On the other hand, you asked, like, why would Apple bother doing something like this that
[24:31.820 --> 24:35.900]  that has, you know, not that much impact on the world, and it might be kind of risky PR
[24:35.900 --> 24:36.900]  wise.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.700]  And I think the answer is, they thought they could make more money.
[24:39.700 --> 24:45.380]  And I think the answer the reason they have all these weird $25 accessories to solve basic
[24:45.380 --> 24:48.140]  design flaws on it is that they wanted even more of that money.
[24:48.140 --> 24:51.800]  And accessories are very high profit business for them, because they, they can make something
[24:51.800 --> 24:55.580]  pretty nice out of some decent leather and sell it for like three times what it got at
[24:55.580 --> 25:00.940]  least maybe 10 times what you know what it cost them to make and, and so part of what
[25:00.940 --> 25:04.540]  they're doing in many ways recently, you know, launching a credit card and stuff like that,
[25:04.540 --> 25:08.900]  like, it just it just seems to me like they're just wanting all of the money, all of it from
[25:08.900 --> 25:13.100]  everybody, you know, they keep pushing developers harder to, you know, they keep more strictly
[25:13.100 --> 25:17.940]  enforcing the in app purchase rules and everything else to just get more of the money and they
[25:17.940 --> 25:20.100]  they want it all for themselves.
[25:20.100 --> 25:22.980]  And they're just looking around the industry saying, you know, where can we get more next?
[25:22.980 --> 25:27.660]  All right, let me take a break and thank our first sponsors.
[25:27.660 --> 25:32.300]  It also is isn't this great that I get to read the sponsor thing and it's not you?
[25:32.300 --> 25:33.940]  Oh, it's so great.
[25:33.940 --> 25:40.060]  I love showing up to this having done no preparation except I got myself a bottle of seltzer.
[25:40.060 --> 25:44.420]  I think that one of these shows you should make Syracuse it do the sponsor reads just
[25:44.420 --> 25:47.060]  to stick it to it's it's not easy.
[25:47.060 --> 25:48.660]  You know, you get used to it.
[25:48.660 --> 25:53.980]  But it's like, you know, I feel like he he skates over it.
[25:53.980 --> 25:54.980]  I do.
[25:54.980 --> 26:01.300]  I feel like he does not appreciate the work that goes into you doing all of the sponsor
[26:01.300 --> 26:05.060]  reads every week, week in week out on atb.
[26:05.060 --> 26:06.060]  But anyway, that's
[26:06.060 --> 26:11.420]  well, at the same time, like I have, I think, almost never added something to the topics
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.420]  document.
[26:12.420 --> 26:14.700]  That's, that's one of his areas like he does that.
[26:14.700 --> 26:15.700]  Yeah.
[26:15.700 --> 26:18.740]  Like I just I just show I do the ad reads before right before the show, I do all the
[26:18.740 --> 26:20.500]  ad reads, I record them beforehand.
[26:20.500 --> 26:24.900]  And then I just kind of show up and I open the document like 10 minutes before we're
[26:24.900 --> 26:27.700]  going to record and I look over the ask ATP questions to make sure I don't have to like
[26:27.700 --> 26:29.180]  prepare an answer.
[26:29.180 --> 26:30.180]  And then that's it.
[26:30.180 --> 26:34.380]  And everything else like he's he and Casey drive the topic discussions.
[26:34.380 --> 26:38.940]  And and you know, Casey kind of hosts, you know, and john does a lot of the documentation
[26:38.940 --> 26:42.900]  of like, you know, preparing the topics and everything and, and yeah, and so and I do
[26:42.900 --> 26:43.900]  the ad.
[26:43.900 --> 26:45.860]  So I have this division of labor that works pretty well.
[26:45.860 --> 26:50.300]  Casey does the show notes, I do the editing, like all this all this stuff, but rest assured
[26:50.300 --> 26:52.980]  that we all we all do our thing, including including john.
[26:52.980 --> 26:54.380]  I'm writing this down right now.
[26:54.380 --> 26:56.340]  I'm gonna I'm not gonna forget it.
[26:56.340 --> 26:57.980]  Casey is the guy's name.
[26:57.980 --> 26:58.980]  All right.
[26:58.980 --> 26:59.980]  All right.
[26:59.980 --> 27:00.980]  Okay, to kill you.
[27:00.980 --> 27:03.620]  Our first sponsor is HelloFresh.
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.460]  And I love this company.
[27:05.460 --> 27:12.300]  With HelloFresh, you sign up and you get fresh, pre measured meals delivered to your home.
[27:12.300 --> 27:17.740]  They just come sealed in a box, you pick you pick the recipes you want, you get the meals,
[27:17.740 --> 27:23.340]  they come in a box and they're fresh and they're cold and they've got like dry ice in there
[27:23.340 --> 27:27.220]  or something like that to keep everything nice and cold.
[27:27.220 --> 27:30.560]  And you can skip the grocery store.
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.660]  And you get these meals and everything is pre measured, you get just the right amount
[27:35.660 --> 27:37.540]  of all the stuff you want.
[27:37.540 --> 27:44.460]  The the recipe tells you exactly what to do to prepare it and you get these delicious
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.460]  meals.
[27:45.460 --> 27:47.260]  It's it's fantastic.
[27:47.260 --> 27:53.440]  You cut out you even if you just get like two of them a week, you know, it it really
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.460]  is a stress reducer on your meal planning your grocery store planning, like what are
[27:59.460 --> 28:04.100]  we going to have for dinner tonight, that sort of discussion you just it just takes
[28:04.100 --> 28:07.620]  a lot of that out of your life.
[28:07.620 --> 28:12.180]  And all almost every recipe they have, they're already in 30 minutes or less.
[28:12.180 --> 28:13.940]  They're quick recipes there.
[28:13.940 --> 28:18.680]  It's not like you're, you know, have to spend all afternoon cooking this stuff.
[28:18.680 --> 28:19.700]  It's really great.
[28:19.700 --> 28:24.100]  They have over 25 recipes every week.
[28:24.100 --> 28:30.800]  And it includes stuff that includes vegetarian meals, kid friendly meals that you know, focus
[28:30.800 --> 28:37.740]  on, you know, kid friendly, you know, let's, let's, you know, let's be honest, kid friendly
[28:37.740 --> 28:43.180]  stuff, you know, simpler stuff, you know, without exotic flavors or ingredients or something
[28:43.180 --> 28:46.340]  like that.
[28:46.340 --> 28:52.380]  Anything you could think, well, what about you know, I, you know, I only like blank,
[28:52.380 --> 28:57.940]  they've got it, they've got 25 recipes a week, you pick what you want, you say I would like
[28:57.940 --> 29:02.020]  this, I would like that, I would like this, and then that's what shows up.
[29:02.020 --> 29:03.020]  It is fantastic.
[29:03.020 --> 29:06.180]  And it's so super convenient.
[29:06.180 --> 29:07.260]  The food is great.
[29:07.260 --> 29:12.380]  And I will say, and I've, you know, I think it's HelloFresh, who's been sponsoring the
[29:12.380 --> 29:17.740]  show for years, I've always been skeptical about like, hey, I'm kind of fussy.
[29:17.740 --> 29:23.060]  I like if I'm going to get like, bell peppers, I like to pick good ones.
[29:23.060 --> 29:29.840]  Where vegetables come, and it looks like the type of vegetables that you would pick personally
[29:29.840 --> 29:36.340]  out of the store, like really, really attractive looking groceries.
[29:36.340 --> 29:41.340]  That to me is the most surprising thing about it is that the things that you could be fussy
[29:41.340 --> 29:47.620]  about, they always come and they look like the people who packed your meal kit were fussy
[29:47.620 --> 29:50.500]  about what they picked to deliver to you.
[29:50.500 --> 29:53.180]  It's really terrific.
[29:53.180 --> 29:59.180]  It can be up to 28% cheaper than shopping at your local grocery store.
[29:59.180 --> 30:04.300]  And it's 72% cheaper, according to their statistics, than a restaurant meal.
[30:04.300 --> 30:07.940]  Well, you know, come on, let's face it, restaurants are expensive.
[30:07.940 --> 30:10.300]  But it doesn't sacrifice the quality.
[30:10.300 --> 30:11.300]  It's great.
[30:11.300 --> 30:12.700]  So here is where you do.
[30:12.700 --> 30:22.780]  Go to hellofresh.com slash talk show 12, and use that same code as the URL slug talk show
[30:22.780 --> 30:24.340]  12.
[30:24.340 --> 30:31.340]  And you get this, this is the part that's almost too good to be true 12 free meals.
[30:31.340 --> 30:34.040]  That's unbelievable, including free shipping.
[30:34.040 --> 30:37.340]  That's hellofresh slash talk show 12.
[30:37.340 --> 30:45.660]  And use the code talk show 12 when you sign up and you get 12 free meals again that all
[30:45.660 --> 30:49.060]  you're doing is listening to a free podcast and you're getting 12 free meals.
[30:49.060 --> 30:52.860]  It's too good to be true and and free shipping.
[30:52.860 --> 30:55.220]  So my thanks to HelloFresh great sponsor.
[30:55.220 --> 30:59.380]  All right, let's talk about new Apple products other than AirTags.
[30:59.380 --> 31:00.780]  What do you want to talk about first?
[31:00.780 --> 31:05.980]  I mean, I don't have that much to say about most of them because I haven't used them and
[31:05.980 --> 31:12.260]  I honestly I don't I don't think the iPad necessarily has much for me.
[31:12.260 --> 31:17.740]  But first of all, the iMac I think is one of the most interesting because with a you
[31:17.740 --> 31:22.260]  know, pretty radical design change and a change that seems to buy most of their reviews be
[31:22.260 --> 31:23.260]  a success.
[31:23.260 --> 31:26.060]  I mean, would you say it was a successful redesign of the iMac?
[31:26.060 --> 31:34.220]  Oh, I would think it's a super successful I I so Apple sent me all three and as far
[31:34.220 --> 31:42.020]  as I can tell, as the three things being the iMac, the new iPad Pro, and the new Apple
[31:42.020 --> 31:43.120]  TV 4k.
[31:43.120 --> 31:45.740]  And I'm not trying to flex here.
[31:45.740 --> 31:48.460]  I'm not trying to brag.
[31:48.460 --> 31:57.860]  But as far as I can tell today, after having published my Apple TV, quote unquote review
[31:57.860 --> 32:05.060]  late last night, I think I'm the only person who got all three and which is weird.
[32:05.060 --> 32:09.400]  And Apple never tells you stuff like that when they send you review units, you know,
[32:09.400 --> 32:13.980]  they don't say like, Hey, you're the only person who's getting all three blah, blah,
[32:13.980 --> 32:14.980]  blah.
[32:14.980 --> 32:19.580]  Of the three, the iMac is to me by far the most interesting.
[32:19.580 --> 32:26.540]  So I'd almost rather push it back on the show to and to me, but I get why they staggered
[32:26.540 --> 32:35.980]  the embargo dates on reviews the way they did iMac first, iPad, second, Apple TV third.
[32:35.980 --> 32:44.860]  But the iPad and Apple TV to me are easier to talk about because they're such minor overall
[32:44.860 --> 32:50.260]  revisions and does that make sense?
[32:50.260 --> 32:51.460]  Yeah, let's do it.
[32:51.460 --> 32:57.500]  I mean, and I love the way you did the Apple TV, I love that it was like, you know, 80%
[32:57.500 --> 32:58.500]  about the remote.
[32:58.500 --> 33:01.780]  And you had like a paragraph the end basically saying, Yeah, oh, the box is slightly updated
[33:01.780 --> 33:02.780]  too.
[33:02.780 --> 33:06.220]  Like, which is exactly like, that's how I'm looking at it.
[33:06.220 --> 33:10.300]  Like, we know I have I have two TVs, one of them that they're both 4k.
[33:10.300 --> 33:13.380]  Now, one of them had the old non 4k Apple TV box.
[33:13.380 --> 33:17.500]  And like our secondary TV had had the old Apple TV HD on it.
[33:17.500 --> 33:20.800]  And we have a regular Apple TV 4k on our primary TV.
[33:20.800 --> 33:25.920]  And so I ordered one new Apple TV, and one new just the new remote, right?
[33:25.920 --> 33:30.280]  And then I'm just gonna, you know, shift the Apple TV 4k onto the secondary TV, the first
[33:30.280 --> 33:33.640]  generation one on the secondary TV, replace the Apple TV HD.
[33:33.640 --> 33:35.000]  And now I have new remotes for both.
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.460]  And so to me, I'm gonna have two new Apple TVs, basically, because the difference between
[33:39.460 --> 33:43.860]  them is, you know, when like, oh, this can now do HDR 60 frames a second, like, okay,
[33:43.860 --> 33:47.140]  well, I have no content like that.
[33:47.140 --> 33:49.080]  So fine.
[33:49.080 --> 33:50.400]  That'll be great for my primary TV.
[33:50.400 --> 33:54.040]  I won't notice the lack of it on my secondary TV.
[33:54.040 --> 33:58.600]  And the thread radio might be something that matters to me at some point down the road.
[33:58.600 --> 34:00.240]  It isn't right now.
[34:00.240 --> 34:01.240]  So great.
[34:01.240 --> 34:04.240]  And I feel like I got two Apple TVs for the cost of you know, one and a half.
[34:04.240 --> 34:05.240]  Right?
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.560]  I mean, I even said in my review, it's like, the thread thing seems like it could be something
[34:10.560 --> 34:12.400]  you know, it really does.
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.560]  You know, when I just cursory read it, it's like, it seems like it's, but I don't have
[34:17.560 --> 34:22.240]  anything in my house right now that is like, oh, you need an Apple TV with thread support
[34:22.240 --> 34:23.760]  to do blank.
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.600]  There's there's nothing I can't think.
[34:27.600 --> 34:29.440]  It sounds like a good technology.
[34:29.440 --> 34:37.640]  But it's like, right now, I can't think of anything and and the Dolby vision, high frame
[34:37.640 --> 34:39.480]  rate HDR support.
[34:39.480 --> 34:40.680]  It's like what?
[34:40.680 --> 34:42.620]  There's nothing I want to watch that it's like that.
[34:42.620 --> 34:49.820]  So if you already have an Apple TV 4k, the one that came out like four years ago, there's
[34:49.820 --> 34:53.720]  it's not a diss on the new one.
[34:53.720 --> 34:55.200]  It's like, what else do you want?
[34:55.200 --> 34:56.200]  Right?
[34:56.200 --> 34:59.320]  It's like it didn't need to support anything else.
[34:59.320 --> 35:05.800]  It's not like, oh, this is a bad update, because it doesn't, it's not more compelling.
[35:05.800 --> 35:13.760]  It's that if you already have a 4k TV, and you have the older Apple TV 4k, you're it,
[35:13.760 --> 35:18.760]  there's, there's not much that you need, except for a better remote.
[35:18.760 --> 35:20.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[35:20.200 --> 35:21.440]  Like that.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.960]  That was the big problem with the Apple TV.
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.860]  I have lots of problems with like, tv OS, and you know, some of the weird UI decisions
[35:29.860 --> 35:33.200]  there, and some, you know, particular bugs in certain apps or certain behaviors of the
[35:33.200 --> 35:34.800]  of the services and everything.
[35:34.800 --> 35:37.700]  But that's all stuff that you're not going to fix in hardware.
[35:37.700 --> 35:42.680]  So among the like category of things that need to be fixed in hardware, it was like
[35:42.680 --> 35:48.200]  90% the remote, like that I've had no problems with my Apple TV 4k hardware, the previous
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.760]  version of the hardware, I've had lots of problems with like, the the Apple TV HD model,
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.000]  those actually, for me, those tended to die after about two or three years of use.
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.560]  Yeah, I heard you say that.
[35:58.560 --> 36:01.980]  And I never experienced that because I got one right away.
[36:01.980 --> 36:05.220]  And then I used it right up until the 4k came out.
[36:05.220 --> 36:10.160]  And I even bought, I'm an idiot, I bought the 4k one before I even had a 4k TV.
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.160]  Because I thought, well, I'll get I'm, I'm planning to upgrade my TV soon.
[36:14.160 --> 36:16.760]  So I should buy the Apple TV 4k.
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.140]  But I never had one die.
[36:18.140 --> 36:20.400]  But I heard you say that, which is weird.
[36:20.400 --> 36:21.400]  You know,
[36:21.400 --> 36:22.720]  yeah, I mean, well, you also dodged bullet there.
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.400]  Because in addition to the Apple TV HD model, in my opinion, having a lot of high death
[36:28.400 --> 36:34.360]  rate, it also was noticeably slower, like just moving around the interface and you know,
[36:34.360 --> 36:38.480]  just basic stuff in the apps, because it had a much older CPU, I think it was an A8 in
[36:38.480 --> 36:39.520]  there or something like that.
[36:39.520 --> 36:41.840]  So it was noticeably slower.
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.780]  When you're talking about it, you're talking about it in the past tense, but they still
[36:45.780 --> 36:47.200]  sell it.
[36:47.200 --> 36:49.280]  That's that's, I love this so much.
[36:49.280 --> 36:54.040]  I love that they are still selling it at the same price it's been for like the last five
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.040]  years or whatever.
[36:55.040 --> 36:56.740]  They're still selling.
[36:56.740 --> 36:58.280]  It's $150.
[36:58.280 --> 37:05.320]  I honestly think that it might be the worst product Apple, Apple Incorporated has ever
[37:05.320 --> 37:14.280]  sold in on today's date, buying the $150 Apple TV HD.
[37:14.280 --> 37:18.280]  And again, if you're right, that they tend to die after a couple of years, it's even
[37:18.280 --> 37:19.280]  worse.
[37:19.280 --> 37:24.760]  But even if it works forever, it is a terrible price for that device.
[37:24.760 --> 37:31.240]  Like if they sold it for, let's say, $79, right, that seems like an Apple-like price.
[37:31.240 --> 37:38.240]  If they were like $79 and you can get the non-4K Apple TV, okay.
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.600]  But I see how they're looking at it and they're like, well, that would really stick out from
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.640]  these $180 and $200 prices for the 4K.
[37:47.640 --> 37:57.480]  So if we want to sell the new ones at $180 and $200, we better sell the old one at $150.
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.920]  And it's like, but all of a sudden, they're selling this ancient device with an A8.
[38:02.920 --> 38:04.520]  It's slow.
[38:04.520 --> 38:08.400]  The OS is clearly not optimized for that processor.
[38:08.400 --> 38:09.400]  No.
[38:09.400 --> 38:12.160]  It does at least get the new remote.
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.160]  That's nice.
[38:13.160 --> 38:14.160]  That is nice.
[38:14.160 --> 38:20.240]  But it's just like for $30 more at that point, if you're going to spend $150 on a streaming
[38:20.240 --> 38:26.400]  TV box, which is at the high end of the price range for that market, spend 30 more and get
[38:26.400 --> 38:29.160]  the one that is way better.
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.800]  It's not a small, it's not a $30 difference in performance and everything.
[38:32.800 --> 38:36.400]  It's a way bigger difference.
[38:36.400 --> 38:41.200]  That I don't know what's the worst product they currently sell, whether it's that or
[38:41.200 --> 38:52.720]  whether it's still they still sell the old 21-inch Intel iMac, and it's non-retina.
[38:52.720 --> 38:56.560]  Until recently, it had a spinning hard drive that's at least finally gone, but they still
[38:56.560 --> 39:00.360]  sell the non-retina base model Intel iMac.
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.880]  But I kind of feel that with that, anybody who does buy it knows what they're getting
[39:06.880 --> 39:15.560]  and they're buying it for a reason, whereas the Apple TV HD seems like a device that somebody
[39:15.560 --> 39:21.160]  could buy by mistake because they think like, this is already a lot of money.
[39:21.160 --> 39:24.280]  I only want to spend $150 on a streaming box.
[39:24.280 --> 39:26.120]  Just let me buy this one.
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.800]  Or let's say you don't have a 4K TV.
[39:30.800 --> 39:31.920]  You've only got a 1080.
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.480]  That's probably the more common failure right here is like if you don't have a 4K TV and
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.520]  you have two things in front of you that say Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K, you might reasonably
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.880]  conclude, and they're very close in price, you might reasonably conclude that the Apple
[39:42.880 --> 39:45.600]  TV HD is the one you should get.
[39:45.600 --> 39:48.040]  And to me, that's a huge mistake.
[39:48.040 --> 39:55.560]  Because to me, as someone who used an Apple TV 4K for a couple of years with a 1080 TV,
[39:55.560 --> 39:56.560]  it was better.
[39:56.560 --> 40:02.200]  And even if you're not driving it at 4K, it was better because it was faster.
[40:02.200 --> 40:04.320]  Yeah, way faster.
[40:04.320 --> 40:07.280]  It's 30 bucks.
[40:07.280 --> 40:09.720]  Let's say, what's the minimum?
[40:09.720 --> 40:19.660]  I think a normal person would buy an Apple TV hardware device, the little thing.
[40:19.660 --> 40:26.160]  And I think most people would use it for at least four or five years before they would
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.320]  think, hey, I got to get a new one because I got to upgrade it.
[40:31.320 --> 40:37.160]  And so at that point, the $30 difference is we're talking about like, what, like six bucks
[40:37.160 --> 40:43.140]  a year, you know, it and wonder if maybe do they maybe sell a bunch of those to businesses
[40:43.140 --> 40:48.140]  for like air playing to projectors thing that maybe they just sell a ton of them.
[40:48.140 --> 40:53.700]  I've heard from daring Fireball readers that that is definitely a market, you know, that
[40:53.700 --> 41:01.120]  there's absolutely a market for buying these things to use as a projector type things that
[41:01.120 --> 41:08.880]  you airplay your presentation to write like, yeah, it's sort of that all the years that
[41:08.880 --> 41:17.800]  I spent making fun of PC laptops that still had VGA ports, which is like, seriously, one
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.760]  of the worst, longest lasting ports in history.
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.360]  It's like, you cannot believe how long VGA was.
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.140]  But it was always every time my first computer had a VGA port.
[41:30.140 --> 41:35.000]  Every time I would make fun of a new machine that came out with it for years and years
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.440]  people would, you know, I hear from a handful of readers who would say, I know what you
[41:39.440 --> 41:40.440]  mean.
[41:40.440 --> 41:43.760]  It wasn't like they were clueless, you know, they were like, I get it.
[41:43.760 --> 41:50.500]  But where I work, if you don't have a VGA port, you need a VGA adapter, because there's
[41:50.500 --> 41:54.260]  no other way to project your presentation, blah, blah, blah.
[41:54.260 --> 42:00.060]  And I think that Apple TV has and and airplay has taken a lot of that, you know, it's not
[42:00.060 --> 42:07.400]  so much that VGA, etc, have been replaced by HDMI or newer ports.
[42:07.400 --> 42:12.800]  I think airplay, you know, airplay is great.
[42:12.800 --> 42:14.720]  And so I do think that that's part of it.
[42:14.720 --> 42:20.560]  But still, wouldn't it be better to just get the low end 4k, even if you're only projecting
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.720]  your thing at 720p, right?
[42:23.720 --> 42:28.280]  Even if you're only projecting at 720p, it would still be better to just have the Apple
[42:28.280 --> 42:30.320]  TV 4k.
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.360]  And I think it would last longer, if it would be, it would have other advantages to like
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.660]  Apple TV 4k has a gigabit Ethernet port instead of 100 megabit on the HD.
[42:38.660 --> 42:41.640]  But it just Yeah, it's like, yeah, you're right, like lasting longer, I feel like is,
[42:41.640 --> 42:42.920]  is the big thing there.
[42:42.920 --> 42:48.020]  But I mean, if they have a ton of these things, nearly, maybe, maybe it's like a HomePod situation
[42:48.020 --> 42:51.320]  where they manufactured too many of them a few years back, and they've just taken forever
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.120]  to sell through the inventory.
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.140]  And they know that business buyers will buy them or, you know, mistaken home users will
[42:56.140 --> 42:57.140]  buy them.
[42:57.140 --> 42:58.140]  I don't know.
[42:58.140 --> 42:59.140]  I just don't make it.
[42:59.140 --> 43:01.960]  You know, it makes me feel like I should do like a hidden.
[43:01.960 --> 43:07.440]  Well, I wouldn't use the actual hidden camera, but do like a, but just go into the Apple
[43:07.440 --> 43:15.840]  Store and and act like, you know, Joe consumer, and be like, try to buy the Apple TV HD and
[43:15.840 --> 43:19.500]  see if they will at least try to talk me out of it.
[43:19.500 --> 43:24.380]  And again, because I do think that in general do this, can you please put your name in the
[43:24.380 --> 43:29.160]  little waiting system as Joe consumer?
[43:29.160 --> 43:32.760]  No because then they're gonna show up as Joe C to most of them.
[43:32.760 --> 43:41.380]  Yeah, I guess it might because they're so they really are privacy conscious like that.
[43:41.380 --> 43:47.500]  Because in general, I do think that, you know, one of the great things about Apple is that
[43:47.500 --> 43:53.020]  if you go in, they don't try to upsell you to the, to the most, you know, it's not like
[43:53.020 --> 43:59.340]  buying a car, right, like, everybody knows buying a car is the is the worst upsell experience,
[43:59.340 --> 44:03.060]  because they're going to try to upsell you on everything.
[44:03.060 --> 44:09.780]  And I, you know, I think the Apple Store has a very good reputation for, you know, they're,
[44:09.780 --> 44:14.640]  you know, maybe they'll reasonably try to ask, like, you know, how much do you have
[44:14.640 --> 44:15.640]  on your phone?
[44:15.640 --> 44:19.860]  And if I think if you showed them your iPhone, and you're like, look, and and they're like,
[44:19.860 --> 44:27.540]  you know, settings, general storage, and it looks like you've only got like, 20 gigabytes
[44:27.540 --> 44:33.700]  on your phone, they're not going to try to sell you a 256 gigabyte iPhone, right?
[44:33.700 --> 44:40.220]  Like you look, you've you're only using 20 now, what, why would you buy a 256?
[44:40.220 --> 44:45.180]  They don't do that in general, but so I'd be very interested to know what whether but
[44:45.180 --> 44:51.700]  they should in general, like doing a favor to the consumer, they should try to talk people
[44:51.700 --> 44:56.660]  out of the Apple TV HD, it's it's a terrible purchase at this point.
[44:56.660 --> 45:02.300]  I wonder to what degree they're allowed to like, kind of push people away from a choice.
[45:02.300 --> 45:06.580]  You know, like, because obviously, like, you know, in most retail environments, the employees
[45:06.580 --> 45:13.460]  would be discouraged for any kind of implied insult of any of the products, like, you know,
[45:13.460 --> 45:17.460]  you wouldn't want your employees to be telling customers, oh, you don't want that one.
[45:17.460 --> 45:21.260]  You know, like, obviously upselling is a different story, but you wouldn't want anybody to possibly
[45:21.260 --> 45:25.100]  imply that like, oh, that's that one's actually a bad choice.
[45:25.100 --> 45:27.180]  And you should really get this.
[45:27.180 --> 45:36.140]  I remember, I don't know, when Amy and I first moved in together in, I think, 1999, we bought
[45:36.140 --> 45:43.900]  a new TV, and my friend, Don was a guy who had a van and we bought a big, big Sony see,
[45:43.900 --> 45:51.340]  it was, you know, CRTs back then, big, big TV, you know, at 32 inches, right, it was
[45:51.340 --> 45:56.980]  humongous, which, you know, again, by today's standards, not that big, but the actual box
[45:56.980 --> 46:01.180]  was incredibly huge, but I remember buying it Best Buy.
[46:01.180 --> 46:07.340]  And I did all the research, you know, before going into the store, I was like, this is
[46:07.340 --> 46:13.060]  the TV I want the here's the Best Buy that has it, you know, let's go pick it up.
[46:13.060 --> 46:17.300]  Don has a van, we'll, we'll put it in the van.
[46:17.300 --> 46:22.140]  And I remember, very specifically that the salesperson was like, do you want any of these
[46:22.140 --> 46:23.340]  monster cables?
[46:23.340 --> 46:26.060]  And I looked at him like, come on.
[46:26.060 --> 46:29.220]  And he gave me a look that was like, yeah, you're right there.
[46:29.220 --> 46:32.420]  You know, it was just just a look, he didn't say anything.
[46:32.420 --> 46:34.740]  But it was like, come on, this is this is nonsense.
[46:34.740 --> 46:36.260]  And I was like, these are nonsense.
[46:36.260 --> 46:40.020]  And he's like, yeah, these, you know, and it was all just in looks.
[46:40.020 --> 46:42.380]  And it was like, you know, I'm not getting you in any trouble.
[46:42.380 --> 46:44.500]  I know you're supposed to ask me, but
[46:44.500 --> 46:49.140]  Oh, I flat out told I used to work at Staples in college.
[46:49.140 --> 46:52.140]  And this was probably around that time period.
[46:52.140 --> 46:57.340]  And and this was, this was one of those times when you would sell a bunch of printers, but
[46:57.340 --> 47:00.100]  printers stopped coming with cables.
[47:00.100 --> 47:04.620]  Because they realized that you could, you know, the retailers were much happy, much
[47:04.620 --> 47:08.340]  happier with the manufacturers and push the models that didn't come with cables in the
[47:08.340 --> 47:09.340]  box.
[47:09.340 --> 47:13.020]  Because then the retailers can sell you they're like $30 USB cable.
[47:13.020 --> 47:15.580]  And it was like, it was just like a regular, like six foot USB cable.
[47:15.580 --> 47:19.900]  And of course, Staples and everyone else would have their like gold plated upgrade version.
[47:19.900 --> 47:23.820]  And we had this we had this whole book full of, like, justifications, we were supposed
[47:23.820 --> 47:27.300]  to tell customers or they were trying to train us to tell people like, why they want the
[47:27.300 --> 47:31.100]  gold plated cable, because that will ensure like faster printing or, you know, they would
[47:31.100 --> 47:34.980]  tell it was there was no technical basis in it whatsoever.
[47:34.980 --> 47:38.420]  And, and I just refuse to say any of that stuff to people.
[47:38.420 --> 47:41.980]  And people would often, you know, they would get the printer and I was supposed to try
[47:41.980 --> 47:46.740]  to upsell them on cable paper, you know, extra ink and the service plan and everything.
[47:46.740 --> 47:49.860]  And I did, of course, none of that, except I would tell them like, you know, you need
[47:49.860 --> 47:50.860]  to use B cable for this.
[47:50.860 --> 47:54.720]  And if they would, if they would, you know, seem to be balking at the price, and you know,
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.020]  this was in like, you know, rural Pennsylvania, a lot of people didn't want to spend an extra
[47:58.020 --> 48:01.780]  $30 for a stupid cable, you know, they're buying a, you know, they're buying the cheapest
[48:01.780 --> 48:03.820]  printer they can, because they don't have a lot of money or something.
[48:03.820 --> 48:07.220]  And so I would tell them like, look, if you just get this online, it's a lot cheaper.
[48:07.220 --> 48:10.540]  Like if you can buy the printer here, but if you need to save money on the cable, you
[48:10.540 --> 48:13.980]  don't you don't have to buy it here, you can use any or it's like, if you if you had a
[48:13.980 --> 48:18.060]  USB printer before, you can probably use the same cable you already have.
[48:18.060 --> 48:21.860]  And many people, many of the customers really appreciated that.
[48:21.860 --> 48:28.580]  I can tell you the boss didn't so much that was that was not as popular with the boss.
[48:28.580 --> 48:34.900]  Have you ever heard from anybody who like now knows you as the famous Marco Arment from
[48:34.900 --> 48:37.940]  ATP and overcast and etc.
[48:37.940 --> 48:42.180]  And it was like, I think that I went to your staples.
[48:42.180 --> 48:43.500]  Probably in Ohio, right?
[48:43.500 --> 48:45.860]  No, it was it was in Meadville, Pennsylvania.
[48:45.860 --> 48:46.860]  Oh,
[48:46.860 --> 48:49.220]  yeah, there were even fewer people than where I'm from in Columbus.
[48:49.220 --> 48:50.660]  I don't even know where they were.
[48:50.660 --> 48:51.820]  I'm in Pennsylvania.
[48:51.820 --> 48:53.380]  I don't even know where Meadville is.
[48:53.380 --> 48:57.140]  I don't know if it's on the east and the west and the center where it's about it's about
[48:57.140 --> 49:00.340]  two thirds of the way from Pittsburgh to Erie.
[49:00.340 --> 49:02.340]  Oh, my God, that's awful.
[49:02.340 --> 49:03.940]  Why would you live there?
[49:03.940 --> 49:07.620]  Those colleagues went to college there.
[49:07.620 --> 49:08.620]  The college was great.
[49:08.620 --> 49:12.780]  It was a small town, you know, and, and it was fun when we were there.
[49:12.780 --> 49:15.500]  But yeah, definitely not a lot of people.
[49:15.500 --> 49:17.140]  It's a terrible location.
[49:17.140 --> 49:20.340]  But have you ever heard from anybody who's like, I think that I went to your staples
[49:20.340 --> 49:24.900]  and I think that you helped me or no, no, probably not a single person.
[49:24.900 --> 49:29.380]  Which, again, given you know, given where it was, that does not surprise me.
[49:29.380 --> 49:31.180]  But I would have I would have done the same.
[49:31.180 --> 49:36.860]  I never had like a job where I could give real advice like that.
[49:36.860 --> 49:40.780]  Like I my menial labor job was at a change.
[49:40.780 --> 49:43.940]  I have I ever told you this that I used to work?
[49:43.940 --> 49:47.260]  Yeah, I guarantee you, you have heard of this chain.
[49:47.260 --> 49:50.900]  But most people listening to the show will never have heard of it.
[49:50.900 --> 49:53.900]  It was a chain called Far More.
[49:53.900 --> 49:56.340]  Oh, I've we had those in Ohio.
[49:56.340 --> 49:57.340]  Of course.
[49:57.340 --> 50:01.860]  Far More started in Ohio, which is why I knew that you would know it.
[50:01.860 --> 50:04.420]  And do you know what their slogan was?
[50:04.420 --> 50:05.540]  No.
[50:05.540 --> 50:11.060]  So it was spelled p h a dash m o r.
[50:11.060 --> 50:17.660]  Yeah, p h a r, p h a r dash m o r.
[50:17.660 --> 50:23.860]  And they left off the e at the end, you know, but the Far More and it was a pharmacy, but
[50:23.860 --> 50:28.660]  it was sort of like the biggest pharmacy you could ever believe.
[50:28.660 --> 50:31.500]  You know, like, wasn't it like leave off the last e for savings?
[50:31.500 --> 50:36.300]  No, no, it was Far More where you get Far More for your money.
[50:36.300 --> 50:38.260]  Oh, okay.
[50:38.260 --> 50:42.220]  But I think you might be right, though, that they left off the last e for savings.
[50:42.220 --> 50:44.940]  No, I think it was something that ended in s that did that.
[50:44.940 --> 50:45.940]  Some TV commercial.
[50:45.940 --> 50:49.780]  No, but I guarantee you, but it was over and over and over again.
[50:49.780 --> 50:51.900]  And it was the way mattress 100 mattress.
[50:51.900 --> 50:52.900]  That's what it is.
[50:52.900 --> 50:53.900]  Yeah, that's it.
[50:53.900 --> 50:54.900]  That's it.
[50:54.900 --> 50:55.900]  Because you only get seven letters.
[50:55.900 --> 50:56.900]  Right, right, right, right.
[50:56.900 --> 50:57.900]  They left off the last s for saving.
[50:57.900 --> 51:02.460]  No, Far More where you get for sponsor, you get Far More for your money.
[51:02.460 --> 51:07.940]  Well, they ended up going under because the founder and CEO was like engaged in some kind
[51:07.940 --> 51:11.460]  of financial fraud.
[51:11.460 --> 51:14.260]  But you got Far More for his money.
[51:14.260 --> 51:25.380]  But I worked as the stock stocker, you know, they, you know, not S-T-A-L-K stock, but S-T-O-C-K.
[51:25.380 --> 51:27.540]  But I would stock the shelves.
[51:27.540 --> 51:28.740]  And it was my first job, too.
[51:28.740 --> 51:31.180]  I was terrible at it.
[51:31.180 --> 51:32.180]  It was it.
[51:32.180 --> 51:34.620]  I was awful at it because I was great.
[51:34.620 --> 51:35.940]  Oh, I was terrible.
[51:35.940 --> 51:42.500]  So the worst aisle to get so and I used to work the the end of the day shift, which was
[51:42.500 --> 51:44.820]  like three to 11.
[51:44.820 --> 51:48.420]  And the store closed at nine or 10.
[51:48.420 --> 51:54.980]  I think like 10 and but like 10 to 11 was like the golden hour of all right, the stores
[51:54.980 --> 51:56.380]  closed, customers are out.
[51:56.380 --> 51:59.380]  But now is when the the stock boys would come out.
[51:59.380 --> 52:00.900]  And we were all boys.
[52:00.900 --> 52:07.740]  You know, if you went there as like an 18, 19 year old and you were a young woman, they
[52:07.740 --> 52:09.180]  would put you at the registers.
[52:09.180 --> 52:14.180]  I you know, it's a weird, you know, in hindsight, it made sense at the time.
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.100]  But in hindsight, it's like, why?
[52:16.100 --> 52:22.320]  Why was that like a thing where like automatically all of the girls worked at the registers,
[52:22.320 --> 52:24.140]  but the boys were in the back?
[52:24.140 --> 52:25.860]  You know, it's kind of creepy.
[52:25.860 --> 52:27.540]  Oh, yeah, there are reasons.
[52:27.540 --> 52:28.540]  They're just terrible.
[52:28.540 --> 52:29.540]  Yeah, they're just terrible.
[52:29.540 --> 52:31.060]  At the time, it's like, Oh, this seems normal.
[52:31.060 --> 52:36.380]  And only back like, Oh, my God, it was tons of misogyny and racism constantly in society.
[52:36.380 --> 52:37.580]  As much as we still have today.
[52:37.580 --> 52:39.220]  It was worse back then.
[52:39.220 --> 52:40.500]  It was really bad.
[52:40.500 --> 52:46.340]  Like you would you would be like a a register person if you were a girl and you would be
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.380]  a stalker if you were a boy.
[52:48.380 --> 52:53.680]  But one of the things was at the end of the day, you'd get assigned an aisle and you would
[52:53.680 --> 52:59.500]  have to I forget what the blocking we used to call it blocking where it would be just
[52:59.500 --> 53:04.260]  taking all of the product and pushing it forward on the shelves.
[53:04.260 --> 53:06.780]  So that it looked like the shelves were full.
[53:06.780 --> 53:08.260]  And we call that facing.
[53:08.260 --> 53:09.660]  We called it blocking.
[53:09.660 --> 53:11.280]  And I was terrible at it.
[53:11.280 --> 53:17.340]  And the worst aisle to get was the hair product aisle because there were so many, you know,
[53:17.340 --> 53:22.620]  there's so many bottles of shampoo, and so many bottles of conditioner and everything
[53:22.620 --> 53:23.620]  else.
[53:23.620 --> 53:25.420]  And people buy tons of it, right.
[53:25.420 --> 53:29.620]  So it was always every day, tons of shampoo would be sold.
[53:29.620 --> 53:33.420]  And then I if they told me, you know, you're you're getting the shampoo, you know, go to
[53:33.420 --> 53:35.700]  aisle 13, you're you got 13.
[53:35.700 --> 53:39.420]  And I would just sit there and it's like, I would just lose my mind.
[53:39.420 --> 53:43.820]  And then like the manager would come through and be like, john, what's going on here?
[53:43.820 --> 53:49.640]  It's it's 1045 and you've you've only done like 10 feet of the aisle and I would just
[53:49.640 --> 53:55.100]  like look at him like, you know, like, I'm sorry, you know, I had no excuse.
[53:55.100 --> 53:57.140]  I would have no excuse.
[53:57.140 --> 54:03.180]  And it wasn't like I had a phone to to or device to dick around with.
[54:03.180 --> 54:07.700]  It was just because I could not apply myself to it.
[54:07.700 --> 54:10.580]  But anyway, far more is where I work.
[54:10.580 --> 54:13.740]  But nobody ever asked me for my opinion on something.
[54:13.740 --> 54:14.740]  So I could.
[54:14.740 --> 54:19.740]  But if I did, if my menial labor job had been at a Staples like yours, I would have done
[54:19.740 --> 54:21.380]  the same thing as you.
[54:21.380 --> 54:25.260]  I will say for my for the job where I was a stockist, that was that was at a natural
[54:25.260 --> 54:26.480]  food store.
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.420]  But I was it was like a little natural food co op, you know, before the era of like, you
[54:30.420 --> 54:32.620]  know, the big ones now like Whole Foods and stuff.
[54:32.620 --> 54:35.220]  And I was like, 15.
[54:35.220 --> 54:37.300]  I didn't know what anything there was.
[54:37.300 --> 54:40.000]  It just happened to be the nearest grocery store to my house.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.020]  And so and they gave me the first job I could get like on my 15th birthday.
[54:44.020 --> 54:48.180]  And so my other my problem there was that if somebody did ask me anything, you know,
[54:48.180 --> 54:50.380]  they'd be like, you know, oh, where's the kale?
[54:50.380 --> 54:53.140]  And I would honestly say I have no idea what that is.
[54:53.140 --> 54:54.140]  Right?
[54:54.140 --> 54:59.980]  Like, you don't know if it's a hair care product, if it's a if that's something you put on your
[54:59.980 --> 55:00.980]  feet.
[55:00.980 --> 55:01.980]  Right?
[55:01.980 --> 55:02.980]  Because this was like 1996.
[55:02.980 --> 55:05.340]  Like, no, I didn't know what any of this stuff.
[55:05.340 --> 55:10.300]  No, most people didn't.
[55:10.300 --> 55:11.300]  So true.
[55:11.300 --> 55:16.260]  You know what the best the best job at far more and it was hard to get into and I only
[55:16.260 --> 55:21.180]  got to do it when somebody you know, people would call out sick and they'd be like, we
[55:21.180 --> 55:22.180]  need somebody to do it.
[55:22.180 --> 55:27.660]  But the thing that far more had was in the corner, but strategically placed so you had
[55:27.660 --> 55:29.940]  to walk through the whole store to get there.
[55:29.940 --> 55:34.260]  They had a video rental corner.
[55:34.260 --> 55:38.060]  And they had tremendously everything was 99 cents, right?
[55:38.060 --> 55:46.340]  So you could get first run movies, rent them, you know, on, of course, on VHS tape for 99
[55:46.340 --> 55:47.340]  cents.
[55:47.340 --> 55:53.500]  And whereas it like Blockbuster, a dedicated video rental store.
[55:53.500 --> 55:57.980]  They were I don't know, what were it was like five bucks to get like a first run movie.
[55:57.980 --> 55:59.220]  Yeah, four or five bucks.
[55:59.220 --> 56:00.820]  Yeah, yeah, four or five bucks.
[56:00.820 --> 56:08.380]  And far more was like 99 cents for all movies, any movie, including the first run movies.
[56:08.380 --> 56:13.800]  But of course, they only you know, the whole trick of that era was that there you could
[56:13.800 --> 56:16.820]  only have so many copies of the same movie.
[56:16.820 --> 56:22.380]  So like a blockbuster movie would come out and they'd have like five copies, five copies
[56:22.380 --> 56:24.340]  of it.
[56:24.340 --> 56:26.960]  And but but people were nutty for it.
[56:26.960 --> 56:31.300]  It was like, though, I think it was the whole gimmick behind far more was the video rental
[56:31.300 --> 56:32.300]  thing.
[56:32.300 --> 56:34.800]  I honestly think it was what kept the whole chain afloat.
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.700]  But it was so much fun to work at the video corner.
[56:39.700 --> 56:47.460]  Because as like a like an 18 year old, you people would return the movies, and then you
[56:47.460 --> 56:52.300]  you know, double check that they're they're rewound and, you know, and then you'd go to
[56:52.300 --> 56:54.140]  take them back out.
[56:54.140 --> 56:58.340]  And people would be they were they were like ravenous for them.
[56:58.340 --> 57:05.940]  And what they wanted to do, because if you were carrying out 20 videotapes of returned
[57:05.940 --> 57:11.060]  movies, and most of them were probably the first run ones that people wanted to get,
[57:11.060 --> 57:13.440]  they wanted to take them right out of your hands.
[57:13.440 --> 57:20.400]  But we were authorized by management to tell people, you are not allowed to take movies
[57:20.400 --> 57:22.860]  out of our hands while until we're done.
[57:22.860 --> 57:28.880]  And while we were restocking that you could say nope, nope, and it was so much fun to
[57:28.880 --> 57:34.420]  tell full grown, like 50 year old adults, nope, you can't you can't pick these movies
[57:34.420 --> 57:38.380]  out yet, until I'm done putting them on the shelves.
[57:38.380 --> 57:40.600]  And then you'd put them back on the shelves.
[57:40.600 --> 57:42.140]  And then you would say, Okay, go.
[57:42.140 --> 57:44.360]  And people would like fight over them.
[57:44.360 --> 57:46.220]  And it was like, this is amazing.
[57:46.220 --> 57:54.380]  Like, I'm 18 years old, and I'm watching full grown adults fight over 99 cent video
[57:54.380 --> 57:55.380]  rentals.
[57:55.380 --> 57:56.380]  It was it was fantastic.
[57:56.380 --> 57:59.580]  That's like the last thing an 18 year old needs is a power trip.
[57:59.580 --> 58:03.340]  Yes, that was it was it was amazing.
[58:03.340 --> 58:04.740]  It was really fun.
[58:04.740 --> 58:09.240]  And it really was a terrible thing, a terrible power to grant to an 18 year old.
[58:09.240 --> 58:13.980]  But I do appreciate, I do appreciate that they authorized us to do that.
[58:13.980 --> 58:18.200]  And and people would get mad and they'd be like, I'm gonna go to the manager and
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.900]  tell him that you're, you know, you won't let me and I'd be like, go ahead, you know,
[58:21.900 --> 58:26.580]  go go tell them, because they've they have told me you're not allowed to do this.
[58:26.580 --> 58:31.740]  And I think it was because before they instituted the policy, it was a real problem, where they
[58:31.740 --> 58:38.540]  would like, effectively knock over the person who was like, you know, restocking the video
[58:38.540 --> 58:40.540]  rentals.
[58:40.540 --> 58:41.820]  I had no idea that was a rental place.
[58:41.820 --> 58:44.700]  It's like we never rented videos when I was a kid, because like, we didn't have a lot
[58:44.700 --> 58:45.700]  of money.
[58:45.700 --> 58:49.380]  And the idea of just like, you would just spend three or $4 for one night it would just
[58:49.380 --> 58:50.380]  be gone.
[58:50.380 --> 58:51.460]  Like we would never do that.
[58:51.460 --> 58:55.380]  So like video rental itself was its own like separate luxury that we didn't do.
[58:55.380 --> 58:59.020]  But we went to far more all the time and I'm just I'm kind of surprised I never even realized
[58:59.020 --> 59:00.380]  it was a video rental option.
[59:00.380 --> 59:02.140]  Oh, it was a it was a huge driver.
[59:02.140 --> 59:03.140]  You did.
[59:03.140 --> 59:06.060]  Did you never rent video games?
[59:06.060 --> 59:11.440]  Once really one time I was like, I Yeah, and Oh, God, it was terrible.
[59:11.440 --> 59:16.260]  It was so one time, I convinced my mom to let me rent a video game.
[59:16.260 --> 59:18.380]  And it was Genesis game.
[59:18.380 --> 59:22.780]  And it was it was some it was somewhat expensive, but it was like, you know, four or five bucks
[59:22.780 --> 59:25.040]  to rent a video game at the time.
[59:25.040 --> 59:28.780]  And it was Bart versus the Space Mutants.
[59:28.780 --> 59:33.900]  Bart Simpson versus any it was one of the worst games I've ever played.
[59:33.900 --> 59:37.820]  And I mean, I guess it's a good thing I rented it before I bought it.
[59:37.820 --> 59:41.780]  But at the same time, it was such a negative experience of like, wow, we just spent, you
[59:41.780 --> 59:45.900]  know, quote, a lot of money on this terrible game.
[59:45.900 --> 59:50.260]  That was a waste and never entered into the game after that.
[59:50.260 --> 59:54.820]  My friend, same friend who helped me move the TV a couple years later, my friend Don
[59:54.820 --> 59:57.220]  and I were roommates for a year.
[59:57.220 --> 01:00:05.380]  And we we knew we needed a video game system and we bought the this must have been 1998.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.700]  We bought the Nintendo 64.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.500]  And we thought, well, you can't go wrong betting on Nintendo.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.720]  And we bought Nintendo 64.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.540]  And we got the Super Mario 3d thing, which was a great game.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:25.800]  And we of course had golden eye, which is everybody knows the golden eyed James Bond
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.060]  game for Nintendo 64 is legendary game.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.120]  It was tremendous fun was ahead of its time.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.900]  It was groundbreaking in so many ways.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:38.260]  That was the first like four player, you know, first person shooter game consoles like that
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.660]  was, it was incredible.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:46.580]  It was it and it was just tremendous fun and just Oh, by the way, if anybody wants to correct
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:51.340]  me on that, I don't care if they're n64 having four controller ports built into the system
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.820]  with no additional accessories was groundbreaking.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.420]  And that was the first big multiplayer shooting up game that use them know you could you could
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.420]  probably do it on other systems before with like adapters and stuff because they were
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.660]  like they were multi they were like four player adapters for the Genesis and for the Super
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.580]  Nintendo and probably even for the NES.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.180]  So like there, I'm sure there were other ways to do it, but nobody did.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:17.580]  The thing about the the multiplayer golden I was that it felt always felt totally fair.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:22.140]  Like it felt like every time you got killed, it was a Yeah, he got me you know that well,
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.980]  it was it was fair, but like, I was one of those people who wouldn't look at everyone
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]  else's screen.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:27.980]  Yeah.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.300]  And so but everyone else would look at mine.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.540]  So it didn't feel fair in that way.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:37.140]  Well, that game really, I mean, that like defined pretty much every like little get
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.940]  together I'd have with my friends for like a two year span in high school.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.260]  It was it was all golden.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.060]  I got better.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.920]  I got slightly better is probably one of the best games I have ever been at, you know,
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:55.260]  like in terms of my competitive stature in the grand scheme of how good people are.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.720]  I was really, really good at golden. I may be the best I've ever been at any game.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.880]  And I, my roommate Don and I were generally even he was good at video games too.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.480]  But I eventually got a little bit better than him to the point where I would get him every
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480]  time.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.360]  And one time he we lived on the third floor of a building.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.660]  And I swear to God, this is the honest to God truth.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:25.800]  The one time I killed him for like the fourth, fifth time in a row, and he threw his controller
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.880]  out the window.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.660]  And it was the most satisfying moment of my entire video game life I did.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:39.060]  Here we are 22 years later, or 23 years later, and it's still to this moment.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.240]  It's like I can just drop the mic, you know, how can you possibly get better than making
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.780]  your roommate throw his controller out the window.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:52.760]  And the best part was he had to go out and get it because we didn't have an extra controller.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.580]  And he went out and got it and it was fine.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.580]  It was fine.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:01.380]  It did have like scuff marks from where it like hit the sidewalk or whatever.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380]  But it worked.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:07.220]  And it's like, hey, hats off Nintendo, you can throw your controller out of the third
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.900]  floor window and it works.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:17.260]  Anyway, the the the video game rental story, though, was that we bought the Nintendo thinking
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:23.900]  well, you can't go wrong betting on Nintendo and we bought it and we did love Goldeneye.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:30.300]  But dammit, it's like you'd go to like blockbuster and all of the cool games were on PlayStation,
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.300]  all of them.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:36.420]  And then you'd go and look at Nintendo and it was like Yoshi's, you know, Yoshi's car
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]  watch.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.900]  It's like, yeah, I feel like the like, if your goal was to like, try a bunch of different
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.340]  games and to rent a game, rent a new game every weekend or something like, you know,
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.620]  try a bunch of different games.
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.640]  The N64 was a terrible system for that because it never had great third party support.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.580]  But if you look at that generation and you want like, what are like the top five or 10
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.380]  best games of the generation?
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.460]  Way more of them are on the N64 than on any other system.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.460]  Right.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.140]  And it had and if you want to just like have a couple of games like have a small collection
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.500]  that was really good.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.740]  You could just get an N64 and get like Goldeneye, Mario Kart, Mario 64, Zelda and be pretty
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740]  much done.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.740]  Like that's it.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.740]  Like that's all you really needed.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740]  What was the name?
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.260]  There was a really cool Star Wars game where they made up a guy who was sort of a Han Solo
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:27.220]  type guy and he flew around in a spaceship and it was really cool.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.500]  But there were seriously only like four or five good games for an N64.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.500]  But you're right.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.560]  Like the best four or five games were the best games.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.420]  But like for the variety, it was it was terrible.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.100]  Every time we went into Blockbuster and thought, let's see if there's anything new we should
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:49.860]  rent before we buy it, it was it was so incredibly disparate where like there was this whole
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:55.980]  section of PlayStation games and then there was like one shelf of Nintendo 64 games.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.980]  Terrible.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980]  Yeah.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.080]  But it was it was still like, if you look back now, like if you look back at those games
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.380]  now and you want to like play old stuff, I'm kind of in that world of like the retro gaming
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.300]  market.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.180]  I don't have any fondness for pretty much anything that was on the PlayStation or the
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.180]  Saturn.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.180]  Like and I was a huge Sega fan.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.140]  I actually at once I did once rent a Saturn.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.100]  That was later on, of course, when I when I could pay for it myself.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.020]  But that was also a waste of money.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.540]  But even just to rent the system was a waste.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.180]  But like, you know, there there were some fun games here and there on Saturn and PlayStation.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.980]  But the ones you'd actually have lasting value and want to go back to those were all in N64.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.820]  And again, it wasn't it wasn't a large number.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.100]  It was basically the ones I just mentioned, like it was five or six games that were like
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.580]  really good for that system.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.740]  But but even at the time, like, you know, the N64, I love that we're still ostensibly
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.980]  talking about the Apple TV, the N64.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.420]  It was such a better system than the other ones at the time, because the other ones were
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.100]  all CD-ROM based.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.600]  And then 64 went cartridge.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.180]  And that was actually a pain in the butt in certain ways for developers because they held
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:03.060]  so much less, but it had much nicer 3D support.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:08.260]  And because it was on the cartridge, there was no load times, no load load instantly.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.340]  And it had four controller ports built in.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:14.420]  And so it ended up, you know, the PlayStation, you'd spent a lot of time on loading screens,
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.900]  and there are only two controller ports and the 3D you would get was really jaggy.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.300]  It was bad 3D like those.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.860]  It did not age well.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.460]  The N64 Oh, yeah, it was low polygon count.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.880]  And you know, by today's standards, it was it was pretty, pretty rudimentary.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.800]  But if you look back on it, like the PlayStation one games look like hell.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.920]  And the N64 games are at least like blurry and smooth, low polygon count.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.660]  And they they loaded faster, they worked better.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.460]  And they had those four controller ports for parties.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.020]  It was just such a better system.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:48.740]  Yeah, I think and I say that that that Don had to go and get that controller.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.260]  We did have four controllers.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:55.260]  I think he just went to get it because on general principle, like, you know, I All right,
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.260]  I was a jerk.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.260]  I threw it out.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:02.740]  But we definitely had the four controllers, because the four player Mario Kart was amazing.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.740]  False.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.740]  Right.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.860]  That was Yeah, that's like your top two experiences on the N64.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.320]  I think number one is golden on number two is Mario Kart, right?
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:15.340]  And you could totally sell people on N64 just by Mario Kart, like I we'd have friends over
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.820]  and and they would be like, I'm gonna go buy a Nintendo 64 just to get this game.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.820]  Yeah.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:21.820]  Yeah, that or golden.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:27.340]  I like those those sold so many systems, like just those two games sold so many systems.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.580]  But it was very true.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.580]  All right.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.580]  Let me let me take a break here.
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.580]  Thank our next sponsor.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.580]  It's our good friends at hover.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.940]  This is a song about the Apple TV.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:43.620]  Hover is a great jumping off point for a ton of entrepreneurs.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:49.060]  And they want you to start your business or your new project or whatever you're creating
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.460]  with a great new domain name.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:56.320]  They have over 300 domain name extensions.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.220]  In other words, it like back in the day when we're talking about Nintendo, and there was
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:08.660]  just.com.net.org and.edu or whatever, they've got 300 of those extensions to choose from
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.460]  when you build your brand online.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:18.180]  And that gives you a tremendous number of options to get the word or words in front
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.220]  of the extension that you want.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.680]  Whatever you're trying to build, whatever you're thinking of, they have options for
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680]  you.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.400]  They have a tremendous This is my favorite part of hover.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:37.460]  My very favorite part of hover is if you just type the word you know if you want daring
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:42.100]  fireball.com Well, guess what, I've got that one.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:49.060]  So it's taken, but you type that in, they'll give you suggestions for what is available
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.640]  and it and they're not trying to upsell you on a thing.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.460]  They're just giving you honest help on what you want to get you type what you want to
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:02.980]  get and either it's available or they'll offer you options like oh, instead of.com
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:07.060]  why don't you get.co or something like that.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.780]  It is a tremendous interface.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.900]  It's really good.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.820]  Their support team does not try to upsell you in any way.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.380]  All they want you to do is just be a customer.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:25.900]  Pay the very competitive rates on what you pay per year to keep your domain names.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:30.940]  And if you need help, like if you have a domain name already registered somewhere else and
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:37.820]  you want to move it to hover their support team will help you to the fullest extent possible
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.780]  even if you're a completely non technical person who doesn't understand DNS at all.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:48.580]  And again, I'm I'm somewhat technical DNS confuses the hell out of me and and scares
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:52.340]  the hell out of me because you don't want to mess up your email and stuff like that.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:57.700]  They will help you out and they'll just move your domain names over from what's probably
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:03.400]  most domain name registers honestly are pretty scammy and scummy.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.940]  They will help you move these over in a safe way.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.320]  It's really great.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.260]  And they don't upsell you on nonsense that you should be getting for free.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.220]  Like who is privacy, right?
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.820]  Like who is privacy should not be something you pay extra for.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820]  It should be built in.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.820]  Well, guess what?
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.620]  Whoever it is, they are really it's just a great, great place.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:29.460]  I've been a customer for I don't even know how many years love hover.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.460]  I would recommend them to anybody who needs to register a new domain name.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:40.220]  Or if you ever feel like you've got domain names in your name, but you've always feel
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.980]  like am this company where I have my domain names is it there.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.740]  This is a terrible company.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.260]  Move it over to hover it you'll be so much happier for it.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:56.180]  It's a terrific company and again 300 domain name extensions to choose from.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.460]  Here's where to go to support the show.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:03.740]  Go to hover H O V E R dot com slash talk show.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:04.740]  That's it.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.900]  Hover dot com slash talk show.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:12.180]  And if you go to that, if you go to that URL with the slash talk show, you get a 10 percent
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.260]  discount on every new purchase.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.700]  So make a name for yourself.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.300]  Go to hover at hover dot com slash talk show.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:25.500]  Yeah, I feel like the domain name registration business is it's kind of like it like if you
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.340]  go to buy a domain name online, you don't know that much about it.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:32.620]  You're at about a high risk of running into some scammy, you know, terrible company as
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.800]  if you don't if you just search for like how to buy Bitcoin.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]  That's right.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800]  I think that's very fair.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.580]  I think that's a really good analogy.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.080]  Like it really for whatever reason, it really is an industry full of a bunch of terrible
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.080]  companies.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:51.940]  Like there's there's not a lot of like nice, trustworthy, easy places to buy domains.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:12:01.540]  It's such a weird thing where, you know, there is ICANN, which is the I C A N N, which is
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.340]  the centralized authority that controls this stuff.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:09.220]  And they're the ones who who authorized new extensions and blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.900]  You know, like our friends at Yes, please write.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.700]  They're not not a sponsor this week on this show, but they've got yes, please.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.500]  Dot coffee, which is a great way.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500]  How could that be a better domain name?
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500]  Right.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.680]  So the dot coffee extension, you know, I can controls that.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:35.420]  So there is a centralized authority, but they're not it's it's such a weird like old school
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:43.820]  Internet like we're all going to you know, the community will will police this and it's
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:50.660]  like I remember explaining it to Jonas where where my son where it's like the whole Internet
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:56.860]  really only works by IP addresses and IP addresses are like phone numbers and it's all just numbers
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:03.740]  and the whole mapping of these names, which are human readable and it's all anybody says.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.020]  I mean, when's the last time you ever went to a website and it like redirects you to
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.020]  the IP address?
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:13.380]  It never happens, except when you're like setting up like I just did it with like a
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:20.580]  label printer where it's like you go to, you know, the local IP address.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:26.700]  It's so weird, though, because domain names are so important, but it's like this like
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:32.860]  where we'll just agree that everybody will be honest about this.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.020]  And instead, what happened, of course, is that most of the companies who got involved
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:43.540]  in it are terrible, tried to try to sell you, you know, and every, you know, nickel and
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:44.540]  dime you on everything.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.940]  I do own bad coffee, by the way.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.940]  Do you really?
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.940]  I do.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.700]  I bought that when the domain name first launched, I bought that.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.140]  Do you have anything there?
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.140]  What's there?
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.140]  It's a redirect.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.380]  Where does it go?
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.420]  I'll give you one guess.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.420]  I don't know.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.740]  I don't have a guess.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.500]  But I'm going to go right now bad.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.220]  But I won't I won't spoil it for listeners.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.220]  I'll let them do it.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.900]  Oh, all right.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.900]  It kind of makes sense.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.900]  All right.
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:16.900]  I should have guessed.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.900]  I should have guessed it.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:18.900]  Yeah.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.900]  All right.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.900]  I won't spoil it.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.220]  Everybody should go to bad coffee, though, and figure it out.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.620]  You should also go to Yes, please.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.780]  They're really I'm actually currently buzzed on their coffee right now.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.660]  I love Isn't it great?
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:33.180]  I love it that they're not even a sponsor right now.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:38.780]  I was listening to your show a couple of weeks ago because they sponsored me and they sponsored
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.580]  your ATP.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:45.260]  And you even said you're you're roasting less of your own coffee because of Yes, please.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.380]  Yeah, I actually I haven't roasted since I'm since I've been at the beach, because roasting
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.100]  here is more cumbersome for various reasons.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.180]  And, and so I just didn't set up the roaster this whole year.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.080]  So I haven't roasted for like, over a year.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.040]  And I've been, you know, I've been altering between a few different mail order companies
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.620]  testing out different ones.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.060]  I spent by far the most time with Yes, please.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:09.220]  And they're the ones that I kind of just always go back to my mic.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.220]  I actually have I have it set up so that I get them every two weeks.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:18.080]  And then on the alternating weeks, I get other things like filled in for variety sake.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:24.720]  But no one else is as consistently good as they are like they are just rock solid consistent.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.540]  And that's why like they've never left my rotation.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:34.100]  My favorite story about it is that during the whole 2020 COVID year, like when when
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:39.500]  the postal system really went to hell, and everybody was freaked out and and thinking
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.000]  like, Oh, my God, this is like an election scam.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.580]  It's like the whole postal system had seized up and everybody's like, Oh, my God, if people
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.740]  try to vote by mail, they're not going to be able to, you know, get their vote counted
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.940]  and blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:16:02.280]  I it's not yes pleases fault, but my yes please shipments from Postal Service first class
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.100]  mail would be like, I got some like three weeks late.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.940]  And it's like, I ran out of coffee.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:15.900]  And it's like running out of coffee when you're a caffeine addict is a serious problem.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.060]  And it was like, Well, what do I do?
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.380]  You know, like, where do I go?
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.940]  And I like, went out, I like ventured out with my mask, and you know, worried about
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.940]  COVID.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.940]  And I'd like buy coffee.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.460]  And I'd be like, this coffee tastes terrible.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.140]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:37.200]  Like, you know, normally you one would think, you know, most people who drink coffee in
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.620]  the world, and there's a few of them, most people who drink coffee in the world, you
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:46.000]  would think how could you possibly like run out and that'd be a big problem because you
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.060]  can walk in literally anywhere and you can probably buy coffee, you know, you can either
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.060]  go to a coffee shop anywhere ever.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.520]  You can go to like, you know, a gas station and convenience store, they all sell coffee.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.080]  And you can go there and buy bags of beans almost anywhere as well.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:03.660]  Any grocery store, you know, many like comedian stores and drugstores, coffee shops usually
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.660]  will also sell beans.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:09.420]  So like, you would think that this would be the easiest thing in the world to not run
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.120]  out of.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:17.460]  But once you're accustomed to good coffee, right, then it's then it really becomes as
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.720]  if no one else sells this.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.420]  You just have to like wait for it to arrive to you.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.680]  And unless you happen to live near a really good coffee roaster, which most people don't,
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.380]  like you when if you run out of that, you're like, Oh, my God, I literally can't get this
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.380]  anywhere.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.620]  You can get something that will satisfy your chemical drug addiction, but it's not going
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.620]  to be good.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:38.620]  And you're not gonna be happy.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620]  Right.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.940]  It's like you're sitting there like, and all of a sudden, it feels like you're in like,
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:49.340]  like a clinic, like I'm trying to detox off my caffeine addiction.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.740]  And they're give, you know, like, in a Clockwork Orange, have you ever seen that?
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:57.460]  I know that you've, you've got a limited film, I've seen parts of it.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:02.980]  But you know, the gist of the movie is that that's a very, that breath did a lot of work.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.540]  The gist of the movie is that there's there's a young man who's a criminal, and he goes
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:11.660]  into the system, and they try to decriminalize him.
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.180]  Well, I don't want to spoil it.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:20.500]  But effectively, I think my analogy probably works as a better synopsis of the movie where
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:25.060]  it's like, all right, imagine you're trying to get off coffee, and your your strategy
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.900]  is okay, I'll drink as much coffee as I want, but it will taste terrible.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.180]  That's the gist of a Clockwork Orange.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:38.180]  And that's what every it's like, I don't know, I didn't know what to do when my Yes, please
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.720]  shipments were late.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.500]  And then all of a sudden, I would get the one that was three weeks late and get a new
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.900]  one that showed up on time.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.580]  And now now all of a sudden, I've got too much coffee.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.580]  But anyway,
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.020]  I was I was lucky that our put for all the postal system and drama that happened in a
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.980]  lot of places, it didn't affect us here.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.140]  Like we have a nice little like beach post office and they didn't have any of those problems.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.620]  So we we were very lucky to have Yes, please be pretty reliable throughout that whole that
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:07.620]  whole ordeal.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:13.040]  But yeah, it certainly if you want to get off of coffee, it's very, very easy.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.460]  Like just tell yourself, all right, I'm only going to drink coffee from gas stations from
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.500]  now on.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.460]  And no milk and sugar allowed has to be black.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:23.620]  I guarantee you, you will quit coffee very quickly.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.620]  Right?
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.980]  You could drink as much as you want, but it has to be straight out of the gas station.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]  Yeah.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.220]  And yeah, no, no adulteration allowed.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.340]  You have to drink it black, just straight.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.180]  And yeah, it's got to be gas station coffee.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:41.860]  I think I've told you this, if not on a podcast, but in person where I have had that experience
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:46.540]  where I drink my coffee black, I don't put sugar in, I don't put any dairy product in
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540]  it.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.540]  I just like black coffee.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:49.540]  Yeah.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  And I make it very simple.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:57.100]  I just grind the coffee, I boil water, I put a couple of ice cubes in after the water boils
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:02.280]  just to cool it down a little bit, you know, so it's a little bit lower than boiling temperature,
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.100]  you know, get it down closer to like the 190s and Fahrenheit.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.500]  And then I just do pour over.
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.060]  It's just a simple pour over thing.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:19.540]  And I make a whole, you know, craft of coffee and I drink a pot of it a day.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:25.980]  It is crazy to me how simple making great coffee can be there, right?
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.300]  Because I don't know how to cook.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.500]  I can't cook anything, but I can I feel like I can make a really good cup of coffee.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.900]  Well, I think the thing is like, you know, obviously, there's all sorts of different
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.620]  coffee paraphernalia, different brewing methods, and I've actually owned many of them myself
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.220]  and gone through a lot of that, you know, trying to go through all the gear and everything
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.780]  and and what I have done most of the time is just AeroPress, which is fantastic.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.940]  You know, that's like $25 plastic plunger that makes amazing coffee with very little
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.940]  effort.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:58.060]  And recently, I've been using a ratio coffee machine, chase Reeves turned me on to them
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.980]  forever ago and like one of his videos and, and it's I've been really enjoying it because
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.740]  it is basically an automatic pour over.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.600]  And I still like AeroPress better, like I like the output better from an AeroPress.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.720]  But the ratio is a little bit less effort when we have kind of a busy morning schedule
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.780]  this year.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.900]  So I kind of needed to save some time.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.540]  So I went with cut something a little more automatic.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:23.740]  But what's you know, I think what this shows is like, it's like if you try to dress up
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:29.260]  really bad produce, if you know you have a like, you know, canned asparagus, right, like,
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.960]  canned asparagus is not super good.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:36.060]  It's pretty, you have to do a lot to it to make anything good out of it, you know, but
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.580]  if you have like, fresh, nice asparagus, you don't have to do nearly as much to it, and
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:43.260]  you'll get much better results much more easily.
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.840]  And you'll just have a much better time.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:51.740]  That's kind of how like, when you have crappy old stale coffee, which almost anything you
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.700]  can buy, like on the shelf of a grocery store is going to be all those things crappy, old
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.700]  and stale.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.380]  And or maybe over roasted, right?
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.060]  Most likely over roasted as well.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.580]  And so if you have a because if you're selling old style coffee, one of the ways you can
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.100]  get flavor out of it is to over roast it anyway.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.860]  So if you have old crappy input, no matter what you do, but you're going to have to do
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:18.340]  a lot to that coffee and really know what you're doing to be able to brew that in a
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.620]  way that it will be a little bit less terrible.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:25.020]  Whereas if you start with really good, fresh coffee that's been well roasted by somebody
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.140]  knows what they're doing, and it's really recent.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.860]  And so you know, it's still fresh within it's, you know, within a couple of weeks of its
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:34.420]  roasting date, you can do pretty much anything to it, and it'll be great.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:38.620]  Like you don't really need a lot of skill as a coffee producer or barista, I guess,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.980]  like you don't need a lot of skill to do to get good output out of good fresh beans like
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:49.040]  that matters so much more than whatever, you know, technique and equipment you're using
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040]  to do it.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:56.220]  So it's sort of like, honestly, I know, we're on a bit of a digression here from Apple TV,
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.340]  but a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, the Apple TV was not that exciting of an update
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.620]  once we got past the remote.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:09.180]  But it's it's sort of like, wouldn't you rather read a really good book, even if it was like
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:16.780]  a, you know, just typed out and then mimeographed and then photographed and then crumpled up
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:22.140]  and then uncrumpled, but you'd, you know, like the worst possible physical manifestation
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:28.620]  of a book, it would be great, though, I'd rather read like, you know, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:35.860]  than read a bad book, prose wise, that was beautifully typeset, it's just you can't,
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:42.020]  you know, just there's no disguising it, you know, if it's a good story, it, you'll enjoy
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:46.660]  reading it no matter how bad it looks, even though it'd be better if it looked good.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:50.180]  Coffee is like that, where it's like, if it's good, if they're good beans, you almost can't
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.360]  go wrong with it.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.980]  You can't make bad, a bad coffee beverage out of good beans.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:24:00.100]  Yeah, well, you can, but it's much harder trying, right.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:06.300]  And again, if you just take like basic, normal technique, and just do an okay job of it.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.980]  If you have good beans, you're gonna get great coffee out of that.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:14.660]  All right, Apple TV, I've I love this remote.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.660]  I love it.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.740]  I wish I had it right here in my hand.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:22.060]  I did dithering last night with the remote in my hand just so I could play with it.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.700]  I love it.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:31.060]  It's it's a wonderful little device to have in your hand and it feels it it's it.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:36.180]  You know what, I was gonna go on a whole tangent about this in my review.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.100]  And then I was like, I don't know if it works.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:42.020]  It doesn't hold out because I didn't want to go into the whole video game thing.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.460]  Because the video game thing brings to mind the fact that the Apple TV is a video game
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.560]  platform.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.680]  But I was gonna talk about like, I mean, is it well, well, but that's why I didn't want
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.680]  to get into it.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.080]  There was no way to do it in a paragraph, it would have had to have been the entire
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.040]  thrust of the thing I wrote.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.400]  So I didn't even touch on video games.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.440]  But like you, no matter how good the video game console is, you have to have a good controller.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.100]  And with video games, it's more important because you're constantly there.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:19.280]  There's no point to playing a video game if you don't have a controller in your hand.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.580]  And for the most part with Apple TV, you use the controller to get to the thing you want
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:29.240]  to watch, you hit play, and then you put the remote down and you just watch right it so
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.780]  it the analogy breaks down.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:37.940]  But it's like the same way that you want a great controller to play video games, you
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:41.520]  want a good remote to watch stuff on TV.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.560]  And this remote to me is is that remote.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.900]  I'm so happy to hear this, like, again, I can't wait to get mine tomorrow, probably.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:55.720]  But wow, I'm so happy to hear that because it just this was one of those things that
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.260]  I feel like we've we've had we've been stuck with the old one for so long.
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:03.900]  And what even like when they when they quote updated it by just putting that white ring
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.020]  around them on the menu button, that was the worst.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.360]  That was that's the worst part about the whole thing.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.640]  And again, I could have gone on a whole tangent about it was like, it almost would have been
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.920]  better if they didn't change it at all.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.920]  Right.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.920]  Right.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.280]  They were just like, nope, that's our remote.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.920]  But the fact that they changed something, right, because because that suggested that
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.080]  they that they realized, oh, we need to fix something about this.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.400]  And then they thought this should do it.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.400]  That's the only problem.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.440]  We'll fix that problem.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.800]  So like, it was seeming like we were never going to get this fixed.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.240]  I mean, before that Apple TV update was announced.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.960]  Many people were saying, you know, they're probably not gonna make Apple TVs anymore.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.040]  Because right now everyone like no one's buying them because they're too expensive.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.800]  Apple won't make them cheaper.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:56.560]  And also now, you know, you can buy Apple TV content it on many other platforms now
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.160]  because they've they've expanded their support, like so now you can go and like, you know,
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.600]  most people don't even buy TV connected boxes anymore.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.760]  Most people, if when they buy new TV, it has smart apps built in, and they just use those.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:15.260]  And so it was it would it would have been equally as surprising as a new Apple TV release
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.320]  coming out if they would have discontinued the Apple TV as an entire platform and said,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.320]  all right, we're done.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.320]  Yeah.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:28.640]  Well, and it or if it and I guess, I've talked about this a lot where it's like, I've always
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.680]  had the gut feeling that they weren't giving up on the Apple TV console.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:40.880]  But again, I'm with you where it was to me, like a 5545 guess, you know, like 55% of me
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.320]  thought, I think they're gonna come out with a new Apple TV hardware.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.320]  But 45% of me was like, but maybe not.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.560]  And they'll just, you know, because it sort of seems like they were just stringing it
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:28:00.760]  out with the old one and just saying, hey, just buy an LG or whatever TV that has Apple
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.280]  TV plus built in and you can buy your iTunes movies there you log into iTunes and you get
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  all your movies and that's that's our future.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.600]  It really, it was hard to distinguish.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.080]  But I love the Apple TV platform.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.140]  I really like using it.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:25.400]  Most of the stuff that I watch, we still have cable TV, Amy watches a lot of stuff and we
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  have a TiVo.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.480]  You know, again, I should probably have Syracuse on to talk about the TiVo but we still have
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:39.040]  a TiVo and when I like it TiVo is is is like a terrific platform that never really took
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.040]  off.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.360]  It's it and still fast forwards and rewinds again, I should have really, the more we talk
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.520]  about it, like, if you want to get back at him for not knowing what a spree is, have
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.800]  me talk about the TiVo that'll do it.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.000]  I don't like the remote as much as he does.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.760]  He liked to me, it's another remote that is hard to tell up from down in it when you just
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.760]  pick it up.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.120]  But anyway, I love Apple TV.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.560]  So I'm glad that it came out.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.480]  But God damn, that remote really started to irritate me as the years went on.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:18.320]  Because it's like, how do you how did it was an experiment worth making.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.400]  And it sounds like a great idea.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.820]  But it sounds like, you know, like that slogan that Apple used a couple years ago, you know,
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:29.880]  for every 1000 knows for every Yes.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:37.240]  This seems like it was absolutely worth trying building, making actual real prototypes and
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:42.780]  then using and then it should have been one of the nose like, you know, this is a great
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.780]  idea.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:49.800]  And the basic idea of having a trackpad type surface so that you can swipe or something
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:56.680]  like that is fundamentally it's the one idea that was great from that remote, it really
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.960]  is a great idea.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:02.480]  And I don't know of any other remote control that has something like that it is actually
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:10.760]  absolutely a great idea, but implemented horribly, really horribly in a practical sense.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:17.280]  And it's like, you just should not have a remote where if you pick it up wrong, it like
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.320]  totally it could could just pause your content unintentionally.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:28.160]  It might take you back out of content, or lose your place, right.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:33.080]  And I can't even tell you how many times where it'd be like, I'll pause this, put the remote
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.040]  down, I'm gonna go Do you want something, you know, maybe I'll go get a snack, maybe
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.000]  get a refresh of a beverage or something.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.840]  Come back to the living room from the kitchen and then pick up the remote and you pick it
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.840]  up the wrong way.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.920]  And all of a sudden, you're out of the thing that you already paused.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:49.920]  Because you picked it up wrong.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.280]  It was terrible.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.400]  And they made it like the very early releases of the software for it were even worse.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.960]  They actually made it a little bit better over time with some software updates to kind
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.560]  of more aggressively reject, you know, accidental input and stuff like that.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.320]  But yeah, the initial version of software was even worse than this.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.320]  And because it's fundamentally like an ergonomics design flaw, they could never fully fix it
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.320]  in software.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.880]  The only way to fully fix it was what they did now, hopefully, because you know, with
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.840]  this new remote, and this is why I just I can't wait to get rid of the old remotes from
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.840]  my house.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:27.760]  Well, the the other thing about the new remote that is so like, I cannot believe that of
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:34.320]  all companies, Apple didn't think of this before, is that the the new thing where you
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:41.600]  can use, so they brought back the D pad circular dial, right, whatever you want to call it,
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.240]  right, there's like an up down left, right clickable ring at the top of the remote.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:55.480]  But it now in that itself is a touch surface that you can run your thumb around to go to
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.360]  do like as a jog dial.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.760]  And it's it.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.300]  It's like it.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:08.200]  It's not like an iPod, like a classic iPod, it is exactly like an iPod.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.320]  It's not like a little bit, ah, it sort of reminds you of an iPod.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:17.120]  No, it's exactly like a classic iPod, where you just run your finger in a circle to go
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:23.400]  to scroll a list or, or go forward or backward.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:29.960]  Either way, it works that the idea of running your thumb around a circle works equally well
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:35.720]  for going left to right in a in a timeline or up and down in a list.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:40.760]  And Apple invented that it's it's it's an Apple thing, right?
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:48.080]  Like it, but it's kind of the mind blowing part to me is why, and again, maybe maybe
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:53.320]  somebody a year ago was like, Hey, why don't we just do the iPod thing?
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.780]  But I can't help but think that there was somebody like back in like 2012, who was like,
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:02.200]  we should make the Apple TV remote, like the iPod, where you run your thumb around in a
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:08.640]  circle to go up and down or left and right, which works equally well, and it'll be great.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.620]  And that somebody was like, Nope, I don't want that I want the whole top to be a diving
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:20.640]  board trackpad surface, no circle that the circular thing on the new remote is the thing
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:28.440]  that that elevates it from okay, they fix the problems with the bad remote.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:35.680]  But that circular thing is what elevates it to this is the best remote I've ever used.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  It's fantastic.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.880]  I really love it.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.160]  The circular thing is, is the game changer for me, because it is like this, this is the
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.360]  thing.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:53.380]  And the thing about the the genius of the iPod click wheel is that you it's easy to
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:55.360]  keep your thumb going, right?
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.640]  You can just keep circles, circles, circles, you don't have to stop.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.880]  Whereas with the trackpad on the old Apple TV remote, you know, you'd get to the side
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.160]  and then you have to pick your thumb up and and go, you know, you have to keep
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.480]  Yeah, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, right?
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.440]  It's you've gone through all those long horizontal lists.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.060]  Oh, the circular thing is so brilliant.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:23.360]  But it's, again, it's like, how did Apple of all companies not think we should make
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:26.120]  the remote exactly like the iPod?
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:33.120]  This is a great way to scroll a long list or to scrub content left to right it it mind
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.120]  boggling.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:40.160]  I wonder if you know, one of the biggest pains in the butts about about tv OS, you know,
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.080]  since the since the tv OS itself is launched, is how much navigation is swiping through
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.600]  long horizontal lists, because before that previous Apple TVs, and almost everything
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.480]  else that ever ran on a TV would organize lists vertically.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:59.060]  And, you know, if you were designing it for the trackpad remote that you know, the outgoing
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:04.200]  Siri remote, if you're designing for that you might it obviously makes sense like well,
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:08.800]  if swiping horizontally is easier than swiping vertically, then you should align the interface
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.480]  to that and design the whole thing to be all horizontal lists, right, even though it kind
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.480]  of visually sucks and it sucks when they're very long.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:21.520]  I wonder if now that the if the primary interaction method is going to become moving your moving
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:28.480]  your finger around the wheel, then that would free them up to redesign tv OS itself to be
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.880]  more vertical list based.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.400]  I wonder if they'll ever do that, because I think that would be that would be a significant
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.400]  improvement.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.400]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.920]  It's it.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.880]  I would say with the new remote, though, it all works so much better.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:51.580]  And and if there's if if there's a downside, it's that that center area in inside the wheel
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.080]  is a little small.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.800]  So when you are swiping in whatever direction you want to go, you're right, like not just
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.040]  up and down or left and right, like with the wheel, when you're in the middle, you can
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.880]  go whichever direction you want.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:10.180]  It is a little small, but I still feel it in my use over the last week, it's it's it's
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:14.000]  big enough that for the most part, it's it.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  It's big enough.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.440]  I was gonna ask about that, actually.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:22.520]  So like, so it's not like when you the combination of the D pad and the inner trackpad is not
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.640]  one contiguous trackpad surface, right?
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.640]  Right?
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.480]  No, no, it's like two different trackpad surfaces.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.480]  Right.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.320]  And so like, so I assume it has to be doing some kind of, you know, heuristics and rejection
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.720]  to, to prevent accidental input from it from whichever one of those you're not trying to
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.600]  use as you use the other one, like, does it do a good job of that?
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.680]  Yeah, it seems to it seems to do a job.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.440]  I've I thought of that where it's a it almost feels like you need this, you need to tell
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:53.960]  somebody, hey, you know, you can use the ring as a as a wheel, like, I feel like if there's
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.120]  a downside to it, it's that a lot of people are never going to realize that they can run
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.680]  their thumb around the wheel.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:05.560]  Because if you don't know that you can do it, you would never know that the outer ring,
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.160]  the D pad ring is itself a, a touch surface.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.800]  Right, right, right.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.800]  That makes sense.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.980]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's just a great remote.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:18.560]  And it's so much thicker than the old one.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.980]  Any of the old ones, right?
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.680]  Like that I, you know, broke down and put a photo in my review just to show how much
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.060]  thicker it is.
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:31.320]  And again, there was no it's not like they needed the extra battery life like one, you
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:38.000]  know, nobody complained that like of all of our 100 complaints about the crappy black
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.960]  Siri remote, the battery life was fine, right?
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.000]  You can get great you go most of a year without recharging it.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.480]  And when you do recharge it, you just plug it into a lightning cable for a couple minutes
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.720]  and then it's fine.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.880]  It's not like they made it thicker because it needed more battery life.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.160]  They just made it thicker because it was too thin, you know, it was it was too light and
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.440]  flimsy and inconsequential in your hand.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.880]  Whereas this one fragile, the almost like, you know, if you would drop that and break
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]  the glass.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.880]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.880]  Like it was it was fragile.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  Right.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.520]  This one contains no glass, which is good for remote.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.920]  No, it really feels like this aluminum slab that you could like throw against the wall
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.240]  you or if you know it, again, not to get into a video, but you could throw it out the window.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.240]  And it'll be fine.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.240]  It'll be fine.
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.240]  There's no way that's gonna break.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.160]  It's it feels almost indestructible.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:36.240]  It's a great device I but again, I it's like, I want to praise it.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:43.520]  But I also want to make sure that I emphasize it's it's mind boggling that as if if you
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.660]  are a hey, I'm going to update to the latest and greatest Apple TV hardware every time
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:57.680]  they do it, that you spent six, six goddamn years with a terrible remote control that
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.920]  they only mitigated by putting a ring around a button that you generally don't have to
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.640]  use much.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.040]  That's the only thing they did in six years.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:14.520]  Well, and as you pointed out to like, it was always called menu, but even at the very beginning,
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.520]  that was wrong.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.280]  It always logically meant back, right?
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:22.360]  And like, when they put the white ring on, why didn't they rename the button to back?
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.360]  Right?
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.420]  And it's even better than it's just a chevron, right?
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.000]  Because it's better than putting the word B A C K on the button.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.360]  It's better to just put the chevron because then it's universal.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.900]  And everybody understands is right.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:44.200]  But it's like, that if I don't know, that was like a weird that that one to me also
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.000]  is like, because it's the sort of thing that Apple does so well, like they really do.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.140]  And it's underappreciated.
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:58.960]  Like they, they're very, very good at picking user interface labels for things, right?
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.600]  Like they're, you know, they have very good user interface copywriters, for lack of a
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.720]  better word.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.240]  Menu is it from the very first Apple TV, it's always been very strange, because it never
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.920]  brought up a menu.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.920]  Yeah.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:20.340]  Even in version 1.0 of tvOS, like, I mean, it would occasionally bring you to a menu,
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.560]  but by circumstance, like, that's not that was not the common case.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.000]  Very strange label.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.960]  Anyway, I love it.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.560]  It's really good.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:35.620]  There's no reason I again, I unless you know, before we move on, unless you really know
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:42.040]  that you you need thread support right now, there's, there's no reason to upgrade from
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:48.800]  the old 4k Apple TV to the new 4k Apple TV, unless you need the thread support, or you
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.040]  really think that Wi Fi six is going to improve your experience versus Wi Fi five.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.940]  I mean, that to me, that's good.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.940]  That's progress.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:04.800]  I'm glad they support Wi Fi six now, but I cannot say that my old Apple TV 4k got bad
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.480]  Wi Fi, because it was only only Wi Fi five.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.360]  I don't know what the thread stuff does.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:20.760]  I don't know what I have no Dolby vision, high frame rate HDR content to watch, you
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.400]  know, just just just buy the new remote and you'll be fine.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.400]  Yeah.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.580]  Although if you know if you have one of the pro phones, you can shoot that content, right?
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:36.780]  One of the one of the pro 12 series, those can shoot Dolby vision 60 frames a second,
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:42.340]  my lowly 12 mini, which apparently nobody except me wants to buy.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.820]  But my my 12 mini can only shoot 30 frames a second Dolby vision.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.820]  You know, that's funny.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.020]  I wasn't going to bring that up.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:52.640]  But I know that you got the 12 mini I regret not buying the mini what I bought.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  I love it.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.800]  Well, what I bought for myself, though, was just the regular 12.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.240]  So I'm tech tech spec wise, I don't have the pro I bought.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.120]  This is the first year where I didn't buy the best possible iPhone, I just wanted the
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.800]  plane 12.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.280]  Because I really thought that the glass back was just a better texture and I like the feel
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.000]  of it.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.800]  And the other thing too, and I think you've mentioned this, the other thing too is I knew
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:26.080]  when I bought it in October, that you know what, it's going to be at least at least best
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.240]  case scenario half a year before I even leave the house.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.480]  So why do I care about the camera right like, you know, battery life wasn't that important
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480]  either.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.480]  Right?
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]  Same thing.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.480]  It's well, on the mini.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480]  Yeah.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.480]  The battery life is not great.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.480]  Yeah.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.320]  But but you know, it hasn't mattered much to me in practice because I don't go very
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  far.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.960]  I think here's here's my gut feeling my gut feeling is that the mini if it is it seems
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.320]  to be selling relatively poorly, whatever, whatever, however well shame, because honestly,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.320]  I love it.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.160]  I feel though that a big part of that is that the only way to truly appreciate it is to
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.160]  see it in person.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:09.200]  You cannot look at specs and say, Oh, it's only five inches and or whatever the size
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:15.600]  of the mini is, you know, and when you tell people the size on a on a web page, as you're
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.400]  ordering a phone, it doesn't make sense in a way that if you go and hold it in your hand,
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.040]  you're like, Oh, my God, this is amazing.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040]  Yeah.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.400]  And because no one could really see these things in person this year, right?
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.160]  I think that definitely played a part.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.840]  I don't think it played a big enough part, though, to like, I think I think the real
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:38.560]  story is what we've seen over and over again, which is like, people say they'll buy small
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.880]  phones, but then when you give them bigger ones, they buy the bigger ones instead.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.640]  And while some people prefer the small ones, like me, you know, in this case, it's not
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.120]  enough people to justify it.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:56.080]  And in many ways, the small phone market is also the low end phone market.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.120]  And Apple already satisfies that in part with the iPhone se line.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.640]  And you know, I don't know to what degree they're going to maybe keep making the mini
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.560]  in the future as a cheaper model.
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.920]  I don't know if they're going to do that or not.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.880]  Or if they're going to just, you know, once the 13 line comes out, maybe the 12 mini is
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:14.840]  just gone from sale, like they often do.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.880]  Or maybe maybe only the 12 is for sale, and not the 12 mini anymore, which wouldn't surprise
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.760]  me at all.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:29.320]  But, you know, it definitely does seem like the small phone market is mostly the low end
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.800]  slash inexpensive phone market.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.960]  And there's a few people like me, who would pay like whatever they wanted to charge for
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.760]  a really high end but small phone.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:43.400]  But I don't think there's enough of us, I think most of the high end market has shown
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:47.680]  that just by what they actually buy, they've shown they want the pretty big ones for the
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:48.680]  most part.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.160]  And, you know, that's as somebody like me who appreciates the size.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.520]  Right now, this is a good year for me.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.660]  I expect, you know, based on the way Apple does things and the rumors, I expect we're
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.940]  probably going to get a 13 mini.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.940]  But then I think that's it.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:07.600]  I think, you know, once they change the case next time or whatever, like once they update
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.480]  it, the initial design this it's out.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:15.920]  No, what I think they'll do is they'll make a 13 mini and it'll be top of the end specs.
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.000]  And then the next time we see that size will be the next iPhone SE.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.120]  Oh, yep, right.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.120]  That's exactly it.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.120]  Yep.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.120]  Right.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.680]  So like a year and a half after the iPhone 13s, or if they call them 12s, who knows
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.520]  what they're going to call them this year, but a year and a half later, they'll come
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.140]  out with one more at that size.
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:39.960]  They'll call it the new iPhone SE and it'll be, you know, I don't know, only 400 bucks
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960]  or something like that.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.960]  Yeah.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.800]  And it'll be, it'll be the 13 mini with like the 15s guts and then that'll be it.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.800]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800]  All right.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.800]  Let me take a break here and thank our friends at Squarespace.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.600]  Look, I'm not going to spend a lot of time here telling you about Squarespace.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600]  You know what they are.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.240]  They're all in one.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:02.900]  This is where you go to build a website and it's just fantastic.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.020]  You do it right in your browser.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.620]  What you see is what you get.
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:11.960]  That's a phrase that used to be like, really, you know, we used to talk about WYSIWYG 20
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.380]  years ago and it was like, that was like a huge thing where it was like, and instead
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:22.080]  of like putting formatting codes into a word processor, you just, you're, what you saw
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:27.080]  in your word processing document was what would come out when you printed it.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.280]  Well, Squarespace is exactly like that.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:37.760]  You go to Squarespace and you, when you go to configure, design, tweak, change your website,
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:45.520]  it's literally your admin interface to your Squarespace website is it's just that you
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:50.540]  as the admin get to edit it and then you say, okay, that's good.
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:51.540]  That's the way it will be.
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:57.440]  And then when people who are not, you go to your website, what they see is exactly what
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.940]  you saw when you were tweaking it.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.940]  It's fantastic.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:07.960]  They have great tech support, great prices, everything, anything you would want if you
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  need a website.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.060]  And again, I always say this and I've stolen it from my guest today, Marco, this, this
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:22.220]  idea I repeated every time, but you as a listener of this show are probably the sort of person
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:26.500]  that anybody in your life who needs a website comes to like, Hey, I need a website.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.560]  What should I do?
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:28.820]  Send them to Squarespace.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.100]  You get them out of your hair.
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.620]  They can do it all themselves.
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:32.620]  It's great.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:41.060]  Go to squarespace.com, enter the code talk show when you check out and they'll get 10%
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.060]  off.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.980]  And you can start by going to squarespace.com slash talk show, and they'll know that you
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.140]  came here from the show.
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:54.200]  So go to squarespace.com talk show slash talk show or send your friends and family and everybody
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.420]  else there.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:48:02.700]  And when you use that code, just plain talk show, you save 10% great.
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:03.700]  What else we got?
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.700]  We got the iMac.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:06.060]  You want to talk iMac?
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.820]  I think it's been mostly well covered elsewhere.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:16.500]  The only thing I really will say on it is that it really shows how much a design matters
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:26.300]  that in 2021, Apple has succeeded in getting people excited about a low end desktop.
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.300]  That's true.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.300]  It's very true.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:33.860]  That actually was sort of the one of my ideas for the gist of my review.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.940]  Like what, how should I write it?
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:42.940]  And it's like, isn't it cool that like just a low end desktop computer could be exciting
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:45.100]  and worth talking about?
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.100]  Yeah.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.660]  Like people are really excited about it.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.740]  They're excited to get it.
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:50.740]  They're showing off.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.820]  They're showing pictures.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:55.620]  People on YouTube are talking about it and like it shows you, first of all, I think the
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:01.060]  design is, is for the most part a home run, but it just shows you how important design
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:06.420]  updates still are because this product by all means is an incredibly boring product
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.420]  in Apple's lineup.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:13.060]  Like the, the, the low end small sized iMac has been, you know, a pretty good seller for
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:14.060]  Apple.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.060]  I think forever.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:19.100]  It's been like being bought in large numbers for computer labs and for businesses and you
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.500]  know, for like, you know, real estate offices where you like you have somebody coming in
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.300]  like seeing a computer on your desk and you want to look nice and you put an iMac there
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:29.780]  and they sell a bunch of these things and I think they always have, but it's not an
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:30.780]  exciting product.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:34.780]  Usually like you look back at all the 21.5 inch iMacs that we've had, you know, up to
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:39.700]  this point and there, it's mostly a pretty boring series of desktops that they would
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:43.900]  update every few years and nobody would say a thing or like they would update it at the
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:47.100]  same time as they updated the bigger ones and we talk about the bigger ones maybe because
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.580]  we were buying them for ourselves, but no one else would care.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:50.740]  You know, it wasn't exciting.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:56.780]  It wasn't like a big thing and, and the fact that like, you know, in 2021 for all intents
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:01.960]  and purposes, nobody cares about desktops and I say this as a desktop user and lover,
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.300]  but most people who care about desktops care about the high end, the higher end desktops
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.100]  and there's not many of us left even there.
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.980]  You know, most computer users are laptop users.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:19.340]  And so the fact that they launched a brand new desktop design now in this day and age,
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:24.020]  and it's getting this much excitement and joy and attention from people and by all accounts,
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:28.180]  it seems like a pretty good computer because of course, it's an M1 and all M1s are fantastic
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.180]  computers.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:34.620]  I know because I own two of them already like, it's, it's, it really shows, first of all,
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:40.820]  how great the M1 is, but which we already knew, but also just how great it is to have
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:47.980]  like a fresh new redesign and how much energy that breathes into a category that otherwise
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:54.660]  for all intents and purposes was in the PR sense, just totally dead and useless.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:51:03.020]  And the bringing back of vibrant color choices, which has been missing for honestly, I mean,
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:10.620]  since the G3 iMacs, I mean, there, there have not been colorful desktop Macs for 20 years.
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:15.620]  And people love to buy stuff that is in colors that they like.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.620]  It's like it.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:22.380]  And again, here's one where I'm totally willing to throw Johnny Ive under the bus because
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:28.900]  I think you have to say it was Johnny Ive who really insisted that everything stay within
[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:37.780]  these very muted, true to the nature of aluminum colors, you know, because even the gold ones,
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:41.620]  you know, the gold, you know, you can't say that they didn't have any colors other than
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:46.660]  gray and dark gray, because they had the gold, but it's like, come on, the gold was very
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.660]  muted.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:52.380]  I mean, didn't you buy you bought Yeah, I actually I have the gold M1 MacBook Air.
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.380]  Yeah.
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:54.380]  That's my laptop.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.540]  You kind of lose track of the color though, right?
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:00.080]  Like you're using it and it doesn't feel like you're using a gold computer.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:05.300]  It's like you're using a you just kind of sort of start to see it as that's the neutral
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:09.940]  color, whereas when you're using these IMAX, it's like, Oh, this is orange and it pops,
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:10.940]  you know?
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.940]  Yeah.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:15.380]  And yeah, because I and I think, you know, part of this, I think is absolutely late at
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.380]  Johnny Ive's feet.
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:20.880]  And I think Phil Schiller's as well, I think I think these were, these were people who
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.500]  who aren't known for like, wanting a lot of fun in the product necessarily, like they
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.860]  take a more serious approach.
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:32.380]  And and I think, you know, you can look at that from one end and say, you know, man,
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:35.460]  we like that sucks, we missed all this color for all this time.
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:38.940]  On another, you know, from another point of view, though, it's part of fashion and fashion
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:39.940]  goes in and out of style.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:45.980]  And I think, you know, in the, in the original IMAX G3 era, like Apple introduced color to
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:51.380]  the road of consumer electronics, and it was really big for a little while.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:55.820]  And then eventually, like that kind of phased out of fashion, and things got more serious.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:00.380]  And as everything moved from plastic to metal, everything got, you know, just like the look
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:05.780]  of raw aluminum became the look of nice hardware for a long time.
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.020]  And that was just what was in fashion.
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:10.960]  And then, you know, and Apple has always been good at at coloring aluminum, like they did
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:15.600]  with the original iPod lineup, like, you know, the iPod mini and everything had fantastic
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.600]  colors.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:19.620]  And, and eventually the nano, you know, once that went aluminum as well, like, they always
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.020]  had really good aluminum colors.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:27.760]  But you know, for the most part, I think the the industry, just like what was cool for
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.980]  a long time, was metal, just sheer like natural looking aluminum, and then eventually, dark
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.120]  metal, space gray, like what, however, like 19 different colors that has meant over the
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120]  years.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.040]  You know, we just had gray and dark gray for a long time.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:48.120]  And eventually, they realized that they could do colors in the iPhone line to help jazz
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:52.300]  it up as their industrial design rate of change slowed down in other ways they would they
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:55.300]  realize like, oh, well, if we're going to keep the same industrial design for two or
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:59.900]  three years for a phone, in years two and or three, we can introduce a new color to
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.500]  help jazz it up.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:07.200]  But for the most part, it was still and I think largely still is considered like, only
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.040]  for low end stuff or only only for like, you know, the the more consumer line of things
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:15.920]  to be actually want color and it remains to be seen whether Apple has seen the light on
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:20.080]  that for the higher end of you know, their upcoming products I hope they have I fear
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:21.080]  they haven't.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.760]  I'm pretty sure what's going to happen is that the the you know, iMac Pro with a big
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.280]  iMac is probably just going to look like the iPhone 12 Pro it's going to be you know, maybe
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.720]  like a steel ring within like the dark handful of colors they offer and that's it.
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:41.140]  But ultimately, I think this was this was largely a part of I think, you know, the the
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:47.360]  Johnny Ive exit and and what's your name Evans hanky the new Yeah, Evans hanky Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.920]  So I if this is what we're seeing from Evans hanky style, I'm a big fan.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:56.360]  I think it wouldn't surprise me at all if that's, that's a big part of the change that
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.360]  precipitated this.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.040]  But again, I think like part of it was the staff change, like, you know, the leadership
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.120]  change there.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:08.400]  But I think part of it's also just the world is coming out of that that fashion cycle where
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.880]  what we wanted was just a bunch of dark metal.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.560]  And we're we're for many reasons, kind of in the mood for some color now.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.560]  And so I think it's just it part of it is just that part of fashion came back around.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.960]  And now it's time.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.720]  I also feel and I talked to Apple, you know, in the private briefings that are off the
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:36.020]  record, but so I won't quote anybody directly, but it it it it is perfectly timed for coming
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:42.360]  out of the worst year in our life, anybody's lifetimes, right, this this terrible year
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:47.400]  of being shut in, and seeing the same stuff, and everybody is just, you know, wants to
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.840]  get back to normal and have some fun.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.920]  And boy, are these fun looking computers, they're just gorgeous.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:58.960]  I mean, I've only seen the orange one in per in person, because that's the only one that
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  they sent me.
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:04.720]  I mean, thank God, because I wouldn't want I wouldn't, it's a big, still a big box.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:09.160]  I'm so I'm glad they didn't send me like all six boxes.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:12.760]  And then, you know, I'd have to send them all back and blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:19.680]  But just judging by the orange one, and how much better I think the orange one looks great
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.160]  on screen, when you're like, hey, which one do I want?
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:27.000]  I like the look, it looks great on screen, you see it in person, it looks even better.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.840]  And I've heard and just chatting with the people who and and reading the reviews that
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.800]  other people wrote, everybody seems to have that same opinion, no matter which color they
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.920]  got that, hey, the blue one looks better in person than you, then it looks on screen and
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.160]  on screen, it looks great.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.560]  And it's just so fun.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.240]  And it seems so perfect for the moment.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:53.480]  But I'm with you, I haven't, I don't think they're going to do it with the pro ones.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.860]  I think the pro ones are still going to be like, you can get whatever, whatever color
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:58.920]  you want, as long as it's a shade of gray.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:56:59.920]  Yeah.
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.160]  And that's I mean, this is this is another area where I'm so happy.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.080]  I went with the 12 mini this year, instead of usually I would go for like, the smaller
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:11.760]  of the pro phones, you know, like the 10, the 10, or the 10, or the 10, the 10 s and
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.400]  the 11 Pro, like that, that's how I went before.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:21.120]  But I was always envious of the better colors that would be on the like the 10 R and the
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.880]  11 base model and stuff like that I was always envious of those because they always have
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.520]  better colors.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:31.320]  And I'm so happy now that I have like, my cool red iPhone mini this year that like,
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  and and one of the reasons I didn't go with the iPhone 12 Pro, even even the smaller of
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:39.960]  the two is that I think it looks significantly worse.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.160]  Like the blue looks decent, but you touch those steel bands and they're covered in fingerprints.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.160]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.440]  I don't like it feels worse.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.440]  It looks worse.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  It's heavier, like by a lot like this bigger and heavier.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:55.080]  And like, I love my little weightless feeling bright red iPhone 12 mini.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.720]  It's so nice.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:02.080]  And because, you know, for many reasons, you know, we've we've had this, this awful pandemic
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.520]  that's torn apart the world in so many ways.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:12.080]  That itself was the capper to the Trump administration, which was its own dark times, right, so many
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.080]  other ways.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.200]  So like, we've come out of this like, cynical, dark, awful, tragic time.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:25.280]  And I feel like we're in for a pretty big upswing of like, just joy and happiness and
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:31.000]  just getting back, getting back into things we like and happy, just feeling good again.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.400]  And it's going to take us a little, you know, might be a bumpy transition for people to
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.400]  get there.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.400]  But that's where we're heading.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:40.600]  And I feel like this, we're like this year, the rest of this year is going to be just
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:44.160]  like a celebration in many ways for a lot of people.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:49.160]  And it's a perfect time to have bright new colorful stuff again, be introduced into into
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.160]  our world.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:57.000]  And that makes me wonder too, if if, in the new regime, the Evans Hanke regime, for lack
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:05.020]  of a better word, maybe Yeah, maybe even if the pro computers aren't rainbow spectrum
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:12.640]  colored, but maybe they'll be more like the light one is white, and the dark one is black,
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.640]  right?
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:17.320]  It's more like stormtrooper Darth Vader type thing.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:24.960]  And they still pop in a way that, honestly, I again, it's not going to keep me from buying
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.960]  one.
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:30.120]  But honestly, the what do they call it space gray aluminum.
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.120]  I'm sick of it.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.120]  I really am.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.120]  I'm sick of it.
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.680]  I've bought so many space gray things from Apple.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:42.680]  And it's like, I still like it better than the the pure aluminum that isn't colored.
[01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:45.160]  But it's like, come on, see, I went the other way.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.660]  Like I stopped, I was sick of space gray a few years back, too.
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:50.560]  And I just started buying like the light colored version.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:56.380]  I bought like the the, you know, the whitish phone and the I bought the silver laptops
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.920]  and I did like them better.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:03.800]  But but like it, you know, it wasn't a good like the whitish iPhone 11 Pro was not a good
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.800]  white, right?
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:09.640]  You know, it's like a real like regular like matte bright white would have looked way better
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:11.440]  and I would have greatly preferred that.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.760]  All right, let me take a last break here.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.120]  And I'm not I'm not making this up this that I didn't fix.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.880]  I didn't fix this just to have Marco on the show.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.840]  But our fourth and final sponsor is Mack Weldon.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:28.120]  I'm wearing like, let me see you want to read for me.
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.160]  Do you want to do it?
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.160]  I could do it from memory.
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:31.160]  Sure.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:32.160]  I mean, I'm wearing their socks.
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:36.960]  The only other person I've ever done this is Merlin Merlin's the only other person who's
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.480]  ever taken over a read for me.
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.480]  But do you want to do it?
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.480]  You want to tell people?
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.480]  Yeah.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.880]  Well, they're reinventing men's basics, basically.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.920]  And you know, this spring, we're all going to be busting out, we're going to be getting
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.320]  outside.
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:51.900]  And you know, you want to look good, you want to, you know, have good, good new clothing
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.000]  to wear.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:59.360]  And Mack Weldon just makes the best, you know, shirts, pants, t shirts, underwear, socks,
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.440]  like sweatpants, exercise gear, jackets, even wear their slippers, like they make the best
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  stuff.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:09.160]  And every day, I'm wearing Mack Weldon's clothes, because I all of my underwear is there.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.940]  So every day, I happen to wear underwear every day.
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:15.320]  So every day, I'm wearing Mack Weldon's clothes, no matter what, because it's at least the
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.440]  underwear.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:19.880]  About half to two thirds of the time, I'm wearing one of their t shirts.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:22.880]  Also, I especially enjoy the silver line.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.680]  This is a fabric that actually has silver fibers as part of the fabric blend.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.600]  And silver is naturally antimicrobial.
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:35.240]  So what this means is that you're basically wearing a t shirt that is sticking antimicrobial
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.720]  cloth into your armpits.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:41.880]  So they can't stink, like they literally you'd be shocked like you, I wear these all summer
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.600]  long, because you basically can't stink in a Mack Weldon silver t shirt.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:49.800]  It's it's an amazing fabric, good for workout wear to they and you can also buy the silver
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:51.340]  fabric in their underwear and everything.
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:53.200]  So it is fantastic.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.440]  All their stuff, it has consistent fit, easy shopping, it all like, you know, works well
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:01:59.440]  with each other.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.640]  So you know, you know that like, okay, if you got this type of shirt, and you're a small,
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.820]  you can be confident that you can buy this new line, you can buy it's small and it'll
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.820]  fit you.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.960]  Their long sleeve stuff is great.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.960]  Once it gets cooler.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.960]  I love the warm knit stuff.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.960]  They're like waffle knit shirt.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.460]  They just have an amazing line of products.
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:17.160]  They also have a free loyalty program.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.220]  Here's how it works.
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:23.080]  You get I can't remember all this all right, so now you get your first purchase, let me
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.140]  take level one, you just get it for free, you get your first purchase, you make your
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:28.960]  first purchase, you get free shipping for life after that.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:35.880]  And then if you spend $200 you get 20% off for the next year automatically and all your
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:36.880]  purchases.
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:37.880]  That's great.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:38.880]  Right.
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:40.280]  That's fantastic.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:47.040]  I will tell you their their polo shirts are the I have gotten numerous compliments since
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.560]  I've been reintroduced into real life and left the house.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.640]  It both my wife and Jonas are both say, Hey, that's a nice shirt.
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:56.700]  They never tell me I have a nice shirt on.
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:00.640]  It's the Mack Weldon polo shirt and it's a really nice polo shirt.
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:01.760]  I love it.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.640]  I remember when you and I were out we were for a friend Michael Lops birthday party right
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:12.960]  before about like a month and a half before the whole world shut down.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:17.920]  And I came down to the lobby and you were wearing a Mack Weldon warm knit shirt.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:18.920]  I was like, I know that shirt.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:19.920]  I have that shirt.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.920]  Yep.
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:23.480]  It's like, you're a podcaster aren't you?
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.480]  Yeah, you're a podcaster.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.840]  But they're great shirts.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:30.200]  It's not I don't wear the stuff because they sponsor the show.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.600]  I wear it because it's great.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.440]  Anyway, here's where you go to find out more.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:39.520]  You get 20% off your first order as a new customer exactly like you're at level two.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:48.100]  You go to Mack Weldon, M-A-C-K W-E-L-D-O-N, mackweldon.com slash talk show, and you enter
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:51.560]  the promo code talk show you get 20% off your first order.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:57.680]  It's like you're already in the high level of their warranty program or loyalty program.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.200]  Anyway, the stuff is great.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.440]  I would not tell you this.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.440]  I know that Marco always says it went on ATP.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.800]  I wear their stuff all the time because it's just fantastic.
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.540]  Why wouldn't I wear it?
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.960]  And I get annoyed when I run out of my Mack Weldon socks and I have to wear other socks.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:13.960]  I'm like, this sucks.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.960]  These socks suck.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.640]  And I'm like, I should buy more socks so that I never run out.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.280]  Anyway, homestretch of the show.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:32.640]  I guess we have to talk about the iPad Pro, which is, to me, it's a fantastic product.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.760]  And I described it in my review as pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the best computing
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.640]  hardware on the planet today.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:40.960]  And I believe that.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.520]  And yet, I'm totally unexcited by it.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:46.200]  Well, what would you say is better?
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:48.120]  What's a better as a hardware product?
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.120]  The M1 MacBook Air.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:55.440]  No, because the see, I think you're talking about the overall experience of using the
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.440]  device.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.960]  I'm talking like you don't even really wake it up, just like or like you don't really
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.680]  wake up the M1 MacBook Air.
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.680]  You open it up.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:12.320]  I mean, that's but like what I'm saying is like, clearly, the iPad is a better product.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:16.680]  It has a much better display than the iPad than the MacBook Air.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.680]  It's that is true.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.760]  I will give you that.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.920]  But way better display.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:25.040]  I mean, like, if you wanted to have like, if you're if you're taking like most people,
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.120]  and you say, all right, you're going to have only one thing, you're going to either have
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.640]  an iPad or a Mac, like, you're not going to have both.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.440]  It's like, if you had to pick just one of those things, I think you'd have to pick the
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:42.360]  Mac for most people, because, you know, unless they have like, you know, very low needs,
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:47.320]  but there are so many things still on iOS, where like, okay, a lot of this stuff that
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:49.700]  you do is really nice and easy and better than on the Mac.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:53.600]  But then you hit a wall that something that iOS makes difficult or impossible.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:57.760]  And then it's like, well, you can either become an extreme iPad power user to get over this
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.760]  wall.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:02.080]  Or you can just do it on a computer the way you already know how to do it.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:07.200]  See, but it's like I, I feel like I'm not expressing my cell phone.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:13.760]  Maybe I didn't write it well, either then it's like, I'm not saying I would rather have
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:25.480]  a a Dell laptop running Mac OS than the the iPad Pro, if if if I could have a Dell lap,
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:32.400]  you know, piece of shit, a total piece of crap, the worst possible, because I'm so you
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.760]  have to use the Dell trackpad Well, even even if I did, I don't know what
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:37.760]  I would do.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:40.400]  But I'm so looking at a mouse.
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:48.240]  I'm so mentally invested in the Mac way of doing things that I would use anything running
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:51.800]  the Mac instead of an iPad if it was my only device.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:56.200]  So I'm not talking about the overall experience of buying it and owning it and using it as
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.200]  your own thing.
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:06.400]  I'm just saying, as a piece of hardware, separated from the software that runs on it, just totally,
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.600]  you know, you know, don't don't judge it by the software.
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:15.480]  It's the best piece of hardware I've seen I've ever seen in my life, because the display
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.480]  is amazing.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:21.840]  And I know you don't have the 12.9 inch new iPad in front of you haven't seen the display.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.080]  And it really, really shines.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:27.800]  The thing that I did that really was like, Oh, my God, this is amazing, was show I put
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:37.280]  fired up the same movie on the M1 MacBook Pro, which I love, and the iPad side by side,
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:45.320]  and it makes the M1 MacBook Pro which has a 20% brighter screen than the air.
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:49.940]  So if the air would look even worse, it makes it look like you're using like a computer
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:57.320]  from like the Soviet era of Russia, you know, it's like it, it looks terrible.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:02.480]  It's so much brighter, it is such a great piece of hardware.
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:06.560]  And I would never use it as my primary computer, like that's where I'm going.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:10.600]  It's the greatest piece of hardware I've ever seen pound for pound, dollar for dollar.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:15.760]  And because of the limitations of iPad OS, mentally, for me, the friction that's involved
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:22.560]  every time I try to do what I consider work on it, I would never use it as my main computer
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:30.960]  I think I and it seems, you know, like you put your, you know, like the old saying, like
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.440]  where you could put your ear to the railway tracks and hear a train coming.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:41.600]  It seems to me like this is going to be a very big WWDC for iPad OS, because I think
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:46.740]  that they kind of punted last year, there's there were some weird features from I mean,
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:50.880]  you know, this from developing, you know, your app, there were a lot of features that
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:09:00.120]  made it to iOS 14 for the iPhone that didn't go to the to the iPad, it was kind of weird,
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:06.480]  you know, given that it almost makes it seem like they part of the reason that they renamed
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:12.000]  the iPad fork of this operating system to iPad OS was so that they could, they could
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.320]  do something like that and just deliver features to the iPhone that they didn't give to the
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.640]  iPad.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:23.360]  To me, that's the it's almost like to me, like, you can't really fully review this new
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.540]  iPad Pro until we see what they're what's coming next month at WWDC.
[02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:29.300]  It just is not pro.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:32.800]  It's not a pro OS, in my opinion.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.880]  I think I mean, part of that, yeah, I definitely agree with that.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:42.400]  And we've seen this pattern ever since the iPad has been introduced, where they do a
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.800]  lot of amazing things with the iPad software, but they they take their sweet time on it
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.840]  and a lot of times, you know, it's very clear that the iPad software kind of lags behind
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:54.040]  the iPhone side of iOS.
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:58.320]  And I don't think the giving it its own name, I don't think changed really anything.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.400]  I mean, it was, I think, purely just a, you know, a nice marketing term.
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.280]  And it, it showed iPad power users like, hey, we care so much about you and this platform
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.800]  that we're going to really get serious about this.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:14.200]  But I don't I don't think they've really gotten significantly more serious about it than they
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.200]  did before.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.400]  Like, we're on a similar cycle where the iPad is getting power user upgrades, but you know,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.580]  maybe every like two to three years, things actually are like substantial about it.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:31.680]  And they're still really kind of glaring holes and awkwardness in things like multitasking
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:39.200]  or file handling or things like that, that that that are just very easy to do on Macs
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:44.280]  and PCs that that's still on iPads, you still have to be kind of a power user to do a lot
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.760]  of this stuff.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.200]  And I mean, God, I am a programmer and an iOS power user.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:53.840]  And I still can't smoothly use iPad multitasking.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:59.180]  Yeah, it's mean to it's unbearable to me like I it's it the whole thing feels slow and unpredictable
[02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:02.540]  and and awkward and unintuitive.
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:05.580]  And I still don't think Apple has solved that.
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:10.040]  And I think the if anything, the the system introduced whenever this current was introduced
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.400]  maybe two years ago, I think it made it less intuitive than before, because now you have
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:18.480]  this weird like, like our friends, he should be Craig called it like the buddy system of
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:22.680]  apps, or like once you like pair up two apps in split screen mode, if you like switch away,
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.760]  and you try to switch back to one of those apps, it'll bring up both of them as the pair.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  Right.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:30.240]  And like, and I think that's, that's one of those things that, you know, they should have
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:32.420]  tested it, and maybe it shouldn't have been released.
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.680]  And instead, that's how it's been for the last two years.
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:35.680]  Right.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.240]  And I think the whole multi system, like it's full of things like that, where it works in
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:45.720]  a way that maybe this maybe it seems a good idea, like in in development or in demos,
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:51.280]  but once actually once actual people try to do it, it's so often doing not what you wanted
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.960]  it to do, or what you want to do is like, all right, I have this app on screen, I'm
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.840]  trying to make it bigger or smaller, get rid of it.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:57.880]  How do I do that?
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:00.660]  And the thing you try to do to do that doesn't do it.
[02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:04.240]  And you kind of can't figure out like, how, how do I do this?
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.560]  And it's just, it's a very confusing and error prone process for me whenever I try to do
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.560]  it.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.960]  And I'm a programmer.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.080]  I have nothing to add to that other than chef's kiss.
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.680]  That was that's a perfect synopsis.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.000]  Marco, thank you for being here.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.260]  I might, you know, have you if I show up at your beach house, you know, we you might be
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:35.000]  on sooner than you usually are from the last appearance because you know, it wasn't on
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.160]  all last year because you didn't come visit because it was coded.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.720]  And the last time we I have it in my Skype window when we open it up tonight.
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.960]  The last time we did an episode on Skype was February 15 2018.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:52.860]  That's that's a very long time that feels like a lifetime ago.
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:54.300]  My thanks to you.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:13:02.320]  Everybody knows where they can find you atp.fm is the accidental tech podcast show overcast,
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:07.620]  of course, is probably how most people are listening to us right now.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:14.540]  And of course, you're at Marco Arment on Twitter, but I tweet less than I did.
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:15.760]  And you probably do too.
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.400]  Yeah, Twitter is not a fun place anymore.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:24.160]  You know what I really feel like tweeting less has been like, it's it's a great it's
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:27.160]  it's really like, it's like a life improvement.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:32.240]  It's like a life hack just it really is like, I mentioned this in ATP a few weeks back,
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.160]  like the new version of tweetbot is subscription based.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.760]  And if you they have a free trial mode of the app, where if you if you get tweetbot
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.520]  and you don't buy the subscription, which I'm not suggesting that you don't do, because
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.020]  it's a great app and you should pay for it.
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:50.820]  But if you don't buy the subscription on the iPhone, it is a read only Twitter client.
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:56.360]  And I consider this actually kind of a feature, like a hidden feature that the unintended
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  feature, right?
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.360]  Yeah.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:59.360]  Like I was on the beta for a while.
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.680]  And then when I got off the beta, I didn't have the purchase, right.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:04.400]  And I just never restored the purchase.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.000]  Because now I have a read only Twitter client on my phone, I think I can still post Twitter
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  on my desktop.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  And I do.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  And it's, you know, sometimes I regret it.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  Sometimes I don't.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.920]  But because I still need to post like, you know, when I have a new show out and stuff
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.920]  like that, like we'll post on the accounts, you know, when we're going live and stuff
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:18.920]  like that.
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.860]  And this is where I where I want to post Twitter, or if I have some kind of code level question
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.840]  or comment, I will often post that on Twitter.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.260]  And, you know, fortunately, I have a large enough audience that I will often get a good
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:30.480]  answer from people if I have a question about something.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:33.720]  But for the most part, like I have no good reason to be tweeting from my phone.
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:35.760]  And so I just can't anymore now.
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:37.760]  And it's glorious, like, because it really does.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:41.000]  It's like, there'll be a tweet and I'll be like, Oh, I want to respond to that.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.320]  Or I want to retweet that.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:43.320]  Oh, and I hit it.
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:44.840]  Oh, I can't do it from the phone.
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:45.840]  I'll just keep going.
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.280]  And I'll just go past it.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:50.440]  And that just and that that reply or retweet just never happens.
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.840]  And I'm actually better off as a result.
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:55.440]  Well, thank you for being here.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  Good, good job.
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:57.440]  Goodbye.
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:18.160]  Thank you, my pleasure.
