[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  Do you have that too? Don't you have that? Am I making this up that you've got your second
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.720]  toe sticks out further than your big toe?
[00:06.720 --> 00:09.880]  No, I always called that a freak toe when I was little.
[00:09.880 --> 00:14.360]  Supposedly it means you're going to be financially well off when you get older.
[00:14.360 --> 00:20.440]  I actually looked it up years ago and I think that's like genetically the more common one.
[00:20.440 --> 00:24.460]  So having it not be that way is actually the freakish way but it still looks weird to me.
[00:24.460 --> 00:26.360]  Like you don't ever draw a foot that way.
[00:26.360 --> 00:32.040]  No, you would never draw a foot that way but I remember that like the tips of my second
[00:32.040 --> 00:39.120]  and third toes would be just blistered to hell and so I would get up earlier or I would skip
[00:39.120 --> 00:42.720]  breakfast and go to the trainer. It's sort of like being a pro athlete. There's like
[00:42.720 --> 00:47.980]  a nice professional. It was at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania and you go to the trainer
[00:47.980 --> 00:54.540]  and there was a real college athletic trainer and he would like take razor blades to your
[00:54.540 --> 01:01.000]  blisters and do them right.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Is that the treatment?
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.880]  Well, I wouldn't recommend doing it yourself. It seems like it was like a fine line between
[01:08.880 --> 01:12.920]  cutting off too much of the skin and too little but it hurt like hell in the morning and it
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.160]  would just feel like I can't. It was terrible. It's like you couldn't even walk but then
[01:17.160 --> 01:24.160]  after a while, it just sort of you just get numb to the pain and then you just play.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.720]  All right.
[01:25.720 --> 01:28.760]  Never much for summer camp. We used to have a playground like a local playground would
[01:28.760 --> 01:36.480]  run pay high school kids to supervise from like 9 to noon in the morning and it would
[01:36.480 --> 01:41.680]  be like supervised kickball games and box hockey and arts and crafts and stuff.
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.400]  Who's paying the insurance on that?
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.960]  I think it was like this would be like the very late 70s and early 80s. I think it was
[01:50.960 --> 01:58.400]  a holdout from a smaller, simpler America where the municipal, the cities, the little
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.160]  town where I grew up, the municipal government paid for it somehow. It was in the school
[02:03.160 --> 02:08.280]  like they'd open up a little hallway in the school which is next to the playground and
[02:08.280 --> 02:12.240]  there was a ping pong table in there. You could play ping pong when it rained.
[02:12.240 --> 02:14.360]  And that's where the bathroom must have been because you need at least one.
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.480]  Right and there was a bathroom and a locker, a little locker where they'd keep the kick
[02:19.480 --> 02:21.480]  balls and the bases and stuff like that.
[02:21.480 --> 02:22.480]  Right, right.
[02:22.480 --> 02:25.960]  And then they'd open it up at night too. It was like 6 to 8 at night or something like
[02:25.960 --> 02:30.200]  that. They'd be closed from like noon to 6 and everybody would go to the community pool
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.520]  or whatever. But from like 9 to noon and 6 to 8, they'd be open up.
[02:35.520 --> 02:37.280]  Got to keep you off the street somehow I guess.
[02:37.280 --> 02:38.280]  Yeah, I guess.
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.760]  I don't know. I grew up in like a housing development so we had, I don't know, a couple
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.920]  dozen kids all around the same age. So that was, we sort of had our own makeshift camp
[02:47.920 --> 02:48.920]  I think.
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.400]  Yeah, I didn't know anybody who went to camp camp though.
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.280]  Like I said, if your parents love you, they keep you around I think.
[02:58.280 --> 03:02.400]  I think Jonas has mixed feelings about it. It seems like a nice camp and you know, they've
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.440]  got, he loves to swim, they've got a pool, they play games and stuff. But I feel like,
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.440]  you know, his view is that the inside of our house is sort of like a camp.
[03:11.440 --> 03:13.400]  It's got way better video games.
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.080]  Yeah, we've got video games and air conditioning and...
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.480]  You don't have to take a bus to get there.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.080]  Right, a refrigerator full of cold beverages and that's about it.
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.280]  Alright, well we've got to get this show on the road because there's some exciting soccer
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.040]  matches coming up that I really, really want to see, so...
[03:31.040 --> 03:32.040]  Is this true?
[03:32.040 --> 03:34.280]  No, of course it's not. Soccer's the worst.
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.280]  You're not following the World Cup?
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.360]  I am following it and I'm hating every minute of it because I'm a masochist. I'm following
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.360]  it.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.640]  Did you ever play soccer?
[03:41.640 --> 03:46.680]  No, I like, you know, gym soccer and I was half decent, but no, I never even, I never
[03:46.680 --> 03:48.360]  went out for any of the teams or anything.
[03:48.360 --> 03:51.960]  No, I didn't either. It just seemed interminable to me.
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.920]  Well, and I think playing it is way better than watching it.
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.940]  Yeah, I don't even know about that. I don't know. It just felt so clumsy to me. Like,
[03:59.940 --> 04:06.000]  it just seemed to me like, it seems to me like basketball and soccer are peer sports.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.120]  You know, two teams, they're going for goals. There's severe limits on how you can touch
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.020]  and advance the ball. And it seems like, to me, always seemed to me like basketball was
[04:15.020 --> 04:19.560]  the one where, what is it that separates us from the other animals? It's our hands, right?
[04:19.560 --> 04:22.240]  And we're purposely not using them in this one sport.
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.240]  Right.
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.080]  Well, I mean, the obvious corollary is really hockey, though. But hockey manages to be way
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.080]  more exciting than soccer to me.
[04:30.080 --> 04:33.120]  Yeah. And again, you get to use your hands.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.120]  A little bit.
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.480]  Or at least a stick that's, you know, in your hands.
[04:37.480 --> 04:43.560]  I think, I think Greece is playing today. But I, God, I hate every minute of this. I'm
[04:43.560 --> 04:45.400]  glad it's only once every four years.
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.240]  Do you root for the Greeks, just out of heritage, family heritage?
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.880]  Eh, you know, for my dad, maybe. I honestly, I never cared.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.880]  Yeah.
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.280]  I, you know, I was born in America. I'm an American. But I'm only, well, I guess I'm
[05:00.280 --> 05:03.720]  50% Greek. So that's pretty Greek. But I don't really get it.
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.400]  Trust me, you're pretty, you're pretty Greek.
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.240]  You've seen my forearms.
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.920]  You were going there. I went there first. Fuck you.
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.240]  What's his name? Montero is rooting for the Portuguese.
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.800]  Yeah. And he is just...
[05:16.800 --> 05:19.760]  I don't know if he's even serious or if he's just trying to...
[05:19.760 --> 05:24.540]  It really seemed like trolling. And I hope it was. Because it was either trolling or
[05:24.540 --> 05:28.920]  he is like the worst sports fan I've ever seen. Worse than you, even.
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.360]  Right. Because it's, how could you not be rooting for the Americans?
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.160]  Well, I mean, if he wants to root for the Portuguese, that's alright. But if you followed
[05:36.160 --> 05:42.560]  his Twitter stream during the Portugal-US match, it was just, I mean, it was just, you'd
[05:42.560 --> 05:44.560]  want to throw something through the wall.
[05:44.560 --> 05:50.440]  Yeah. Yeah, I kind of got the feeling that he was just trolling when he started complaining
[05:50.440 --> 05:55.400]  about the refs. Who I don't think were in the US's favor at all. I think it was a well-refereed
[05:55.400 --> 05:56.400]  match.
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.120]  Well, and like on Dempsey's goal, he kept calling for an offside. And then meanwhile,
[06:00.120 --> 06:02.400]  the announcers are not, like it wasn't even close.
[06:02.400 --> 06:03.400]  Right.
[06:03.400 --> 06:06.880]  Like it wasn't as if there was any question of an offside.
[06:06.880 --> 06:10.440]  The only questionable thing in the officiating there was the extra, the one extra minute
[06:10.440 --> 06:11.440]  of extra time.
[06:11.440 --> 06:13.560]  It went from four to five minutes, right?
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.560]  Right.
[06:14.560 --> 06:15.560]  And that's when they scored in that.
[06:15.560 --> 06:19.000]  And that's when they scored was in the fifth minute. And supposedly they're saying that
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.640]  the, what I read after the match is that whoever the mysterious referee is who gets to decide
[06:25.640 --> 06:30.860]  how many minutes of extra time there is added another fifth minute.
[06:30.860 --> 06:33.560]  So he added four and then he added one?
[06:33.560 --> 06:38.960]  On the last US substitution where the US, the guy being substituted was like crawling
[06:38.960 --> 06:45.600]  off the field. Which is possibly justified. Although from what the announcer said is a
[06:45.600 --> 06:46.960]  time-honored tradition.
[06:46.960 --> 06:53.200]  Oh, well, it's horrible. I mean, this is what happened against Ghana the past two World
[06:53.200 --> 06:59.280]  Cups for the US. That, you know, they got a lead and then they were just, everybody
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.720]  was suddenly struck down by injury.
[07:02.720 --> 07:06.080]  Balls are being kicked out of the stadium. We don't have any more balls. Somebody get
[07:06.080 --> 07:07.080]  a pump.
[07:07.080 --> 07:12.920]  Well, I mean, what I don't, I have so many complaints about soccer, but the one that
[07:12.920 --> 07:18.400]  really gets me is that we can use the stop button on a stopwatch. It is literally called
[07:18.400 --> 07:24.920]  a stopwatch because you can start the time and then you can stop it instead of just letting
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.360]  it run for 45 minutes and then saying, yeah, there was about two minutes of extra time
[07:29.360 --> 07:30.360]  we need to add.
[07:30.360 --> 07:36.440]  Yeah. It seems, it seems like some kind of bizarre antiquated, you know, thing holdover
[07:36.440 --> 07:37.600]  from a hundred years ago.
[07:37.600 --> 07:43.520]  Right. But then meanwhile they've got like, like, like the television crew at least has
[07:43.520 --> 07:49.360]  like the offsides camera that is like showing exactly where the player was with like computer
[07:49.360 --> 07:54.400]  renderings and stuff. So, I mean, it's not as if the game has, is the same that it is
[07:54.400 --> 07:59.700]  played in, you know, a desert or a back alley or something. Like the game, the World Cup
[07:59.700 --> 08:03.680]  games are professional level. We can use a stopwatch properly.
[08:03.680 --> 08:07.960]  Yeah. I don't, I don't get that. I don't get why they don't run in a simple, just stop.
[08:07.960 --> 08:12.740]  If the ref decides, Hey, this is a real injury. I'm blowing my whistle. Then there's a timekeeper
[08:12.740 --> 08:16.720]  who hits a red button. And then when he blows his whistle again, they hit the red button
[08:16.720 --> 08:22.840]  again. And then it's 90 minutes and it's 90 minutes. And at nine zero zero zero a buzzer
[08:22.840 --> 08:26.960]  goes off and the game is over.
[08:26.960 --> 08:32.120]  Cause there's also the weird thing at the end, you know, and, and you know, it was almost,
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.960]  almost got to that point in the U S Portugal match where there is no automatic buzzer that
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.720]  goes off. There's a ref who decides to blow the whistle. And if the team is down by one
[08:42.720 --> 08:47.960]  goal and streaming down the sideline, they don't blow it play. Right. That bothers me
[08:47.960 --> 08:52.820]  as an American. Just, just logically, like as a nerd, it's annoying like this, this nebulous
[08:52.820 --> 08:59.580]  nature of, of the clock and yeah. Whereas I love, I do love and, and our mutual friend
[08:59.580 --> 09:06.460]  and he's been slowly getting me more into the game over the years. Guy English is big,
[09:06.460 --> 09:13.360]  you know, grew up in, I don't know, some kind of soccer playing country has been preaching
[09:13.360 --> 09:16.520]  to me that it's a beautiful, you know, that it's the beautiful game and that there's aspects
[09:16.520 --> 09:20.840]  and there's parts of it that I am getting more into, but I do love, I love the fact
[09:20.840 --> 09:27.400]  that it's a running clock that it's, you know, they start a half and for the next 45 minutes,
[09:27.400 --> 09:30.720]  you're just watching these guys play. Well, I mean, that's, that's the great aspect of
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.680]  it that there's no commercials like cutting into, into the game, just a halftime full
[09:35.680 --> 09:40.840]  of commercials. And then they've, you know, and it's funny, it's like the nature of the,
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.640]  it's just like the web and anything else. If you want to sell ads, the nature of the
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.600]  opportunity, the, the advertisers will find a way. Oh, I mean, so they have those sponsorships
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.440]  along the sidelines, which are like way worse than the boards in hockey or way more noticeable.
[09:54.440 --> 09:59.040]  And yeah, but it's way better than commercial breaks. Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh, well,
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.100]  but I think, I don't know how much, I think that's part of the issue with soccer in America
[10:03.100 --> 10:07.840]  is that I think there's not nearly as much money in it, even with all those ads, uh,
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.800]  because it just doesn't ever total up to as much as you would make from selling a few
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.120]  commercial ads like video ads. Yeah, but somehow the premier league in Europe makes tons of
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.040]  money and that they can afford to pay guys, you know, it's, it's commensurate with US,
[10:20.040 --> 10:24.320]  you know, professional sports in terms of the top player salaries and the value of the
[10:24.320 --> 10:27.140]  franchise. Yeah, I think so. Well, I mean, they all come up, like Beckham came here to
[10:27.140 --> 10:31.440]  make his money. I'm sure he made, I'm sure he made some in England, but. Yeah, but he's
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.580]  sort of like, you know, he's like an a rod type where it's, uh, and I don't mean that
[10:36.580 --> 10:42.240]  to be disparaging to him, but, but where his celebrity far extended beyond sports, you
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.320]  know, that he had opportunities that were beyond just his soccer playing ability. Uh,
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.600]  well, I don't know. We, I didn't do any research. Yeah, we should, we should really talk more
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.280]  about soccer on your tech podcast with both of us that don't really like soccer. The fans
[10:56.280 --> 10:59.320]  are going to love that. Well, but the thing that to me is interesting though, in terms
[10:59.320 --> 11:04.120]  of like the advertising finding a way is that in the premier league, the teams are sponsored
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.160]  right. And their jerseys are like that. They have ads on their jerseys, don't they? Right.
[11:09.160 --> 11:12.560]  I forget which team is, which, but I know that I watched them. I don't know how I got
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.840]  tricked into watching a premier league match a couple months ago and the one had, uh, the
[11:16.840 --> 11:21.800]  Emirates airline and airlines are big because they're international and that they, you know,
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.360]  the international appeal of it is, you know, makes it a perfect opportunity. Right. And
[11:25.360 --> 11:29.560]  they just have a, instead of having the team name on the Jersey, it's a big airline logo
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.840]  on the Jersey, which would, you know, to an American is crazy. Like, can you, I mean,
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.520]  if the Red Sox or the Yankees had a, had a big logo, uh, somebody, some other company's
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.740]  logo would be disgusting. Yankees. The Yankees don't even put their player names on the Jersey.
[11:42.740 --> 11:48.160]  That's right. Derek Jeter's Jersey just says two. Even that's all the away Jersey. Right.
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.880]  Right. It just says two. It's his number. That's all it says. I can't even imagine if
[11:52.880 --> 11:59.520]  it had like a big Pepsi logo, but that's the opportunity. And the nature of the game is
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.920]  such as that there aren't any breaks. Right. Right. And so I do like that. I like that
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.120]  you can kind of just say, okay, I want to watch the U S play somebody and you've, you
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.960]  know, you only have to give up like, you know, two, it's exactly two hours. Yeah, exactly.
[12:14.960 --> 12:21.200]  Right. And, uh, and it just flows. I like that. Anyway, let's make a prediction. You
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.640]  think the U S is going to make it into the elimination? Well, I'll tell you what, the
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.840]  only reason I'm watching it all is cause I have a, a pool going with some friends, uh,
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.800]  whose prize is a Landon Donovan world cup Jersey. Uh, wait, is that for the loser or
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.500]  the winner for the winner? Uh, they must've printed these jerseys up before, uh, he was
[12:40.500 --> 12:44.860]  not selected for the team. So we found this on eBay and that's, that's going to be the
[12:44.860 --> 12:51.360]  prize for the winner. But, uh, uh, so I have them losing. Uh, I have, I had Germany and
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.320]  Portugal advancing, so, uh, I don't know. I mean, they played well against Portugal.
[12:55.320 --> 12:59.000]  They could have won that game. So should have won that game. I've got Brazil winning the
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.300]  whole thing though. I go hometown, I go, you know, one of the best soccer teams. So yeah.
[13:03.300 --> 13:06.640]  And eventually the rest are going to fix it for him. There'll be some kind of match and
[13:06.640 --> 13:11.200]  that, you know, there'll be a terrible handball. Have you noticed the, uh, I don't know how
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.360]  much of the commercials you've seen, cause there are some during the half, but there's
[13:14.360 --> 13:21.040]  a FIFA ad that is a soccer ball, like rolling on a field and the field tilts. Have you seen
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.120]  this? The short, the gist of it is, is that it's a FIFA, it's a FIFA ad and it says together
[13:27.120 --> 13:34.240]  we fight match manipulation. And it's absurd that you need an ad to tell the fans like
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.820]  we're fighting against corruption in soccer. Right. Well, did you see that New York Times
[13:38.820 --> 13:45.080]  story a couple of weeks ago about South Africa, right? Yeah. And you know, the one, the one
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.920]  FIFA ref, you know, just took like a cash deposit of $120,000 rolled into the bank with
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.240]  it and then like six hours later was reffing a match. Right. Making suspicious calls. Yeah.
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.440]  No, no, no attempt to hide it even. I mean the whole, yeah, the whole thing is crooked.
[14:03.440 --> 14:10.080]  Yeah. And well, and that it's, it stems from the fact that they pick the referees via international
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.600]  diplomacy where it's, Hey, we need a guy from this part of the world. This guy, the part
[14:15.600 --> 14:23.720]  of the world, this part of the world, as opposed to ranking them. Right. Which is how us sports
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.240]  typically are done. Like in the NFL for the playoff games there, there's like a systematic
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.240]  analysis of which referees were the most accurate in a regular season and those refs get to
[14:34.240 --> 14:39.140]  ref playoff games. And it's, I think it's the same in baseball. I think that there's
[14:39.140 --> 14:43.280]  like the veteran teams at least. I don't know if it's, but if you're a veteran team, it's
[14:43.280 --> 14:47.120]  because you've, you've done well over the years. Right. And one thing you could definitely
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.080]  say for major league baseball is for all the problems that they've had over the decades.
[14:52.080 --> 14:57.800]  One thing is that there's never really been any kind of even hint or, or whiff of implication
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.000]  of anything other. Yeah. There's umpires you can complain about, but it's never in terms
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.400]  of bias or fixing matches or no, you just think they're inconsistent with their strike
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.440]  zone or right. Just allows the umpire, but never a cricket umpire. They had, they truly
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.800]  have an impeccable, you know, a hundred, you know, century long reputation for, uh, uh,
[15:19.800 --> 15:25.880]  uncorrupt ability. Yeah. Yeah. Being impartial. Yeah. And you take that for granted when you
[15:25.880 --> 15:36.800]  hear what has to put an ad on that says we're trying to keep this fair. Oh man. Soccer.
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.000]  Let's move on. I, I, I said ahead of time that I wasn't going to get into it and I'm
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.200]  not into it, but I'm still watching it and I, I don't want to talk about it. All right.
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.400]  Well, all right. One last thing. Thank, thank God they got rid of those goddamn noise makers.
[15:49.400 --> 15:55.400]  Oh, the VU was A-list. Yeah. I don't want to, you can cut this, but, uh, those were great
[15:55.400 --> 16:00.740]  for our company because, uh, there was a plugin called vuvu X and it was an audio plugin that
[16:00.740 --> 16:05.300]  let you cut out the sound of vuvuzelas and audio hijack pro worked with this plugin.
[16:05.300 --> 16:10.200]  So people were using audio hijack pro in this plugin to, uh, to remove the, the, the buzzing
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.440]  noise from the background. No, I, there's no reason to cut it. I don't mind. Uh, well,
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.600]  when you were watching the matches, it was, if you could get rid of it, it was a vuvuzela
[16:19.600 --> 16:28.160]  plugin. Yeah. That's fantastic. Good. You know, it was so annoying that it doesn't surprise
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.280]  me in the least that somebody took the time to get rid of it. Yeah. Well, but I mean,
[16:32.280 --> 16:35.240]  that was like an African thing, so I guess, you know, they don't have that in Brazil.
[16:35.240 --> 16:38.080]  I don't know what they have there, but nothing quite so. Well, they've apparently banned
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.040]  it though. Did they really? Yeah. That you, you know, that they were telling you as you
[16:42.040 --> 17:10.680]  come into the stadium that if you're caught with one, you're going to get kicked out.
[17:10.680 --> 17:13.840]  Well, I like what you've done with the place. The, uh, the studio here, it's slimmed down.
[17:13.840 --> 17:20.000]  It's sparse. I, you've changed it up a little bit. The set looks different. I was looking
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.980]  at the, uh, the talk show page now versus, uh, I think I was on sometime last year and
[17:25.980 --> 17:31.340]  you got rid of the wood paneling. Yeah. You got rid of the, uh, uh, skeuomorphism, if
[17:31.340 --> 17:35.720]  you will. You toned it down to a flat gray. Thank you, Paul. Very nice. Did you see this
[17:35.720 --> 17:40.800]  where FAA, I just sent you this link. There's late breaking news before we started recording
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.960]  that the FAA is, uh, put the Nix on Amazon's drone delivery plans. Well, which didn't,
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.200]  I mean, the drones didn't exist anyway, or, you know, it's not as if this was like they're
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.200]  in the air right now and they're calling them back because of this ban. Right. Uh, I, you
[17:56.200 --> 18:02.160]  know, I read that article. It, uh, it indicated that this was something that the FAA had already
[18:02.160 --> 18:09.760]  attempted to ban. Right. I guess so. I, it, it occurred to me when Amazon announced this,
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.400]  was it months ago? Was it last year? I don't know when it was. Yeah. It, it occurred to
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.840]  me that it just seems like, well, this it's a cool idea and I could see how in the future
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.180]  this, you know, this, this could be a thing, but it's got to be, there's, there's gotta
[18:25.180 --> 18:29.740]  be some regulatory structure here. We, you can't just have anybody who wants to willy
[18:29.740 --> 18:38.120]  nilly flying through the air. Right. Uh, especially propeller driven things. Yeah. Right. Right.
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.200]  Uh, well, I mean, even when they announced it, they said this was, I mean, they announced
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.360]  it and it made a big, you know, it got a big PR, uh, cry and, and that was what they wanted,
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.440]  but it wasn't as if they announced it like coming in six months. They said, this is coming
[18:51.440 --> 18:58.720]  in several years, uh, once we deal with the FAA. And, uh, so this, this story now doesn't
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.560]  really, I don't think it really changes anything for Amazon. It just sort of clarifies that,
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.180]  no, you cannot just start doing right. Right. It's not, it's not happening next week. Uh,
[19:09.180 --> 19:13.360]  you're not, you're not getting drone deliveries within the next few months at least. It just
[19:13.360 --> 19:19.060]  fits to me though, with like, um, and to a lesser degree, it's Amazon, but you know,
[19:19.060 --> 19:24.560]  it's Google's mo to me is to just announce crazy shit. That's not even close to being
[19:24.560 --> 19:31.600]  real and get people all excited about it. And to me it just distracts from the best
[19:31.600 --> 19:37.280]  of what's really real. Right. And being announced today. Well, for Amazon, I think it's probably
[19:37.280 --> 19:41.440]  actually pretty effective because it says, oh, they're really focused on delivery. And
[19:41.440 --> 19:45.400]  even if they can't do this yet, I should still buy stuff from them because it was only, it
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.220]  was an ancillary thing. It wasn't as if, I mean, probably some people would have ordered
[19:49.220 --> 19:53.280]  stuff just to get a drone to deliver it to them. I probably would have, but yeah, I would
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.880]  do that, but I mean, it wasn't as if they said, you know, this is the service they said,
[19:56.880 --> 20:02.500]  you know, we're working to make shipping on what you buy as fast as possible. So it's
[20:02.500 --> 20:05.980]  not as if they were actually selling the drone delivery. Whereas I think you're right in
[20:05.980 --> 20:10.320]  terms of Google, there's a lot of stuff that they pre-announced or announced when it's,
[20:10.320 --> 20:14.860]  you know, sort of half baked and it's something that you might actually want to buy directly,
[20:14.860 --> 20:20.500]  but either it's not available. Like, uh, Google glass has been, uh, this year they've had
[20:20.500 --> 20:25.880]  a couple, like anyone can buy it days. Right. But for the most part, it's still 1500 bucks,
[20:25.880 --> 20:29.940]  which is much more than they plan to charge for it. And for the most part, it's just been
[20:29.940 --> 20:35.120]  available to select developers. So it's something that's in the public consciousness, but not
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.640]  actually available to the public. So, you know, and we're recording this a day, I think
[20:39.640 --> 20:45.180]  one day before the Google IO keynote, it could be, you know, by the day or two from now,
[20:45.180 --> 20:48.460]  there's a big new Google glass announcement where either a, they've radically dropped
[20:48.460 --> 20:54.540]  the price or B they've got a new generational hardware that's, that's less obtrusive and,
[20:54.540 --> 20:57.780]  and significantly improved. Who knows? But I don't, I don't really expect well, but even
[20:57.780 --> 21:02.020]  even if they, even if that's true and it may well be, but, uh, you know, it's been what,
[21:02.020 --> 21:07.340]  uh, a year, at least a year plus since it first has landed in people's ears. Yeah. Two
[21:07.340 --> 21:11.900]  years. Right. Uh, and you know, it just, it doesn't really exist as a product. It's not
[21:11.900 --> 21:16.760]  a product you can go into the store and buy. And that's strange to me. And I think your
[21:16.760 --> 21:20.980]  comparison is generally going to be to Apple where you don't hear anything about it until
[21:20.980 --> 21:26.340]  it's either in the stores or it's going to be in the stores very soon. And in a form
[21:26.340 --> 21:30.540]  that is exactly as promised, right? Like, you know, they did pre announced the, I was
[21:30.540 --> 21:34.460]  just gonna say the iPhone five months or the exception, but even that nothing that they
[21:34.460 --> 21:39.160]  preannounced, I mean, was there anything that was missing in the final product? No. In fact,
[21:39.160 --> 21:45.760]  it was better because they switched from plastic to gorilla glass, uh, like a month beforehand,
[21:45.760 --> 21:50.700]  which to me is one of those like secret, like little overlooked historical things where
[21:50.700 --> 21:54.980]  it's like, can you even imagine being Tim Cook? And it's like, you're trying to get
[21:54.980 --> 21:59.980]  this super high profile thing shipped and from China and like Steve Jobs comes in and
[21:59.980 --> 22:04.940]  was like, Hey, plastics, no good. I've got these guys from Corning on the phone and I
[22:04.940 --> 22:10.600]  think we can switch to glass and it's like may, it's like six weeks before you're supposed
[22:10.600 --> 22:14.500]  to ship the thing. And somehow he made it happen. Was it that, I mean, do you, I don't
[22:14.500 --> 22:19.200]  know. I mean, even if it was six months, even if it was six months, it's ridiculous. Well,
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.400]  it was definitely after January. You know, I think, I think that one of the books might
[22:23.400 --> 22:28.020]  have had that maybe like the jobs biography had this story and maybe it was like April
[22:28.020 --> 22:32.180]  or something like that. But like you said, it doesn't, at any point between January and
[22:32.180 --> 22:37.820]  June, it should be finalized. And right. And it's, it was like the most important part
[22:37.820 --> 22:41.820]  of the phone. It was the thing that was most different and original and new and they switched
[22:41.820 --> 22:48.060]  from plastic, hard plastic to gorilla glass. Right. And, uh, the apps got better in some
[22:48.060 --> 22:51.540]  ways. Right. Okay. I forget. There were a couple of days. It was better than promised
[22:51.540 --> 22:54.700]  though. And then two months after that, when they dropped the price, it even came down
[22:54.700 --> 22:59.500]  in price. Right. Right. So yeah, by, by in, in that first generation it wound up being
[22:59.500 --> 23:03.620]  better than they had originally promised, which is something they never do anyway as
[23:03.620 --> 23:09.240]  far as originally announcing something before it's available. Right. Like, whereas the opposite
[23:09.240 --> 23:13.100]  would have been if they'd promised it was going to be gorilla glass and promised it
[23:13.100 --> 23:17.740]  was going to be three 99 and then they shipped it and it was scratchable plastic and six
[23:17.740 --> 23:25.540]  90. Right. Right. Uh, well, and I'm also reminded of this, that showing these, these concepts
[23:25.540 --> 23:30.060]  and sort of conflating between the concepts and reality with this thing I saw over the
[23:30.060 --> 23:36.300]  weekend and linked up about, uh, the armband Google gesture. Right. It was this video and,
[23:36.300 --> 23:40.340]  and, and mashable linked it up as though it was real. And then a couple of Android sites
[23:40.340 --> 23:48.060]  picked it up after mashable. And what it really was was just a student exercise from, I forget,
[23:48.060 --> 23:52.780]  some advertising school in stock. You're up or something. Right. Yeah. Uh, it's, I think
[23:52.780 --> 23:57.060]  it was Stockholm Berg school of communication and it was a bunch of students who made a
[23:57.060 --> 24:02.460]  video of a fake Google product called Google gesture where you'd put this armband on and
[24:02.460 --> 24:09.580]  it would translate sign language to verbal speech in real time, which is a little fantastic
[24:09.580 --> 24:17.580]  given that, um, it doesn't, you know, Google has great text to speech, you know, and speech
[24:17.580 --> 24:22.780]  to speech to text, but it still isn't quite as real time as what they were showing for
[24:22.780 --> 24:29.420]  this, this armband for a sign language. Uh, all it was though it was, it had nothing to
[24:29.420 --> 24:33.060]  do with Google. They're, they're not engineering students. They're not working with, it's not
[24:33.060 --> 24:39.340]  like a computer science project. They're advertising. Right. It was just an exercise to say like,
[24:39.340 --> 24:43.740]  make a fantastic product and then make an ad for it. Right. But mashable went with it
[24:43.740 --> 24:48.080]  as though it was real and so did other sites. And I feel like, you know, shame on them for
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.180]  not looking at it a little harder. The signs were all there that this was not real, but
[24:53.180 --> 24:58.460]  it's still to me is a little telling though that, that they got fooled because it's, it's,
[24:58.460 --> 25:02.900]  you know, Google tends to announce stuff that's not real yet. Right. Right. What was the last,
[25:02.900 --> 25:06.820]  the last sentence was no, no shipping date for the app has been announced yet in the,
[25:06.820 --> 25:11.780]  in the mashable. Yeah. In the mashable piece. Right. Right. Well, I don't know that. Uh,
[25:11.780 --> 25:16.040]  I mean that happens with, it doesn't happen in the same way with Apple, but, uh, there's
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.120]  all sorts of writing about Apple, about the iWatch that's coming and it's written as if
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.980]  this is a certainty and as if Apple has already announced it and it drives me crazy. Uh, yeah,
[25:26.980 --> 25:30.460]  absolutely. Because, well, and the thing, I brought it up with Mark Gurman a couple
[25:30.460 --> 25:34.060]  of weeks ago when he was on the show. The thing that gets me is the way those articles
[25:34.060 --> 25:39.940]  are always accompanied by visual mock up from some random, you know, designer on flicker
[25:39.940 --> 25:47.020]  or dribble or wherever. Right. And, and there's a tiny little credit to like a name, but it
[25:47.020 --> 25:51.740]  doesn't really say, it never says this is just a crazy mock up that is unrelated to
[25:51.740 --> 25:56.340]  the rumor that I were published. It just goes well with the story, but don't take it as,
[25:56.340 --> 26:03.100]  as fact or even as, as anything. Yeah. In fact, there was one a couple of weeks ago,
[26:03.100 --> 26:06.480]  it doesn't really matter which site it was, but it was one of these sites like nine to
[26:06.480 --> 26:09.380]  five Mac and it wasn't a Mark Gurman story of somebody else, but it might've been nine
[26:09.380 --> 26:15.500]  to five Mac, might've been somebody else, but it was, um, a story about, or maybe it
[26:15.500 --> 26:20.460]  was a German. I don't know. It doesn't matter, but it was about this thing where that iOS
[26:20.460 --> 26:26.860]  eight is rumored to be like in the fall when new iPads come out, that there's going to
[26:26.860 --> 26:33.380]  be, um, split screen mode between multiple apps, two apps. It was this before the developer's
[26:33.380 --> 26:37.900]  conference or after after. Okay. So before the rumor, but then they didn't, they didn't
[26:37.900 --> 26:42.300]  mention at the conference. So we're assuming it's not happening. Right. And, and somebody
[26:42.300 --> 26:49.580]  had, um, poking around the iOS eight beta had found some stuff that's in there that
[26:49.580 --> 26:53.420]  suggests, yeah, there is, there's these, you know, we can actually come back to this later
[26:53.420 --> 26:59.540]  in the show, but these, you know, different screen modes like, uh, two thirds, one third,
[26:59.540 --> 27:08.660]  one half, one half. Um, and so this article was describing what's actually in the iOS
[27:08.660 --> 27:14.340]  beta hidden, which isn't much, we still don't really know like the actual interactive, like
[27:14.340 --> 27:18.180]  what is the act, how are you going to invoke it and drag it along and stuff like that.
[27:18.180 --> 27:22.380]  And in the meantime, they had an illustration showing something completely different from
[27:22.380 --> 27:27.940]  like somebody from months ago, just speculate when the rumor first came out or right. It,
[27:27.940 --> 27:34.740]  it didn't even match what was being described, right. But yet was done in a very highly detailed
[27:34.740 --> 27:39.580]  visual style that conveys a sense of authority and, and of, of reality as if this is real
[27:39.580 --> 27:44.300]  and right. Like it would be different. It would be stupid. They wouldn't do it. But
[27:44.300 --> 27:49.260]  like if somebody who's, you know, not really an artist like me took like a field notes
[27:49.260 --> 27:55.940]  notebook and just did like a simple sketch on artistic, just a pen on paper and said,
[27:55.940 --> 28:00.300]  it's sort of like a couple of rectangles in an arrow. That would be one thing. But it's
[28:00.300 --> 28:06.940]  these completely fleshed out ideas. Yeah. Like a hundred percent articulated in Photoshop
[28:06.940 --> 28:10.860]  idea, you know, and it drives me nuts, you know, every, and you could just, you can find
[28:10.860 --> 28:16.980]  hundreds of these stories about like the iWatch that are accompanied by these illustrations.
[28:16.980 --> 28:21.540]  Makes me crazy. Let me tell you about, take a break, talk about our first sponsor. Happy
[28:21.540 --> 28:26.980]  to say, I always love to say this. I think pretty sure a new sponsor, never before sponsored
[28:26.980 --> 28:36.660]  the talk show. It's a company called Squarespace. Squarespace, I'm Squarespace. I've not heard
[28:36.660 --> 28:41.580]  of them. Go ahead. All right. This is a fantastic company. You're going to love this. You got
[28:41.580 --> 28:47.580]  to hear this. Here's the thing. Squarespace is an all in one website building and hosting
[28:47.580 --> 28:55.620]  service. So you need a website. Easy. Go to squarespace.com. You sign up and they have
[28:55.620 --> 29:01.940]  an all in one platform. Makes it fast and easy to create a very, very professional website.
[29:01.940 --> 29:05.940]  And it could be any sort of website. They have all sorts of templates for pre-existing
[29:05.940 --> 29:11.040]  ideas like a portfolio site. If you're an artist who wants to show off your work, an
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.400]  online store, if you have stuff to sell and they take care of all the really hard stuff
[29:15.400 --> 29:22.380]  of online commerce for you, all just baked into your account. It's simple and easy, beautiful
[29:22.380 --> 29:28.820]  design, drag and drop content to rearrange it just the way you want. If you want, you
[29:28.820 --> 29:32.620]  can drop down and adjust it at the code level. If you want to inject your own JavaScript
[29:32.620 --> 29:36.580]  or adjust the CSS or something like that. But if you don't know JavaScript or you don't
[29:36.580 --> 29:43.260]  know CSS, you can do the whole thing through drag and drop in a very visual intuitive way
[29:43.260 --> 29:49.020]  and it all just works. Now, plans start at just eight bucks a month and include a free
[29:49.020 --> 29:56.860]  domain name if you sign up for a year. They have 24-7 tech support and live chat and email
[29:56.860 --> 30:03.900]  tech support located in New York City, Dublin and now Portland. I'm assuming it's Portland,
[30:03.900 --> 30:07.980]  Oregon. It could be Portland, Maine. That's a fine city but I'm going to guess it's...
[30:07.980 --> 30:09.700]  Probably want the different time zone though.
[30:09.700 --> 30:14.460]  Yeah, probably want the different time zone. Responsive design, everything they do looks
[30:14.460 --> 30:22.700]  great from phones to tablets to big 30-inch cinema displays. You can start a trial with
[30:22.700 --> 30:26.140]  no credit card required. You don't have to give them a credit card first and then cancel
[30:26.140 --> 30:30.740]  it if you decide to do it. You can start with no credit card and start building your website
[30:30.740 --> 30:39.740]  today. So here's what you do. Go to squarespace.com slash Gruber and you can use the offer code

[30:52.940 --> 30:55.620]  that way they'll know you're coming from the talk show. Squarespace.
[30:55.620 --> 31:01.020]  What's interesting is actually if you use offer code PK, my initials, you get 11% off.
[31:01.020 --> 31:04.100]  So it's up to you which one you want to use.
[31:04.100 --> 31:12.660]  Anyway, this sounds like a great idea for a service. I'll bet whatever from them again.
[31:12.660 --> 31:20.360]  Happy to have them as a sponsor. What else? We were talking about Amazon. So last week
[31:20.360 --> 31:24.420]  they announced the Amazon Fire phone.
[31:24.420 --> 31:30.960]  Did you see that? I didn't see the event. I saw one of the summaries of it. Did you
[31:30.960 --> 31:36.300]  actually watch the event? No, I didn't. I watched a little bit and they did seem to
[31:36.300 --> 31:43.360]  do a nice job, but I forget. I was busy at the time and then I just read all the highlights
[31:43.360 --> 31:47.560]  and it just didn't seem like there was two hours of stuff. Well, right, because it was
[31:47.560 --> 31:52.880]  just the phone, right? Did they cover anything else? Pretty much. I think they had some boiler
[31:52.880 --> 31:59.440]  plate up front just talking about how successful Prime is.
[31:59.440 --> 32:05.380]  Right and they're graphs with no labeled axes. So it's twice as good as it was last year,
[32:05.380 --> 32:07.140]  but who knows what it was last year.
[32:07.140 --> 32:14.380]  Well, I'm only half joking. I took a screenshot of one of the graphs. It showed total number
[32:14.380 --> 32:20.640]  of Prime members over the years and it's a steeply sloping upwards chart.
[32:20.640 --> 32:23.520]  There's no label on the y-axis.
[32:23.520 --> 32:28.240]  No label. And I'm only half joking. I asked if Amazon had ever published a graph with
[32:28.240 --> 32:35.160]  a labeled y-axis. The x-axis is labeled in years and the y-axis is completely unlabeled.
[32:35.160 --> 32:40.740]  I don't think that they have. And I know that they've never once announced sales figures
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.560]  for any hardware device that they make.
[32:42.560 --> 32:51.920]  For the Kindles and the tablets and the TV one they've got now. They're all fire something
[32:51.920 --> 32:52.920]  now, aren't they?
[32:52.920 --> 33:03.680]  Yeah, I think so. Fire TV. Kindle means reader and fire means everything else.
[33:03.680 --> 33:09.000]  Like fancier. Except the Kindle Fire is a reader as well.
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  The phone?
[33:10.000 --> 33:12.540]  No, no. The Kindle Fire tablet.
[33:12.540 --> 33:17.040]  Well, they call it the... Yeah, but it combines Kindle and Fire. It's Kindle Fire.
[33:17.040 --> 33:19.480]  Right. Yeah, I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying.
[33:19.480 --> 33:25.880]  It's Amazon Kindle Fire is a tablet that's a reader and a fire. I guess fire means Android?
[33:25.880 --> 33:26.880]  I don't know.
[33:26.880 --> 33:27.880]  Yeah, I think you're right. I think that...
[33:27.880 --> 33:30.000]  Fire means their offshoot of Android.
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  Yeah, it's the equivalent of iOS.
[33:31.000 --> 33:35.920]  So it's both an e-reader and a thing. Then the Fire phone is just their Android offshoot
[33:35.920 --> 33:42.520]  for the phone and then Fire TV is their Android offshoot for watching video and playing games.
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.520]  Or whatever on your TV.
[33:43.520 --> 33:44.520]  Right.
[33:44.520 --> 33:46.000]  I guess I don't know if they have games. I don't think they do.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.640]  No, they do. They do. Because that was one of the first ones that shipped with its...
[33:49.640 --> 33:54.440]  You could buy it with a separate controller. And that was where people said the Apple TV
[33:54.440 --> 33:59.640]  should sell with a... You could buy a $20 controller and then play games on it. And
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.280]  the Amazon Fire TV had... I think the default model didn't have a controller, but you could
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.480]  buy an additional controller with it. I don't know if that ever took off. It's only been
[34:09.480 --> 34:10.480]  a few months.
[34:10.480 --> 34:12.600]  I don't... I never hear anybody write about it.
[34:12.600 --> 34:16.340]  Maybe it's not that popular. Maybe it is and they're just not writing about it, but...
[34:16.340 --> 34:21.320]  You know, that's one of those things too that it's... I know people who follow Apple tend
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.680]  to be accused of, I don't know, favoritism or like in the sport, to go back to the sports
[34:26.680 --> 34:29.200]  analogy that we're always complaining about the refs.
[34:29.200 --> 34:30.200]  Right.
[34:30.200 --> 34:35.680]  Right. Right. We always perceive that the refs are out to get us. But I can't help but
[34:35.680 --> 34:42.320]  think that if Apple had announced at the same time an Apple TV update with a game controller
[34:42.320 --> 34:47.040]  and it had taken off to the extent that Amazon's has taken off, which is to say apparently
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.720]  not much at all, that they'd be getting excoriated in the business press.
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.580]  There'd be stories about how it had flopped.
[34:52.580 --> 34:57.480]  And that Tim Cook would need to be fired and et cetera, et cetera. Go for it.
[34:57.480 --> 34:59.080]  So it's better off not to try anything.
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.640]  Well, I don't know. Somehow Apple and Apple alone seems to not be given permission by
[35:04.640 --> 35:08.560]  the business press and some of the tech press to just try things.
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.560]  Right.
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.360]  Right. And there's snide remarks about Apple TV as a quote unquote hobby, whereas it's
[35:15.360 --> 35:21.320]  clearly more... And I think by that it just means it's not as big a deal financially as
[35:21.320 --> 35:23.760]  the other things that Apple does like the phone and the iPad.
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.020]  Well, I mean, that originated... I think it was Tim Cook who said that, wasn't it? Or
[35:27.020 --> 35:28.020]  was it Jobs?
[35:28.020 --> 35:32.800]  Yeah. Yeah. It came from Apple. Or maybe it started... Well, it came while Jobs was still
[35:32.800 --> 35:33.800]  alive.
[35:33.800 --> 35:37.960]  Well, I don't know if it was his words or Tim Cook's words, but Steve was still the
[35:37.960 --> 35:38.960]  CEO.
[35:38.960 --> 35:42.480]  Right. And yeah. And they said, you know, this is sort of a hobby for us. And then yeah,
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.720]  then it becomes the way that the press writes about it.
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.640]  Right. Well, I actually remember when they did the first Apple TV.
[35:49.640 --> 35:52.160]  The silver one with the actual hard drive in it.
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.200]  Yeah. And they even... It was sort of semi preannounced because they were going to call
[35:57.200 --> 35:58.200]  it ITV.
[35:58.200 --> 36:03.440]  Yeah. It was the same time as the iPhone. It was 2007. Same keynote.
[36:03.440 --> 36:05.840]  Really? At the end of the iPhone announcement?
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.240]  Yep. It was the same keynote. I'm like 99% certain on that.
[36:10.240 --> 36:12.960]  He was like, I don't even know what we're going to call it. We'll just call it ITV for
[36:12.960 --> 36:13.960]  now.
[36:13.960 --> 36:16.920]  Well, no, no, no. They had decided it was the Apple TV, but he kept calling it the ITV
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.320]  because he said, oh, that's why you shouldn't go with a code name that like... I do remember
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.780]  that. It was that internally they had called it the ITV. And then he kept slipping when
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.360]  he was referring to it.
[36:28.360 --> 36:35.080]  Well, I've heard that the reason they couldn't use that was because there's a big TV network
[36:35.080 --> 36:41.400]  in the UK called ITV. And it just wasn't worth it. I guess they could maybe use that name
[36:41.400 --> 36:47.460]  elsewhere around the world, but that the UK is too big, big enough market not to do it.
[36:47.460 --> 36:50.560]  But anyway, it was introduced as a hobby. It was like, we don't really know what we're
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.160]  doing with this, but it's interesting enough to ship and you can watch movies and TV shows
[36:56.160 --> 36:57.840]  on it and stuff.
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.800]  But I can't help but think that if they had done a game controller already and had games
[37:01.800 --> 37:09.160]  for Apple TV and it had gone nowhere yet, which isn't... Right, you'd hear about it.
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.320]  Well, you wanted to talk Tim Cook, right?
[37:13.320 --> 37:14.320]  Sure.
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.760]  Let's segue right to these... I guess it was just one piece about Tim Cook and then a response
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.120]  piece, right?
[37:20.120 --> 37:26.080]  Right. So last Sunday, this was I guess nine days ago now, but last Sunday it was on the
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.440]  front page, not the front page of the New York Times, but front page of the Sunday business
[37:30.440 --> 37:34.940]  section of the New York Times was a profile of Tim Cook.
[37:34.940 --> 37:38.360]  Which interestingly, he did not sit down for.
[37:38.360 --> 37:39.360]  Right.
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.880]  At one point in the profile, they'd spoke to Apple to verify some things, but they said,
[37:43.880 --> 37:48.520]  you know, Tim Cook, who declined to be interviewed for this piece.
[37:48.520 --> 37:55.120]  Yeah, but they open it with like an anecdote, a personal anecdote from his childhood, which
[37:55.120 --> 38:00.600]  makes it seem as though he had talked to them for the article, but in fact, they took the
[38:00.600 --> 38:01.600]  anecdote from...
[38:01.600 --> 38:03.960]  A speech or something that he gave, right?
[38:03.960 --> 38:10.280]  That he gave at Auburn University within the last few years, but then they just sort of...
[38:10.280 --> 38:13.960]  To me, it's a little disingenuous, the way that it's written.
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.040]  Yeah, the way that it opens anyway. It relatively quickly admits, you know, we did not interview
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.640]  him directly for this, so it's not as if... They're certainly not framing the whole thing
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.120]  as if he had spoken to them, but you're right that the intro does make it seem a little
[38:28.120 --> 38:30.240]  bit like he was speaking directly to them.
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.640]  Yeah, the headline is Tim Cook making Apple his own. I'll be sure to put it... I don't
[38:35.640 --> 38:39.520]  always keep up with the show notes, but I'll make sure I link this in the show notes. It's
[38:39.520 --> 38:47.960]  by Matt Richtel and Brian X. Chen. Brian X. Chen of Japanese hate the iPhone, back when
[38:47.960 --> 38:51.160]  he wrote for Wired.
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.240]  But the other thing, though, that's interesting, so Tim Cook did not speak to them for this
[38:54.240 --> 39:01.680]  profile, but they got a huge interview. They did speak to Johnny Ive.
[39:01.680 --> 39:04.080]  For the same... Was it in the same profile they had spoken to him?
[39:04.080 --> 39:05.080]  Yes.
[39:05.080 --> 39:08.800]  Okay, I guess I didn't... I read it late last night, so I guess I didn't see that that was
[39:08.800 --> 39:09.800]  the case.
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.040]  Yeah, so they did get Johnny Ive, which, if anything, is...
[39:13.040 --> 39:15.200]  It's a bigger get, you think?
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.680]  Well, I think Tim Cook winds up speaking... Certainly doesn't speak a lot to the press,
[39:20.680 --> 39:22.720]  but he speaks more often than Johnny Ive does.
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.600]  Well, so it was Johnny Ive speaking almost exclusively about Tim Cook, so it wasn't him
[39:28.600 --> 39:35.880]  talking about his own work or his own experiences at Apple. It was him sort of buttressing their
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.960]  claims about Tim Cook or responding to some of their claims about Tim Cook.
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.800]  Right. Here's a quote from the article. Johnny Ive, the head of design at Apple in a name
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.280]  nearly as adored by its followers as Steve Jobs, says, Mr. Cook has not neglected the
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.640]  company's central mission, innovation. Here's the quote. Honestly, I don't think anything's
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.620]  changed. People felt exactly the same way when we were working on the iPhone. It's hard
[40:02.620 --> 40:08.180]  for all of us to be patient. It was hard for Steve. It is hard for Tim. So that's a pretty
[40:08.180 --> 40:15.280]  strong statement. That's Johnny Ive putting his personal stamp of approval on the...
[40:15.280 --> 40:18.720]  The Tim Cook era. Yeah. And saying, honestly, I don't think
[40:18.720 --> 40:20.360]  anything's changed. Right.
[40:20.360 --> 40:25.120]  At least with regard to Apple and its, and you know, the, the I word innovation.
[40:25.120 --> 40:29.960]  Right. Well, it's interesting that, so yeah, he was, if he was interviewed for part of
[40:29.960 --> 40:33.280]  this, it was really to sort of vouch for Tim Cook.
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.040]  Right. Exactly. Which is if... Presumably put him forward to do that almost.
[40:38.040 --> 40:42.440]  Yeah, because if anything, there's more credibility there than Tim Cook vouching for himself.
[40:42.440 --> 40:46.240]  Right. Absolutely. Yeah. Right. Take, take the sort of, and I know
[40:46.240 --> 40:53.400]  it's a loaded word, objectivity, but take the objective per stance of, okay, forget
[40:53.400 --> 41:01.040]  whether it's Apple and Tim Cook in particular, but a company's CEO and is he, it replaces
[41:01.040 --> 41:09.000]  a very successful predecessor who founded the company. The CEO claims that he himself
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.280]  is doing a good job replacing the guy. It's almost meaningless, right? It's, it's
[41:14.280 --> 41:18.440]  not, you know, we laugh, but it's like, well, you know, of course you're going to say that.
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.760]  You'd hope. Right. It means a lot more when somebody
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.440]  who has his own... Well, who was there before and who's there
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.600]  now, definitely. Right. And is, has and has earned an enormous
[41:31.600 --> 41:33.500]  amount of credibility. Right.
[41:33.500 --> 41:38.640]  And has credibility to lose, an enormous amount of credibility to lose, vouches for him.
[41:38.640 --> 41:44.840]  So it's, you know, you could see why Apple PR wise would, would strategize such and say,
[41:44.840 --> 41:47.640]  you know, and, and assuming that, you know, everybody went along with it, that they would
[41:47.640 --> 41:51.120]  have Johnny speak instead of Tim. Right.
[41:51.120 --> 41:53.560]  Even instead of both. The thing that I thought was interesting was
[41:53.560 --> 42:00.080]  there was a mention of, so right now there's this idea sort of in the ether that Apple
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.960]  hasn't had any innovative product since Steve Jobs died. Right. And the last one was the
[42:04.960 --> 42:11.880]  iPad, which was 2010. He died in 2011. Is that right? 2011, I think. And you know, they
[42:11.880 --> 42:16.760]  just have, they've been sitting on their hands since then. And you know, the, the fairly
[42:16.760 --> 42:21.440]  obvious response is that innovative products don't come every six months or every year.
[42:21.440 --> 42:29.080]  It's, you know, the Mac, the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and then the iPad in 2010.
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.680]  So even if you think it accelerated, I think that's fairly coincidental. And really we're
[42:32.680 --> 42:38.520]  talking about a handful of truly game-changing products that you should expect there to be
[42:38.520 --> 42:44.920]  multiple years, maybe even, you know, decades between them. But the iPad mini is sort of
[42:44.920 --> 42:50.960]  the counter to that, that maybe that's one where it's at least semi innovative in terms
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.600]  of ramping up sales, at least. And what was interesting in that piece was that it said
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.800]  that this was a product that Steve Jobs didn't think would find a market. And since then
[43:01.800 --> 43:08.040]  it outsells the full-size iPad. I don't think it gave a number, but it vastly outsells it,
[43:08.040 --> 43:09.040]  right?
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.000]  I don't know about vastly, but it did say that it outsold it. And I thought that was
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.240]  interesting because it wasn't, it's, Apple doesn't break that down, although you can
[43:17.240 --> 43:21.960]  kind of extrapolate some of it from average. They do say how many total iPads they sell
[43:21.960 --> 43:26.280]  per quarter, and they do give an average selling price. And given that the iPad mini has always
[43:26.280 --> 43:31.540]  been significantly lower priced, that you know, you could see from the downward shift
[43:31.540 --> 43:36.440]  in average selling price that it's clearly been a successful product. But it was, you're
[43:36.440 --> 43:39.360]  right though, that they do give Tim Cook credit.
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.120]  Not just credit, but like credit as far as Steve Jobs didn't want to make this product.
[43:44.120 --> 43:49.320]  And therefore, you know, they didn't under him. And Tim Cook took over and then he said,
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.960]  you know what, we are going to make this. And, you know, that's, that's really, it's
[43:53.960 --> 43:59.800]  never been, been promoted that way. But that's to me almost really the first major Tim Cook
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.680]  product that, that apparently really just literally would not have happened under Steve
[44:04.680 --> 44:05.680]  Jobs.
[44:05.680 --> 44:14.040]  Right. And it's also a very interesting product to me operations wise because I still think
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.680]  it's an enormous, you know, Apple is a company of patterns and you can kind of pick up on
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.920]  the, the annual patterns of their development and make, you know, without any kind of sources
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.880]  at all at Apple, it's a pretty good guess that there's going to be at least one new
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.920]  iPhone later this year. And it's going to have an, uh, a new system on a chip called
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.920]  the AA, right? Right. I mean, at the very least, there's going to be a new iPhone as
[44:38.920 --> 44:44.480]  far as the chip. Like, what do you think, like 90% chance on that? I would say at least
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.560]  90% chance that there's going to be an a eight because there's been an a four, a five, a
[44:49.560 --> 44:53.000]  six, a seven for the last four years. And has it been every single year that they've
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.400]  had a new one? Ever since they introduced the one called with the a four, which I'd
[44:58.400 --> 45:02.400]  say, you know, 99.99 that there's going to be a new iPhone and then maybe just slightly
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.640]  less that it's going to have a new chip. Anyway, it doesn't matter. But yeah, as you're saying,
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.080]  patterns that they've followed for years at this point. Right. And so to me, the thing
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.440]  that's most interesting about the iPad mini is the first one that was introduced in 2012
[45:16.440 --> 45:23.440]  was like a year behind the big iPad. It was a year behind. It was still on the a five
[45:23.440 --> 45:29.560]  when the big iPad had gone to the a six. It was not right. It didn't have the retina display.
[45:29.560 --> 45:36.880]  Right. And so I expected that in 2013, that it would still be one year behind and it might
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.720]  go retina because the iPad had gone retina the year before, but that it would have the
[45:40.720 --> 45:47.280]  a six where it right, which is how they you know, how they in other ways, you know, how
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.480]  they kept the prices so much lower than the full size, but it like skipped a year it to
[45:51.480 --> 45:57.000]  me engineering wise, it went all the way from an a five non retina device to top of the
[45:57.000 --> 46:05.040]  line a seven retina and not thicker like the original retina iPads were right kept this
[46:05.040 --> 46:12.560]  felt thinness that long battery life and retina and went to the a seven. I mean, it's like,
[46:12.560 --> 46:15.880]  there's like a tiny little asterisk you have to insert there because it's like the clock
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.120]  speed is like 5% slower than the iPad. Oh, is that I don't even think I was aware of
[46:21.120 --> 46:25.600]  that. So yeah, but it's it's really really like it's not even just an asterisk. It's
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.360]  like a tiny it's effectively they effectively brought it up to the same level as the as
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.920]  the full size iPad instead of keeping right in a year when the full size iPad had a tremendous
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.960]  year big jump in terms of the thickness and the width and you know, battery life and stuff
[46:39.960 --> 46:45.080]  like that, which is amazing. And to me, that's just all Tim Cook and then to hear that this
[46:45.080 --> 46:51.480]  you know that he you know, he'd been a proponent of the mini size all along. I mean, you know,
[46:51.480 --> 46:57.240]  seems like the guy gets credit both for the operations and for the for actual anticipating
[46:57.240 --> 47:01.840]  the market demand, right? Well, the thing that I think before I say this, I need to
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.160]  stipulate that I do own some Apple stock. But the thing that I can't ever really get
[47:07.160 --> 47:13.520]  behind in these articles is talking about growth. And I'm not like I'm not some sage
[47:13.520 --> 47:19.880]  investor. I don't really know what I'm doing. But everything talks about how Apple's growth
[47:19.880 --> 47:27.520]  has slowed. And that's percentage growth. Right, right. But why is that the metric?
[47:27.520 --> 47:32.960]  Can someone explain to me why, you know, if you go from being I don't know how big they
[47:32.960 --> 47:38.400]  were 10 years ago, but they weren't that big to either the biggest or second biggest or
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.560]  you know, top five biggest companies in the world? Why is that not enough? And why do
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.560]  you need to continue growing beyond that point?
[47:49.560 --> 47:57.340]  Well, and I would even say the flip side that where they did have in the crazy gogo early
[47:57.340 --> 48:04.340]  years 2008 2009 2010 of the iPhone, where they did have crazy like 40% 30% year over
[48:04.340 --> 48:09.280]  year growth. Who thinks though that once you are the biggest company in the world that
[48:09.280 --> 48:15.920]  you can possibly or 40% growth is feasible. It's it's it almost is impossible. And I know
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.240]  this is not really the law of big numbers. But it's what some people are to use that
[48:21.240 --> 48:28.280]  phrase, which is simply means once you're that big, you can't grow at 30 or 40%. Yeah,
[48:28.280 --> 48:33.000]  you're right. That's the thing is that if you go from 1 billion in sales to 2 billion,
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.200]  it's 100% growth. But to do two to 4 billion is obviously not as easy as one to two. And
[48:39.200 --> 48:43.440]  as the numbers get bigger and bigger, that becomes more difficult. And when you're literally
[48:43.440 --> 48:46.680]  the most profitable company in the world, not just profitable tech company, but most
[48:46.680 --> 48:52.600]  profitable company, seven or 8% growth year over year in profits is huge. And and it's
[48:52.600 --> 48:59.160]  huge numbers of billions of dollars that everyone's I shouldn't say everyone, but Wall Street
[48:59.160 --> 49:05.400]  or investors or you know, whoever it is seem so focused on the percentage growth. And I
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.320]  just look at these numbers. And I think like, okay, they made, you know, $20 billion last
[49:10.320 --> 49:17.720]  quarter. That seems pretty good to me. Yeah. You know, and the iPhone in particular, which
[49:17.720 --> 49:23.520]  is the biggest and most profitable by revenue and profit line that Apple has, is in a fascinating
[49:23.520 --> 49:29.440]  market, which is phones because for the most part, there's an upper cap on how many phones
[49:29.440 --> 49:34.740]  are going to be in the world, which is one phone for every adult, or even close to adult
[49:34.740 --> 49:39.840]  aged person. I mean, unless you've got your day phone and your night phone. Right, which
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.880]  is an exception. And you know, there's obviously a lot of very elderly people who are not going
[49:44.880 --> 49:49.640]  to buy a cell phone and they're dying off. And there's, you know, children, I guess,
[49:49.640 --> 49:54.680]  you know, really young children are typically not going to get an iPhone. Right? Well, and
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.800]  it's not a it's not a good that people trade them in or upgrade, but it's not a good that
[49:59.800 --> 50:04.880]  expires in any way. At least not in terms of months. It's years. I don't know what's
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.120]  the world population? 7 billion people. So let's say there's truly a hard cap at around
[50:10.120 --> 50:15.800]  3 billion phones in the world, let's say three or four. Sure, why not? You know, and you
[50:15.800 --> 50:22.560]  know, you could cut off large swaths of those people for for not having the financial interest.
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.160]  They don't have enough money to buy an iPhone. Right? It's just not gonna happen. Or they
[50:26.160 --> 50:32.200]  live in a place where there still isn't cell service. Right? You know, not that the iPhone
[50:32.200 --> 50:35.680]  has already peaked in it can't sell more. But it's it's actually if you look at the
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.880]  numbers that have actually sold, it's remarkably close to they've sold about as many as they
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.760]  could have hoped to at this point. And they've got to expand and interesting in new ways
[50:44.760 --> 50:49.820]  and wait for the world to catch up. You know, it's it's truly, they've done almost as well
[50:49.820 --> 50:55.960]  with the iPhone as they as you possibly could. Right? Like if you said in 2007, when they
[50:55.960 --> 51:01.880]  came out with it, what's the best case scenario for the next seven years, right? It almost
[51:01.880 --> 51:06.040]  it's almost as though that they've they've hit that that they've they've, you know, they've
[51:06.040 --> 51:11.960]  done as well with it as they possibly could have expected to do. And that years where
[51:11.960 --> 51:17.480]  they were having 30 or 40% growth, that was those were the years where they were expanding
[51:17.480 --> 51:23.560]  to new carriers around the world. I mean, it's this is a thing that debuted on one carrier
[51:23.560 --> 51:29.420]  in one one country in 2007. And because of the nature of the way that they control the
[51:29.420 --> 51:34.040]  customer experience, and that, you know, it's so different than than what the carriers expect
[51:34.040 --> 51:40.680]  or want. You know, it was a relatively slow rollout around the world. And that's what
[51:40.680 --> 51:45.720]  made the growth possible is that there are these countries where it hadn't been sold,
[51:45.720 --> 51:52.060]  except like on the gray market. And then they debut, and they could, you know, it would
[51:52.060 --> 51:55.480]  allow for this tremendous growth, whereas that type of growth, it's just not feasible
[51:55.480 --> 52:00.480]  to expect that. Right. Right. Well, and then in that same piece, there was a quote from,
[52:00.480 --> 52:05.480]  I forget who it was, it doesn't really matter, some either investor or some analyst. And
[52:05.480 --> 52:09.280]  I wrote this down, because he said, he thought Apple no longer had the juice to create the
[52:09.280 --> 52:16.520]  world beating product it needs. And so let's, let's, I can even I can even say, you know,
[52:16.520 --> 52:19.840]  maybe he's right, maybe they cannot create another iPhone, maybe there's no market that
[52:19.840 --> 52:25.080]  exists, or maybe they don't have the ability to create a market. But the word needs in
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.080]  that sentence is really what sort of sticks. Because this is again, I don't know what it
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.760]  is right now today, but it's one of the biggest companies in the world, one of the most profitable
[52:33.760 --> 52:39.840]  companies in the world. And they've got how much money in the bank. What does needs mean,
[52:39.840 --> 52:45.140]  in that sense? Right, it's not what Apple needs. It's what these investors who seek
[52:45.140 --> 52:51.520]  huge returns on this stock, right? Right. What they need to justify continuing to support
[52:51.520 --> 52:56.600]  Apple. Here's a quote that they have in this time story from, you know, this is the balance
[52:56.600 --> 53:01.480]  that was added to the story. This is from Lawrence I. Balter, chief market strategist
[53:01.480 --> 53:10.960]  at Oracle Investment Research. Well, the article this is this is the Times author's words,
[53:10.960 --> 53:16.560]  investors have clamored for Apple wizardry, a much anticipated iWatch or ITV, perhaps,
[53:16.560 --> 53:21.120]  to these critics, Mr. Cook is uninspiring his social views window dressing, when what
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.240]  they want is magic, which is a little more telling than they could think. I think because
[53:27.240 --> 53:31.440]  I think that saying that they want magic, like they're presenting these guys as reasonable
[53:31.440 --> 53:38.000]  critics, whereas I'd say using the word magic is a little bit. It's actually spot on like
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.880]  what they want is not possible, not right. Yeah. Here's the quote from this guy, Balter.
[53:43.880 --> 53:50.020]  Where is the grand design? All we hear from Cook is that there are some great products
[53:50.020 --> 53:56.640]  coming down the pike. Mr. Balter calls Apple a financial rock of Gibraltar, it is sitting
[53:56.640 --> 54:01.040]  on about 150 billion in cash. But he says he has serious questions about whether it
[54:01.040 --> 54:08.080]  continued to be a hyper growth company. Is it a stock for growth investors, he asks,
[54:08.080 --> 54:15.960]  or quote, widows, which and now to me, it's actually a little insulting, right? Like now
[54:15.960 --> 54:24.920]  it's like the the alpha male investor on Wall Street. Who's, you know, like, what's what
[54:24.920 --> 54:30.840]  exactly is wrong with widows? Right? Like, they were like, like, if stock, right, which
[54:30.840 --> 54:37.040]  churns out earnings every year and pays a dividend and, you know, is a is a viable thing
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.900]  to hold on to and earn you some money. Right? Women whose husbands have died are looking
[54:41.900 --> 54:49.160]  for stability, I guess. Yeah, I guess it's and exactly like you said, what's what's wrong
[54:49.160 --> 54:54.380]  with that either? Well, I mean, and you're right, it presents it as a as a, you know,
[54:54.380 --> 54:58.360]  it should be this hyper growth stock. And instead, it's this boring, you'll just make
[54:58.360 --> 55:05.660]  a little bit of money off it every year stock. Right. Yeah, like I said, I can't, I can't
[55:05.660 --> 55:13.500]  read too much of the the stock analysis of Apple just because it's just so insane. Right.
[55:13.500 --> 55:21.360]  And it's never been a fair way to necessarily measure the CEO because the stock is in some
[55:21.360 --> 55:28.380]  ways outside the CEO on large ways outside the CEOs control that, you know, judge them
[55:28.380 --> 55:32.480]  by their revenue and their profit and their product lines. But what what happens to the
[55:32.480 --> 55:37.880]  stock price is often irrational, and in Apple's case, usually irrational. Even if you do think
[55:37.880 --> 55:42.280]  the CEO should be judged based on the stock. If you look at the numbers, it's way up since
[55:42.280 --> 55:48.080]  he took over. Right way up. And in fact, it's that's the point I'm getting at is that this
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.620]  the it's actually getting to me this Times article, if you really read between the lines
[55:52.620 --> 56:00.360]  and look at it. The stuff in Tim Cook's favor is a lot of it is concrete things like the
[56:00.360 --> 56:06.860]  iPad mini being largely brushed over in this article, but but the stuff at WWDC, where
[56:06.860 --> 56:14.260]  you see Apple as an organization really working to pulling together in a cohesive way. Between
[56:14.260 --> 56:20.160]  across the whole company, right. Right. And in a way that shows that these products, they've
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.520]  already got the iPhone and the iPad, and even the Mac, which is, you know, the longest standing,
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.960]  still have deep areas to be improved, that they're nowhere close to being finished, you
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.000]  know, and that it's a shallowness to say, give me something new, give me a watch or
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.760]  a TV, that the iPhone and iPad are old news, whereas there's still so, so much to do to
[56:43.760 --> 56:48.920]  improve those products, even in the short term, even just this year and next year, let
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.480]  alone for the next decade, right. And it's such a shallow way to look at them as to say
[56:53.480 --> 56:59.680]  that, that they need, you know, like you emphasize the word need that they need something new
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.160]  when there's so much work that can be done and improvements that can be made to these
[57:04.160 --> 57:10.680]  existing products. But then conversely, the negative stuff, the balance, you know, well,
[57:10.680 --> 57:16.400]  I don't know, maybe the guy is an empty shirt is getting so much. The sauce is so much weaker,
[57:16.400 --> 57:24.240]  right? They're still you in this article using the stock dive in 2013, right against Cook
[57:24.240 --> 57:32.800]  that investors doubted the guy and the stock went from six over 700 down under 500. And
[57:32.800 --> 57:38.600]  this is the old pre split numbers, but it's, they're still using that like, hey, there's
[57:38.600 --> 57:44.280]  proof that the guy you know, is maybe on shaky ground, whereas really what that stock dip
[57:44.280 --> 57:48.720]  proved was that a lot of investors believed not that Tim Cook was an empty shirt, but
[57:48.720 --> 57:52.600]  that a lot of investors thought he was an empty shirt, right? It's not proof that he
[57:52.600 --> 57:59.520]  was. It's proof that he believed he was right. But the article came out in June of 2014,
[57:59.520 --> 58:06.660]  when the stock is back up at near historic peaks, and way higher. I mean, I might even
[58:06.660 --> 58:12.860]  be I think it was around 350 when he took over. I'm pretty sure that's right. If it's
[58:12.860 --> 58:20.080]  not double, it is very close to double the peak of where it was when when Steve Jobs,
[58:20.080 --> 58:23.960]  you know, reside. So yeah, it went up and then it went down a little bit from there,
[58:23.960 --> 58:28.520]  but was still way over where it had been. And now it's back up. So that the only way
[58:28.520 --> 58:34.640]  you can use it as a cudgel against him is to ignore what's happened after. You know,
[58:34.640 --> 58:41.840]  you've got to still be stuck at like, late 2013 when it was depressed. It's it's actually
[58:41.840 --> 58:49.280]  the stock now is it's not a good example of problems with Tim Cook. And then the last
[58:49.280 --> 58:55.200]  Well, there's two things I wanted to talk about in the article. But the last thing in
[58:55.200 --> 58:57.080]  the article, I thought was weird, too.
[58:57.080 --> 58:58.480]  Is it the Beatles comparison?
[58:58.480 --> 59:04.520]  Oh, yeah, maybe. Yeah. Was it? Is that who gave it? It's like they found some guys at
[59:04.520 --> 59:11.800]  WWDC, who claimed to be, you know, iPhone device. And yeah, and one of them, the quote
[59:11.800 --> 59:16.600]  that I have is that I wrote this down to is that jobs is to john Lennon, what Tim Cook
[59:16.600 --> 59:25.960]  is to Ringo. Yeah. I mean, nothing against Ringo. But, I mean, that's, I don't know,
[59:25.960 --> 59:31.680]  I couldn't, I couldn't cotton on to the idea that, that jobs is Lennon and Tim Cook is
[59:31.680 --> 59:35.520]  is not Paul McCartney. He's frickin Ringo.
[59:35.520 --> 59:39.960]  Right. I think it's, I think comparisons to the Beatles, in this case, are pretty, it
[59:39.960 --> 59:43.960]  doesn't work. It doesn't work. But it's Yeah, they let that you know, but they found somebody
[59:43.960 --> 59:50.400]  who obviously doesn't think much of Tim Cook. And then at the very end of the article, they
[59:50.400 --> 59:55.480]  found one thing particularly jarring in the keynote, Apple did not hue to its tradition
[59:55.480 --> 59:59.880]  of pairing hardware and software. Specifically, Apple introduced a program called health,
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.220]  which helps consumers and doctors monitor health status like heart rate or glucose levels,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.680]  but did not also introduce a piece of hardware to measure those results. That is something
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.080]  the new smart smartwatch is rumored to do. Quote from this guy, Mr. Zeleff. They just
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.960]  released software said Mr. Zeleff sounding surprised. It's something never wouldn't have
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.000]  done. It's an impossible comparison, but it's one that Mr. Cook is being held to at least
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.920]  until he makes enough magic of his own. And then the article ends. Whereas so they just
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.560]  let this guy say this, they quote this guy who was at WDC saying, in the last paragraph,
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.600]  it's something Steve wouldn't have done. Whereas you can list W you probably run out of fingers
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.640]  listing WWDC is where they didn't introduce new hardware, right, right. Well, and and
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.440]  recently, it's all been new iOS stuff that then in the fall, you realize, oh, right,
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:56.020]  the phone does have, you know, two cameras or a GPS, or I'm trying to think of a more
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.680]  recent example. But, you know, the phone does have things that go with this software, right,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:09.360]  including 2011. Steve Jobs last WWDC was no hardware, right? It was actually the WWDC
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:16.440]  where they moved the iPhones from right to the fall. And there was no hardware. It was
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.120]  the I, you know, it was like the introduction of iCloud as a strategy, which was software.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.880]  And so they don't, they just let the quote stand like that to me. And that's how the
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.260]  article ends. They say that something Steve wouldn't have done, whereas the times could
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.400]  have easily fact checked, right and said, actually, it is something that not only would
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.920]  he have done he did do and that to me is maddening. And to me is the sort of thing you would think
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.640]  you would expect better from the New York Times. But it's it's because I feel like it
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:50.460]  didn't even occur to them. Because their perspective is they want this false balance, right, where
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:54.760]  you've got to, you know, where you've got to have somebody saying that something like
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:02.080]  this. Otherwise, it seems like Tim Cook is it's too balanced and too too skewed in favor
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.920]  of good job. Right? Whereas that's what the actual facts say. And it's just maddening
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.640]  to me that that's who they speak to from WWDC. Whereas I thought it was I know you missed
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.360]  it this year. You weren't out there. But it was a crazily popular WWDC from developers
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.280]  perspective, right? Right. Yeah. I mean, and you could see that after the fact for in terms
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.240]  of developers. And you didn't even have to be there for that. You know, the announcements,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.720]  you know, that it's a lot of stuff that developers have been asking for. Right. It's really crazy.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.120]  Let me take a second break here and thank our next sponsor. And we'll keep going. Our
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:44.480]  good friends at igloo igloo is the intranet you'll actually like it's built with easy
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.960]  to use integrated apps like shared calendars, Twitter, like micro blogs, file sharing and
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.920]  more, right. So think about having a little Twitter for your team, or your company, where
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.640]  it's private, it's on your own hosted site separate from real Twitter, but you can post
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.780]  Twitter like things just amongst yourselves. Great idea. Everything you need is built in
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:10.580]  everything is social. So if you upload a file, or you write a post on the internal blog,
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:15.000]  your team can share it, comment it, rate it, like it, even manage versions of that document
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.560]  all within the igloo system. The idea is you get your whole company or your team within
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.480]  the company communicating better, gives your team or your company depending on your size,
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.540]  a place to work and collaborate. And they put control over the content and page layout
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:36.380]  into the hands of users without compromising the needs of your IT team. It's very secure.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:41.140]  You can still manage permissions and have centrally centralized authentication with
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:47.820]  open standards like LDAP. So give it a try. It's free to use free with up to 10 people
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:52.640]  enough to get your whole team on board, see what it's like. And very, very affordable
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:59.480]  once you go over 10 people. Learn more, watch their videos. They've got great videos that
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:05.300]  explain the whole thing, how the whole thing works way better than I can here. Go to igloosoftware.com

[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.180]  I've heard from so many people listen to the show who signed up and are super, super happy
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:21.300]  with it. So check them out. I was not able to negotiate you guys a better discount with
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:28.580]  my name on that one. I thought there was one more thing in this time story that that got
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:36.220]  under my skin, which was when they were talking about Tim Cook and Apple's charitable giving
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.340]  and the whole thing with the telling the investors at the annual meeting that if they want, you
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.780]  know, with regard to their environmental stance, all you care about is the return on investment,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.740]  then get out of the stock, right? Right. And that they're going to do the right thing.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:05:02.500]  And this was from some investors with admittedly right wing views on climate change and similar,
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:09.820]  you know, that sort of environmental type things. And I thought that the article sort
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:16.740]  of painted Tim Cook, tried to paint him a little bit as sort of a wuss, you know, like
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:24.300]  he's sort of a namzy-pamzy wasting money on things that a CEO... I thought that they presented
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:30.140]  that side of the argument a lot more than the flip side, that they didn't really seem
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:37.300]  to have any quotes from anybody who backs his leadership on those concerns. They had
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.260]  quotes from the people who are against it and nothing from the people for it. And I
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.260]  thought that was a little...
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.780]  Well, I mean, Tim Cook declined to be interviewed, so that's...
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:50.300]  Yeah, I guess. But I thought that was a little weird. And then there was this weird thing
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.500]  where they were comparing Apple's charitable giving to Microsoft.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.140]  Yeah, did you work out the math on that? Because...
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.500]  Well, I'd leave that to you. You're...
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:05.100]  Well, I just... You know, I did a mental calculation on it. And it was something like, you know,
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:09.300]  under Cook, Apple has increased their charitable giving and their matching of employees' charitable
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.020]  giving. And I don't remember the numbers. It doesn't really matter. You can look it
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:17.220]  up in the article. But basically, it said something like, in the past two years, 50
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:23.200]  million has been donated. But in the past two decades, Microsoft has donated like over
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.200]  a billion.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:31.480]  Yeah, that's exactly it. It's over two decades, Microsoft's employees' donations, inclusive
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:37.980]  of the corporate match, have donated a billion dollars since 1983. So two decades.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:42.540]  And so if you... Or three decades, right? Yeah, that's three decades.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:48.380]  If you do the math, like, it worked out that, yeah, Apple might not have, you know, might
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.220]  not be doing quite as much on average as Microsoft did over 20 years. But in the past two years,
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:07:00.640]  the numbers are way up. And it doesn't really make sense to compare 20 years worth of donations
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.320]  to two years when they've just started this program out. So the whole thing, the math
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.060]  on it seemed, it was just, it was, it was an apples and oranges comparison, to use a
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.340]  phrase that doesn't work that well for Apple. But it didn't really make sense to me as I
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.340]  was reading it.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:27.460]  Well, if you divide a billion over 30 years from Microsoft is 33 million a year, and they're
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:33.900]  saying Apple has donated 50 million in two years. Well, so it's in the ballpark. Now,
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.300]  there's inflation adjustment, etc., where 1983 dollars are worth less. So maybe Microsoft
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.100]  has been giving, you know, more. But still, they're in the ballpark when you look at it
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100]  that way.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.060]  And it's new. It's, they've recently gotten into the ballpark. So it doesn't seem to make
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.380]  sense to me to compare it over the past 20 or 30 years.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.100]  Right. And the other thing, too, that they just toss out there as though it's equivalent
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:08:02.420]  is that Microsoft says that on average, it donates $2 million a day in software to nonprofits,
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:07.940]  which is great. It's better than not doing it. But let's face it, you know.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:13.700]  That's valuing Office at like $900 or something, which nobody pays.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:19.820]  Right. It would be great if Rogue Amoeba donated software to nonprofits, but it's not the same
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:26.660]  thing as Rogue Amoeba donating money to nonprofits, you know. And $2 million sounds like a lot.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:33.140]  Like it would be a lot for Rogue Amoeba or Qbrands to donate $2 million a day in software.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:40.660]  Right. Yeah, $2 million a day. That'd be a lot of copies of Esper. But for Microsoft,
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.660]  it's not, especially given the fact that they could, you know, that the prices they charge
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.740]  for their software are just arbitrary. It's not real good. It's not the same thing as,
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:54.260]  for example, donating $2 million a day in hardware to nonprofits, which has a fixed
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.700]  cost. So it's a weird, I thought it was a weird and slanted comparison.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:03.780]  Yeah. All right. What else you got? Well, we were talking growth. I think you wanted
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:09.620]  to touch on the physical growth of the iPhone. Oh, there you go. Mr. Segway, right? That's
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.180]  why. Yeah. So we've got, that's the other big story that came out this week. And this
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:20.180]  is nothing new. This is, you know, it's just verifying months-long rumors. But that Bloomberg
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.980]  yesterday, this was Peter Burroughs. Well, hold on. Don't use the word verifying because.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:28.580]  Oh, not verify. All right. That's a wrong one. Well, no, I don't mean to criticize you.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.740]  I'm talking more about all the sites that publish this stuff all the time. Now we've
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:37.620]  got a slightly more reputable site with maybe better sourcing, right? Right. Echoing.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:42.580]  There you go. The rumors. This is Tim Kolpin and Peter Burroughs reporting for
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:50.340]  Bloomberg. Apple's big iPhones, plural, said to start production next month. Apple suppliers
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:54.260]  in China will begin mass production of its largest iPhones ever next month, according
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:59.460]  to people familiar with the plans, as the smartphone maker faces increased competition.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.700]  Blah, blah, blah, asked not to be identified because the plans are private. One model will
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:11.460]  have a 4.7 inch display compared to the four inch screen of the current 5S that may be
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:17.860]  available to ship to retailers around September, said two of the people, a 5.5 inch version
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:22.580]  is also being prepared for manufacturing and may be available at the same time, the people said.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:27.700]  So they're saying this is, you know, and this has been rumored by various people for a while
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:35.060]  that there's two new bigger iPhones this year, a 4.7 inch diagonal display and a 5.5 inch.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:39.620]  There's a lot of, I feel like we could easily fill the rest of the show just talking about this.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:45.220]  I don't even understand, I don't even understand the aspect that this 5.5 inch version
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.180]  may be available at the same time. As if they might release this in like January or something.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.420]  I mean, as we just talked about, you know, 10 minutes ago about the patterns that Apple follows,
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.980]  they don't release a new iPhone in the middle of the year with a different size.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:07.220]  Right. I don't get it. I've never been less excited. Not excited. Well, I'm not excited
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:15.140]  because I'm personally a little, yeah. I don't want a bigger phone. I mean, I'll just put that
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.020]  right out there. I'm holding my iPhone right now. It's a four inch screen and it's almost too big
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:26.500]  to me. I could see how many people are going to buy this iPhone. I don't know how many people
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:35.540]  are going to buy it. I could see how maybe I could get used to a 4.7. I've seen 4.7 devices,
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:40.180]  but that to me seems, just the width seems to be annoying. 5.5, I've seen those phones.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.780]  I know that I don't want one. I know that I don't. It just seems weird to me. No, I've never,
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:51.140]  even my personal tastes aside, even let's say I really want, even if I wanted a huge iPhone,
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:59.300]  I just don't understand how Apple's going to present it in a keynote where they say,
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.500]  you know, I can see how they would say, look, everybody wants a big phone. Here's a bigger
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:11.380]  iPhone. I don't understand how they say, here's two bigger iPhones, bigger and even more humongous
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:17.540]  and the size that you've grown used to over the last seven years and that has made the iPhone by
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.900]  far, you know, 70% of all the profits in the entire handset industry is now right. That was,
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.220]  yeah, that was your big thing is that you're reading this as them saying there will be a 4.7
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:33.300]  and a 5.5 and that's it. And that's all I've ever seen rumored. I've never seen from any of these
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:40.900]  other rumors, rumors of a new four inch normal, big current size iPhone. Right. Well, but I guess
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:47.700]  the question is, how would that, how would that leak versus if the size changes, it's much more
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:55.620]  obvious, right? Well, part of it too. And, and over the last few years, the track record has
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:02.180]  been pretty good on the component leaks out of Asia. And what they're showing this year is
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:07.620]  something that's more along the lines of the iPads with rounded sides. Okay. Have you seen
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.100]  any of these? I haven't. I really don't look at this stuff just because I wait till it comes out,
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:16.180]  but I understand what you're saying. A lot of what's come out and from sources that have been
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:23.940]  pretty accurate in years past, you know, and that got the new iPhone five shape and same type of
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:33.940]  people who, you know, had like leaks of the gold iPhone last year are showing 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:40.820]  phones with more or less, just think of a smaller iPad or iPad mini with the rounder sides and those
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:48.180]  style brands. And nothing like that has leaked with a four inch. So let's, if you presume now,
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:53.220]  obviously this is an enormous, if this is the biggest, if I could make on the show,
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:14:02.900]  if we take it for granted that all new iPhone hardware is, will inevitably leak from the Asian
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:07.940]  supply chain. Okay. Again, that is an enormous if, but if we take that as an assumption,
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:15.700]  then the only way that the four inch screen stays at the top of the, you know, and gets the A8 and
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.020]  new camera and, you know, stays at the top of the heap technology wise, spec wise,
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:27.060]  is if it's going to still be in the current five, five S form factor, which seems different
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:33.380]  if there's two new models that have a new iPad style look. Like it's possible, I guess,
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:38.820]  I don't, but it just seems weird. Like to me, for example, like the way that I just mentioned before
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:46.900]  that in 2013, last fall, Apple introduced two new iPads, the new mini with retina and the new iPad
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:54.180]  air. And they had the same spec, same camera, same A7 system on a chip, you know, roughly that it's
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:15:00.420]  just, Hey, which size do you want? Right. And they also looked like siblings, right? They look like
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:06.500]  the same device shrunk up and down. Well, but if you even right, so I mean, the question is,
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.940]  are they going to keep a four inch screen as a sibling, a brother to the existing or the new
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:19.060]  sizes. But if you were going to do that, if you're going to change the case, that's going to present
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:25.860]  all sorts of manufacturing challenges, right? I would guess, I mean, it might make sense to
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:31.380]  put the new hardware in there, you know, whatever the new chip is, new camera, whatever. But keep
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:36.180]  the current case because you've already tooled up all your factories for that current four inch
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:41.940]  sized case. Yeah, but they've never kept the same four factor form factor for more than two years.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:49.060]  The 3G 3GS was two years, the four 4S was two years. And that's true, the five 5S. Now, does,
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.260]  you know, again, the fact that that's the pattern that they've had ever since the, you know, 3G,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.460]  you know, in the original 2007 iPhone was the only one that only lasted a year.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.820]  Does that mean that it'll always be so? Maybe not, you know, maybe this form factor, the five
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:13.300]  5S form factor is like their Porsche 911, you know, we don't need to change it, you know,
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.780]  this is this is the way the four inch iPhone looks all the time. Yeah. And there's,
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.420]  and it doesn't look dated. It looks still looks great. I mean, ultimately, what we'll see in,
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:29.620]  what, three months? I would guess September, because that's it's been September for ever
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:36.020]  since they moved it to the fall, right. And then October is for iPads, and perhaps the watch or
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.780]  whatever else they're going to do, but I would guess the phone gets its own event in September.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:44.340]  Right. Well, I said to you, I said the interesting thing to me was not the
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:48.900]  physical size growing, because I'm, as I said, I'm pretty happy with the current physical size.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:54.340]  I'm interested to see a storage space increase in the device.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.420]  Yeah, absolutely. And nobody has any kind of rumors about that.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.700]  Well, again, I guess is that something that would even leak? Because, you know,
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:06.340]  they already make 128 gig iPad. So the the storage already exists in that size.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.300]  How different would the with the physical, you know, the case wouldn't need to be any different
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:15.860]  just to put a little more storage space in there, probably. Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:22.580]  the 128 gigabyte chips would be bigger. And along the same lines, I would really, really, I think
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.700]  it's almost overdue at this point, like to see more RAM. Okay. Because they've they've been all
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:32.420]  it. The iPhone's been at one gigabyte of RAM sense for a while now. I forget which was it
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:39.940]  maybe the iPhone five, I think the five. You know, and in that tick tock strategy of every two years,
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:46.420]  they take bigger leaps forward. I would really like to see them go to two gigabytes.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.260]  Well, now, do you do you think you notice a lack of RAM?
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:56.740]  Less so than used to, but I still get those, you know, it's it's most noticeable in Safari. Okay.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:03.140]  When tabs that I know I have open end up having to refresh. And, you know, it's just the nature
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:09.540]  of the phone where I use it on cellular more than any other device. And therefore, if I'm out on
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:14.180]  cellular, sometimes, you know, it's the most inconsistent networking wise and reloading a tab
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:19.620]  often takes, you know, longer than than you'd like. Right. Well, because I mean, with storage space,
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:24.020]  it's very obvious if I want to put all of my music on there, I can't do it. Whereas with RAM,
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:28.420]  it's more of a nebulous, you know, as you said, some days, a Safari tab needs to reload. And
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.980]  but the other that is that is, I guess, one of the one of the obvious ways you can tell.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:39.780]  Yeah. And, you know, I don't play a ton of games on my phone. But I know a lot of people do Jonas
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.260]  certainly does. And they're, you know, games typically, you know, can use as much RAM as you
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.740]  can throw at them. Right. Yeah, absolutely. You know, so it's not so much that I personally on a
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:53.380]  day to day basis, really, really need more RAM in my iPhone. But I think that the iPhone as a
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:59.380]  platform could use it more. Yeah. Right. Yeah, absolutely. And the iPad too, especially if it's
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:04.980]  true that they're going to add some sort of multitasking type interface where you can run
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:09.860]  two apps at the same time. Right. Sure. Yeah, I totally agree. I just I still I just can't see
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:16.980]  how they would spin an introduction where they say we've added two new sizes above it. And but
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:22.820]  yet the four inch one looks exactly the same as it used to. Right. Well, I mean, honestly, if you
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:29.700]  look at we're we're especially you, I think are very fixated on the devices, and pay much more
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:35.780]  attention to them than most people. But I mean, if you look at a bunch of iPhones side by side,
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:43.780]  the user experience is not really very different between them. From a, you know, from a consumer
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.300]  standpoint, you know what I mean? In that there's always been a home button at the bottom, there's
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:53.140]  a power button at the top, I guess the headphone jack moved but you know, would it really be that
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:58.340]  big a deal if the four inch had one case and the four seven and five five if they exist had a
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:05.220]  different case? It's not but it just seems weird. It just feels a little off to me that if they were
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:12.500]  all going to be on the same level, the same level spec rise, it just would seem odd if one of them
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.820]  looked different than the Yeah, just seems a little off. And then that makes me think that if it's the
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:23.380]  case that they're going to your concern is the bail on the four inch size, right? Exactly. That's
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:30.820]  my concern is that the new AA top of the tier top tier iPhones are only going to be four seven and
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:36.980]  or five five. And that the four inch size will no longer even be made with metal, it'll drop. I
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:42.580]  don't know what they're going to call it the five CS but that the phone with the five s specs will
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:49.860]  be in the plastic case that we saw last year at one at that $200 or $100 you know, price level
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:54.740]  price level down. Well, selfishly, I hope that's not the case. But I don't have any insight as to
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.900]  whether or not that will be the case. I mean, no, but nobody who's publishing these rumors does
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:03.780]  either which is makes me it's just convinces me that all of the leaks are from the supply chain
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:09.700]  and none of them are from Cooper tonight. Whereas the only people who know nobody even says like
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:14.420]  what, you know how they're going to price these things are how much is the 5.5 inch going to be
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:19.300]  much more expensive, expensive. Right? With the iPads, you pay for the bigger size,
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:24.100]  you pay for the size for the storage, right? Right. Does it make sense that you would I just
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:31.700]  don't see how you do this, you know, maybe one of them is, you know, another possibility is that
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:40.980]  the 4.7 inch is the the new flagship model most expensive and the 5.5 inch is the new five C
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:48.420]  lower priced model. But then that seems weird to me, that you that, that somebody let's say
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:54.100]  somebody who's older and has, you know, really wants the bigger phone because they really have
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:58.100]  trouble reading the smaller screen, they just want everything bigger because they want bigger text,
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:04.100]  which is a totally reasonable perfectly, maybe the best example of why they should have multiple size
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:12.500]  iPhones available. But why would you be Why would you have to sacrifice on the specs to get the
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.420]  bigger screen because you really want the bigger screen? It doesn't make any sense to me. Like to
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:22.260]  me, it makes the most sense to do it like the iPads, and have same specs across the line. And
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:26.340]  you know, different price points. But I don't even know if the price differential, you know,
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:32.100]  on the iPads makes sense. Why is the iPad mini so much cheaper? I don't know. Right. I guess the
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.740]  screens are I guess, at a certain point, you really just costs more to have a better screen
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:41.780]  and battery. I even if the pixels are the same, right? Yeah, because I mean, it needs a bigger
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:47.460]  screen physically, and it needs a bigger battery physically. So. So what are you hoping for? I've
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:52.340]  had Marco on talking about this. I've had you I'm so confused about this. I really don't see it
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.940]  where where this is how this is gonna play. I mean, like I said, I try not to think about
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.540]  this until they've actually announced it. And then I say, Okay, I've, that's the one I'm gonna get.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:05.700]  But I like I said, I don't want a bigger phone. I certainly don't want a five and 5.5 inch phone. As
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:09.620]  you said, you've tried a phone like that. I've used a phone like that. It's way too big. For
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:14.580]  my taste. It's really big. I can see why some people do. I can I can totally see why Apple
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.900]  would make it but I certainly don't. I don't think I want and you don't want to be forced
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:25.060]  into getting it almost because you want the top of the line phone as far as specs. Exactly. Right.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:32.740]  So yeah, I don't I, I'm hopeful that a relatively reasonable size physical size phone will exist
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:40.180]  with the high level specs. But you know, like I said, we'll see in the ace that the A8 which
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:46.100]  I mentioned a few times is maybe not even the best example of it because the the iPads have
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:52.340]  the a seven to this year, the two things that the iPhone five s has that no other iOS device has
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:58.020]  is it has a better camera touch ID, and as touch ID, and anything else they might introduce along
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.980]  those lines is going to be in the iPhone first because the iPhone has the mark the profit margins
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:07.700]  to support right the the top of the line and the camera, you know, for me personally, the camera
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:14.420]  is the most important thing. I would probably buy whichever iPhone has the best camera,
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:19.700]  even if it's the 5.5 inch. Well, if it was only the 5.5 inch, man, that would I don't know what
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:24.100]  I would do. Because I mean, the camera has gotten pretty good. Like I went from the I forget I went
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:29.620]  from like the iPhone one to the three g or three g s maybe. And the difference was enormous. But
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:35.780]  at this point, you can certainly see a difference, but it's pretty good already. You know what,
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:40.820]  you still see the difference indoors. Okay. outdoors. I don't know that I can Pepsi challenge
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:44.820]  it. But indoors, you can definitely still see the difference, especially you know, indoors in at
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:49.780]  night, you know, we're low, the low light situations, right? You can definitely I think
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.700]  I could easily tell the difference between a five and a five. Well, but it's not even just telling
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:59.220]  the difference. It's is the is the lower one. Pretty good and pretty acceptable.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:05.220]  Right. Well, and I still because I'm, you know, as I can add semi, you know, amateur camera
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:10.180]  enthusiast, and you know, I have cameras, you know, hot, you know, real cameras that
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:16.340]  have fancy lenses and high ISO. So I know what it's like to have a camera that can do really
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.460]  well in low light, you know, and I so I can see how much potential, you know, phone cameras still
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:27.220]  have to go and get to that point. Yeah. Right. It would honestly it would break it would truly
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:33.460]  break my heart if the 5.5 inch display is the only way to go top of the line. I just can't see how
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.660]  they would make such an enormous leap. Because I'll tell you what going from four inches to 5.5
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:44.260]  inches. It's huge is just it's just huge. It's it sounds like you're just talking about an inch
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:49.940]  and a half, but it's not. It's just a so much bigger device. I mean, it's, I think it's even
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:55.780]  bigger than like a Field Notes notebook. They're really, really big. And again, I can see why
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:00.100]  someone would want that I totally understand the idea of Hey, I just I want something right in the
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.340]  middle of a phone and a tablet because I'm going to use it all day long for these things. That's
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:10.340]  not what I want. Right. I just want something that's as small as possible, and not noticeable
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.580]  in my pocket until I want right. So I don't know, I really don't see how this is going to play out.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:23.140]  Let me take a third break here. Thank our final sponsor. And it's our great friends at Backblaze.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:30.420]  You guys know Backblaze they've been here before. Unlimited unthrottled backup for your Mac $5 a
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:38.340]  month for everything. Everything you just pay $5 a month. You install their software. Yeah, it does
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:43.860]  take a long time for your initial upload if you have a lot of data to get a good cabinet. I like
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:50.660]  that. Yeah, it's true. There's no magic. There's no way around it. If you've got, you know,
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:56.500]  terabytes of data, and you know, there's just no way to get that up there instantly. But it does
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.340]  work. I have a lot of data when I first signed up, it took a couple days, maybe even took a week for
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:05.460]  my initial upload. After that, everything's incremental. And it just works. They have over
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:11.540]  100 petabytes of total data backed up. I don't even know how big a petabyte is, but it's in
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:21.940]  over 5 billion files have been restored by users of Backblaze. In other words, not that they backed
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:26.980]  up 5 billion files, they've backed up way more than that. But 5 billion people who've needed
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:32.180]  to get their files restored from Backblaze have gotten them. They have an iOS app that lets you
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.100]  access and share any of your files. So if you're just on your iPhone, you need to get something
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:40.500]  from your Mac, you can just connect to Backblaze and get the version that was most recently backed
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:46.020]  up. You can restore one file. If you've just got one file, it's like, oh man, what happened to that
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:48.980]  thing? I got it. You know, here it is. It's corrupted on my Mac. I'm going to get it from
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:55.620]  Backblaze. Go get it. Or all of your files easily with their web restore. It's founded by ex-Apple
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:01.860]  engineers. Backblaze runs natively on your Mac and on Mavericks. There's no add-ons, no gimmicks,
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:08.020]  no additional charges. If you're here $5 a month and think it's just too good to be true, it's
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:12.500]  really, that's the deal. It's just fantastic. I've been telling you about it for months.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:17.380]  Can't believe all of you haven't signed up yet, but they keep coming back because people keep
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:22.020]  signing up. And if you've been on the fence, I can't encourage you to do it strongly enough.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.500]  It's great service. Just helps you sleep better at night, knowing your stuff is, everything on
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:34.420]  your Mac is backed up offsite out of your house. Where do you go to find out more? www.backblaze.com
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:40.820]  slash daring fireball. Backblaze.com slash daring fireball. If you haven't signed up yet,
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:47.860]  you're not too bad. You're just crazy. So bigger storage, more RAM. I agree with you on that. I
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:52.420]  don't know if we concluded on that, but I do think they should go more. And I think the way
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:57.380]  that people are shooting video, I think that it's essential. I know I've had family members come to
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:04.900]  me with iPhones that are filled up. Yeah. And it's because they shoot so many videos and photos. I
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:16.100]  think it's due. What else do we have on the agenda? So bigger iPhones. This is something
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.300]  I want to talk about last week when Guy was on. Just a small thing, but I don't know if you saw
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.860]  it. Did you see the State of the Union address? I haven't yet. As you said, I had to miss dub dub
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.820]  for a family matter, so I haven't caught up on all the videos yet. So the State of the Union is
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:34.740]  great. I recommend it for anybody who's only watched the keynote. I know that we're a couple
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.980]  weeks out from WWDC, but if you want to watch one more, I recommend the platform State of the Union.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.580]  It is always worth watching, especially as a developer. But in general, there's often stuff
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:46.020]  in there that you didn't hear about in the keynote, but that could have been in the keynote.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:50.420]  All right. And if you're nerdy enough to, even if you're not a developer, but if you're nerdy
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.860]  enough to listen to this podcast, you're absolutely in the target audience for the
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:58.660]  State of the Union. Because it's not super codey. It's not a lot of example code. It's
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:05.940]  at the level of the show, I think. But they give you details that they just cannot fit
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:11.140]  into the keynote or that they just don't want to put in the morning keynote. And the big one,
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:15.460]  it's such a tell, and it's so awkward. And like you said, where they've switched to this thing
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:20.020]  where they'll ship stuff at WWDC and software, and then the hardware that comes out later in
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:26.900]  the year, it's like, Oh, yeah, that's why they did that. Well, the stuff about multiple screen sizes
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:34.420]  is so it's so obvious, but they can't say, well, they won't. Anyway, right. Well, right. They're
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.660]  not going to say, Hey, we might be shipping iPhones with new pixel dimensions or new physical
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:48.500]  sizes. Or we might when we unveil the iPad later, new iPads later this year have a show a new
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.940]  feature where you can run two apps side by side. They just say like, Hey, you know, in theory,
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:31:00.180]  you might you might want to support these new they call it adaptive apps. And it's sort of like
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.340]  responsive, what responsive layout is to web design, right where it works at whatever,
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:09.380]  whatever the screen size is, it'll still work and look as if it was made natively for that size.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:16.980]  Right. And that they're switching from a model where there are two sizes you need to worry about
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:25.140]  iPhone size, and iPad size, and horizontal and vertical layout. And then a little asterisk for
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:29.860]  iPhone because there's still older ones that have a 3.5 inch instead of a four inch, but they really
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:34.660]  just added pixels to the top, they didn't really create a new everything stayed exactly the same
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:42.260]  size, they just just got taller, just got taller. They're switching to a system where there's these
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:49.140]  one third width, half width, full width, two thirds width, and you know, like the iPhone is
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:54.820]  considered a one third width. And so it just seems pretty like without saying, Hey, we might do this,
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:32:00.260]  they're telling you that your apps, it's, you watch the everybody should watch the State of the
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:04.820]  Union. And they talk about this. And it's, it's interesting, both in terms of thinking about how
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:09.220]  it might work as a, you know, user and developer and how it might, you know, but it's also
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:14.500]  interesting, as anybody who's ever spoken publicly or is careful with their words to look at the
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.980]  contortions that they're jumping through. Yeah, it's and they do it pretty well. But you can,
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:24.980]  it's so hard. It's, it'll make you laugh. It's really kind of funny. And I almost feel bad for
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.500]  him. And then there's a whole session. I haven't actually watched it yet. But it's building
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:35.860]  adaptive apps with UI kit session 216. And the thing that's interesting, too. And I still feel
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.180]  like this hasn't really gotten through to everybody yet. There's no NDA this year, right?
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:48.340]  Like, everybody can just go to developer.apple.com. Or just Google WWDC 2014 videos, it's easier, but
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:54.820]  it's slash videos slash WWDC slash 2014. And they have all the videos from WWDC. And you don't even
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:59.860]  need an ADC account, you don't have to log in, you just click the video you want and start watching
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:03.460]  it. So everybody, you don't even have to sign up for a developer account, you can just go watch
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:09.940]  session 216. And talk and see them talk about it. Yeah, I had a note that I wanted to mention that
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:16.180]  it's interesting. It's interesting that the NDA has been lifted on all of this. And they just
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:24.180]  before the conference talked about how there can be access to betas of the OS. But as a developer,
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:32.100]  it's tremendously annoying to have even more people running a beta OS. That's interesting.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:37.140]  That's interesting. That's I, you know, I that occurred to me, and it's
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:47.140]  yeah, I thought about that. But as my personal interest as a developer at Q branch, we're still
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:55.460]  iOS only. And iOS is not having a public beta. Whereas at Rogue Amoeba, you guys are almost all
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.660]  Mac. And or is it all Mac? I have something for them. But it's but for the most part,
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.460]  though, the company is a Mac company with it with some toes dipped in the iOS pool.
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:11.380]  And now you guys are gonna have people running the public beta of yo seven, right. And, and
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:17.460]  people always did this, who I don't want to say shouldn't have but you know, didn't necessarily
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:23.620]  need to. And it was always a little bit of a struggle because, you know, we'd have to say,
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:28.500]  we're not there yet, we're working on it. But if you need your stuff to work on a daily basis,
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:32.260]  don't run a beta OS. I mean, that's just good advice in general, right?
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.020]  Yeah, it's definitely good advice. And anybody out there who's thinking about participating in
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:43.220]  the Yosemite public beta, you know, was right. I mean, if you not, we're I'm not saying don't
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:47.540]  do it. I'm saying no, you've got to take responsibility. That's exactly it. And and
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.780]  you've got to take responsibility for what and the more people that are doing it, the more emails
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.460]  we're going to get that say, you know, this isn't working, whatever. And we want to support these
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:00.980]  people as soon as we can. But we also have limited resources. And, and so I don't know if this,
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.820]  I don't know if this will help Apple or not, because I think they had pretty good testing,
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:10.420]  both internally and from developers in previous years. So I'm not really sure what they're
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.340]  striving for with this sort of change to opening it up a little bit more.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:21.860]  In theory, if there's something stupid, simple, that's like, really just like a line of code,
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:26.660]  and it do you know what it is that this thing, we could do this, and maybe we'll ship a point
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:34.260]  one update. And it'll make things run better on Yosemite public beta. Sure, you might do that you
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:39.780]  could do that it just in a way that you even if there was no public beta might roll out.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.900]  But updates of your apps over summer, if you can work one in that does make things better under
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.260]  Yosemite, you'll do it, you might have done it anyway, because it'll help you because you'll
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:56.260]  be running it. But you can't run your company. You can't support a beta operating system.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.860]  And that's exactly it. And so like I said, I don't know what Apple is hoping to accomplish
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:04.740]  with this. And I hope they do get something out of it. But it's definitely frustrating for us as as
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:09.700]  developers. Because ideally, you're going to want to you're going to want to support Yosemite either
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:14.820]  when it officially ships out of beta or soon thereafter, all of your possible, right?
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:20.180]  All right, day one, if possible, if not as soon afterwards as possible. But that's because once
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:24.900]  it's out of beta, it's a stable target. That's the thing. Yeah, that's the thing to you make
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:30.500]  a great point there that right now it's completely all over the map. And things can change drastically
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:36.420]  between releases. And trying to track every single one of those changes across weekly or monthly
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:42.660]  releases before it's in the public's hands is not a good way to run a company. Right? It's you can't
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:48.180]  target a moving target. Well, you could you can try to force you, you'll end up wasting time.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:52.580]  You know, and it could be something like a cosmetic bug. Like, you know, this doesn't
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:59.220]  look good, because it's doesn't render well on the transparent, such and such. And it ends up by the
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:03.380]  time it ships. It's no longer even transparent, because they've changed. And you spent time
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:10.820]  fixing it for two weeks worth of. Right? Yeah. So anyway, and you cannot do it. And again, I've been
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:14.980]  there like, but even way back when I was at bare bones, we went through it with BB edit on the
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:22.820]  public beta of Mac OS X. Well, but I mean, that are you talking pre 10.0, the actual public betas
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:30.420]  then? Because those were actually almost releases. That's probably a bad example. Because I think we
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:35.940]  only had the only way we only had the native carbon version of BB edit was internally beta
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:40.980]  tested. We didn't have a public beta of that. So but there I remember though, being at bare bones,
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:45.940]  though, maybe not the 10.0, but like 10.1 and 10.2. And all you know, even before that, even the
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:52.260]  betas of Mac OS 9, you know, that the various updates to it that we'd get bug reports from
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:57.300]  people who were running it. And it's like, thanks for filing the bug. We do appreciate that report
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:03.140]  the bug. But don't you don't expect us to have this fixed on the schedule that we would for a
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:08.900]  similar bug on a shipping version of that. Yeah, that's exactly it. Right. Anyway, yeah,
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:12.980]  that's interesting. I'm interested to see how that aspect of it plays out and how popular the public
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:17.380]  beta. Well, I should, you know, I mentioned this, but I should say it hasn't been a huge issue. It's
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:21.780]  not as if we've seen an influx of people running this who shouldn't be or you know, ah, but they
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:27.860]  haven't started the public beta yet. For Yosemite, there's none right now at all. I don't Okay. Am I
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:31.780]  wrong? Well, then I guess we'll see. If I'm like I said, I'm sort of out of it as far as dub dub
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:38.020]  goes. You'll know in the next episode of the talk show, if I start by apologizing, I'm nearly certain
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:41.380]  that the public beta hasn't started. You may well be right. I mean, I'm running it on one of my
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:46.180]  machines. But that doesn't mean you know, I got it from the developers area. Yeah, my hope is that
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.940]  they're waiting for a significantly better I think that the two betas are actually pretty good for
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:57.780]  June. Right. You know, both iOS eight and Yosemite. I've got machines. I've got devices running both
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:04.100]  here. And they're both pretty good for June betas, especially compared to past years. Yeah, past
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:08.420]  years, the June ones have usually been unused, right? You know, it's like, I'll come back to it
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:12.100]  in mid July when they've got it to me, they seem like they're ahead of where they've been the past
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.900]  years, but they're, I wouldn't recommend them to anybody to depend on in either No, and there's
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:21.780]  an a big thing is that a lot of a lot of the time, the features that they've talked about aren't in
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:27.060]  there yet. Yes, that's absolutely you want to run these and see like, oh, they talked about this new
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:30.420]  stuff, I want to see it. And then you if you install it, you're not actually going to see it
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:36.100]  for another month, because it's not there yet. So, so I don't know, I'm optimistic that they're,
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.660]  I'm curious about it, though, because it does seem it does seem to be of a piece with this whole,
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:46.580]  like opening up of Apple, you know, that they're a little bit, you know, not in a radical departure,
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.740]  but in a slight shift, of course, you know, Angela orange had a LinkedIn blog post yesterday
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:59.220]  on what it's like to be starting a new job at a new company. It wasn't particularly revealing,
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.980]  you know, that was, you know, right. And it was, you know, there were no secrets,
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:08.660]  there's nothing gossipy or shocking or notable, it was, you know, well written and interesting.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:13.940]  It's an interesting perspective. But the thing that's most interesting is that a senior vice
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:20.180]  president at Apple posted a, here's what I'm up to on LinkedIn, right, which is never happened,
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:26.580]  right. Not just LinkedIn, but on any kind of social network or blog or anything.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.940]  Well, besides when Steve Jobs was blogging on apple.com.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:35.940]  Yeah, but even then it wasn't personal. It was, right. It was like two times in the
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:40.340]  entire history of Apple, Steve Jobs wrote, you know, here's something, you know, here's
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:46.820]  something you've bastard made me actually address. Thoughts on music and then thoughts on flash.
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:51.300]  That's right. That was the other one, flash. Yeah. How'd that work out? We have flash on
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:58.020]  the iPhone yet? You know, there's people that, somebody emailed me about that the other day,
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:02.580]  some reader wanted me to do like a claim child roundup on mobile flash because the people who
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:07.940]  were adamant that it was, it could never be a success without it. Right. Seemed to have
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:15.460]  conveniently lost their, lost their interest in the cause. Right. No, I don't believe so.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.700]  I'm more curious. Are there any devices you can go out and buy today that have that do have flash,
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:24.660]  right? Do the Android, do current Android devices have it or. Right. I don't think so. I think you'd
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:29.620]  have to buy like a super low end Android phone. That's running an ancient version of Android,
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:34.100]  you know, to get it like a two point something version. I don't think Android supported it
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:40.820]  and the entire 4.0 versions and at 4.0 is a couple years old. Yeah. Everybody's given up on it.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:44.260]  All right. I don't even know if Blackberry still supports it. They just had some new phones,
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:51.540]  didn't they? Yeah. It's funny. It's funny how hard it is for a company to actually like the,
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:56.580]  the, the, the candle to actually go out. Right. Right. Well, it's like, uh, do you remember the,
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:05.220]  uh, the load SIS like, uh, lawsuits against Unix and Linux. This is, this is, they were suing,
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:10.100]  uh, Linux and maybe Unix. I forget what the deal was. They, they, they owned some piece of Unix
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:15.620]  and therefore were suing Linux, I think was the deal. And these lawsuits went on for like a decade
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:20.740]  and they kept losing them, but they kept filing them. And, uh, it was always a concern that,
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:26.820]  you know, this was going to impact something like, uh, Android where it's actually, even if it's not
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.900]  true Linux, it's, it's built around it. And if this, if one of these lawsuits was successful,
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:36.020]  suddenly somebody might be taking a huge chunk of money out of some big company. Uh, and, and yeah,
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:40.580]  anyway, the point was that it took over a decade, I think, before they, as you said,
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:43.700]  the candle finally went out and they finally gave up and said, all right, we're done.
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.540]  Uh, and it's a similar thing with Blackberry where the company is just limping along. And
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:53.300]  I mean, they must've had some money in the bank too, the way Apple does not, not to that extent,
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:59.140]  but yeah, I guess so. I don't know. It's just, it's, I don't know. I expected something
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:03.780]  spectacular to have happened by now either like we're out, we're turning out the lights and we're,
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:09.060]  we've sold our, I, you know, the way I expected to go is we've sold ourselves to, I don't know,
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:15.460]  LG or HTC or I don't know, some, somebody like that we've sold ourselves to, and now
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:18.020]  Blackberry is just a name that's owned by this other company.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.220]  Like Napster got sold a couple of times that way.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:24.580]  Yeah, but it hasn't happened yet. And yet they're, you know, like you said,
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:29.060]  they're still coming out with new phones and it's like, I feel sorry for them. I don't know,
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:33.940]  anybody who's still left. They don't look terrible. They look, but they don't look at
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:39.220]  the least bit competitive with everything else that's going on. Or Palm, you know, right? Like
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:44.020]  Palm just disappeared, you know, it's like, I've ever thought something would have happened by now,
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.300]  you know, that Blackberry is going to, you know, either disappear or sold.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.980]  Palm got bought by HP, right?
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:54.900]  Yeah. I think that's, I know HPA wound up with them at some point because the, the, the
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.380]  tablet size ones were HP devices. What were they called? The touch pad?
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:05.060]  Yeah, I think that's right. But yeah, Blackberry is limping along still. And that was the thing.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.420]  I was, I was surprised to see this announcement. I think it was this week or last week. And
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.420]  I haven't even looked at the phones, but I, I I've never been interested, but it's
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.740]  interesting that they're still able to put something out.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.620]  Yeah, but I don't, you know, you never, just walking around the city and never see
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:24.180]  Blackberry posters in the carrier stores anymore or anything. It's, you know, it's almost like,
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:27.140]  it's almost like they're not there. I mean, I'm sure you can go in and buy one, but
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.020]  I don't know. I would guess that most of the ones that are still being sold are like the
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:36.100]  old style ones, not the new. With the keyboard versus the touch screen, you mean?
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.380]  Yeah. Right. The ones that, you know, people who are just Blackberry diehards,
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:44.340]  who've just skipped out on the whole iOS Android type computing thing and still just,
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.500]  they just want a replacement for the Blackberry that they have.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:51.220]  Right. Right. Which isn't unreasonable. It's not a good business going forward, but it's.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:55.060]  No, but if you have something that works and then it eventually breaks because it's been five years,
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.740]  you may well want the exact same thing.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:02.580]  Right. I totally understand that mindset. I mean, I personally, obviously don't, you know,
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:06.660]  when it comes to phones, I don't feel that way, but there's other things in my life that if,
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.660]  if it breaks, I just want to buy the exact same thing.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.860]  Goddamn keyboard, John.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:15.620]  Exactly. My keyboard, I have the same, I've bought like four or five pairs of the same sneakers.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.100]  Okay.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.940]  You know, I don't care what the new sneakers are. Just give me a new pair of
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.780]  the Samba Millennium.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:22.260]  Right. Right.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:27.460]  Or whatever they're called. All right. I think that's it for my list this week. Good show.
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.540]  All right. Well, I got, I got one more for you. Can you give me.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:30.660]  You got a topic? You got something?
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:36.740]  I do have one more that, and this is, this is important to me. Did you see, it was last week,
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.220]  did you see the announcement of these new emoji?
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:44.580]  Emoji? No. Oh, no, I didn't. I saw that there were, but I didn't see what was.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:50.020]  Okay. Well, so, so there's two things actually iOS eight makes, uh, it promotes emoji to like a top
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:55.220]  level keyboard now. So instead of, by default, it used to be, you had to turn on the emoji keyboard.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:57.220]  Oh, right. Yeah.
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:00.820]  Now iOS eight has it there by default for everybody, which is actually a little bit
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:05.700]  interesting because it indicates Apple feels this is part of the culture now the same way,
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:10.580]  like punctuation is almost. So I thought, I thought that was kind of interesting, but.
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.620]  Right. There's a smiley button.
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:14.740]  That's exactly it. Instead of hitting the globe and pulling up other keyboards,
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:20.100]  you just hit the smiley button basically. Uh, but yeah, so last week, uh, the standard got
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:28.020]  released for like 240, 250 new emoji. And the way that it works is that each platform, Apple,
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:34.500]  Android, Twitter has to then create illustrations for this and make it part of their OS or part of
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:40.180]  their platform. And I wrote about this today, but the, the, the one that I'm very excited about,
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.620]  and I'm a little worried about is there is now going to be a middle finger emoji.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:51.380]  There is a, I forget the exact name, but it's, it's hand with middle finger raised. Uh, you know,
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:59.460]  they have longer names. I I'm looking at your website now. Yeah. So it's, uh, what's it called?
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.780]  Reversed hand with middle finger extended. And it's, it's, you know, it's a hand flipping the
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:12.500]  bird. Uh, now my concern though, and this is a question for you, is Apple going to include this?
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:18.660]  Oh, now that's a fascinating question. This is why, this is why you put Paul
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:22.260]  Kufasas on your, on your show. That's a damn good question, Paul.
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:28.580]  Because Apple, you know, they've got the pile of poo in there, but at the same time,
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:32.820]  their app store is, is fairly restrictive. There's no pornography in there. There's no,
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:41.300]  uh, risque content is pile of food is the, is the emoji emoji description pile.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:45.300]  That is the actual name of it. Yeah. If you look in the Unicode table, it's called pile of poo.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:51.220]  So, and so there's no, no reason that you would have to turn it into a googly eyed smiley face.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.380]  No, it's not happy face. It's not happy pile of poo. It's not smiley pile of poo. It's literally
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:01.860]  just pile of poo. It could be an ugly rank smelly with flies buzzing around it.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:06.820]  Yeah. Like little, little, little stink rays coming out of it, pile of poo. And instead
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:12.740]  it's a very, very happy, you know, you're, you're, uh, your doctor is going to be very
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:17.300]  happy with your school. It looks like this guy. Yeah. Yeah. You're eating well. You're
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.700]  taking care of yourself, you know? But so the, the thing is that, you know,
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:26.820]  they're restrictive in some regards and then not in others, but this is a standard. Uh,
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.900]  and they, the, the, what's interesting is that they were talking a couple months ago about
[01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:35.780]  introducing diversity into the emoji and they wanted to have, basically there's a whole lot
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:40.980]  of white people in the emoji, which is interesting because it comes from Japan. So it's a little
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:46.740]  strange, but Apple said, you know, we want to have other, other races represented in there.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:51.940]  And they said they might just do it themselves. And they can take, instead of like smiling elderly
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:59.140]  person, they can make that a smiling elderly person of a different race. Uh, so I don't know,
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:04.980]  you know, they have the authority on their own platforms to make this not quite a middle finger,
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:09.460]  I think. And I'm worried that I'm going to have to switch to Android if this happens.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:18.100]  Reversed hand with middle finger extended. Well, I mean, can you make, can you draw that in a way
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:22.100]  that follows that guideline without it being a middle finger? Yeah. Well, look at that. You're
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:30.420]  obviously not an emoji lawyer as I am. I actually have a JD in emoji law. Uh, so reversed hand,
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:35.380]  you do need to show the back of the hand. The middle finger extended does need to be extended,
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:39.140]  but there's no reason you couldn't have another. That's exactly it. Like you toss up another
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:44.100]  finger and it's, it's not incorrect. And then suddenly I'm not flipping somebody the bird.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:50.660]  I'm giving them a peace sign. Right. Right. Yeah, exactly. Or, or a Spock sign. No, that,
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:55.460]  that is one of the new ones. That's it. I saw that one in there. The, uh, what did I call that? The
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:01.380]  Vulcan symbol. Yeah. That's already, that's already in there. I feel like you could
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.780]  officially comply with the description by putting another finger up there. I'm worried. I'm worried,
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:12.020]  John. That's a good question. They got to do the right thing here. They got to give me the
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:20.660]  middle finger. Yeah. You know, it would be, it would be, it would, it would fit with, uh, it
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.220]  wouldn't comply with the description at all, but it would fit with previous frustrations
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:34.500]  with similar curse words in, in prose. If they just replaced it with a picture of a duck.
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:42.340]  Right. Right. Right. You would go to insert this emoji and you'd get a duck.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:48.740]  Nice. That's my guess. My guess is they're just going to put a picture of a duck.
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.700]  Son of a bitch. We'll see. I'm hopeful.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:58.020]  This is great. Now I'm on pins and needles to see how this turns out. It could be months. We don't
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:01.700]  know. Cause the way the standard works, you know, it gets announced and then they implement it over
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:06.900]  time. So I don't know if it'll be part of iOS eight or iOS nine, but I'm, I'm eager to see it.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:11.220]  And I hope we get what we're, what we deserve. Yeah. Do you know if there was there any
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:18.500]  controversy over this? You know, I, I didn't, not that I saw, uh, it, it's a standards body that,
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:24.100]  uh, you know, the, the, the companies that comply to the standards still have a lot of
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:30.100]  leeway rather. So if you look, you know, things look different on different platforms. So, uh,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.700]  yeah, I'm going to go with, no, I think they're not going to do it. I mean, they did pile of poo
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:38.180]  though. I wonder, would there be a way that they would add a parental control that you
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:42.980]  can't emoji keyboard? Right. Well, but the thing is that if you don't know what it means,
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.380]  then it's just a middle finger sticking up. Right. I mean, it's not,
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:49.780]  do they have other fingers? Can you get every single finger of the hand?
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:54.260]  I mean, there's already pointing fingers, like pointing with the pointer finger and,
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:58.420]  and up and down. And, uh, I don't know if there's one for every finger. I don't think there is,
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:03.860]  uh, but I mean, like you could just tell your kid, this is, this means one. Like,
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.740]  I mean, that's probably a bad lesson to teach your kid, I guess.
