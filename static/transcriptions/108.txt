[00:00.000 --> 00:02.100]  What time you got? What do you got? What are you 11 o'clock?
[00:02.640 --> 00:04.560]  12 21 a.m. Oh my God.
[00:04.560 --> 00:06.200]  Are you serious? Is this going to be all right?
[00:06.200 --> 00:09.000]  Yeah. No, I I have it down to science.
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.600]  I took a shower, then I weighed down for a 20 minute nap,
[00:12.600 --> 00:15.460]  and then I drink up coffee and then I will calm myself down
[00:15.460 --> 00:18.440]  with a couple of beers during the conversation. Sounds good.
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.740]  No, I'm good. Don't worry about it.
[00:24.740 --> 00:29.300]  OK. Although although we had we had we had a nice like home Korean barbecue
[00:29.300 --> 00:34.240]  over at the the in-laws place, of course.
[00:34.240 --> 00:37.200]  And she's like my mother in law is like a huge whiskey fan.
[00:38.060 --> 00:39.400]  So she always has really good stuff.
[00:39.400 --> 00:43.760]  But I limited myself to to us to a single a single serving.
[00:44.960 --> 00:47.600]  So you owe me one.
[00:47.700 --> 00:51.600]  I do. That's that's a steep price to pay to be a guest on the show.
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.340]  I forgot I have you set up.
[00:53.340 --> 00:55.800]  I have Taipei set up in my today view.
[00:55.840 --> 00:57.460]  I could I didn't need to ask you what time it was.
[00:57.460 --> 01:01.240]  I could have just opened today, my world clock.
[01:02.540 --> 01:05.340]  I guess that that says enough about today.
[01:05.340 --> 01:10.000]  You know what? I think the problem is that I usually I really only open
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.040]  that thing up for it's kind of weird to have that be today and notifications.
[01:14.040 --> 01:16.900]  Like I understand why they grouped it together that way.
[01:16.900 --> 01:20.200]  But I think in practice, it's weird because it's one
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.960]  or the other is always two steps away instead of one step away.
[01:23.840 --> 01:26.140]  Yeah. And yeah, I agree.
[01:26.140 --> 01:28.600]  I don't know. I never click on today either.
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.040]  I'm looking at like it actually took me a couple of seconds
[01:31.040 --> 01:33.000]  to remember what you were talking about when you said today.
[01:34.540 --> 01:37.100]  It's I use it for notifications only.
[01:37.100 --> 01:39.800]  And I don't know. I guess that's kind of true on both OSes,
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.940]  although I was talking about the Mac, not iOS, but it's kind of true
[01:43.940 --> 01:49.700]  on both OSes where I've always got it on notifications, not today.
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.040]  Yeah. No, it's well, it's interesting because.
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.780]  I don't know, you could almost see that as being being a shift, right?
[01:58.780 --> 02:04.020]  Like, I mean, almost with everything is is more almost responsive in real time,
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.340]  whereas today, that's like that's like a plan.
[02:06.340 --> 02:09.980]  And I know maybe we're hardly authorities to talk about
[02:10.520 --> 02:14.020]  having a set schedule and marching through the day.
[02:14.020 --> 02:15.920]  So we're probably outliers.
[02:15.920 --> 02:18.380]  Yeah, I've seen some people who've wanted who've requested
[02:18.380 --> 02:21.140]  they wish that there was a way to make, at least on the Mac.
[02:21.740 --> 02:23.580]  I think only on the Mac, it wouldn't make sense on iOS.
[02:23.580 --> 02:27.180]  But on the Mac that they could make that persistent and like just say,
[02:27.180 --> 02:29.880]  like, take those two inches on the right side of my screen
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.580]  and just always make it today.
[02:31.580 --> 02:35.020]  And, you know, I've got a big 30 inch iMac here or something, you know, a big
[02:35.940 --> 02:37.220]  thunderbolt display.
[02:37.220 --> 02:38.440]  I don't need the whole screen for this.
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.340]  Just treat my screen as what's left and give me that today view over there.
[02:42.340 --> 02:44.920]  So I've got like a permanent agenda.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.540]  Oh, no, totally.
[02:45.540 --> 02:50.080]  I did something similar to that when I'm like when I was at Microsoft
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.020]  and Windows eight and you can mix like the regular desktop and then like
[02:54.580 --> 02:57.940]  Windows eight apps and like a in like a sliver on the side of the screen.
[02:58.180 --> 03:01.240]  And so I put my calendar there for that exact reason.
[03:01.540 --> 03:04.320]  It was it that it worked out perfectly.
[03:04.320 --> 03:06.040]  And then I just had a quick view of what's going on.
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.080]  And people have done that.
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.440]  People have done that virtually or in a mismatch of digital and analog
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.280]  for as long as they've been using computers in their office.
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.920]  If you think about like sticky notes on the side of a monitor.
[03:18.920 --> 03:20.620]  Oh, no, totally, totally.
[03:20.620 --> 03:23.860]  And I think that's that's something that's like, what was that?
[03:23.860 --> 03:26.820]  Were you talking linked to this, like there's like that new accessory
[03:26.820 --> 03:30.920]  for like an iPad where you can actually like have it as a secondary display
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.720]  or whatever to me, the the the case, if you have an iPad, your desk is just
[03:35.720 --> 03:39.220]  yeah, just have you have have it there for your calendar and stuff like that.
[03:39.220 --> 03:41.720]  I mean, it's yeah, I didn't link to that.
[03:41.720 --> 03:44.020]  I know which one I forget the name of the thing you're talking about,
[03:44.020 --> 03:45.520]  but I know exactly what you're talking about.
[03:45.520 --> 03:47.720]  And I've been looking at I've been thinking about trying that out.
[03:47.720 --> 03:49.520]  But I wouldn't use it again.
[03:49.520 --> 03:55.420]  I would not use it as a like a I wouldn't put an app over there, any app.
[03:55.420 --> 03:58.020]  But I could I would think about using it exactly like you said,
[03:58.020 --> 04:01.220]  like as a sort of like a paste board.
[04:01.220 --> 04:03.220]  I don't know, like a bulletin board.
[04:03.220 --> 04:07.020]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a I'm a screen maven.
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.020]  So I have I mean, I have I have three screens on my desk, so
[04:11.120 --> 04:13.220]  I don't know if I even have room for an iPad.
[04:13.220 --> 04:14.520]  Yeah. What's the name of that thing?
[04:14.520 --> 04:17.220]  Is it reflector or is that a different thing?
[04:17.220 --> 04:22.420]  No, I think I want to say sort of an L, but I'm that might be totally making that up.
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.620]  But the idea is, I think it was built by a former Apple guy or something.
[04:25.620 --> 04:29.020]  So it like and apparently it actually it actually works quite well.
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.720]  Air display duet, duet, duet.
[04:35.720 --> 04:38.520]  I think that's it. Duet display.
[04:38.520 --> 04:42.920]  Yeah, there we go. I will put it in the show notes.
[04:42.920 --> 04:45.420]  We'll look at it for next week.
[04:45.420 --> 04:48.220]  Yeah. First, first, yeah.
[04:48.220 --> 04:49.520]  First, good response. Duet display.
[04:49.520 --> 04:51.620]  X Apple engineers turn your iPad into an extra screen.
[04:51.620 --> 04:57.020]  So they and that that's their that's actually their their page title for Google.
[04:57.020 --> 05:00.920]  So they're definitely playing up the the X Apple engineer angle.
[05:00.920 --> 05:03.920]  So effectively, because that's that's what I remembered.
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.920]  That's interesting. I wonder I wonder how that plays at the company.
[05:08.920 --> 05:13.220]  Because the other thing, too, is that part of the reason
[05:13.220 --> 05:18.020]  that very few former Apple engineers or,
[05:18.020 --> 05:22.620]  you know, people at any, you know, who've had any kind of involvement managers, too.
[05:22.620 --> 05:24.220]  They don't talk about their experience at Apple,
[05:24.220 --> 05:28.120]  even when they leave is because so many of them go back and they know.
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.220]  Yeah, it's like a revolving door, right?
[05:31.220 --> 05:40.420]  It's like Steve Joe, one of the things Steve Jobs did when when when he came back to the company is get rid of the sabbatical program.
[05:40.420 --> 05:41.820]  There used to be I forget how many years,
[05:41.820 --> 05:46.920]  but every five years you got like a couple of months sabbatical.
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.220]  And he got rid of that because, you know, I forget various reasons.
[05:51.220 --> 05:54.420]  But one of them was that an awful lot of the time people would take a sabbatical
[05:54.420 --> 05:57.320]  and then at the end of the sabbatical, they'd quit.
[05:57.320 --> 06:02.220]  But there's sort of a de facto sabbatical where if you feel burned out, you just quit.
[06:02.220 --> 06:05.320]  You can leave. And, you know, as long as you're on good terms,
[06:05.320 --> 06:10.520]  it's like the easiest way to get a job at Apple is to have been a successful Apple employee before.
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.120]  I can't tell you how many people I know who've left and come back within sometimes a year.
[06:15.120 --> 06:18.220]  Sometimes it's actually pretty quick, sometimes three, four years, but they do.
[06:18.220 --> 06:24.220]  But one of the things you could do that would ruin that would be to, you know.
[06:24.220 --> 06:27.620]  You know, blab about the company in the interim. Yeah, no, totally.
[06:27.620 --> 06:31.920]  No, it's a very like at this point, it's I mean, everyone kind of knows about it.
[06:31.920 --> 06:39.320]  And I think even Apple internally like they they it's all it's like it's totally accepted.
[06:39.320 --> 06:42.320]  And and kind of the assumption, yeah, you get burned out.
[06:42.320 --> 06:48.420]  Yeah, only at Apple do you get burned out and go work at a startup to relax and you come back.
[06:48.420 --> 06:55.620]  Right. Gives you an idea of what the what the what the pace and expectations are.
[06:55.620 --> 07:01.020]  Yeah, but it is, you know, it's a better I think it's, you know, it's an interesting way to do sabbaticals.
[07:01.020 --> 07:05.920]  Quit. Come back. Yeah, I mean, it works for them.
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.320]  I'm not sure that it's something that other companies want to adopt as a as a policy.
[07:10.320 --> 07:16.320]  Yeah. Did Microsoft have a sabbatical policy? I don't think so.
[07:16.320 --> 07:23.020]  At least not that not that I remember. I mean, I wasn't I wasn't really there long enough to to have it matter for me.
[07:23.020 --> 07:27.220]  But I've heard of people taking sabbaticals, but I don't think it was like a formal thing.
[07:27.220 --> 07:29.420]  I think those things where if you're you know, if you're in good standing
[07:29.420 --> 07:35.120]  and the other thing with Microsoft is in part because of of where they're located.
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.920]  I mean, there are more and more, you know, tech jobs in Seattle and the startups and stuff.
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.420]  But in general, it's more of a big company talent with Microsoft and Amazon
[07:44.420 --> 07:48.320]  and no one from Microsoft wants to work at Amazon for the most part
[07:48.320 --> 07:54.520]  because, you know, everyone thinks that, you know, they work insane hours and don't get paid anything.
[07:54.520 --> 07:57.020]  So it's kind of a plus and minus for Microsoft.
[07:57.020 --> 08:00.220]  It's a plus in that like there's still a lot of really good employees there.
[08:00.220 --> 08:05.420]  Whereas if they had been the valley, like you take them like HP or Yahoo, especially before Marissa American back
[08:05.420 --> 08:11.520]  and they just lost they lost so many people, you know, it just like how do you come back from that?
[08:11.520 --> 08:17.920]  Whereas Microsoft, I think one of the advantage of being there is that they there's still a lot of like really strong people there.
[08:17.920 --> 08:20.920]  It's a disadvantage, though, because you get people that are just kind of there
[08:20.920 --> 08:24.720]  and they're not particularly pleased with being there and they're kind of a drag.
[08:24.720 --> 08:32.320]  So it cuts both ways. But I think I do recall people, you know, taking some time off and, you know,
[08:32.320 --> 08:38.120]  it being OK because they're valuable employees and, you know, people appreciate that.
[08:38.120 --> 08:41.720]  Sometimes you need to unplug for a bit. It used to be.
[08:41.720 --> 08:48.220]  I mean, this is ancient history, but it was, you know, when I was getting out of college in 96,
[08:48.220 --> 08:57.820]  I mean, Microsoft was, I don't know, notorious, infamous, famous for being like the hardest place in the world to get hired.
[08:57.820 --> 09:03.220]  It was, you know, that was the play. I think they practically invented the sort of gimmicky,
[09:03.220 --> 09:08.020]  you know, you know, off the top of your head, how many marbles would fit in a,
[09:08.020 --> 09:13.420]  you know, beer barrel or a Volkswagen bug type of interview question?
[09:13.420 --> 09:19.820]  Why is a manhole cover around? And yep, and and also but tough,
[09:19.820 --> 09:28.720]  like whiteboarding questions, too, for programmers. Yeah, I think that that's probably I mean,
[09:28.720 --> 09:32.520]  any company that's on top, I mean, it shifted to Google, right?
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.520]  And it's, you know, some people have the nature or they want to like get on the next big thing.
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.320]  But for a lot of people, the idea of being at the market leader and knowing,
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.320]  you know, that that's that's attracted a lot of people.
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.820]  And those people are valuable, too, because you need those are the kind of folks that kind of provide long term stability.
[09:49.820 --> 09:52.220]  Because, you know, once once they're set, they're set. I mean,
[09:52.220 --> 09:55.320]  you do need the people that are willing to take risks and push forward.
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.420]  But it's always a balance. And it can create a certain arrogance,
[09:59.420 --> 10:04.920]  though, like an institutional arrogance, because the gist of it is then it creates this it created a culture,
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.620]  I think, where the assumption was any you have to be really smart to work at Microsoft.
[10:09.620 --> 10:14.120]  And and therefore, everybody here is like the smartest people in the world.
[10:14.120 --> 10:23.920]  And at the time, Microsoft had this extraordinary success that seemed to back up the idea that the company was staffed with all of the best programmers in the world.
[10:23.920 --> 10:29.820]  Absolutely. No, it's definitely a problem. And it and you get it's a problem on a few levels.
[10:29.820 --> 10:39.220]  One, you definitely get arrogance or arrogant to it also kind of breeds a little bit of a bad culture in that.
[10:39.220 --> 10:45.820]  Everyone, everyone is all it's like the first time a lot of these people have gotten to a place where they're not for sure the smartest person in the room.
[10:45.820 --> 10:49.820]  And so everyone's very eager to show that they are the smartest person in the room.
[10:49.820 --> 10:58.020]  And like people trying to show that they're smart is not conducive to, you know, collaborative, collaborative work or, you know,
[10:58.020 --> 11:04.620]  it is conducive to having a very dog eat dog sort of culture, which Microsoft is very famous for.
[11:04.620 --> 11:09.020]  And and I think that's that's probably plays into it.
[11:09.020 --> 11:13.820]  Yeah, I think Google is the inheritor of that. I do.
[11:13.820 --> 11:18.420]  Well, I mean, Google is so much like Microsoft. I mean, just in so many respects.
[11:18.420 --> 11:22.320]  I mean, I've written from just from a big picture, like strategic perspective.
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.320]  I think that they're there right now in a place similar to Microsoft, you know, around around 2000.
[11:27.320 --> 11:36.120]  Obviously, that's somewhat controversial, but not even that, but just the way they hire, the way they the way they treat employees, their status in the valley, the way people look at them.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.720]  I mean, for sure, they're the inheritor, even the even.
[11:39.720 --> 11:44.920]  And I think you can agree with that, even if you like Google and hate Microsoft or vice versa.
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.020]  And it's just a function of being kind of the big dog.
[11:48.020 --> 11:52.120]  And like, of course, Apple is is the biggest, quote unquote, from market perspective.
[11:52.120 --> 11:58.020]  But they've always Apple's always been very it's apples of the valley, but they're separate from the valley.
[11:58.020 --> 12:04.920]  Like all the startups and all the people like all look towards Google and people bottoms after that, just as they previously did Microsoft.
[12:04.920 --> 12:11.520]  And Apple's always been kind of a bit of an aberration from a cultural perspective, from a product development perspective.
[12:11.520 --> 12:14.820]  And obviously, you know, there's something to that.
[12:14.820 --> 12:21.820]  I think it's also and from a personality perspective, I think that that I mean, and I know I think I've talked about this before in the show.
[12:21.820 --> 12:30.920]  I know people who have gone between Google and Apple, but not very few, fewer than any similar companies that I know of.
[12:30.920 --> 12:36.320]  Like they just the two companies tend to draw very, very different personalities.
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.320]  No, for sure. And I think you can see this from a social perspective.
[12:40.320 --> 12:52.620]  You know, I think Apple people tend to hang out with Apple people, whereas Google and and kind of this whole startup culture is much more much more of a group and goes back and forth.
[12:52.620 --> 12:59.020]  And you see tons of people from Google going and going into going into startups and coming back and stuff like that.
[12:59.020 --> 13:06.020]  And you do see it at Apple, but I think to a much lower degree, I think you have more long term employees at Apple.
[13:06.020 --> 13:15.320]  I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, we're we're we're probably both going off anecdote a bit, but I definitely have always felt that, you know, the Valley company is Google.
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.920]  Even though Apple is the biggest, just Apple is kind of it's in its own world and kind of always has been.
[13:19.920 --> 13:27.220]  Yeah. I also think personality wise, I think a lot of the people who I've gotten to know at Apple who are very smart, though,
[13:27.220 --> 13:32.920]  but they're not the type of smart person who wants to assert that they're the smartest person in the world or in the room,
[13:32.920 --> 13:38.220]  that they're and they'd be happy not to be because they think, cool, now I've got these other smarter people.
[13:38.220 --> 13:46.620]  And almost like if you want to bring some sports ball into it, it's you know, what do you do if you've always been the star basketball player?
[13:46.620 --> 13:51.120]  But now you're only the third or fourth best. Are you happy?
[13:51.120 --> 13:59.520]  Because, holy, holy shit, now I've got three guys on the team who are even better than me and I'll settle into a smaller role and we're going to win.
[13:59.520 --> 14:05.920]  Or are you you know, are you upset and going to complain about how many shots you're getting and stuff like that?
[14:05.920 --> 14:14.620]  No, totally. And I mean, I'm I think of I'm very vociferous in my you know, I love the NBA, I love basketball.
[14:14.620 --> 14:21.120]  And one of the reasons I love it is because I think it's it's a sport that it's one of the hardest sports to kind of figure out.
[14:21.120 --> 14:26.420]  Right. I mean, I think we might have talked to this last time, you know, like baseball's at the end kind of a one on one game,
[14:26.420 --> 14:34.020]  whereas basketball, the interaction both on offense and especially on defense is is so important to it.
[14:34.020 --> 14:37.620]  And it's and it's not it's you can't distill it to a spreadsheet.
[14:37.620 --> 14:40.920]  It's just one of those. There's a lot of feel to it. That makes sense. Right.
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.220]  And with only five players on the court at any time, one new player is a significant difference.
[14:47.220 --> 14:59.720]  I mean, I think maybe the canonical example would be when when King James went to the Heat and they already had a lineup of All-Star players and they added,
[14:59.720 --> 15:04.220]  you know, almost inarguably the best player in the league. That's not necessary.
[15:04.220 --> 15:10.220]  That wasn't necessarily going to work out. There wasn't, you know, it was certainly a talent injection.
[15:10.220 --> 15:17.220]  But it it isn't necessarily it wasn't it wasn't fate that it was going to lead to success.
[15:17.220 --> 15:24.120]  Right. It was so fascinating. We're seeing a replay now. Right. And it's arguably going going worse than it did that time.
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.420]  So, no, with the Cavaliers. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, totally.
[15:29.420 --> 15:37.420]  So the other thing that's interesting about Apple that I've always found very fascinating is if you look at kind of the executive board of most big companies,
[15:37.420 --> 15:44.520]  it's like Stanford, Stanford, MIT, Stanford, Stanford. But that's never been the case for for Apple.
[15:44.520 --> 15:52.620]  I mean, you look at it right now. I mean, you have, you know, Tim Cook went to Auburn and Angela Ahrens went to went to Ball State.
[15:52.620 --> 15:58.420]  Eddie Q went to Eddie Q went to Duke, which is obviously, you know, that that's a prestigious school.
[15:58.420 --> 16:04.320]  But yeah, but it's not a Valley school. Right. It's not it's not a Valley school. Schiller was Boston College, right?
[16:04.320 --> 16:11.320]  Yeah, I think so. And at least as well, if he's not, he's for whatever reason, he's a huge fan of their sports.
[16:11.320 --> 16:15.320]  Yeah, I think he is. I just I just opened a couple of them here.
[16:15.320 --> 16:22.620]  The University of Massachusetts Amherst, Dan Riccio, Phil Schiller is Boston College.
[16:22.620 --> 16:29.320]  And I think that's Jeff Williams, North Carolina State. I mean, like state schools.
[16:29.320 --> 16:37.620]  Right. I mean, good schools, solid schools, but not very different than the than than a lot of the Valley.
[16:37.620 --> 16:43.020]  And I think I think it's a big deal. I think it matters. And I'm biased in this regard.
[16:43.020 --> 16:55.320]  I went to a state school. I mean, it was no Drexel University, but Drexel is like Drexel is like the public school for people who are otherwise going to end up in a state school.
[16:55.320 --> 17:08.320]  But yeah, I think it's I don't know, I I'm not objective in the slightest in this, because when I was when I was getting my MBA,
[17:08.320 --> 17:14.320]  the I had a very hard time getting a job. And because I had this very kind of nontraditional background,
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.820]  I had been living abroad, teaching English, traveling the world, stuff like that.
[17:18.820 --> 17:25.120]  And lots of companies were like people tell me, oh, it's very interesting, but I would never make the cut for an interview.
[17:25.120 --> 17:29.820]  If I got a first interview, I'd never make it to a second one, even if I thought the interview went very well.
[17:29.820 --> 17:39.720]  And kind of the one exception was was Apple, where everything went fantastically, got in, you know, relatively quite easily.
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.820]  And and the interviewer told me right off the bat or and I was fortunate because the like the interviewer was sick.
[17:44.820 --> 17:48.920]  So I interviewed with the hiring director, like my first interview. So that probably accelerated things.
[17:48.920 --> 17:56.320]  But she's like. Like I wanted to hire you to say your resume because it was so off the wall,
[17:56.320 --> 18:01.120]  like that's that's the sort of person that we're looking for. And you go there and you meet lots of people.
[18:01.120 --> 18:05.920]  And I believe it because most of the people I met. Yeah, there were some Stanford people and there were some,
[18:05.920 --> 18:13.420]  you know, MIT people and stuff like that. But a lot of people had really weird backgrounds and did lots of strange stuff.
[18:13.420 --> 18:17.720]  And they were super smart, but they were the weird, weird people smart.
[18:17.720 --> 18:24.820]  And I think that's I don't think that's an accident. I know a lot of engineers at Apple or at least a couple.
[18:24.820 --> 18:29.120]  I shouldn't say a lot. I know a couple at least who don't have any degree at all.
[18:29.120 --> 18:34.520]  And I would say I know a lot who have degrees in things other than computer science.
[18:34.520 --> 18:42.620]  You know, physics, a lot of physics. I mean, I don't know how many both Indy and people at Apple.
[18:42.620 --> 18:47.320]  You know, people who went to school for physics and were programming on the side and then just got sucked into it.
[18:47.320 --> 18:55.820]  And it just was irrelevant to their job prospects at Apple that they didn't have a computer science degree or, you know, whatever school.
[18:55.820 --> 19:03.920]  Wasn't there a thing in Nick Carlson's new book on on Marissa Meyer where she was?
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.020]  I forget who she was dismissive of because she didn't have a college degree.
[19:09.020 --> 19:11.720]  I don't remember. I haven't read it yet. I've only read the excerpt.
[19:11.720 --> 19:21.120]  There was something, though, where she was, you know, she sort of just turned her nose up at somebody else just because the person had didn't have a college degree.
[19:21.120 --> 19:30.620]  Yeah, well, I mean, I mean, by all by all, you know, Google is kind of notorious for having a very strong bias towards.
[19:30.620 --> 19:36.020]  You know, towards your degree in your GPA, in particular, if you're from Stanford, and I think a lot in a lot of the valley is.
[19:36.020 --> 19:42.020]  And it's one of those things where I think the problem with it is, is it raises the floor for who you hire.
[19:42.020 --> 19:44.720]  Like you're going to get someone that's smart and capable.
[19:44.720 --> 19:52.020]  But any time you raise the floor, you're also lowering the ceiling because you're kind of constraining constrain your options.
[19:52.020 --> 19:55.720]  And if someone fits in a box, like you're not going to get out of the box thinking.
[19:55.720 --> 20:03.120]  I mean, it's and I think Apple, at least in my personal experience and from people that I saw there and for my talk to.
[20:03.120 --> 20:12.120]  And this is something that we did talk about Apple University, like the way Apple thinks about hiring, putting much more value on non-school stuff.
[20:12.120 --> 20:20.820]  And and and if they're smart and if they're kind of weird and they've done interesting things, then that's someone that we're interested in.
[20:20.820 --> 20:27.520]  And if they spent their whole day going, going to schools and having a high GPA, it might be useful.
[20:27.520 --> 20:32.520]  But it's almost more of a more of a challenge in some respects.
[20:32.520 --> 20:41.220]  Yeah. The other thing, too, and you like that whole like asserting who's the smartest person in the room, like I've heard this from other people, too.
[20:41.220 --> 20:48.720]  But this is like even personal experience, like way back when, probably close to 10 years ago, like about like eight years ago when I was a joint,
[20:48.720 --> 20:54.620]  we had a meeting with Apple just, hey, you know, we're interested in what you guys are working on.
[20:54.620 --> 21:08.120]  This is one joint was not a hosting company when we were doing like a web based. Email calendar, contacts, notes, sinking type thing.
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.720]  And it was a you know, it was a pleasant meeting. It was, you know, maybe like 30, 40 minutes.
[21:13.720 --> 21:19.120]  But it was like the opposite of anybody trying to assert who is the smartest. All they wanted to do was listen.
[21:19.120 --> 21:24.920]  That's it. They had they had questions, but there was absolutely no it was the opposite. It was almost like creepy.
[21:24.920 --> 21:31.920]  How much they were just observing and listening to us and revealing nothing about themselves.
[21:31.920 --> 21:37.820]  Yeah, well, if you I mean, if you want to get into like, wait, read way too much into this, like we probably already are.
[21:37.820 --> 21:45.120]  But if you want to if you want to take it full speed ahead, one of the best things about being an intern at Apple is they have this like this intern lecture series,
[21:45.120 --> 21:51.520]  where basically the executive team at different members of the executive team for lunch, they come in for an hour and they and they talk.
[21:51.520 --> 21:56.120]  Some some some just talk the whole time. Some give presentations, others just do Q&A.
[21:56.120 --> 22:03.520]  So it was I mean, so you got an hour Steve Jobs and our Tim Cook got an hour with Phil Schiller, like Ron, Ron with Ron Johnson.
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.420]  Like it was an incredible experience, like worth the internship alone.
[22:08.420 --> 22:19.520]  But there was one that was really interesting because this person came in and he was obviously the smartest person in the room.
[22:19.520 --> 22:25.620]  And he was also determined to make sure that everyone knew he was the smartest person in the room.
[22:25.620 --> 22:29.520]  And it is this person no longer at the company.
[22:29.520 --> 22:33.820]  I'll give you one guess as to who this person was. I'm guessing it was Scott Forstall.
[22:33.820 --> 22:39.920]  It was it was like I walked out of the meeting and I told and I told a friend of mine and we we talked this week after he left Apple.
[22:39.920 --> 22:45.220]  Like we because we talked about right afterwards, like it was so it was jarring.
[22:45.220 --> 22:55.620]  I mean, he was so clearly brilliant, but like his it was just such a turnoff to listen to him talk, especially relative to to some of the other executives.
[22:55.620 --> 23:00.720]  And and if you want to get, you know, we're going to really piss off all the Stanford listeners.
[23:00.720 --> 23:06.820]  But there's your Stanford guy. And and I don't know.
[23:06.820 --> 23:10.820]  Like I wasn't it was one of those things where when he left, I was shocked,
[23:10.820 --> 23:16.720]  but I was not surprised because of that that lecture that I heard from him.
[23:16.720 --> 23:19.920]  Well, I mean, there wasn't just that. There was I mean, I'd heard stuff.
[23:19.920 --> 23:25.220]  I knew that it was I mean, I knew that he was a difficult person to work with just to the grapevine.
[23:25.220 --> 23:29.920]  But the truth is, I think Apple misses him, to be honest.
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.820]  But I also was not was not surprised. I agree with that.
[23:34.820 --> 23:38.720]  I do, too. And I think it's easy. Like I laughed and said I knew who it was and I didn't know.
[23:38.720 --> 23:41.920]  I instantly guessed it was it was forced all.
[23:41.920 --> 23:45.320]  But I think he's an extremely complicated figure.
[23:45.320 --> 23:52.020]  And I think explaining his role in Apple's success over the last 15 years is extremely complicated.
[23:52.020 --> 23:59.520]  And there's absolutely no way to paint it in either black or white and say he is missed.
[23:59.520 --> 24:04.420]  They stuck without him or it was an easy no brainer to get rid of them.
[24:04.420 --> 24:08.620]  Good riddance to bad rubbish. It is so, so many different.
[24:08.620 --> 24:14.220]  And I wouldn't even say gray. It's just so many interweaved streaks of black and white.
[24:14.220 --> 24:18.320]  Absolutely. Good, bad part, good part, bad part, good part, bad part.
[24:18.320 --> 24:24.720]  No, he's I mean, he is he's on the top five list of people most responsible for Apple being where it is today.
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.220]  I think part of it was that I think he always had and I don't you know,
[24:28.220 --> 24:33.220]  again, I met him once, you know, after a keynote and we had like a half hour discussion and it was great.
[24:33.220 --> 24:36.920]  And he was just me and him shooting the shit in the hands on area.
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.320]  And he was, you know, clearly a reader of my site, very complimentary to my work.
[24:42.320 --> 24:48.220]  And we just talked about some cool stuff. And, you know, it was no showy offy stuff at all.
[24:48.220 --> 24:50.620]  It was just, you know, but he was very, very brilliant.
[24:50.620 --> 24:58.820]  It was actually around the time of, was it 2010? Might have been like WWDC 2010.
[24:58.820 --> 25:02.120]  iPhone four. Yeah, iPhone four.
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.520]  Yes, iPhone four. And the iPad was like four months old.
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.020]  Yeah. And a lot of this stuff where I was gonna say kids,
[25:13.020 --> 25:19.620]  but it's actually just about everybody, but especially kids with autism and problems like that.
[25:19.620 --> 25:26.020]  We're found to be doing sensational stuff communication wise with iPhones.
[25:26.020 --> 25:27.820]  And now with the big iPad,
[25:27.820 --> 25:32.320]  which really helps with the fine motor control because there are bigger targets that it was a huge thing.
[25:32.320 --> 25:35.620]  He was so amazingly engaged on that.
[25:35.620 --> 25:40.720]  And this, you know, that is not like a hey, how to make the company another 10 billion dollars.
[25:40.720 --> 25:47.020]  You know, it's clearly a small segment of the overall market for iPads and iPhones,
[25:47.020 --> 25:51.720]  but he was super, super engaged on it and thought that we had this cool discussion about it.
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.720]  How the a lot of the things that they design not think they'd,
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.320]  you know, all these things fell out of things that they just thought were cool for regular people,
[25:59.320 --> 26:05.520]  but it ends up being, you know, super great for people with autism,
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.020]  but it's it's this whole that, you know, his his conclusion.
[26:09.020 --> 26:12.020]  He, you know, said that they were looking into it to try to prove it to,
[26:12.020 --> 26:13.320]  you know, not just do it as a hunch,
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.620]  but that it's just about a leave, you know, eliminating a layer of abstraction,
[26:18.620 --> 26:22.820]  that that whole thing where you move a mouse, which moves an arrow on the screen,
[26:22.820 --> 26:25.820]  and you do it, you know, once you get used to using computers,
[26:25.820 --> 26:27.220]  you know, you just forget about it,
[26:27.220 --> 26:29.920]  but that people with autism can never get past it,
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.920]  that it's this abstraction that just their brains don't make the connection.
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.420]  And when they can put their finger right on that button on screen and tap it,
[26:39.420 --> 26:43.220]  it's it's not just like a little bit easier.
[26:43.220 --> 26:46.520]  It's the difference between unable to make the connection
[26:46.520 --> 26:49.420]  and completely able to make the connection
[26:49.420 --> 26:51.520]  and that other people who can use a mouse
[26:51.520 --> 26:54.320]  and don't have any sort of impairment like that.
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.820]  They you know, they might they don't really think about the fact that the iPads a lot easier
[26:58.820 --> 27:00.220]  or the iPhones a lot easier,
[27:00.220 --> 27:05.620]  but that it ends up that subconsciously without thinking about it it is
[27:05.620 --> 27:09.920]  and it actually is why they prefer using it.
[27:09.920 --> 27:11.620]  No, I think it was a great conversation
[27:11.620 --> 27:13.920]  and the gist of it was just he just was talking.
[27:13.920 --> 27:16.020]  It was just me and him talking and it was great.
[27:16.020 --> 27:17.320]  And he I thought he was great.
[27:17.320 --> 27:22.120]  And I also know also now just add the other thing is that there are a ton of people,
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.920]  ton of people who worked under him at Apple who loved him,
[27:25.920 --> 27:27.720]  love and love working under him.
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.920]  He was demanding but that it was he was absolutely not.
[27:33.920 --> 27:36.920]  He was his problem.
[27:36.920 --> 27:39.220]  And well and the other thing too that I heard time and time again,
[27:39.220 --> 27:43.620]  was that people who worked under him always had the sense that he had their back.
[27:43.620 --> 27:44.120]  Right, right.
[27:44.120 --> 27:44.920]  That's what I was getting at.
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.820]  Yeah.
[27:46.820 --> 27:49.620]  No totally the other thing is that I actually think I'm not sure
[27:49.620 --> 27:52.220]  but I think in that talk I think he actually did talk a lot.
[27:52.220 --> 27:54.620]  It was the same summer 2010 that I was there.
[27:54.620 --> 27:55.920]  And so maybe it was on his mind.
[27:55.920 --> 27:58.120]  I think he talked a lot about the accessibility stuff
[27:58.120 --> 27:59.520]  and I think I'm not sure
[27:59.520 --> 28:04.820]  but I think I've heard that he was really the driving force for iOS being so advanced
[28:04.820 --> 28:07.220]  when it came to like accessibility like for the blind
[28:07.220 --> 28:11.520]  and well he was certainly was a complete advocate for it.
[28:11.520 --> 28:12.620]  Like a total advocate.
[28:12.620 --> 28:15.020]  He may not have been the sole driving force,
[28:15.020 --> 28:18.320]  but he put his full advocacy behind it.
[28:18.320 --> 28:19.020]  Just in general.
[28:19.020 --> 28:23.620]  I mean, I really think like this is where I think Apple misses him in two parts.
[28:23.620 --> 28:34.820]  I think one is is like his ability to like I do think that iOS was incredibly relevant
[28:34.820 --> 28:38.320]  given given what it was was not buggy at all
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.320]  and was really you know,
[28:40.320 --> 28:41.120]  it was really good.
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.720]  I think there's a discussion we had about some of the quality stuff
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.720]  but to I think he had a real passion
[28:48.720 --> 28:56.120]  and push for usability and accessibility not just for like disabled
[28:56.120 --> 28:57.420]  but for normal people
[28:57.420 --> 29:02.320]  and like and so much of the original iPhone OS that was so natural
[29:02.320 --> 29:04.520]  and so obvious
[29:04.520 --> 29:07.220]  and that obviousness it's obvious when you use it,
[29:07.220 --> 29:09.120]  but it's not obvious when you design it right.
[29:09.120 --> 29:10.820]  It requires tons of iteration
[29:10.820 --> 29:13.320]  and tons of pushback and doing it again and again
[29:13.320 --> 29:16.620]  and certainly Jobs was was the head of this
[29:16.620 --> 29:18.320]  and the and pushed for this
[29:18.320 --> 29:21.320]  but this was where this was where in particular.
[29:21.320 --> 29:22.820]  I think for still really channel jobs
[29:22.820 --> 29:24.920]  and certainly iOS
[29:24.920 --> 29:26.420]  and I would say, you know,
[29:26.420 --> 29:31.320]  especially now once we're used to them look much better than the old iPhone OS,
[29:31.320 --> 29:35.320]  but I still think there's lots of areas where they're more difficult to use
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.520]  and more difficult in a not in that they're less obvious
[29:39.520 --> 29:41.820]  and that's something that I think is missing still.
[29:41.820 --> 29:47.620]  I think a way that you get there is not so much being able to find
[29:47.620 --> 29:52.220]  the truly simple seemingly obvious way to do it.
[29:52.220 --> 30:00.120]  It's more of the refusal to accept the complicated the complex the this isn't
[30:00.120 --> 30:02.420]  it isn't clear how you do it,
[30:02.420 --> 30:03.320]  but you you know,
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.920]  you you start you think hey,
[30:04.920 --> 30:05.120]  you know,
[30:05.120 --> 30:08.320]  here's how we'll lay out the new calendar app for iOS 8
[30:08.320 --> 30:09.120]  and we'll do this and this
[30:09.120 --> 30:10.620]  and it sounds good and you build it
[30:10.620 --> 30:13.520]  and then you use it and it's like but I'm kind of confused.
[30:13.520 --> 30:15.820]  Like how do I just show a list of events
[30:15.820 --> 30:17.520]  and eventually though you kind of get used to it
[30:17.520 --> 30:20.820]  and you can just say well you can do everything now.
[30:20.820 --> 30:22.020]  I've been testing it long enough.
[30:22.020 --> 30:23.520]  I know it good enough.
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.320]  Let's ship it.
[30:24.320 --> 30:26.320]  Whereas I think for stall and again,
[30:26.320 --> 30:29.820]  like you said channeling jobs had an ability to say
[30:29.820 --> 30:30.720]  this isn't good enough.
[30:30.720 --> 30:31.520]  This is shit.
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.020]  We've got to start over this,
[30:33.020 --> 30:33.320]  you know,
[30:33.320 --> 30:34.220]  this can't be tweaked.
[30:34.220 --> 30:35.520]  We can't just move a button here.
[30:35.520 --> 30:37.020]  We've got to throw this out
[30:37.020 --> 30:41.920]  because the whole thing is just not brain dead clear.
[30:41.920 --> 30:42.120]  Yeah,
[30:42.120 --> 30:42.920]  it's so hard.
[30:42.920 --> 30:43.120]  Oh,
[30:43.120 --> 30:43.820]  sorry.
[30:43.820 --> 30:44.120]  Well,
[30:44.120 --> 30:47.420]  it's just you can get you can just talk yourself into accepting something
[30:47.420 --> 30:48.820]  that's not quite clear.
[30:48.820 --> 30:48.920]  Well,
[30:48.920 --> 30:49.420]  it's so hard.
[30:49.420 --> 30:50.620]  It's so hard when you're immersed.
[30:50.620 --> 30:50.820]  Yeah,
[30:50.820 --> 30:51.620]  when you're immersed in it,
[30:51.620 --> 30:54.520]  it's so hard to look at something through the eyes of a new user
[30:54.520 --> 30:58.520]  or a novice user like that's a that's a truly like a skill
[30:58.520 --> 31:02.620]  and a gift that very few people including myself.
[31:02.620 --> 31:03.320]  I think,
[31:03.320 --> 31:06.120]  you know have because what you're just used to it.
[31:06.120 --> 31:08.820]  And so it becomes a blind spot.
[31:08.820 --> 31:10.320]  Yeah.
[31:12.320 --> 31:13.920]  I guess I take a break right here.
[31:13.920 --> 31:19.820]  Thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at fracture.
[31:19.820 --> 31:22.720]  You guys remember fracture fracture is the company
[31:22.720 --> 31:24.820]  that you send them your photos.
[31:24.820 --> 31:29.520]  They print your photos directly on pieces of glass,
[31:29.520 --> 31:32.920]  not on a piece of paper that's under glass and put in a frame.
[31:32.920 --> 31:34.020]  They I don't know what they do.
[31:34.020 --> 31:36.520]  They've got some kind of proprietary technology.
[31:36.520 --> 31:37.220]  It's amazing.
[31:37.220 --> 31:41.420]  They print your photo right on the glass.
[31:41.420 --> 31:47.720]  The effect in person is like the analog equivalent of these modern retina displays
[31:47.720 --> 31:53.520]  where the LCD is laminated to the touch center
[31:53.520 --> 31:56.020]  where it looks like the pixels are right on the glass.
[31:56.020 --> 32:01.920]  That's what your photo looks like when you get it back from fracture really really cool.
[32:01.920 --> 32:08.020]  They have a whole bunch of sizes everything from small square ones to really really big ones
[32:08.020 --> 32:09.920]  and they ship them in these amazing.
[32:09.920 --> 32:13.020]  It's almost worth ordering your first thing from fracture just to see how they ship them
[32:13.020 --> 32:19.520]  because the box is the frame is the stand it's all sort of integrated
[32:19.520 --> 32:25.020]  and there's like a total minimal amount of wasted cardboard.
[32:25.020 --> 32:27.420]  But when you get it out if you want to hang it on the wall
[32:27.420 --> 32:32.320]  or you want to prop it up on your desk all that stuff is all built in to what you get.
[32:32.320 --> 32:33.820]  So you don't need to take this thing
[32:33.820 --> 32:37.220]  and then put a frame around it or put it in a frame or do anything like that.
[32:37.220 --> 32:39.720]  Everything you need to like say hang it on the wall
[32:39.720 --> 32:46.020]  or prop it up on your desk is all built in to the packaging really cool looking
[32:46.020 --> 32:47.920]  so you can do it and then it's borderless.
[32:47.920 --> 32:53.220]  So it just is a just has a great effect very very aesthetically pleasing on your desk
[32:53.220 --> 32:59.820]  or on your wall and the quality is just top-notch.
[32:59.820 --> 33:02.220]  I really really love the way pictures look from this.
[33:02.220 --> 33:05.520]  It's a great gift.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.520]  If you haven't tried it yet, you're you're nuts.
[33:07.520 --> 33:10.320]  It's a really really good way and you know,
[33:10.320 --> 33:12.420]  I think their big pitch,
[33:12.420 --> 33:17.820]  you know is that as we go more and more digital digital digital digital
[33:17.820 --> 33:24.620]  with our photography we lose touch of the almost the humanity of getting analog prints
[33:24.620 --> 33:30.420]  of your family and friends and you know events from your life
[33:30.420 --> 33:31.420]  that you want to remember
[33:31.420 --> 33:35.820]  and the way that we used to in the old days all the best photos we had were of course analog
[33:35.820 --> 33:37.120]  because that's all we had
[33:37.120 --> 33:42.220]  and you had them hanging on your wall or on your desk or on your mantle.
[33:42.220 --> 33:44.120]  So it's a great way to do that.
[33:44.120 --> 33:50.420]  Take your best pictures get them printed out and there's no better way to do it than fracture.
[33:50.420 --> 33:52.020]  So where do you go to find out more?
[33:52.020 --> 34:02.320]  Well, their website is at fracture fr a c t u r e me.com fracture me.com
[34:02.320 --> 34:09.220]  and they have a special code just for listeners of the show daring fireball all one word daring fireball.
[34:09.220 --> 34:14.120]  You'll say five bucks off your order if you use that code daring fireball.
[34:14.120 --> 34:19.820]  So my thanks to fracture go get some pictures.
[34:19.820 --> 34:23.520]  So you mentioned the like the analog nature of photos.
[34:23.520 --> 34:29.620]  Did you see that that iPhone app that basically it lets you take it lets you take a picture,
[34:29.620 --> 34:32.020]  but it doesn't show you the picture if you've taken it.
[34:32.020 --> 34:34.620]  No, and once you've taken 24 pictures,
[34:34.620 --> 34:37.720]  you can pay to have them mailed to you like print it out.
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.420]  Oh, no, I did see something about this.
[34:39.420 --> 34:42.420]  This is like maybe maybe a couple weeks ago.
[34:42.420 --> 34:43.920]  Yeah, I think it's called white album.
[34:43.920 --> 34:47.320]  I think I was just did a quick search for it white album.
[34:47.320 --> 34:49.020]  I think so.
[34:49.020 --> 34:53.020]  Yeah, white white white album app.com.
[34:53.020 --> 35:00.320]  Surprised the Beatles didn't have something to say about on an Apple device no less.
[35:00.320 --> 35:02.420]  Wow, that sounds terrible.
[35:02.420 --> 35:06.020]  Yeah, it was it's interesting because like I thought it was interesting
[35:06.020 --> 35:07.720]  because a lot of people to her like all this is so great.
[35:07.720 --> 35:11.620]  It's so wonderful and it's like and are you sure about that?
[35:11.620 --> 35:13.920]  It's one of the things that it sounds great when you tweet it.
[35:13.920 --> 35:16.420]  I'm not sure it'd be very great in actual real life.
[35:16.420 --> 35:26.620]  Right I and I also feel that there's something about a digital viewfinder
[35:26.620 --> 35:29.220]  even though the iPhone viewfinder is you know,
[35:29.220 --> 35:31.820]  using your iPhone as a viewfinder and holding it up and looking at it.
[35:31.820 --> 35:36.520]  It's so much bigger than what you'd see with like an analog an old analog film camera
[35:36.520 --> 35:38.520]  when you'd look through the eyepiece,
[35:38.520 --> 35:41.520]  but because it's a sensor there's something about it
[35:41.520 --> 35:45.820]  that makes it harder to frame exactly what you want.
[35:45.820 --> 35:50.820]  I don't know. I feel like if I tried this I would not take as good a pictures as I would
[35:50.820 --> 35:56.220]  if I were using my old 35 millimeter SLR looking through the viewfinder where you know,
[35:56.220 --> 35:59.920]  I can't chimp and look at the pictures as I take them,
[35:59.920 --> 36:02.220]  but I feel like I would get better pictures
[36:02.220 --> 36:05.120]  that way because I'm looking through an actual analog viewfinder
[36:05.120 --> 36:07.920]  and there's no lag whatsoever. No, I agree.
[36:07.920 --> 36:14.020]  And it actually I was just thinking about it when I use my my SLR like I I don't look at the photo.
[36:14.020 --> 36:16.520]  I took most of the time unless I'm like worried about the exposure
[36:16.520 --> 36:19.520]  or something right unless you notice something really weird like man.
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.220]  This is there's such strong backlighting like these people,
[36:22.220 --> 36:26.020]  you know, there's no way to get on the other side of them and the sun is behind them.
[36:26.020 --> 36:29.320]  You know, I want to double check that this isn't just going to show up as a silhouette.
[36:29.320 --> 36:30.620]  Right. Exactly. Exactly.
[36:30.620 --> 36:36.720]  It's usually I take it and then I'll look at it whenever I, you know, put them in a room or whatever.
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.020]  I used to get frustrated. I don't even I can't remember the last time I launched it.
[36:40.020 --> 36:43.820]  I eat but I used to use Hipstamatic a lot because I thought they for a while.
[36:43.820 --> 36:47.720]  I thought they had the best filters by far.
[36:47.720 --> 36:50.720]  But Hipstamatic had they were halfway in that regard
[36:50.720 --> 36:54.620]  where they they didn't let you apply filters to photos.
[36:54.620 --> 36:57.720]  You'd already taken and they didn't let you change the filters on photos.
[36:57.720 --> 37:02.420]  You'd taken you had to set your gimmicky fake lens
[37:02.420 --> 37:08.220]  and your gimmicky fake film and then whatever you took you got.
[37:08.220 --> 37:10.620]  Oh, interesting. I never I never really used it.
[37:10.620 --> 37:13.620]  Yeah, it ended I it's you know,
[37:13.620 --> 37:18.520]  and it was all in the name of this sort of well for lack of a better term skeuomorphic.
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.120]  Pretending that you're that the Hipstamatic app was a film camera,
[37:23.120 --> 37:25.020]  you know, and the different lens, you know,
[37:25.020 --> 37:28.920]  you might find a film you really like and then you put a different lens on and it gives it a slightly.
[37:28.920 --> 37:32.720]  I think the I think that the film's always had the strongest effect on the filtering
[37:32.720 --> 37:34.520]  and the lens is a little secondary,
[37:34.520 --> 37:39.220]  but you could get different effects but you couldn't see until after you took a photo.
[37:39.220 --> 37:42.920]  And it was you know, and if you took one and it was like it you're it
[37:42.920 --> 37:46.120]  when you had it set up to look really good outside on a sunny day
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.620]  and the pictures were nice and warm and had a nice,
[37:48.620 --> 37:50.920]  you know, not gimmicky filter look but just you know,
[37:50.920 --> 37:52.420]  an aesthetically pleasing look
[37:52.420 --> 37:55.120]  and then you went indoors and the same combination look bad.
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.420]  You were like so many taps and turning the camera around and switching the film.
[37:59.420 --> 38:01.920]  It was crazy.
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.620]  Like why not just let me do this after I've taken the photos.
[38:05.620 --> 38:09.120]  It's interesting to think about that with with Instagram,
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.920]  right because you got on like an initial pass you would think that they're going to be all there.
[38:14.920 --> 38:16.220]  They're in the same category.
[38:16.220 --> 38:19.720]  But what I mean Instagram is is an amazing app
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.720]  and service because it's it's really forward
[38:24.720 --> 38:26.820]  and what I mean by that is like Instagram.
[38:26.820 --> 38:30.920]  It was kind of the first really pure.
[38:30.920 --> 38:33.520]  We were built for a mobile phone
[38:33.520 --> 38:35.420]  and part of that's in the workflow.
[38:35.420 --> 38:38.220]  Like you can just take a picture and then you apply the filter
[38:38.220 --> 38:42.520]  and yeah, you may be a fly applying a Kishi skeuomorphic type filter,
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.820]  but it fits with the way you actually take pictures on a phone.
[38:46.820 --> 38:49.720]  Yeah, and then and then just beyond that the actual service,
[38:49.720 --> 38:51.520]  you know only really working on a phone
[38:51.520 --> 38:54.520]  and having a bare-bones website at best for a very long time.
[38:54.520 --> 39:02.020]  Even today. It's pretty bare-bones like they've always been a mobile first company that is
[39:02.020 --> 39:05.320]  that is built around the phone with the assumption that you're going to use your phone
[39:05.320 --> 39:07.320]  and I think that's a big part of why you know,
[39:07.320 --> 39:08.620]  they've been so successful.
[39:08.620 --> 39:10.320]  Yeah on the aesthetic side.
[39:10.320 --> 39:11.920]  There's no doubt Instagram.
[39:11.920 --> 39:13.120]  I wouldn't call it a ripoff.
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.920]  I would just say that they ate hip stomatics lunch
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.120]  where there's so much that they that they just took from hip stomatic the square.
[39:22.120 --> 39:25.020]  The only side you only the only size you can are ratio.
[39:25.020 --> 39:29.820]  You can have a square hip stomatic has has had.
[39:29.820 --> 39:33.520]  I don't know the fake borders to make,
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.820]  you know, some of the films depending on what phone you had had like Polaroid style borders,
[39:37.820 --> 39:42.420]  which if you recall Instagram had for like the first couple of years of its existence,
[39:42.420 --> 39:45.620]  right? You know,
[39:45.620 --> 39:50.720]  the basic the basic look like like not just you know that the films tended to look
[39:50.720 --> 39:56.420]  like old analog instant films all of that,
[39:56.420 --> 40:02.420]  you know, Instagram just borrowed from hip stomatic or followed hip stomatics lead right,
[40:02.420 --> 40:08.720]  but they did that in a better way because they they took advantage of they did all the things.
[40:08.720 --> 40:10.620]  Aesthetically that made people like that.
[40:10.620 --> 40:13.020]  Look, they you know, that's all the you know,
[40:13.020 --> 40:17.020]  just the pleasure it gives you to have photos from your camera that look like that
[40:17.020 --> 40:21.520]  and that make you know, just look cool or look better or whatever you want to say.
[40:21.520 --> 40:31.820]  Look hipper with none of the none of the goofy restrictions that hip stomatic imposed in the name of just pure hipsterism,
[40:31.820 --> 40:33.920]  you know the whole once you've set a filter, you know,
[40:33.920 --> 40:39.220]  you have to take the filter the photo with the filter and if you don't like it tough take another photo.
[40:39.220 --> 40:43.120]  Whereas Instagram would let you pick camera images from your camera roll.
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.020]  They would let you change the filter if you'd already taken it in Instagram Etc.
[40:48.020 --> 40:54.820]  And then, you know, multiply that by a hundred fold by having the genius of turning it into a Twitter like social network,
[40:54.820 --> 40:57.720]  right? I mean, that's that's you know, but it's all part of it.
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.020]  I mean if I think that if they had launched without filters at all,
[41:01.020 --> 41:04.320]  it would have taken a lot long and may not have taken off.
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.820]  Well that that's what's so brilliant about about Instagram as a social network is they
[41:09.820 --> 41:14.820]  there was a reason to use Instagram from day one even if you didn't have any friends
[41:14.820 --> 41:18.020]  and that that's what's so hard about getting any social network off.
[41:18.020 --> 41:21.320]  The ground is is just finding people or discovering people
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.320]  and even Twitter today has this problem where people get on there
[41:24.320 --> 41:27.720]  and they don't really have many followers and now Twitter's cut off from the Facebook,
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.320]  you know, kind of connection feed and it's like so I'm just like farting in the wind here.
[41:32.320 --> 41:37.220]  Like who's listening to what I have to say whereas with Instagram like you're getting value.
[41:37.220 --> 41:41.320]  You can get value from Instagram, even if you have zero followers.
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.520]  Yeah, even even if your Instagram feed is more or less just your own photos for now.
[41:45.520 --> 41:47.420]  Nobody's looking at him there. You can send you know,
[41:47.420 --> 41:50.220]  email them and keep them and you know,
[41:50.220 --> 41:56.220]  right because the filters I mean because they're cool and they look neat and and no I agree.
[41:56.220 --> 42:01.120]  The other thing is just in general and you I think you just said something along these lines is
[42:01.120 --> 42:09.120]  appreciating a product is so much more than just like the actual like like Instagram is successful.
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.220]  Yeah, maybe they they borrowed the the filter concept
[42:12.220 --> 42:15.620]  and a lot of was very similar Hipstamatic,
[42:15.620 --> 42:17.920]  but that's not an it's very easy.
[42:17.920 --> 42:20.620]  It's stuck on that in like comparing companies
[42:20.620 --> 42:22.320]  or comparing products and all this sort of stuff.
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.820]  But if you think about the whole like the whole thing is the product it's it's all of it.
[42:26.820 --> 42:31.020]  And even even with Instagram you can argue like it's they have a
[42:31.020 --> 42:33.020]  how they're going to make money in the future in the long run.
[42:33.020 --> 42:36.020]  That's going to be part of the product and like it's much more.
[42:36.020 --> 42:38.320]  There's all these different facets that go into it.
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.220]  And sure some companies are approximately similar on one facet,
[42:41.220 --> 42:42.720]  but they may be very different other ones
[42:42.720 --> 42:46.120]  and maybe those different things that end up making the difference.
[42:46.120 --> 42:47.820]  Do you have any insight on this a couple weeks ago?
[42:47.820 --> 42:54.520]  Dan Fromer was on the show and he it's been so long that I have almost forgotten the complaint
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.220]  that Instagram still doesn't have an iPad app.
[42:58.220 --> 43:01.820]  I do actually I think it's I think it's okay.
[43:01.820 --> 43:05.920]  I mean, I understand I understand the the objection
[43:05.920 --> 43:12.920]  but I think it comes back to Instagram being being a phone first app like that.
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.220]  That's where like so just from a very kind of narrow perspective.
[43:17.220 --> 43:22.320]  I think Instagram still sees more benefit from and working on improving their phone apps
[43:22.320 --> 43:28.220]  and they do on building building an iPad app one to the problem.
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.620]  I mean now that people use iPads as cameras that this isn't as quite as strong an idea,
[43:33.620 --> 43:38.920]  but I think this what's compelling about Instagram is I think Instagram more than almost Instagram's like Facebook
[43:38.920 --> 43:44.920]  in that there is a very solid balance between creating content and consuming content.
[43:44.920 --> 43:46.920]  Whereas Twitter,
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.920]  I think a lot of people might just consume if they don't really put stuff out there
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.020]  whereas Instagram like people use it to make stuff and they use it to get stuff
[43:56.020 --> 44:00.620]  and I think but I I almost think it's an outdated view of the iPad though.
[44:00.620 --> 44:04.220]  Like I think in a lot of ways and especially when it comes to photography.
[44:04.220 --> 44:12.820]  The iPad is a lot more big iPhone than tablet laptop.
[44:12.820 --> 44:15.420]  I do think so and especially for you know,
[44:15.420 --> 44:17.220]  for a certain segment of the population.
[44:17.220 --> 44:18.920]  I mean, it's my mom's primary camera.
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.120]  I mean, you'd like to go an entire podcast thought mention your mom,
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.620]  but literally it's my mom's primary primary camera.
[44:24.620 --> 44:25.920]  There's too many people like that.
[44:25.920 --> 44:26.620]  I just you know,
[44:26.620 --> 44:29.020]  every time I go to I used to I used to make a note
[44:29.020 --> 44:33.420]  and I used to even like when we'd go to Disney World like a year or two ago.
[44:33.420 --> 44:42.320]  I would just snap photos of people using tablets as as cameras just as like a like a thing to do while walking around the park
[44:42.320 --> 44:44.120]  and I didn't publish them anywhere to make fun of them,
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.320]  but I just had them privately and see how many how many photos of people using a tablet
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.020]  as a camera could I rack up in a day and my son,
[44:52.020 --> 44:52.320]  you know,
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.720]  my son used to laugh that it was that's the stupidest hobby to have at Disney World ever,
[44:57.720 --> 44:57.920]  you know,
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.620]  but I could usually get like 20 in a day and then I would just delete them all.
[45:01.620 --> 45:02.820]  It's not you couldn't even do anymore.
[45:02.820 --> 45:06.020]  You'd never you wouldn't be able to get from point A to point B.
[45:06.020 --> 45:09.120]  It's it's as common as seeing somebody using a phone as a camera
[45:09.120 --> 45:10.920]  and there's too many people who you know,
[45:10.920 --> 45:13.620]  they just don't see the distinction like I don't even see people
[45:13.620 --> 45:17.620]  and when I first tried to get off I tried to get off my own high horse
[45:17.620 --> 45:24.720]  about making fun of people using tablets as cameras maybe like a year ago or so.
[45:24.720 --> 45:27.620]  I'd still get pushback from like listeners of the show
[45:27.620 --> 45:28.120]  and they'd be like,
[45:28.120 --> 45:28.620]  oh, come on.
[45:28.620 --> 45:29.920]  It's stupid looking now.
[45:29.920 --> 45:32.120]  I don't even get that everybody it's just sunk in
[45:32.120 --> 45:38.020]  and I feel like it's almost ridiculous for an app that's photo centric like Instagram not to be native on
[45:38.020 --> 45:40.720]  what is for a lot of people their primary camera
[45:40.720 --> 45:43.620]  and then for the consumption side consuming photos.
[45:43.620 --> 45:45.420]  It's always better to be bigger.
[45:45.420 --> 45:47.820]  So it would you know to look at your friend's photos.
[45:47.820 --> 45:50.420]  It's always going to look bigger are the bigger on the biggest device,
[45:50.420 --> 45:52.220]  you know, you can use.
[45:52.220 --> 45:53.020]  No, that's fair.
[45:53.020 --> 45:59.420]  I like and I think your point is right that the that that justification may have made sense,
[45:59.420 --> 46:00.920]  but it makes increasingly less sense.
[46:00.920 --> 46:02.620]  That's that said they they I mean,
[46:02.620 --> 46:06.220]  they're a part of Facebook they they have access to numbers
[46:06.220 --> 46:08.920]  and where what people are using and where they're using it.
[46:08.920 --> 46:12.820]  So I would imagine it's a it's not a uninformed decision.
[46:12.820 --> 46:17.120]  And the third factor is that it's different.
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.020]  I think in the iOS 8 era with the to font with the new phones
[46:21.020 --> 46:25.920]  because the difference between making an iPad app
[46:25.920 --> 46:34.920]  and an iPhone app is nowhere near as different as it used to be like it's it's really more in with these
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.620]  if you're doing it the right way if you can support the multiple iPhone sizes,
[46:41.620 --> 46:45.320]  there's almost no reason you shouldn't be supporting the iPad 2.
[46:45.320 --> 46:47.920]  Yeah, the same thing. It's no longer two big things.
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.220]  It's these different, you know, what are they called scaling factors or whatever?
[46:51.220 --> 46:54.320]  I'm sure you're scaling though. I think there is a resolution issue.
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.320]  I know some people have raised that as a possible reason as well.
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.920]  Like the Instagram photos are just super low resolution and might look like crap on the iPad.
[47:02.920 --> 47:06.020]  Yeah, I don't that again. This is this is a company that got off the ground by,
[47:06.020 --> 47:08.220]  you know, utilizing like the iPhone 3G camera.
[47:08.220 --> 47:15.120]  So right. Yeah. So my guess is it's coming but it's it's almost it's almost a you know,
[47:15.120 --> 47:17.120]  it's almost like they're doing it on purpose at this point
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.920]  because they do support the native iPhone 6 sizes and 6 plus,
[47:22.920 --> 47:26.120]  you know, and I would suggest as an iPad app just you know,
[47:26.120 --> 47:29.020]  they I think that's an app where you don't have to you know,
[47:29.020 --> 47:34.620]  the just a just a just a natively scaled version of the iPhone app would be just fine.
[47:34.620 --> 47:37.720]  You don't have to redesign it or relay it out or do something different.
[47:37.720 --> 47:41.820]  Oh, I mean their website is basically a scaled up version of the iPhone app.
[47:41.820 --> 47:47.720]  Like it's literally just like a column of photos that that might as well be the app put on a put on a web page.
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.120]  Yeah, I think the more I my guess is the explanation is that I think that you know,
[47:52.120 --> 47:58.520]  they're a very conservative company that gives is a weird thing for a four-year-old.
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.420]  What five-year-old startup that is part of Facebook
[48:02.420 --> 48:08.720]  and that is you know gone from 13 people to you know, a billion dollar acquisition
[48:08.720 --> 48:14.420]  to a multi-billion dollar asset in just a handful of years,
[48:14.420 --> 48:16.820]  you know, usually don't think of such companies as being conservative,
[48:16.820 --> 48:19.520]  but they are they're very very conservative in my opinion.
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.220]  We can always design wise you can already see the you can arguably see the conservatism
[48:23.220 --> 48:26.920]  and the fact that they sold out so early right and you know,
[48:26.920 --> 48:29.320]  yeah, I would say that's actually part of the conservatism
[48:29.320 --> 48:32.820]  and I would say the biggest sign of it is just how close
[48:32.820 --> 48:36.920]  what they have today is to what they shipped with the first day.
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.220]  Like it's it, you know, they've definitely added a bunch of features
[48:40.220 --> 48:45.320]  and they've rewritten the filters but it's more or less the same thing.
[48:45.320 --> 48:52.420]  Yeah, I mean you would be somebody who got to who like on the day that Instagram came out.
[48:52.420 --> 48:55.020]  For iPhone and just instant bought it are you know,
[48:55.020 --> 48:58.820]  and you have to buy just downloaded it got into it and said I love this.
[48:58.820 --> 49:03.420]  I love this Instagram thing and just, you know, consumed the whole app understood the whole thing.
[49:03.420 --> 49:07.020]  And if you took today's Instagram to that person five years ago,
[49:07.020 --> 49:10.720]  four years ago, whatever it is, they would be right at home.
[49:10.720 --> 49:13.120]  They would have like two or three new things to like,
[49:13.120 --> 49:17.820]  oh, that's cool. But that's it. No, it's a good point.
[49:17.820 --> 49:20.720]  There's very few companies that you can say that about.
[49:20.720 --> 49:25.720]  Yeah. Well, it gets to the genius of the genius of the of the whole entire concept too.
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.320]  Right. Think about how different Twitter today is like logging into Twitter.com
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.820]  and what you're exposed to compared to what you were, you know, five years ago.
[49:34.820 --> 49:39.920]  It's very different. What else is in the news before we get to big picture stuff?
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.620]  See box had their IPO today. They did and it popped very nicely,
[49:45.620 --> 49:51.620]  which is I think great for them. I kind of suspect that they they underpriced a little on purpose.
[49:51.620 --> 49:54.420]  Just because there's been so much there's been a bit of a cloud around the company
[49:54.420 --> 49:58.420]  for the last year, which is not which is not a good thing to have
[49:58.420 --> 50:00.220]  if you're trying to sell into very large enterprises
[50:00.220 --> 50:05.320]  and assure them that you're going to you can hold on to all their data and for the long run.
[50:05.320 --> 50:07.320]  Whereas now I think they're going to come out of this.
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.020]  There's going to be a ton of good news,
[50:10.020 --> 50:12.820]  you know, wow, what a fantastic the market loves them.
[50:12.820 --> 50:17.620]  And I think it's going to be really good for them from a just a sales and momentum perspective.
[50:17.620 --> 50:23.820]  So I wouldn't be suspect. I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if they kind of knew they would probably be leaving some money on the table.
[50:23.820 --> 50:31.220]  But but that they deemed kind of the the shift in perception that this will result in to be to be worth it.
[50:31.220 --> 50:37.320]  Yeah, the psychology of an IPO is so weird because it's like ideally in some sense,
[50:37.320 --> 50:42.320]  you want to price your IPO at exactly what the market is going to value it at
[50:42.320 --> 50:44.820]  because otherwise you're leaving money on the table.
[50:44.820 --> 50:47.920]  But then you're from your investors perspective,
[50:47.920 --> 50:55.520]  there's a financial drive to underprice your IPO so that all of those investors shares,
[50:55.520 --> 50:58.720]  you know, go up in value once the market prices it.
[50:58.720 --> 51:01.020]  You know, I think and I think it I think it I think it matters
[51:01.020 --> 51:03.820]  and because the people you take like take Facebook versus Twitter,
[51:03.820 --> 51:08.720]  like Facebook basically didn't pop at all and then over time it actually went down
[51:08.720 --> 51:11.420]  and and there's a lot of people who look at it from a narrow perspective
[51:11.420 --> 51:15.820]  and say well Facebook did it just right they captured every available cent
[51:15.820 --> 51:19.620]  and and then they look at Twitter and Twitter had a huge pop
[51:19.620 --> 51:22.520]  and they're like oh Twitter screwed up they left a lot of money on the table.
[51:22.520 --> 51:28.020]  But I think if you actually look at it like Facebook was under a ton of pressure right after IPO
[51:28.020 --> 51:35.020]  and I think they were constrained like strategically like I suspect that Facebook should have bought Waze
[51:35.020 --> 51:36.720]  for example the mapping app,
[51:36.720 --> 51:43.920]  but I think that one reason they didn't is they couldn't really justify spending over a billion dollars
[51:43.920 --> 51:47.220]  when they were under so much pressure from from investors
[51:47.220 --> 51:50.420]  because that was the kind of the height of like Facebook is doomed mania
[51:50.420 --> 51:53.820]  with their stock had dipped like a third of what what an IPO
[51:53.820 --> 51:59.720]  at our half whatever whereas Twitter Twitter arguably Twitter has kind of been a disaster
[51:59.720 --> 52:05.120]  since they IPO'd almost every earnings call has been been worse than the last yet.
[52:05.120 --> 52:08.620]  Yes, there's pressure and there's been a lot of talk about Costello
[52:08.620 --> 52:10.220]  and stuff like that this year particular,
[52:10.220 --> 52:17.720]  but I don't think it's been nearly to the degree that it Twitter probably deserves to be perfectly honest
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.820]  and I think part of that is because the stock is still up from the IPO like that it like and so you look at it.
[52:22.820 --> 52:26.820]  Yeah, the stock's down from its high, but it's still higher than what it IPO'd at.
[52:26.820 --> 52:29.020]  I think that that that that matters
[52:29.020 --> 52:34.820]  and if whereas if Twitter was down like Facebook was down and had way worse fundamentals
[52:34.820 --> 52:41.520]  than Facebook ever had man like this guy would be falling to a much greater degree than it is right now.
[52:41.520 --> 52:49.420]  Yeah, and there's also some like the incalculable part is the PR value of an IPO that pops as you say.
[52:49.420 --> 52:51.320]  Absolutely.
[52:51.320 --> 52:57.120]  Like net Netscape was you know, maybe the canonical example.
[52:57.120 --> 53:02.120]  I don't know but that it gave the sense that Netscape was the future,
[53:02.120 --> 53:05.020]  you know that that you know, however much money they left on the table
[53:05.020 --> 53:09.220]  because the IPO popped on day one was worth.
[53:09.220 --> 53:13.320]  I don't know. I think tens of millions of dollars in the perception of you know,
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.620]  holy shit. There's a new tech industry Titan in town.
[53:17.620 --> 53:21.820]  Absolutely and it matters from where it matters for hiring it matters for morale
[53:21.820 --> 53:26.620]  and it matters for like it like I mean the stock market a lot of it is about perception
[53:26.620 --> 53:31.420]  and right it's the popping is like oh my God everybody else thinks this company is going to kick ass.
[53:31.420 --> 53:39.620]  Right in that sticks with you like in so like when it matters when like it the bad news doesn't matter.
[53:39.620 --> 53:43.720]  The way people perceive the bad news is what matters
[53:43.720 --> 53:48.920]  and if people come at it with the assumption that this is a valuable company that people are excited about
[53:48.920 --> 53:51.220]  then it's like oh, that's okay. They'll get over it.
[53:51.220 --> 53:53.120]  Whereas if it's a this company man,
[53:53.120 --> 53:56.020]  everyone's down on it and then a piece of bad news comes out like oh man,
[53:56.020 --> 53:58.220]  this is terrible and like I said,
[53:58.220 --> 54:04.120]  I think you saw that with Facebook which in retrospect it was ridiculous,
[54:04.120 --> 54:09.820]  you know, I mean the now that now the stock is is well up from its IPO stage,
[54:09.820 --> 54:16.320]  but it took it took a lot longer than it should have for kind of the the perception of Facebook to change
[54:16.320 --> 54:23.320]  and arguably I think even in the Valley I feel like Facebook is is still serially underappreciated
[54:23.320 --> 54:29.120]  for what a force it is not just not just as a service in an app,
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.820]  but as a financial as a business.
[54:32.820 --> 54:38.620]  Yeah, I agree with them and I think it's it's funny
[54:38.620 --> 54:44.020]  because it's complicated as Facebook itself as a product is in my opinion.
[54:44.020 --> 54:46.920]  It's a pretty simple story financially.
[54:46.920 --> 54:50.120]  It's you know, they sell a lot of ads into the feed
[54:50.120 --> 54:57.020]  and they make people pay to get placement and because everybody uses it.
[54:57.020 --> 55:00.920]  It's worth it and therefore, you know, the money is growing,
[55:00.920 --> 55:03.920]  you know, whereas Twitter is a much simpler product
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.620]  and any kind of argument they try to make as to how they're going to make money is my eyes roll back in my head
[55:09.620 --> 55:12.620]  and I fall asleep because I don't understand.
[55:12.620 --> 55:14.920]  Yeah, I mean there there is something to that
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.820]  and I think the the Facebook ad unit is like the best ad unit in in like in tech.
[55:19.820 --> 55:25.520]  I mean, it's like people are looking at that feed multiple times a day every day more and more
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.520]  and in a Facebook ad takes over your entire screen.
[55:29.520 --> 55:30.820]  It might only be for a few seconds,
[55:30.820 --> 55:35.820]  but for a few seconds like your entire screen is filled with an ad which on the web was never the case.
[55:35.820 --> 55:37.920]  Like the ads were always off to the side.
[55:37.920 --> 55:40.020]  They were accompanying stuff and so they were easy.
[55:40.020 --> 55:43.920]  They were much easier to ignore and now it's super compelling.
[55:43.920 --> 55:46.720]  What the other thing is those you safe you say Twitter is simple.
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.720]  I almost wonder if this is a like we talked about with with when we talk about forestall like we're used to it
[55:52.720 --> 55:55.820]  and it feels simple and 140 characters seem simple,
[55:55.820 --> 55:59.520]  but then you start trying to explain to people like oh don't start your tooth
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.820]  and at mention or some people still use RT or MT like there's all these kind of conventions
[56:05.820 --> 56:09.120]  that actually Twitter's Twitter is pretty complicated
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.620]  and and there's a lot of stuff like I think the last really smart thing
[56:13.620 --> 56:18.020]  Twitter did from a product perspective was the native retweet
[56:18.020 --> 56:20.720]  because that did simplify a convention
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.320]  and there's so much other stuff that's cruft that's risen up like these multi tweets
[56:25.320 --> 56:32.120]  or the tweet storms and like all this and attaching photos to to an image like that.
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.220]  The company I find it's so frustrating
[56:34.220 --> 56:36.720]  because they're doing all the stuff and they're buying these things
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.220]  and they're we're going to do developer tools
[56:38.220 --> 56:43.120]  and all this sort of crap when it's like there's so much low-hanging fruit just from a product perspective
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.120]  and from an onboarding perspective, which is still a disaster.
[56:47.120 --> 56:49.720]  Yeah, I know what you mean it's it comes I think it can come across
[56:49.720 --> 56:56.220]  it comes across even to my eyes as very jargony like computer jargony with all the RTs and MTs
[56:56.220 --> 57:00.620]  and honestly even I think people get the at username
[57:00.620 --> 57:05.020]  and it's certainly one of the I think it's the most powerful asset Twitter has I really do
[57:05.020 --> 57:12.220]  is the fact that when you turn on TV doesn't matter whether it's politics or sports.
[57:12.220 --> 57:14.620]  It's like the people who are on TV.
[57:14.620 --> 57:17.120]  They tell you their name and they tell you their Twitter handle.
[57:17.120 --> 57:22.520]  Yep, and people get that and that is super valuable.
[57:22.820 --> 57:25.220]  But I think and combine that with hashtags
[57:25.220 --> 57:28.620]  and to me the whole thing comes across looking very jargony.
[57:28.620 --> 57:32.720]  Yeah, I mean I could we could do the whole rest of the show on my feelings on hashtags,
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.320]  but I know I realize they've taken off
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.720]  and I realize that people somewhat get them and that regular people do use them.
[57:38.720 --> 57:43.420]  But I do feel that it contributes to a visual jargony ness
[57:43.420 --> 57:45.920]  when you especially for new users where you're you know,
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.720]  you look at this stuff and they see all these weird punctuation characters,
[57:48.720 --> 57:51.320]  you know and starts to look like programming code
[57:51.320 --> 57:54.320]  and the weird short hands like RT and MT and stuff like that.
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.220]  Yeah. No, I think I think we might have talked about Twitter
[57:58.220 --> 57:59.320]  when I very first time in the show,
[57:59.320 --> 58:03.020]  but I'm still I'm still like there now they're messing with the timeline
[58:03.020 --> 58:04.920]  like there's a while you were gone and stuff.
[58:04.920 --> 58:10.920]  I honestly think like the timeline is such at this point as so much cruft associated with it.
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.820]  It's fantastic for all of us who are familiar with Twitter
[58:14.820 --> 58:18.620]  and used to it, but I it's pretty intimidating for a new user
[58:18.620 --> 58:21.720]  and I wish they would re-embrace lists
[58:21.720 --> 58:26.320]  and like have channels and the idea that you could like a new user
[58:26.320 --> 58:27.620]  should be able to come under in the World Cup
[58:27.620 --> 58:32.020]  and dip into the World Cup channel without having to like you don't want to like what's
[58:32.020 --> 58:36.320]  you don't want to follow people in the World Cup every day of the year.
[58:36.320 --> 58:37.820]  You just want to dip in and dip out
[58:37.820 --> 58:42.020]  and there's no dip in and dip out experience for a new user on Twitter right now.
[58:42.020 --> 58:44.820]  Yeah, I think and I think it kind of gets into some of the stuff
[58:44.820 --> 58:47.220]  that Evan Williams has was writing about
[58:47.220 --> 58:49.320]  and talking about in the last couple of weeks,
[58:49.320 --> 58:56.720]  you know with the whole when when Instagram passed Twitter in terms of I forget the metric
[58:56.720 --> 58:58.720]  monthly average users users.
[58:58.720 --> 59:04.020]  Yeah active users and he was like, I don't give a shit how many monthly active users Instagram has,
[59:04.020 --> 59:05.620]  you know, and he has a great argument
[59:05.620 --> 59:07.820]  and it's you know, the line can be taken out of context
[59:07.820 --> 59:09.520]  and make it look like he's arrogant or whatever
[59:09.520 --> 59:12.820]  and you read his you know essay on it on medium
[59:12.820 --> 59:16.620]  and it's unsurprisingly for Evan Williams very very thoughtful
[59:16.620 --> 59:20.120]  and he's right and it's you know, when there's you know,
[59:20.120 --> 59:24.820]  Twitter's has important uses that you just would never do on on Instagram.
[59:24.820 --> 59:29.720]  Like when there were the the uprising in Egypt and stuff like that
[59:29.720 --> 59:34.120]  and people use hashtags to get the news out and it you know,
[59:34.120 --> 59:38.220]  breaking news and stuff like that happens in a way on Twitter
[59:38.220 --> 59:41.920]  that there's no equivalent on any other service.
[59:41.920 --> 59:44.220]  The stuff in Ferguson's, you know,
[59:44.220 --> 59:52.620]  the St. Louis demonstrations and stuff like that all had a part on Twitter.
[59:52.620 --> 59:57.420]  I mean, I think that it's Twitter is central to the way that the the protesters
[59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.520]  have organized for things like that and there's it's just unique
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.920]  but I feel like the thing that Twitter Twitter though,
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.620]  you know Evan Williams doesn't run Twitter anymore.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:11.620]  And I feel like the problem is that Twitter has gotten at a leadership level gotten caught up
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:18.120]  in that sort of Facebook ask monthly average users as an important metric
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.020]  which is tied them up because I feel like what Twitter's natural place is
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:28.220]  for most people is far more about consumption than about actually tweeting right where
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.620]  whereas Facebook is all about everybody sharing all of their stuff with their people,
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.720]  you know with their friends and family and stuff like that.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.420]  Whereas I think the problem is well, what am I supposed to tweet?
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.920]  Maybe you're not supposed to tweet anything.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.420]  Maybe you're just supposed to you know,
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.020]  like you said get on a list or follow a hashtag for the World Cup
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:50.620]  or for your favorite team or for some sort of news event.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.220]  They are interested in and just follow along and you know,
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.820]  maybe it's like a hobby that you want to follow all the time
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.620]  or maybe it's just I just want to follow the Super Bowl until next Sunday.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.520]  Yep. No, I don't you don't want to contribute anything.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.620]  You're not tweeting. You're just following along.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.720]  No what I said when that happened the Instagram thing like my take was like,
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.020]  I'm really sad that Twitter didn't buy Instagram mainly because it
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.820]  if they had Instagram would make all the money and Twitter could just be Twitter.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.820]  Yeah, because I mean Instagram Instagram is going to make billions of dollars.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:27.620]  I mean, it's it's like Facebook but even better like you're going to scroll through your photos.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.120]  There's going to be ads in there
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  and you're going to do it anyway because you're addicted to it
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:38.220]  and and it's it's such it's so it's so obvious and Twitter surprised.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.420]  I'm surprised we don't see more ads in Instagram.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.520]  I don't know if I've ever seen one then I know that they announced it
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]  and I know that they had some demo versions of it,
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.820]  but I've still I check it almost every day and I can't remember seeing an ad in Instagram.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.520]  No, it's it's still like very limited sort of trial is one of those things
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.320]  where Facebook doesn't need to like Facebook is making so much money right now that they can
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.120]  I mean they can spend billions of dollars on whatever they want to and not and not monetize
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.420]  and it's I almost I almost think it's it's smart not just from a they want to do it the right way,
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:14.320]  but it's smart from a they can always turn that faucet on if they need to
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.720]  and and like what's the rush the stock market loves them.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.620]  They're flying high they they have like pretty much
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.620]  they're as independent as a independent company can be for the most part.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.820]  I mean just from a one the stock market loves them in two Zuckerberg controls everything anyway.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.220]  So I from that perspective, you know, what's what's the rush right?
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.820]  And the gist of it as I you know,
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.520]  I don't know I agree with you I'm surprised we just haven't seen it yet.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.620]  I you know or just because I feel like the way to do it is a you know,
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.820]  the old slowly boiled frog,
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:51.120]  you know start them slow and then slowly dial it up to where you want it to be.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  But you got to start at some point. Yeah,
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.720]  but which they have but I think they are going slower than they need to just because they can.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:09.420]  Right. You see Tim quick Tim Cook tweeted congratulations on the box.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:13.520]  Yeah, that's surprising and I take note of that,
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.020]  you know in my because Tim Cook tweets
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:24.220]  and I'm almost dead certain that it's actually him doing the tweeting.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.320]  But he doesn't tweet very often right?
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.520]  And so it's usually worth noting and I know he tweeted earlier in the week
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:36.320]  or I guess it's almost a week ago now for Martin Luther King Day holiday here in the US
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.520]  and you know, he's repeatedly, you know,
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.420]  his two heroes are Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.520]  So no surprise that he would tweet something like that.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.020]  You know a nice thing for Apple CEO to tweet but not necessarily newsworthy,
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.920]  but him tweeting to you know box on an IPO is to me a little interesting.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.920]  Totally there's I mean for what I've seen on Twitter,
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.620]  there's been a fair bit of speculation already
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.720]  and that's like you should just like raised eyebrows.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.420]  Yeah, I don't know. I kind of feel like it's you know,
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.120]  an IPO one thing about an IPO is it certainly it doesn't mean
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.520]  that box is not going to be acquired by somebody else,
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.320]  but it certainly makes it a lot less likely
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.920]  and you know,
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.320]  I think Apple is happier in a world where more companies like box IPO
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.520]  and stay independent satellites of the you know,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.320]  the mammoth Titans like Microsoft and Facebook
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.220]  and Google then a world where every company that gets to that size
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.120]  and stability gets acquired by somebody absolutely.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.820]  I think because Apple is not going to do those acquisitions,
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.020]  right Apple is never going to be the one that that acquires a lot of companies
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:56.320]  and therefore it means that most of those companies would be going into companies
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.920]  that are more like competitors to Apple like Google or Microsoft or Facebook.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.120]  Or you know, what have you know, that's how I read.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.320]  I read it as a really great that I think that's exactly it.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.220]  That's how I read it because I feel like Apple can you know happily
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.720]  and wholeheartedly partner with box on things like the you know,
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:25.220]  the extent you know, the file sharing integration in Yosemite and iOS 8.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.520]  And would be a lot less likely to do that
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.620]  if they thought box was going to be acquired by Google.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.620]  Even though it's an open API that everybody can do.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.020]  So I guess who you know after box would you know Dropbox would be next right?
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.520]  Yeah, and I think Neil Seibert like formerly Sammy the Walrus
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.120]  like he was one of those kind of speckling about it
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.520]  and he's like well would Apple do the same for Dropbox
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.920]  and I think for the reason you said yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.720]  And I think when they demoed extensions, I think they had both box and Dropbox.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.420]  Yes there and I think that's yeah Apple
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.020]  and it's a good it's the exact sort of relationship Apple Apple likes
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.620]  where they need Apple more than Apple needs them.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.720]  Yeah, I don't think you know Apple has any desire to crush Dropbox.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.920]  I really don't I mean, I know some people read into it
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.220]  and they think you know that they would just like everybody to you know,
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.720]  they want people to use iCloud drive no doubt about it.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.520]  I mean they made it so people would use it.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.620]  But if people would rather use Dropbox instead use Dropbox instead,
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.520]  you know, there's no way that they would go through the work
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.720]  to make things like Dropbox official
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.220]  because you know up until Yosemite Dropbox was just a dirty hack
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.420]  to integrate with the finder.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:34.920]  That's right.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.520]  They actually they did like things for Dropbox in in Yosemite
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.220]  to actually make it make it work.
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:41.720]  Yeah.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.420]  Yeah, it's all officially sanctioned
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.820]  and on the up and up those green checkboxes that show you,
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:49.720]  you know, like in the finder view when you're looking at something your Dropbox.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.820]  Dropbox is the one I use.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.820]  I don't use box.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.720]  I don't use any of the other third-party ones,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.920]  but I use Dropbox and now you get these official green checkmarks
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.620]  that you never got before.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.020]  Like when you used to get like a little badge on your finder icon
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.820]  that would show you that a file was syncing to Dropbox
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.820]  and then it would go green when it was there.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.820]  That was all using private APIs,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.520]  you know on Dropbox's part and you know to their credit.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.220]  I've been using Dropbox from very early days
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:23.620]  and I'm very loathe always have been loathe to install third-party extension.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.620]  That are using private APIs on Mac OS X
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.420]  but Dropbox, you know Dropbox the features were worth it
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.220]  and but I've always been like one foot,
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.120]  you know, like hey if I ever see problems
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.620]  if the finder starts going wacky,
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.220]  you know, you're out the door
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.120]  but they've never really been a problem.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.520]  No, they've always been they're very very very excellently engineered
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.120]  for something that was using private APIs.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.020]  And I also think it's interesting.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.420]  I always thought when they announced that at you at WWDC.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.320]  I specifically thought about Dropbox
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.820]  a because I'm the most familiar with them
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.220]  and I use them and be because they had their own thing
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.520]  that was working and in my experience
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.820]  and I think most people's experience.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.920]  I don't I've never heard of anybody say wow Dropbox,
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.620]  you know, it's crash makes my computer crash
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.720]  or anything like that or corrupts my file system,
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.520]  but they had their own thing.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.420]  Would they be willing to dump their own thing
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.420]  that they'd spent all that work on to use Apple's thing
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.320]  and they did they've done the right thing
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.120]  and I wonder how much of that is,
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.720]  you know that they they considered a good allocation
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.220]  of engineering resources to go with the official APIs
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.020]  in Yosemite and how much of it
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.220]  because they still have the old stuff
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.720]  because you can still run Dropbox on Mac OS 9
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.020]  and I mean 10.9.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:43.020]  I don't think it runs on OS 9 now 10.9 10.8 10.7.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.220]  I don't know how far back they go.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.120]  So they've still got to keep their their private API stuff
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.020]  going for their support of older versions of Mac OS.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.120]  And so a lot of times I think in you know,
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.220]  in my experience is watching the way the industry goes
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.420]  a lot of times and then you know,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.220]  a company isn't going to go with the new thing
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.620]  because they want to go with the backwards compatible thing
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.120]  even though it's not using a public API
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.020]  but Dropbox did the right thing which in my opinion
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.420]  the right thing which is to go with the official API
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.720]  even though it's sort of for Forks their code.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.520]  And I wonder how much of that was about engineering
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.320]  and how much of it was about politics
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.020]  and keeping a good relationship with Apple.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.220]  Yeah, I mean, I would I wouldn't be surprised
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.220]  if Apple worked with them on it
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.020]  and there was a bit of a you know, quid pro quo here
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.120]  like, you know, you got not a quid pro quo,
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.320]  but like, like, okay, we'll help you fix this.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.720]  But you I mean, you have to adopt on day one.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.120]  Yeah, and I and as a user it was seamless.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.220]  I didn't even notice when they switched over.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.820]  I think at some point because I you know,
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.520]  I've been running Yosemite since the public beta is in summer
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.920]  and I'm pretty sure at the time originally
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.520]  I'm almost certain that Dropbox didn't already support it.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.420]  I didn't even notice I actually didn't notice
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.020]  when Dropbox started supporting it until one day.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.720]  I was like, oh, they're obviously are
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.320]  because I've got the new style checkmarks
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.920]  not the ones that are superimposed on the icon.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.720]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  The other thing the other thing too is I think
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.120]  you know, Aaron Levy.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.920]  I haven't really heard anyone say a bad word about him.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.820]  I think people are are just happy that like it's been
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:22.620]  such a torturous journey for Box that they finally made it.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.120]  It's I won't be surprised.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.920]  There's just a bit of like, you know,
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.120]  Cook's just genuinely happy for him.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.520]  Yeah, I'm going to take another sponsor break.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.020]  But before I do, that's a good reminder.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.720]  I have a correction to make just a minor one.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.320]  But last on the last show with Marco,
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]  I forget what we were talking about.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:45.320]  But I said something about me running iOS 9 and what I meant
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.020]  I doubt I am not running iOS 9 I'm running iOS 8 but combine
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.320]  that with the things where like Mac rumors has like an increase
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:59.220]  in the number of hits of people running iOS 9 from Cupertino
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:02.720]  and I got I don't know a dozen emails from people asking
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.920]  whether I'm running iOS 9.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.120]  No, I'm not running iOS 9 and if I were I wouldn't be able
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.420]  to say anything about it anyway.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:14.120]  It was just a stupid with the verbal typo.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.520]  I don't know misspeak.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.320]  Yeah, there's gotta be better word on that.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.020]  Well, whatever a verbal typo is that's all it was in the same
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.820]  way that I just said that Dropbox still runs on Mac OS 9.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.320]  Yes.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.820]  Yeah, the 9 seems to be a bit of a kryptonite number for you.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.220]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.620]  I've I don't know something and I think Mac OS going to 10.10
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.820]  somehow set over my trip odometer as well.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.720]  It's like a I don't know.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.320]  Well, I should according to Urban Dictionary or verbal
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.120]  typo is a thing.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.120]  So okay, I could just call it a verbal typo.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.320]  It works for me.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.420]  Yeah, what about malaprop is malaprop to the right word?
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.520]  I don't think so, but a malaprop or malapropism is the term
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520]  for misspoken words.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.520]  Yeah, a malaprop the mistaken use of a word in place of a
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520]  similar sounding one often with an attention.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.320]  Well, that's not quite right dancing of dance of Flamingo
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.720]  instead of dance of flamenco.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.220]  Although I do make a lot of problems.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:23.720]  So I think I do I think that's a characteristic of like someone
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.920]  that like read a lot and like, you know, we I mean neither
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.920]  of us I think go out that often and then you so you encounter
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.220]  a lot of words, but then when it actually comes to articulating
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.220]  them sometimes you we I swear to God we talked about this
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.120]  on a previous episode about how we constantly mispronounce
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.420]  words. Yeah.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.720]  Yeah, because I've you know, there's there's a huge chunk
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.920]  of my vocabulary or things that I read when I was growing
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.420]  up and never heard anybody say and so I just made up my
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.120]  own punctuation or pronunciation in my in my head totally
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.920]  no idea of how it was actually supposed to be pronounced.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:04.420]  Anyway, our second sponsor is our good friends at need
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:10.020]  and EED need is a refined retailer and lifestyle publication
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.620]  for men.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:17.120]  That's their official slogan my friend Jim Ray very well
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.920]  dressed man knows his stuff really likes the stuff at need.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.620]  Has described need as a refined retailer and lifestyle
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.820]  publication for men who generally don't like retailer
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.520]  and lifestyle publications for men, which is a great way
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.020]  to put it.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.820]  So if you hear lifestyle publication for men and roll your
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.020]  eyes like not for me, maybe you should check out need
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.520]  because it's a different style and vibe each month.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.620]  Here's what need does they source and curate a selection
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.220]  of exclusive products from Brands around the world.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.220]  They're presented in a monthly editorial.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.620]  It's not just a catalog they put them in an editorial since
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.820]  they have story around it a lot like what you'd find in
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.120]  a men's magazine allowing you to find the best products
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.420]  without any need for copious shopping or research or selection.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:14.620]  They just launched volume 2.2 featuring items to help you
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.220]  make small meaningful changes in your life from amazing
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.920]  coffee to better shaving to the best bedside clock volume
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.520]  2.2 is need best collection yet.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.220]  If that's not a good fit, they've also just launched seven
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.920]  brand new essentials collections featuring the best denim
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.320]  footwear and more.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.120]  They haven't done promotional codes yet.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.220]  They're coming they are coming they're working on it.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.720]  But in the meantime talk show listeners who place an order

[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.720]  which is sort of secret other than the name.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.820]  So my thanks to them.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:25.920]  It's weird.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.020]  I feel I feel over the last few weeks.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:33.320]  I've encountered a few people that that don't drink coffee
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.220]  or they gave up coffee and I just don't understand.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.320]  I just understand what drives what drives the one to do
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:39.920]  such a thing.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.020]  They claim all they claim all I feel great, but that just
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:47.220]  reminds me of the of the Frank Sinatra quote.
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.820]  What is it?
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.920]  I feel sorry for people that don't drink because when they
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.420]  wake up in the morning, that's the best they're going to
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.020]  feel all day.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.520]  Such a great line.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.820]  I think you and Merlin talked about the the blogger the
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.420]  blogger the was a blogger drinking routine or something
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.020]  like that.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.020]  Basically you tell what time it is by what you're drinking
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:09.520]  in the morning.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.120]  It's coffee.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.920]  Then it's a like SodaStream and then it's scotch or something
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.220]  on those lines and that's that's about how you know what
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.720]  time it or Martini in your case.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.620]  I said, yeah, exactly.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.620]  Well, I don't drink martinis every day.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.120]  I am all over the place on alcohol.
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.820]  I'm trying to expand my palette.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.820]  I just linked to I'm so proud of it.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:28.420]  I don't know.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:33.720]  Sometimes I really like to I like it when I my linking to
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.720]  something like blows it up a guy named do you see this this
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.820]  guy named Mark by law?
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.720]  I did I put it in my Amazon cards loan problems.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.220]  It's this big book and they don't you know, they don't
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.720]  ship does that want to think the back story on this is I
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.420]  don't remember where I saw it.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.920]  I don't remember and it's you do you ever pre-order stuff
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.520]  from Amazon?
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.320]  I do it all the time.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.420]  It's like sending gifts to myself because I always forget
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.520]  always forget and so it was like at some point December.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.520]  I got a thing from Amazon and it was close to Christmas
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.220]  really close.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.520]  It might have been like the 23rd or something like that
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.820]  and I had no pending gifts coming everything I had ordered
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.720]  had already shown up.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.220]  I'd gotten everything done at a read, you know, not last
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.220]  minute and and a thing came and I assumed it was for my
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.420]  wife and instead it was addressed to me.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.120]  It was from Amazon.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:19.820]  I thought shit.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.320]  I don't remember I don't I have no idea what this is.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.220]  I open it up and here it is the Whiskey cabinet this beautiful
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.320]  beautiful book by Mark by law and then I remembered oh a
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.120]  couple months ago.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.220]  I pre-ordered this.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.020]  Oh, here it is and I thought this book is beautiful.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.420]  It is beautiful photography beautiful paper beautiful
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.920]  typography and you know, and I couldn't wait to read it.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.720]  I was very excited.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:46.320]  I went up and it is just so it's such a weird coincidence
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320]  because you know, I'm terrible.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.220]  I'll go days.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.820]  I literally go days without checking my email sometimes.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:54.520]  Oh, it's I was just talking about this like I get less
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.020]  email than like when I worked at Microsoft for example way
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.720]  less but it's so much more of a burden now because it's
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.620]  not my job like it's pure additive.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.220]  Whereas before like I lived in it.
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.320]  So it was it was like almost more tolerable.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.420]  This was a day where I had gotten caught up on my inbox
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.920]  and I had was, you know down to the inbox zero at least
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.720]  for like, you know this week and I had two new emails one
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.020]  was junk and the other was from Mark by lock and I was
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.520]  like what that's crazy.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.720]  The same guy's name is what's on the book and he's like,
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.920]  hey, you know, no idea if you're interested.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  I just written a book on whiskey.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.220]  You might be interested.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.020]  No, no, you know, I know no pressure to link it up or
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.220]  anything.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.520]  I just thought you might want a complimentary copy.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.820]  Tell me where to send it and I'll send one.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.920]  I did it was like literally after it right after I answered
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.020]  the ding-dong of the UPS giving me the book that I'd paid
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.420]  for so I quick snapped a photo with my phone and I was
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.020]  like too late.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.420]  I pre-ordered it months ago.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.120]  That's awesome was just like an amazing story.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.320]  Anyway, long story short.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.620]  I read the book and I loved it.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:58.520]  So I linked it up on during fireball and it like sold out
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.120]  at Amazon.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.320]  So they have to like they had like order more from his
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.320]  publisher or something like that. No, I mean III can certainly
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:06.720]  relate.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.820]  I mean, I think I mean back when I back when I first I mean
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:14.420]  what I started Sir Techery with the I had a five-year plan.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.820]  Like I thought maybe in five years I could make, you know,
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:19.920]  make a living from it and then like move back to Taiwan and
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.020]  you know, which is we wanted to do and and obviously it's
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.720]  taken off far more quickly than than than I anticipated.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.720]  I haven't it's not even two years old yet.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:34.920]  Um, but uh, but I mean the big kind of the the real big jump
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.020]  was I might have told this story the talks were previously
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.920]  but was you linking to it and saying, you know, it's great
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.820]  new blog and stuff like that, but it was funny about it.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.420]  And sorry if I've told this one before but I got an email
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:50.120]  from you like saying oh wow, you've been really prolific
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.020]  really great stuff.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.320]  By the way, I noticed and you like went on this like three
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.620]  paragraph dissertation on a bad word choice.
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:59.220]  I had made and you're like, oh, I always make the same mistake
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:20:59.620]  as well.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.220]  So I actually have a script and fix it when I do a while.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.620]  It's like what the etymology of the word and how it was used
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.120]  all sort of stuff and it was it was so classic like the
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.620]  John Gruber that you know, anyone might imagine and so
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.520]  right after that I can open up Google Analytics.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.720]  I started like refreshing your page.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.520]  I'm like, I bet he's gonna link to me soon and then like
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.620]  like 30 minutes later.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:18.920]  Boom.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.220]  There it was and but I mean, I'll take the opportunity now
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.620]  being your show to thank you for that because it certainly
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:31.120]  was um, you know a good you know, I think I when you went
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.820]  to me, I probably had like 600 followers on Twitter and
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.720]  within a couple days I had about 1500 and I mean obviously
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.520]  I've gotten a lot since then but that that was certainly
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.820]  kind of the the ignition or jumpstart.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.820]  So thanks John.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:45.920]  I do that.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.520]  I if I see a typo or something like that and something I'm
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.020]  going to link to I do try to come to and I know if I know
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.920]  the person at all do try to tell them it before but I never
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:59.320]  say that I'm going to link to it because I I don't know I
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.820]  don't want to lock yourself in.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.020]  Well, partly I don't want to lock myself in what if I change
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:04.820]  my mind?
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.420]  What if I think you know what it's not worth linking to and
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:11.120]  the other part is it somehow sounds a little presumptuous.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:11.920]  It's to me.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.320]  It's like if I just say hey you have a typo here.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320]  It's like I'm doing you a favor.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.220]  I'm pointing it out if I say I'm you know, I'm about to link
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.120]  to you but you have a typo.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.120]  It's all it feels a little bit more like I'm not linking
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.420]  to you until you fix this typo.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.520]  Yeah, right.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.320]  And I don't want to put that you know, I don't want to put
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.120]  any pressure on them.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.120]  I should I should I should find out what the word was.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.920]  Yeah, we could look up the email later.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.720]  I'm sure but anyway, it made me think of that book by Mark
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.420]  Bylock because the whole gist of the book is it's it's not
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:42.020]  comprehensive.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.220]  It's not an encyclopedia.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:49.320]  It's just a sort of I would guess maybe like a hundred whiskies
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.220]  from around the world, you know, Scotland Ireland United States
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:58.920]  Canada Japan and like his you know, expert opinion and discussion
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.720]  on what makes the different region, you know, what are the
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.920]  traditions and you know, what makes them different and what
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.720]  you should be looking for if you're you know, if you like
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.320]  one and you know, I'm mostly a US bourbon ride drinker.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.820]  But you know, I'm I really like it.
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.520]  And so I've you know, I've been trying to expand my palate
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.820]  to other things around the world.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.320]  I think there's something about it not being comprehensive
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.720]  like and that just makes it so much more accessible.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.120]  Right and again, I have from years and years ago and he has
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.220]  the unfortunately coincidental name Michael Jackson.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.120]  He's a famous famous beer writer.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.820]  Like I drank a beer a lot more before I got into any kind
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:42.720]  of spirits and it's a useful it's it's just a different type
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.220]  of book but Michael Jackson has like a beer book.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.720]  That's encyclopedic.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.620]  It is I you know, no, I guess no, you know beers.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.620]  There's so many microbrews.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.720]  I don't think anybody could cover them all but it I think
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.920]  it's probably more like thousands of beers than hundreds
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.420]  of beers.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:58.720]  Yeah.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.620]  No, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.320]  And I share the fee for the beer by the way.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:08.220]  I did find the email I wrote I wrote this jives with data
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:12.520]  showing little cyclicality and Android purchases jive is a
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.720]  dance or an adjective for us black slang.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.420]  The word you want is jive and this is what killed me is
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.620]  you had verb bracket.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.520]  No objective bracket informal be in a court semicolon agree
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.520]  like it was like literally a dictionary definition.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.220]  It wasn't like a offhand.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.020]  This is what it means.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.920]  It was like they had the nomenclature of a dictionary definition
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.820]  that like I note this because I have was always to use jive
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.820]  with a G when I'm at J and you actually said you you created
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.720]  a Texas Banner snippet to fix it automatically.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:47.220]  So yeah, that's a comment still kicks in every time I try
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.320]  to use I always use the wrong.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.820]  Well as you note confusingly enough jive as a verb means
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.320]  make insulting or mocking your remarks cheer, which is actually
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.320]  very close to in the alternate meanings of jive, which is
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.420]  taut or sneer at right?
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.820]  Yeah, it's very confusing.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.420]  Wait, so which is the one we want when we say that it's
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.020]  in agreement with something jive j-i-b-e your problem is
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.020]  you say g-i-b-e and I said j-i-v-e which is like a dance
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.220]  right, right, right, right, right.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.120]  Yeah, I actually now that I think about it.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.220]  I think I've finally gotten that down and I do tend to type
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.420]  it right because if I had to guess I would have right there.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.820]  I would have guessed j-i-b-e.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.420]  Yep.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.020]  So, uh, no you that's that's the word jive.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.920]  That's the type of thing that you get when your pals with
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.220]  me and your your ability to be a pal with you determines
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:36.420]  on whether you find that endearing or just absolutely irritating.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:40.720]  Yeah, also some sad news the report ends up Michael Jackson
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.020]  the beer hunter died in 2007.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:50.820]  So my condolences to his family, but his his world guide
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.720]  to beer, I don't know how many beers are in there.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.520]  But anyway, it's not that type of book The Whiskey Cabinet.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.820]  It's you know, I think he's got like like I said, probably
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.320]  under a hundred.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320]  I don't know in the book, but it's you know, just a couple
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.620]  from each region in each style.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.320]  It's too bad for Michael Jackson that he never liked.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.120]  He didn't even get a single year of his life where he was
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.120]  the only Michael Jackson.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.220]  Oh, that's right.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.420]  I guess he died first.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.020]  Wow, that's really a shame.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:21.320]  I had a little bit of that with that Jonathan Gruber economist
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.220]  guy. So what percentage of those tweets did you retweet?
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.920]  Oh, only the I would say maybe 10% of them.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.320]  Wow, so you retweeted quite a few and they were all hilarious.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.820]  Yeah, that was that was a real quick on and off.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.520]  It was like a week-long firestorm.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.020]  I know if I do think I thank the maker that the guy's name
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.320]  was Jonathan not John.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.420]  I don't know if he goes by John or what and at first when
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.420]  it first started breaking there were an awful lot more John
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.420]  groupers and he's you know, because he's Jonathan he's John
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.120]  so it is spelled differently, but that's certainly I mean,
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.520]  I you know when you are named John you're very sensitive
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.520]  to the H no H thing but it's you know, let's face it, you
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.520]  know, that's very typical mistake, you know, like half the
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.020]  half the I well.
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.720]  I'd say a third of the Valentine's I got in elementary
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.920]  school or spelled jon a third were spelled correctly and
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.520]  a third were spelled jonh.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.020]  I can totally sympathize because I'm I'm I'm Benjamin
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.120]  Thompson and Thompson actually has like multiple spellings
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.720]  like right for the P at P nope and it's so it's so unfair
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.120]  because I both have a boring name and I have to spell it
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.320]  all the time like it should be one of the other like if you
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.720]  have to spell the time it should because you have a really
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.920]  kick-ass name that no one's heard of before right, but
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.920]  no, I have to spell all the time and I'm just Benjamin
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.320]  Thompson. So right.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.720]  So somebody who does something famous or infamous named
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.820]  Ben Thompson, but with no P is not the same name as you
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.520]  but you're going to get conflated it.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.520]  Well, I do appreciate that my nemesis on Google when I was
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.920]  trying to be the top result for Ben Thompson, which I which
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.120]  I am now was Ben Thompson lawman and like the top article
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.720]  from his badass of the week.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.020]  I like well if I'm going to get confused with someone I'll
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.820]  get confused with the badass of the week.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.220]  Wow.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.720]  I just noticed I just I haven't done this in a while.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.420]  I don't know if it's true for you for years.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.220]  I I even gave up on it.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.420]  I was not the top search in Google for Gruber just Gruber
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.020]  it was always Gruber Industries the people but this might
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:21.720]  be because I'm not signed in.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.720]  What do you get if you search Google for group during Fireball
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.120]  huh?
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.920]  See I get different I get twitter.com slash if I'm not
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.220]  signed in I get Jonathan Gruber the economist and then
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.420]  Daring Fireballs next and then John Gruber Twitter, but
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.420]  the other thing is because I'm in Taiwan.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.020]  So there's all that stuff that affects it.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.720]  I have a VPN here, but I won't sign in so probably mess
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:41.520]  up my connection.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.520]  Yeah, I haven't searched for years.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.720]  I because I honestly don't I don't know I'm vain in other
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.620]  ways, but I'm not super I realize I I've I have good enough
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.520]  Google juice but Gruber.com used to come up first for years
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.320]  and years and years.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.120]  It's some kind of industrial company down in Arizona who
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.820]  got the domain name like in 1993 much to my chagrin.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:06.520]  Yeah, I can't help but think and but I've never really heard
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.220]  anything about them.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:10.420]  I can't help but think that there was some kind of rearranging
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:14.920]  of Google's algorithm that they used to favor search term
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.520]  in the.com over anything else.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:21.520]  Oh, but for years and years and years, but Gruber.com doesn't
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.720]  even show up in my first page.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.820]  Stupid Jonathan Gruber guy.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:31.720]  What it got me so many but anyway, the best thing that happened
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.920]  with that was that at some point during the week where he
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.820]  was really in the news people who don't know like he said
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:40.920]  something about like Obamacare passed by because people were
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.020]  stupid or something like that.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.020]  He is a world-renowned economist at MIT and his specialty
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:52.420]  is health care legislature and he wrote the Massachusetts
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.020]  law or helped write the Massachusetts health care law that
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.420]  Mitt Romney when it it's this whole, you know, I don't want
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.320]  to get into the politics of it but this weird situation
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.120]  where it was a health care law that gave everybody in Massachusetts
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.720]  universal health care coverage in a Republican style because
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.020]  they had a Republican governor who eventually went on to run
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:17.320]  for president and the way that President Obama went about
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.320]  trying to get health care was instead of pursuing a traditionally
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.920]  Democratic style, you know, which is single-payer single-payer
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.720]  was like look I just want people to have health care.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.120]  Let's go the Republican route and and you know, follow the
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.720]  Massachusetts model and you know ended up being you know,
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:35.920]  obviously it's a political hot button thing.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:40.320]  Anyway, he was also a consultant on the national version
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.620]  of this law and then years ago.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.120]  This is what the weird thing about it is that it wasn't
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.520]  something he said recently, but it was like years ago at
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.620]  some kind of conference for other economists.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.820]  So he wasn't speaking to the public had no, you know was
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.820]  being videotaped obviously, but you know, wasn't he's not
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.320]  a politician.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.320]  It wasn't going to go spread wide. It was this discussion
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:06.120]  about how the word tax is just toxic in American political
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.420]  culture and so to pay for the new health care law, they
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.520]  couldn't call anything they did to raise money for it attacks
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.920]  and so they called it.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.620]  I don't know what a subsidy instead.
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:19.220]  There's some kind of way that through the the vagaries of
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:24.220]  the way that the US Congress budget department classifies
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.520]  different types of legislature.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]  It wouldn't be called a tax.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.320]  It would be called a subsidy but it's a Rose by any other
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:32.820]  name. It's people paying more money to a collection that
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:37.420]  would then be distributed to pay for the mechanics of the
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:42.220]  law and his explanation was very it was honest, but it was
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:45.820]  more or less that the you know, American voters are too stupid
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:48.320]  to know the difference, but you know that calling it something
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.520]  else doesn't make it something else, right?
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.320]  Which is true in a sense, but you know, I mean in a way that
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.920]  but it was taken by Republicans as an insult that he was,
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:02.020]  you know, that the law was passed under false pretenses
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.020]  and he became, you know, the public enemy number one of
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:11.520]  American Republicans and an awful lot of them thought we
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.720]  did at Gruber at Gruber was because they would like I even
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.220]  if they went so far as to see what at Gruber was and then
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.320]  saw it was in fact, somebody named John Gruber whether it
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.720]  had an H or not and he had a bunch of followers.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.520]  They just assumed it was him and so for about a week.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:35.320]  I was inundated with vitriolic and I think part of it is
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:39.020]  that you had to make a mistake to do that which increased
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.420]  the chance that the people doing it weren't really the
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:44.020]  sharpest pencils in the case.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.720]  And so I took to retreating some of them.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.020]  It was it was interesting.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.520]  It was you know, if you think that like the vitriol that I get
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.220]  you know from let's say Android fanatics when I say something
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.320]  disparaging about Android or something like that if you
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.620]  think that's harsh the way that the political stuff is
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.820]  is just unbelievable.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:07.120]  It's it's it's yeah, it's incredible.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.320]  Yeah people.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.820]  I mean just seriously saying things like, you know, go kill
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.220]  yourself at Gruber.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:16.820]  I mean, no no exaggeration and I do know it just occurred
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.620]  to me and I would write back to some of them some of them
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:21.920]  I would retweet some of them I would tweak a little and
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.820]  then some of them I would just write back totally honest.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:26.520]  It's like did you you know, what were you thinking?
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:28.620]  You know, were you thinking that I would see this when
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:32.020]  you wrote it, you know, like what goes through your mind
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.520]  if you're doing that do you do you assume do you think
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.620]  that the Jonathan Gruber was going to read that and perhaps
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.620]  feel bad about himself because here's somebody wishing you
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.320]  would kill him like kill himself.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.520]  Why would you write that like what is going through your
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.620]  mind? How can you go through your day with so much hate?
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:51.020]  I it was interesting to me.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.820]  It's like the extreme opposite of like we were talking
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:57.220]  about before like the ability to like see a product through
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.020]  someone's eyes.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.920]  It's like just a complete and utter lack of empathy.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.420]  Yeah, and I you know, I could you go through the rest of
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.220]  your life like that or does this only spew out on Twitter?
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.320]  And then there were a few people who I tweaked I told
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.820]  some people that we were I was we were going to next the
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.020]  next step was we were going to come take your guns.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.520]  Wait, wait until next year when we come take your guns.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.620]  It's a health care issue.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.520]  They're like, I'd like to see you try and it's like we're
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:28.220]  on our way.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.720]  You tell some of these people you're coming to take their
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.720]  guns and it really riles them up.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.620]  Those are the best.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.220]  Anyway, that's died off for the most part.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.620]  But it really elevated this guy in the Twitter rankings
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.320]  for Gruber though.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.320]  Jeez.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.120]  Anyway, but it's the best thing to happen.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:48.820]  I know it was Fox in particular.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.720]  It was really helped but Fox News.
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.920]  It was very clear to me as like probably the second most
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.020]  interested observer in the country that they they there
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.720]  must have been a memo that circulated with and I don't
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.920]  think it had anything to do with me.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.620]  I don't think had anything to do with me, but they they
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.220]  they clarified they unified on Jonathan Gruber instead of
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.120]  John Gruber MIT economists.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.620]  They at first when the when the whole thing first broke it
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.620]  was like half and half where they would spell it jon or
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.920]  spell out the whole Jonathan and about halfway through the
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.520]  week Fox started consistently calling him Jonathan Gruber
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.820]  and it helped a lot.
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.620]  I think interesting.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:30.220]  Well, maybe you know your friendship with Clayton Morrison
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.620]  helped out there, you know, I thought about it.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.820]  I actually had was like at the it's funny because I was
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.620]  thinking about it and I was halfway thinking maybe I should
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.720]  write to Clayton and and just say, you know, I know you
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.020]  can't do anything about this whole thing.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.720]  But if you could just you know, pass the word around to
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.120]  call the guy Jonathan instead of John I would appreciate
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.320]  it but I never even had to do that.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.220]  It seemed like Fox it happened on its own.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.520]  Much much to the decrease in entertainment for the rest
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.020]  of us.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.220]  Yeah, only other thing I could see in the news this week
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:03.320]  was other than the big Microsoft stuff, which I do want
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.820]  to talk about but you see Mark Gurman's report on Apple
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.220]  Watch. Yeah, somebody at Apple sold him there.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.420]  Yeah, which is a little weird.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.620]  I thought the more interesting thing that he had was that
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.120]  according to Mark Gurman and it's unnamed source at Apple
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:23.020]  that they have 3,000 units already in use by Apple employees.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.920]  Although he doesn't say by Apple employees, but from what
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.920]  I understand, you know, I had heard a few weeks ago that
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.220]  there were a thousand in use.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.020]  So German says 3,000 it could just be that they've expanded
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.120]  it but it's all that they are all in the hands of Apple
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.520]  employees. Well, I mean you it you have to think it's relatively
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.520]  easy to pull off.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:45.420]  I mean more even more so than that than a phone.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.720]  I mean, I guess the kind of screen being black is a bit
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:54.020]  of a giveaway, but I mean a watch watches a watch and especially
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.320]  now I mean, I mean California never gets particularly cold,
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.820]  but people are more likely wearing long sleeves and jackets
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.520]  and stuff like that.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.020]  It's kind of an ideal time to do it.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.320]  I've thought for weeks like when I heard weeks ago that
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.120]  there were a thousand of them in use I was a little surprised
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.320]  we haven't seen more because I remember in the six-month
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:14.120]  run-up to the iPhone coming out there were none of them
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.620]  leaked. It wasn't like the time the iPhone 4, you know was
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:20.520]  found in a bar but there were like a steady stream of here's
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:23.920]  a here's a blurry shot of a guy on Bart who was using an
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.820]  iPhone until I took out my you know camera phone to take
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.020]  a picture of him and then he put it back in his pocket, you
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.120]  know, but they were always there were a steady stream of
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.520]  reports of people who'd spotted Apple employees with iPhones
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.120]  before it came out at the end of June and I haven't seen
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.320]  the single peep of anybody saying, you know, I saw a guy
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.220]  with an Apple Watch at such-and-such.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:43.220]  No, that's a good point.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.820]  I think it's you know, I think it's like what you said a
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.420]  watch is just to you know, especially if you're being even
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:52.520]  just a little bit circumspect about when you take it out
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.120]  when you're not at work or at home.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.820]  It's really really hard to notice that somebody's got an
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.720]  Apple Watch that said I mean, I mean I saw someone using
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.120]  using a smartwatch the other day and it was like it was
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:05.720]  super obvious.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.820]  He's using a smartwatch.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.120]  So maybe they're just not using them in public.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.920]  Maybe that's part of the instruction.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.020]  Well, my understanding is the instruction is you're allowed
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.920]  to use it and take it and if anybody even asks they are
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.120]  allowed to say yes, it's an Apple Watch I work for Apple,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.920]  but they're not allowed certainly not allowed to take
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.620]  it off and they're not allowed to do any kind of demonstration.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.320]  Yeah, and they are but they're allowed to say but I'm not
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320]  allowed to do a demonstration.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.620]  That's one of the benefits of having announced it already
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.020]  is there's there's nothing to hide.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:34.120]  Right.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.420]  There's nothing to hide and and what you see when you're
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.820]  not using it is all you know, you'll get a much better view
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.120]  of it on Apple.com than you will on somebody's wrist.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.120]  It's interesting.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.420]  I mean, we think the last time I was on we were talking
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:47.720]  about all about the watch and it was funny because I have
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.920]  a spidey sense when you're gonna invite me on the talk show.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:53.320]  So I kind of I kind of have an idea that this week was
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.720]  going to be one of those weeks the same thing with the
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:39:00.320]  watch thing probably because I to be clear I result to that
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.320]  to be clear.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.920]  I asked you to be on about 30 seconds before we started
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.420]  recording.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.920]  It's a little bit of exaggeration, but it was funny.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.320]  I swear to God today.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:10.920]  I went to the gym.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.620]  I came back and I was I don't know why I was thinking about
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.820]  I think I was listening to last week's episode while I was
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:19.720]  working out and I was like, oh, I think I was thinking like
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.020]  oh, I actually I thought John was gonna have me on this week,
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:25.020]  but I guess not and then like 30 minutes later got a message
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:25.420]  from you.
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.820]  I know it's a little late but uh, do you have time today?
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:37.620]  But uh, no, I mean one thing with the watch is the another
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.720]  product actually pretty intrigued about is the Amazon Echo
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.220]  like the box in your room.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.820]  And the reason I am and I'm actually much more intrigued
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:48.320]  by that than I ever was by the fire phone and I think people
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.720]  kind of just dismissed out of hand because it came on the
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.820]  heels of the fire phone but like it sounds stupid but the
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.820]  idea of just like talking to something instead of like
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:00.820]  pulling something out of your pocket and then talking to
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.720]  it or with the watches looking at your wrist instead of
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.120]  pulling out your phone and looking looking at something
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:11.320]  like it sounds it sounds so trivial but like convenience
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.420]  always wins right?
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:15.020]  I think we might have talked about this before but it's
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:20.320]  little conveniences add multiplied by all the times that
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.120]  they matter end up being a big deal and and it's funny.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.120]  I think the Echo has gotten kind of mixed reviews, but
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.920]  I'm still a lot of people there are people who do really
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.820]  like it and I think it's it's because it's a it's in a similar
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.920]  vein to what I think the watch is going to be where it's
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.520]  you don't kind of realize until you use it like how it
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.720]  just makes life a little bit less a little more frictionless
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:49.720]  and you know, it's the idea of it being the center is a long
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.820]  ways off just for all the technical reasons more than anything
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.020]  but I think convenience is always convenience is always
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120]  are easier to see backwards than forward.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:40:59.420]  Yes.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.720]  Like yes, it's more easy to tell how much you appreciate
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.120]  it when it's taken away than when you first get it always,
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:12.320]  you know, and it's the same way that like when you go back
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.520]  to an older iPhone, it makes your current iPhone feel so
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.220]  much faster than it felt when you first got the new iPhone
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.020]  you get a new iPhone next year next generation a whatever
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.420]  chip like wow, this is great.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.620]  It's a lot faster and if you put it down and take your year
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.020]  old one or your two year old one, especially like a two year
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:28.220]  old one.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.220]  You're like, holy shit.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:34.920]  This is so jaggy and you know coming out of college and
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:37.220]  you get your first apartment and it has a dishwasher and
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:37.920]  you're like great.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:38.520]  This is great.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.720]  I love having the dishwasher.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.120]  Well when your dishwasher breaks and you don't have a dishwasher
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.420]  anymore.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.220]  You're like, holy shit.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.120]  How do I live without a dishwasher right?
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.520]  Yup, no and I think I think you know that voice could be
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.420]  something like that.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.220]  No, I agree and I think it's one of those things where if
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.620]  you I mean, I it's easy to look back and just like I but
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.720]  I really do think that people said like when the phone came
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.520]  out. It's like well, I could do this.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.620]  I can do this on a computer.
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.620]  I can do this or especially the iPad.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.820]  I think you probably saw this more than anything like little
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:15.920]  little making it just a little bit easier makes makes a
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.520]  really big difference and and I I think that that's a good
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.020]  vector to look at any new product like does it does it make
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:27.820]  life just a little bit easier and if it does then that product
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820]  probably has a chance.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.820]  The thing I didn't understand about Amazon Echo when they
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:34.020]  announced it and I you know, they announced it and I watched
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:38.020]  their their little video with the family, you know using it.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:42.220]  I didn't understand that it was going to be invitation only
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.520]  for some period of time.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.520]  Dave Whiskas actually was just tell me he was thinking about
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.220]  getting one but it's like you don't buy one.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.620]  You can't just buy one you go to the site and you request
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:51.820]  an invitation to buy one.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:54.120]  Yeah, it's I actually just in the in the other thing is I
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.620]  just got my request just got granted and it said it's going
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:59.820]  to ship in three to four months or something like that.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:03.620]  I I suspect like they just got burned so badly by the phone
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.820]  that they weigh like they got way too conservative like they
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:10.720]  over corrected and it's really hard to ramp something and
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.720]  if you if you if you kind of started out with the assumption
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.520]  we're going to sell a hundred thousand units you get a million
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.620]  orders like it's not just that you're behind infinite million
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:23.320]  orders that but that that being behind kind of compounds.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.020]  Yeah, so it's interesting though.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:29.320]  I do think that you know, like you said there is something
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.020]  and this is you know, is this this is sort of closest to
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:37.120]  the how style interface of 2001 right where what was the
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.020]  interface with how on the Discovery?
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.320]  It was you just talk to how.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:43.820]  You know, there was no button to push.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:45.820]  There was nothing you didn't have to go over push a button
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.820]  to start talking to him.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.220]  You just talk to him because he was always listening.
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:49.720]  No.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.220]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:54.120]  It's so when you look at any new product you have to think
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:59.820]  it's so easy to to sell made a bingo card for my podcast
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:01.920]  exponent and a notorious word.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.620]  I say is over index and I'm going to use it.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:08.120]  It's so easy to over index on what the product is today,
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.020]  but to evaluate you have to think about what's this product
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.720]  going to be after three or four iterations and like for
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.520]  example, the original Kindle like the original Kindle was
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.320]  a piece of crap and it looked terrible and it felt terrible
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:21.720]  but like it was so obvious that this is how we're going to
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.120]  read books going forward right in once it's thin and easy
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.720]  to hold and actually I think the version to Kindle was
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.320]  was very good.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.620]  They actually there's a huge jump from one to two, but I
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:35.920]  think that this that's something we see with the iPhone
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.520]  and I think that's something with something like the Echo
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.820]  and I think I think it will be the case with the watch as
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.020]  well where it's not just you have to look at it not just
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.320]  as what it can do right now and what capabilities right
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.620]  now or what battery life it has right now you have to
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.620]  think about what is this going to be in five years and
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:55.420]  can you see a path from here to there and if that path
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:59.620]  is a path that's easily understandable as in like our
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:01.020]  chips going to get more efficient.
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.420]  Yes, our streets get more efficient.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.620]  Yes, our batteries going to improve not as fast as those
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.520]  are get more efficient, but yes, they're going to improve
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.620]  like there's and you it just like you have to be able to
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.020]  put yourself in the shoes of a new user.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.620]  It's the same sort of thing when you look at a product
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:16.820]  you have to you have to be able to assimilate what you
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:19.320]  know about the way technology progresses and that's how
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.120]  you evaluate a product not you can't evaluate it on version
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.020]  one. Yeah, one of the interesting things about echoes
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:25.620]  to me.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.420]  It's the first new product from any of these companies
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:32.720]  in my memory where battery isn't an issue because it's
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.220]  not battery-operated something to plug in. Yeah, like
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:36.820]  when's the last time somebody's come out with something
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.920]  that doesn't isn't battery-operated.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.420]  It's you know, that that's fascinating to me because it's
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:45.720]  it just hasn't happened in so long.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.020]  No, it's a great point.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.920]  Yeah, I think people were like joked about like Amazon
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:53.320]  actually sold try to sell that as a feature.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:56.420]  I can plug it in and I totally got that like yeah, it's
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.520]  it's like it's your home.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.620]  It's your home assistant a lot of ways.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:04.620]  I think the problem for Amazon obviously is you know,
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.920]  they're they don't have the entire like they don't have
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:11.020]  the mobile companion really to go with it which obviously
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:13.620]  the phone, you know, their phone was intended to be I
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:17.720]  would imagine but but still I think I think the concept
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.820]  is at least compelling and if Echo isn't it I wouldn't
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:23.920]  be surprised if you know in five ten years, we all have
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.620]  a similar sort of device in our houses that we just talked
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.220]  to. Yeah, I wonder
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:33.120]  I wonder if it's already in the works if the you know,
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.620]  whatever the next generation Apple TV is is always listening
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:40.020]  Xbox, you know Microsoft's done it with Xbox for a while
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:41.320]  or I don't know.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.920]  Is it okay Xbox something like that has been a trigger
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.420]  for you've been able to give vocal commands to your Xbox
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:47.720]  for a while.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.420]  Yeah, I think going back to the previous Xbox the 360.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.720]  No, I mean it seems like an obvious thing for the Apple
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:56.820]  TV. I mean man talk about a product that's stagnated.
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:01.420]  Yeah, well, yeah, I think that's basically I don't know
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.920]  if they've missed a deadline, you know, and something
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.420]  has slipped or what but there's clearly something that
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:06.920]  was coming.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.120]  I mean at this point I would say I probably would have
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.620]  bet on something, you know a year ago if we had talked
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.320]  a year ago, I probably would have bet on some kind of new
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.220]  Apple TV at the end of 2014.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:19.620]  So at this point I would call it overdue and I kind of
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:22.920]  expect to see or more I wouldn't be shocked if we don't
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.420]  see it in 2015 because I know maybe they've but if we're
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:28.520]  talking a year from now and they still don't have a new
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:33.420]  like a truly new Apple TV then then I would a year from
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.320]  now. I would think maybe they've written it off.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:36.920]  Maybe they've you know abandoned.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:39.620]  Yeah, because I was I thought it was in 2013.
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:42.720]  So like yeah, that's what I meant by stagnating like
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.620]  setting as in like the Mac Pro stagnated like so yeah,
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:51.520]  either it's dying or it's because there's a wholesale kind
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.220]  of like refresh coming their way.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.320]  Yeah, they're waiting on something either a piece of
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.020]  some kind of hardware or and or software that they need
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.620]  to make the one they want to make and it's not ready.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.320]  I don't think they're giving up on it though because
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.020]  especially I mean, I think that home kit is is important
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.720]  even though we haven't heard a ton about it and Apple TV
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.520]  is pretty important home kit.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:17.020]  So yeah, I don't think they would do that if it was something
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:17.820]  they were giving up on.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.520]  Yeah, and at the very least even in a in an Apple TV list
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.520]  world you need something in your house always plugged in to
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.420]  make home kit really sing.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.020]  And so why not just make it a thing you put in your TV
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:33.220]  since everybody has a TV.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.120]  Yep.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:37.620]  No, right it like it doesn't have to be Apple TV could be
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:40.020]  anything but why not just make it Apple TV?
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:40.420]  Yeah.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:43.120]  No, I've always thought I mean, I've long thought like
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.220]  they're going to unify like the router and the Apple TV
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.620]  and you know, that would take care of some leg issues for
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:55.720]  one for airplay if you like if the app ecosystem ends up
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.520]  like running off an iPhone or whatever whatever it might
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.820]  be but now I love the idea that you put forward of like
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:05.020]  there being an echo types type angle to it as well.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.720]  I think it makes I mean, obviously Siri would be involved
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.420]  in it but having it be kind of a an assistant that you
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.420]  can just talk to I think is really compelling.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.020]  I thought about that two years ago that why not combine
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:19.620]  Apple TV with the airport router?
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.520]  So then there's only one thing to plug in and I didn't
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.120]  even think latency is even it's just a plus.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.920]  I'm just thinking hey, just one thing plug this in put
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:30.320]  your cable thing in the back put the power plug in and
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:34.020]  you're done and then I kind of thought maybe not when
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.620]  I got the latest generation Airport, which was so much
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:37.120]  bigger.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.820]  Right, but I think I mean, I think the but that has that
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.920]  has the that's an actual router like and has multiple
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.220]  ports and stuff like that.
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:49.220]  I think the airport Express is probably a fuller expression
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.420]  of like Apple's ideal router in a lot of ways.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.120]  Well, my understanding is that the reason the new airport
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.620]  extreme is so tall is that it was and who knows, you
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:01.420]  know, who knows how long it was in the works, you know
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.220]  with Steve Jobs being gone, but it was just purely engineering
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:08.220]  that having antennas that are up bigger antennas that
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:10.820]  are up just is part big part of why it gets better
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:11.720]  reception through your house.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.020]  No, I whereas deal whereas it gets better reception
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.120]  whereas the older ones that were so much smaller were
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.520]  always constrained in terms of the energy, you know, the
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  power of their intent, right?
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.520]  Because like the super like long-range ones have like actual
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:26.520]  antennas that like stick up so that makes sense.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:30.020]  It's a little bit more of a practical design than a you
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:34.920]  know, it's function over form, but I don't know it might
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.720]  be a hard sell when all the other boxes are so small and
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:40.420]  the old Apple TV was so small to say your new Apple TV
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.120]  is you know now 10 times.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:43.120]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.020]  I don't know but it would you know, but on the other hand,
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:49.020]  hey just plug this one thing in and you're done is compelling.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.020]  What was the other thing?
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:56.020]  So Gurman's other thing was all about how the battery sucks
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.120]  on the Apple watch.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.820]  But I see to me that's like no surprise.
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:00.620]  Of course, it does.
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.820]  All right, of course, that's the biggest thing that that's
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:03.520]  holding them up.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.420]  I mean, I you know, I don't really need sources to tell
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:06.920]  you that.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.220]  Yeah, I mean it's going to the thing I've always kind of
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:17.820]  maintained about the about about the watches 24 just has
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.420]  to get you through the day and the funk the way to address
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:25.020]  battery life is not to make like week-long battery life
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:26.020]  or month-long battery life.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.220]  It's to make battery life that it's to make the functionality
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.720]  so great that you're willing to put up with charging it
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.620]  all the time and that like that's what they did with the
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:37.120]  phone right the iPhones iPhone battery wife relative to our
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:41.720]  old phones is still drastically worse than it was before but
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.120]  we don't care about that because the functionality is so
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:49.120]  Superior that we put up with charging it like it's assumed
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.520]  that we're going to carry like you go around like you can
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.320]  go to any shopping mall here and there's lockers when you
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.820]  walk in the door where you can pay to plug in your phone
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.720]  and like you can go shopping and come back at your phone
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:02.720]  and it'll be charged like that's if you can't think about
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:06.120]  that's kind of crazy, but it's it's it's not crazy anymore
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.320]  because it that's of course, why wouldn't you why wouldn't
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:11.920]  you no one's going to give up functionality to get better
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.720]  battery life today.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.220]  It's just the way right every every time an airport is a
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:20.020]  new terminal is added or a terminal is is refurbished.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.520]  It's always, you know, a huge factor is, you know, getting
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.320]  power outlets to to to more people.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:26.120]  Yeah.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:27.820]  Yeah.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.720]  It's so frustrating to go to an airport with no power outlets
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.020]  and then you have people like huddled around like whatever
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:34.920]  outlets are there.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.620]  It's it you know, it is like it's nobody had the idea but
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:42.020]  it's a just you know, it dystopian science fiction future
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.920]  come to life where you know, everybody waits around sucking
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:45.420]  up power.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:47.520]  Yeah, there's there's like rows of seats and no one's in
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.520]  there. I would say on the floor on like the one pillar that
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.820]  has like outlets with it.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:52.220]  Right.
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:55.220]  It's interesting because I've eventually that'll happen
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:58.520]  though because you remember and I know Jason snow has written
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.120]  about this lately where clearly Apple has these target numbers
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.420]  in mind like X number of hours for an iPhone and 10 hours
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.720]  of battery life for an iPad and they stick to them and with
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.520]  the iPad in particular, like it's been dead solid every
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:18.120]  single iPad and they have that number in their head and then
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.720]  they just keep making the devices as thin as they possibly
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:23.620]  can walk hitting that number, you know, and it's every single
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:27.020]  year when iPhones come out and or every other year when a
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:28.820]  new generation comes out and it's so much thinner.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:31.920]  There's a decent chunk of people who have you know personally
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.420]  have different sets of priorities who say why couldn't
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:36.820]  they just make it as thick as the last one which was plenty
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:39.820]  thin and just give me more battery life, but eventually
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:42.220]  that's going to happen because it happened with laptops
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:45.420]  laptops MacBooks Powerbooks or everyone to call them got
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:48.420]  like three to four hours of battery life year after year
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:51.020]  after year after year after year and then all of a sudden
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:56.920]  boom, you know, it's shot up to 789 hours of battery life
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.420]  and eventually that'll happen with phones like eventually
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:02.320]  we'll have an iPhone that instead of getting thinner instead
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:05.420]  gives you like you go two or three days without plugging.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:05.620]  Yeah.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:11.320]  Well, I mean, I obviously I'm I'm not the right person to
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.120]  measure this because I work from home but the iPhone 6
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.820]  my favorite feature even more than than having a larger
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.720]  screen is that I never worry about battery life anymore
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.520]  again, like I probably haven't plugged in more than most
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.820]  people and I've heard from people that yeah, it's still not
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.420]  good enough.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:32.120]  But for me anyway, like it's it's crossed that line compared
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.320]  to the 5s, which if I was always worried about it.
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:36.820]  Yeah.
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:39.920]  No, I've you know, going to Disney World is a good test
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:43.720]  for me because it used to you know, I need my mophie to
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.620]  get through a day and I don't anymore.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.420]  Yep, or any kind of travel day any kind of day where I'm
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:52.120]  you know in an airport and going somewhere and doing all
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.120]  of my computing from the phone always used to need a mophie
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.820]  and I don't generally anymore.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:01.920]  The other thing is Mark Gurman's reporting 2.5 to 4 hours
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.620]  of active application use that seems pretty good to me.
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:09.820]  I mean, I yeah, I think that's all it's interesting because
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.020]  I'm sure that those you know, he's got great sources and
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:16.020]  I'm sure they're real numbers, but I feel like it's it's
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:18.220]  hard to think about that as a user because from a user's
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.320]  perspective you're not going to think about stuff like that
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.220]  and in particular the other one he called out I agree.
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:26.020]  I think that's actually pretty good considering how I
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:27.920]  think we'll be using these things.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.420]  The other one was the time telling and the time telling
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.320]  as I understand it.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.120]  I've heard from people is so the watch is off most of the
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.220]  time or the faces off most of the time and it has to be
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:43.420]  because it's you know, I we don't know yet whether it's
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:44.620]  OLED or LCD.
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:46.420]  I think it might be some kind of OLED though because they
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:49.120]  are using black as the background instead of white.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.720]  But regardless any kind of color screen like that whatever
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:56:00.220]  the technology is he you know, the the biggest power sink
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.720]  that you're going to have on the device so it's off most
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.820]  of the time my understanding is that they've put like
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:11.220]  inordinate like a huge chunk the whole three-year-long
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:15.120]  effort there have been teams devoted to it or an a-team
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.220]  devoted to it is that when you twist your art wrist to
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:22.320]  look at the time it is already, you know, it turns on like
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.820]  the detection of this is the type of motion of a person
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:30.820]  checking the time is like an a1 priority for the thing
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:34.320]  and that apparently it works already works really really
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:34.620]  well.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.920]  It's very very smart about turning on when you want to
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:38.520]  look at it.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:41.820]  But then when you turn your wrist back it goes off again.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:45.920]  So it's I forget how long it said it was like three hours
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.420]  like the watch last three hours of continuous telling
[01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:49.620]  the time or something like that.
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:52.620]  The only thing with the only thing with that is I think
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:54.820]  this is the one thing that really kind of detracts from
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:01.020]  the watch as fashion accessory thing because the I mean
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:06.420]  the face of a watch is is super important to it being
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:09.420]  a fashion accessory like they can have beautiful bands
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:13.120]  they can have a beautiful case, but if it's just a black
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.820]  box, it's that that is an area where I mean if they were
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.620]  ever to get to a point where they could actually have those
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:22.120]  watch faces on all the time.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.420]  Like I think that would be a that would be a big deal
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.820]  just from from I mean, we're yeah, if they could do it
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.820]  they would but they yeah, we're we're we're watching our
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:32.820]  pajamas podcasting.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:35.820]  I don't think we're fashion experts, but I do think yeah
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.420]  that will be when and if they can get to that point.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.620]  I think that will be that will be a big deal right, but
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:45.220]  it's definitely in this, you know, you know, their Apple
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:48.220]  clearly is going way more as this is a watch watch and
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:51.020]  we're, you know, we're going right up against any watch
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:53.820]  brand you want than anybody else in the smartwatch game,
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:57.220]  but clearly one of the areas where they just can't compete
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:59.620]  is the fact like you said that the face is black, you
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:02.420]  know, and and whatever choice you make in terms of which
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:06.620]  style of of the many that they offer from for your watch
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:10.020]  style has no bearing on what other people see when they
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.020]  see it on your right, you know, the guy across from
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:17.220]  you in the aisle on the train who's not moving his wrist
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:19.420]  or checking the time all you see is that he has an Apple
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.220]  watch you have no idea what face is that said that and
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.220]  that's definitely a factor.
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:27.020]  There's it's there's no getting around what the what's
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:30.620]  interesting is at least for at the beginning before they
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:33.820]  are, you know, obviously Apple would like them to be as
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:35.020]  widespread as phones.
[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:37.820]  But if you think back when the phone iPhone first came
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:41.820]  out like it was it said something that you had an iPhone
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.820]  it was it was obvious that that you had one and there
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.820]  weren't very many people that had one and so it's almost
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.020]  like it's not that big a deal at the beginning because
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:54.020]  just seeing that that black square will be meaningful
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:58.820]  enough whereas once in and ideally once they get to the
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:02.020]  point if they're successful and they become ubiquitous
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.420]  that the by that point their power management will also
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:09.020]  be to the point where they can be fully customized and
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:14.820]  all the time and fully fulfill that kind of like personal
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:17.620]  personalized fashion angle.
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.220]  Yeah, yeah, I read it so much as how much time how much
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.420]  you can tell the time but how much how long the screen
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:24.420]  can be on.
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:27.420]  So if it can be on for three hours, that's sounds pretty
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.820]  good because it doesn't seem to me like you would it
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:32.620]  doesn't seem like how could you spend more than three
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:36.020]  hours looking at the little thing right exactly.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:39.220]  I mean if you're if you're going to be interacting with
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.220]  it that long you might as well take out your phone.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:49.220]  Right, 3,000 users so I wonder how I wonder if that's
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:53.220]  right seems like a lot but again a lot for it not to
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:57.020]  have leaked but on the other hand maybe it's a lot
[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.020]  easier to conceal.
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:02.420]  It'll be interesting if it's soon.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:05.620]  Yeah, yeah, what do you think about that?
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:09.420]  Germin said that that it's still on pace to ship at the
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:10.820]  end of March.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:12.420]  I it seems seems reasonable.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:17.520]  I like I suspect they were shooting for February, you
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:20.120]  know, just maybe for the Chinese market like Chinese
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.220]  New Year super late this year people get cash for Chinese
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:24.220]  New Year.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:29.320]  But so I it fits with a well, let's shoot for this.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.420]  Well, we didn't quite make it but it's still it's still
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:33.420]  early in the year.
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:37.220]  You know, I don't think I would I would you know, of
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:39.820]  course, you know, Mark Germin is number one at pointing
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:42.920]  out that Tim Quok's products released throughout 2014
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.320]  and they didn't release anything till the second half
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.120]  of the year.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.920]  But that said, I think that he wouldn't drop a date
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.620]  lightly.
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:51.420]  Right.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:52.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.720]  I still think March is I'll be impressed if it ships by
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.120]  March because I don't know my impression from the few
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.820]  people I secondhand all secondhand no firsthand
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.820]  information from everybody who's wearing one but
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.020]  secondhand information who know people who are wearing
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:07.620]  them is that they're still buggy enough and have poor
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:11.520]  enough battery life that March would be an achievement
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.020]  because they're you know, they if it's too buggy and
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.720]  to do battery life is too bad.
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:17.820]  There's you know, it's not going to come out in March,
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.820]  you know, they're they have the wiggle room to push
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:25.720]  it until April or May or even June like June will
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:27.620]  give you know, people will roll their eyes because
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:32.120]  it's about as late as early 2015 can be.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.020]  But they you know, they have that will go right
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.520]  and in first impressions will matter.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:36.820]  Right.
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.520]  It would be better to have people complaining that
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.420]  June is pretty damn late for early to that, you
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.420]  know, quote-unquote early 2015 than to ship it in
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:49.420]  March just to hit the first quarter and you know,
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:51.020]  have it be riddled with bugs.
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:55.520]  Yep, or not make it through the day.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.020]  What was the other thing just so I can't I made
[02:01:58.020 --> 02:01:59.920]  a note here when you were talking about it can't
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  talk about the fire phone without talking about
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.020]  Austin cars.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:03.620]  It's not new.
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.920]  I guess it was a sometime in the last month his
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:09.720]  Fast Company piece on the making of the fire phone.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.420]  Surely you read it.
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:12.620]  I was quoted in it.
[02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:13.220]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:13.620]  That's right.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:14.120]  That's right.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.520]  I remember that that's actually one of the things
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.420]  that it was I should I should get back on the
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:19.420]  show this week.
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:21.320]  I actually remember that it was it.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.620]  I thought it was a tremendous piece of oh,
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:25.420]  yeah, and he talked to a lot of people.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:27.820]  And got, you know, a lot of inside people at
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:30.920]  lab 126 that it was definitely very compelling
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.620]  and if you haven't read it, you should I'll link
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.120]  it in the show.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:35.520]  So I actually want to link it on there and it'll
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.220]  be linked on during firewall in between us
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:40.820]  recording and and the show wearing but I'll put
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:43.020]  it in the show notes too, but it's just a tremendous
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:45.720]  piece of reporting and rather scathing.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:52.020]  It's interesting because the the one he talked
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.420]  about like Amazon not being focused and that's
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:57.420]  a comic critique that any Apple fan will have
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:00.620]  about Amazon, but actually when I told him this
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:03.320]  when I talked to him Amazon is not that kind
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.820]  of company like Amazon is in many respects the
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.820]  anti Apple or the bizarro Apple like the the
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:14.620]  way the company works internally is it's a lot
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.620]  of companies.
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.420]  Some of them are mature companies that throw
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:19.120]  off cash and some of them are startups that
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.220]  devour cash and because they're all under one
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.720]  roof that money can be funneled from the ones
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:27.020]  throwing off money to the ones that need it
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:30.220]  and and and so there are lots of groups that
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.720]  that that kind of start and so you go to
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:33.420]  amazon.com and it's like one website, but
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.220]  actually like there's the clothing section
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:39.220]  and there is the the car section and like all
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:41.920]  these are within Amazon completely separate
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:44.420]  groups and they have their own their their
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.520]  own procurement managers at their own marketing
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  managers. They have their own you know, their
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.520]  own P and L's it's like it's the exact opposite
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.620]  structure from the way Apple is set up and
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:58.220]  it and it's meant to almost be like a self
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:01.820]  incubator in a lot of ways and so from that
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.120]  perspective to say that Amazon is doing this
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.520]  like the phone can fit in that and actually
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.120]  almost if you look at this way that if you
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.920]  accept that this is the way Amazon is and
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.820]  that's the way they're going to operate my
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:16.420]  critique of the phone and what I took away
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:19.020]  from that reporting is that Jeff Bezos in
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:22.820]  particular was too focused on the phone and
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:26.320]  like he got too obsessed with it and didn't
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.520]  let it kind of breathe and go through a
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.020]  natural sort of like startup process and
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.820]  that more than anything was was up in he's
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:37.420]  he got a blind spot about like the viability
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:40.120]  of this product which which I mean everyone
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.320]  was kind of knew was a lot of us are saying
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.820]  there was no point to it before they even
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:46.020]  announced it once they announced it was
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.720]  like what you know what this makes no
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:51.920]  sense what it's it's a cautionary tale it
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:54.220]  I I think that you get so wrapped up in
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:57.920]  something you you lose all perspective well
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:00.820]  that gets back to my argument earlier in
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:02.920]  the show with forced all and the ability
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:05.920]  to look at it like an interface and say you
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:08.220]  know what we put a lot of effort in this
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:10.420]  but this is crap we need to scrap this right
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:12.420]  you get too close to it and you lose yeah
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.720]  it's just to me it's the same type of
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:16.220]  thing that you can I can see how it
[02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:18.220]  happened you know because I know that's
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:19.820]  just human nature but I mean the gist of
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.020]  it the big point of it is that the all
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:24.020]  this emphasis and it came from Bezos
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:27.120]  directly was on this 3d whatever they
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.620]  call it you know the camera sensors on
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:32.020]  the front to make a face that you don't
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:37.020]  need glasses for on the screen and the
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.920]  there the the on within the team there
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:42.620]  was some you know it's a neat trick it's
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.520]  a neat idea but what in the world how in
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:45.920]  the world is it a selling point what is
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:49.720]  the actual purpose of this and yet
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:52.520]  Bezos got hung up on it and thought it
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.720]  would be the selling point and it
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:55.020]  certainly was the selling point in the
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:56.620]  initial marketing the marketing was all
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:00.020]  about this 3d effect and then in reality
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:02.320]  it turned out exactly what the naysayers
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:04.420]  on the team had thought which is nobody
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:05.520]  sees the point of it yeah that's
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:07.120]  definitely differentiation it's not just
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:10.320]  having a unique feature it's actually
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.020]  making a difference in customers lives
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:14.020]  in the way that another product cannot
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.820]  right it actually isn't a didn't make it
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:18.520]  a better device and that's the whole
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:22.520]  problem and yet it also made it
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:25.020]  something that was expensive because it
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.820]  was a high-end phone it was a premium
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:28.920]  phone you know that and I this is the
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:30.620]  part where I disagree with cars analysis
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:32.020]  the reporting is interesting that there
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:33.520]  was that there were people within the
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:35.520]  team who said all along I don't see the
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.220]  point of this it's it's just you know
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:40.120]  it's it's pure gimmickry and no utility
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:45.220]  and they were right and then without it
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:46.620]  then the fire phone was left with
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.820]  nothing compelling because the other
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.520]  stuff that it has none of it was best of
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.120]  breed doesn't have the best apps doesn't
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:53.220]  have the best ecosystem what you know
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.620]  there was nothing else about the device
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:56.820]  that was that was worth hanging your hat
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.520]  on the only thing they had to hang their
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.720]  hat on was the 3d effect and the 3d
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.420]  effect was pointless but Bezos was all
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:05.020]  caught up in it for like well well over
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:06.920]  here you saw that in the keynote to like
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:09.220]  the keynote was so long and it was so
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.520]  self-absorbed I actually wrote this at
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:12.820]  the time like I thought I found the
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:16.520]  keynote very distressing not just just
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.420]  because it was it was it reeked of
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:22.420]  hubris and and yeah basically this this
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:24.320]  article said yeah that's basically
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:28.220]  exactly it yeah and so there I agree and
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.120]  I think it's spot-on where I disagree
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:32.320]  and the article several times touches on
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.020]  it and I think you can kind of see car
[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:35.720]  goes along with it he has sources saying
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:37.720]  it too so it's not just cars the writer
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.720]  projecting it but it's the idea that the
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.320]  whole idea of a high-end phone from
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.520]  Amazon is contrary to their brand and
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:46.920]  doomed from the start that this idea
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.220]  that they can make a phone that competes
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.920]  with Apple was a terrible idea because
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.520]  Apple competes on branding and design
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.420]  and Amazon is just low-end prices and so
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:55.820]  if Amazon wanted to do a phone it should
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:57.420]  have been a you know some piece of junk
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:00.620]  that was super cheap and I disagree with
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:01.920]  that I disagree with that entirely
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.420]  because I mean what was the one quote
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:08.020]  there it was like there was a branding
[02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:09.720]  issue you know is the quote from one of
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.320]  the sources that he had I really
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:14.020]  disagree with that and it's to me it's
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:16.720]  like a it's to me it's a fundamental
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.120]  misunderstanding of what branding and
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:19.520]  marketing are about to me branding and
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.920]  marketing always come from eventually
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:23.820]  from the actual quality of the products
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:25.320]  or services whatever it is themselves
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.920]  and so sure it is a little bit outside
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:32.620]  of Amazon's expected brand to ship a
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:35.120]  high-end you know phone that competes
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  with the iPhone on quality and maybe
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:39.220]  some people wouldn't have gotten that
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:41.420]  right away but the problem isn't that it
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.020]  that the fire phone was outside Amazon's
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:45.620]  brand the problem is the fire phone was
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:47.920]  a crappy phone and so therefore it's not
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.420]  it it's the product it all comes from
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:51.820]  the product the product was a piece of
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:53.220]  crap that no one wanted to buy and that
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:55.420]  was poorly reviewed if it actually had
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:57.720]  been a really good phone if it had been
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.720]  something that was compelling it may
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.720]  not have been a smash hit right away but
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:03.020]  at least would have fit with the brand
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:04.420]  they were trying to do and then they
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.820]  could iterate for two or three years and
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:07.820]  eventually it might catch on but it all
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.820]  comes from the product itself it had to
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:12.720]  be a good thing no I I think I think
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:14.920]  that's right the other thing too is if
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:16.920]  you step back and look at the e-commerce
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.920]  market Amazon is a high-end brand and
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:22.220]  they're a high-end brand because their
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:24.820]  number one proposition is selection and
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.420]  convenience yes they've pushed price but
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:30.020]  you see a brand like jet.com is like the
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:32.020]  the former diapers comm CEO is like
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.420]  launching a new thing it's like a Costco
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:34.820]  model basically where you pay a
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:38.420]  membership fee and then they they will
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.420]  give you that their margin effectively
[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:42.220]  and and I think it's all there's all
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:43.920]  these rules it's convoluted and it takes
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.020]  longer to get your stuff and there's all
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:47.820]  weird ways to get discounts use a debit
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:49.520]  card is cheaper it's a pain in the ass
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.620]  and it sounds awful to me like I would
[02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:55.020]  not want to use it but I am the sort of
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:57.020]  person that is willing to pay for
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:58.620]  convenience for a guaranteed two-day
[02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:01.020]  delivery for going to one place and get
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:02.120]  what I wanted I don't want to price
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:03.520]  compare I don't want to like jump through
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.320]  hoops to lower price but there are
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:08.420]  people who do and and I don't think
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:11.120]  Amazon ultimately when push comes to
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:15.420]  shove I think they will prove out to be
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.720]  more of a high-end offer another another
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.720]  interesting e-commerce app is wish which
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:21.620]  is a mobile app where you you can
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:24.320]  basically buy stuff from China and it's
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:26.820]  really cheap and it sometimes it's
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:28.620]  crap and sometimes it takes like two
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.220]  weeks to arrive and sometimes it doesn't
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.720]  arrive like it's it's but it's super
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.320]  cheap and it's like interesting stuff
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.520]  and it's exploding and it's a very
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.820]  different proposition than Amazon and I
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:40.920]  think what we will look back at the
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.620]  e-commerce industry as a whole and
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:43.820]  Amazon's actually is going to be
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:46.420]  Amazon's primarily in rich countries and
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.120]  it's used I think primarily by
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:50.820]  relatively rich people and so not only
[02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:52.720]  are you right that the phone is crap and
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.220]  that was the biggest problem and if
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:55.620]  they made a good phone it would accrue
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:57.420]  to their brand but I actually think the
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:10:58.820]  the characterization of their brand was
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:01.920]  wrong as well yeah I kind of do I kind
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.420]  of agree with that too and I you know
[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:05.220]  and I think especially when you're
[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:07.020]  getting into a new initiative you've
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:10.620]  kind of got a blank slate in terms of
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:12.420]  establishing the brand right I mean like
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:14.320]  think about the Kindle which you said
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.920]  was you know a hit right from the start
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:18.520]  would get Amazon wasn't known for making
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:20.520]  their own products at all period they'd
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:21.920]  never done it before that was the first
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.820]  gadget they made and it you know they
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.820]  defined the brand by the fact that it
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:30.620]  was a product that made people who were
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:33.520]  voracious readers very happy right it's
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.220]  the Kindle as at least as an e-reader
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:38.620]  yeah is I think a very well-perceived
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:41.520]  brand and is you know it sits atop the
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.520]  e-reader market I mean and I have all
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.020]  sorts of little niggling complaints
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:47.120]  complaints about the design of the
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.920]  devices God Almighty I love I would love
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.520]  to see our Amazon poach some Apple
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:55.520]  engineers and let them have at the
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:58.320]  Kindle eating hardware for a year or two
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:03.320]  but overall it's you know it I admit
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.920]  them all my complaints are more or less
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:07.420]  niggling and that the basic gist of it's
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.220]  this magic box that you can just read
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:10.820]  and read and read and read forever and
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:11.720]  when you get to the end of the book
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.120]  you're 15 seconds away from putting
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:18.120]  another book on it it all just worked
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.120]  and the brand for the Kindle it didn't
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.420]  really matter what Amazon's brand was
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:24.220]  before the brand for Kindle was defined
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.220]  by the experience of using a Kindle you
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.420]  know and that's why it's a good brand
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:28.920]  and if the phone had actually been
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:30.620]  compelling in some kind of profound way
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:32.620]  then the fire phone would have had a
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.720]  good brand yeah and again it might take
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.820]  years for it to really catch on traction
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:41.120]  is a weird you know is a weird thing but
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.920]  I really don't think that any you know
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.920]  that the the the brand is defined by the
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.120]  products it's not the other way around
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:52.420]  and the thing is like the I mean the the
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:55.320]  the era of differentiating on the OS
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.520]  layer is over like it's iOS and Android
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.720]  like that's it and and the thing is like
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:04.720]  Amazon has lots of pieces to do
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:08.420]  interesting to do interesting stuff you
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:11.120]  know like you like the fire like the
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:12.120]  most compelling thing in the
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:14.420]  presentation was like the Firefly you
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:15.820]  know application where it identifies
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:17.020]  stuff and you could put in your car you
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.620]  could you could buy or whatever like in
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:22.120]  that that that fits Amazon now I think
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.120]  Amazon you know I think the whole
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.420]  endeavor was was a bit misguided they
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:31.020]  would have been better off they would
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:32.520]  have been better off focusing on the
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.920]  Amazon app on on iOS and Android but if
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.620]  they if they felt that was the right way
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:38.520]  to go like that should have been the
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.920]  central point and the reason should be
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.320]  the central point is because that's
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.420]  where Amazon can actually bring what
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:45.120]  they have to bear to create something
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:46.720]  truly unique that's that's really
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:49.520]  compelling yeah so what do you think that
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.520]  what do you think they're gonna do
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.720]  that's one thing I didn't really get out
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.020]  of the car article is what are they
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:54.620]  gonna do going forward is this such a
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:56.620]  disaster that they're done making phones
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.120]  or are they gonna stick with it and do a
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:01.220]  fire phone too I honestly I thought that
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:02.420]  was the most surprising thing that he is
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:04.620]  so well sourced to get the story that he
[02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:06.320]  got but it doesn't have anything about
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.820]  what their future plans are I don't know
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.120]  it's a really interesting question I
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.520]  mean I mean and it was a huge flop I
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.920]  mean it was I what was the I think it
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.820]  was they only sold like 10,000 phones or
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:19.120]  something like that at least until they
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:20.520]  radically cut the price and we're
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.520]  selling the housing 800 right off or
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.920]  something like that yeah I mean a huge
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:27.520]  write-off and what's it 800 million I
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.920]  know it was hundreds of millions I but
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:31.820]  170 million sorry I was confusing with
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:36.320]  the surface um yeah yes but even so
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.220]  that's an awful that's an awful lot I
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:41.320]  mean it was and it's clearly internally
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.820]  they had projections that were a lot
[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:47.620]  higher oh yeah for sure I mean yeah it
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.920]  wasn't a mild disappointment it was a
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.820]  profound that's right so I don't know
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:52.720]  what do you think they're gonna do I
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:55.820]  honestly can't guess because it's their
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:59.320]  their tenacious company and Bezos
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:01.920]  strikes me as somewhat stubborn but on
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.520]  the other hand man it was such a turd
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:08.220]  of a you know it market failure I think
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:13.520]  that they I like I said I think that
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:18.220]  trying to really build out a a third
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:23.320]  platform is is a bad idea and like and
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.020]  it's really a second and a half platform
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:27.520]  right but I don't know it doesn't make
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.220]  it any easier right it's like there's
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.620]  Windows Phone which is trying to be a
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:33.820]  third platform and it's all new UI all
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:35.720]  new API is even a different programming
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:38.520]  language and Amazon phone is certainly
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:42.620]  you know it's mostly Android right it's
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:44.620]  the same language at least and you know
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.220]  games and stuff like that I think you
[02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:48.020]  can pretty much just submit to their
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:49.920]  store and they just run but still it's
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.720]  yeah basically anytime you make like a
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:54.820]  location API call or anything involving
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:58.120]  the store API's anything like that uses
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:15:59.420]  Google services you have to go in and
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:02.120]  change and it's it's in the grand scheme
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:04.320]  of things a simple change but it gets
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:05.820]  back to like the convenience factor
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:08.820]  right you're like one a developer has to
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:11.720]  actually do it and which they have other
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:15.320]  stuff to do and to they have to support
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:20.220]  it and it's one like that barrier and
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:22.120]  like I've I've done developer work like
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.020]  working with developers before like
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:25.420]  those little barriers that seem
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:27.020]  especially to someone trying to create
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.320]  a new platform oh it's not that big a
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.420]  deal you only have to do X it is a big
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:33.520]  deal and it's a lot bigger deal than you
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:35.020]  appreciate and it's a bigger deal not
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.720]  just for the big guys that you talk to
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:39.720]  before the long tail of developers that
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:42.220]  you know that are out there um you know
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:43.820]  if well and the other thing the other
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.220]  thing too is it strategically that's
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:47.620]  exactly where Google has sort of shored
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.220]  up and protected and you know not to get
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:52.820]  political but closed Android is by
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.620]  putting more and more stuff in the
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:57.420]  Google service absolutely in lesson you
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:59.120]  know and and actually taking stuff out
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:02.620]  of the Android you know and the part
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.020]  that's called Android is open and the
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.520]  part that's Google services is
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:08.820]  completely closed and you know even just
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:09.920]  little things like the way that they've
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.420]  stopped development of the web browser
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:13.420]  on the Android side and they've only
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:16.420]  officially now develop Chrome but that's
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:20.020]  part of Google services yep no it
[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:22.220]  rightly so because that that is the
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:25.920]  bulwark like it is the App Store that
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:29.720]  prevents like there being viable
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:31.220]  alternatives you know with the exception
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:34.720]  of China which has multiple app stores
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.420]  but that's like that's that's now the
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:38.120]  expectation for customers in China like
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.520]  you just go get different app stores and
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:41.120]  multiple answers on their phone that's
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.720]  not the expectation anywhere else in the
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:45.020]  world and it's an expectation that is so
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:49.520]  cemented that I I generally believe an
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:52.020]  alternative isn't it isn't isn't a
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:53.820]  viable isn't a viable thing that's why
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:55.720]  what's more compelling and interesting
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:58.520]  to me is is what's going to be built on
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.620]  top of iOS or Android and and that's
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:05.320]  where I think Amazon should Amazon
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.320]  should be that's where their efforts
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:09.020]  should be focused on again this is
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:11.820]  balanced with like this is such a
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:14.320]  problem for companies is companies get
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:19.220]  so wrapped up in what like you can make
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:21.620]  a good argument strategically why it's
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:23.120]  important for Amazon to own their phone
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.420]  and it's really easy to just kind of
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.120]  ignore the part of like it actually
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.020]  happening it's like the you know like
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.120]  question mark question mark question
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:31.420]  mark profit it's like question mark
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:32.620]  question mark question mark we have a
[02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:36.920]  platform like but but but you mean with
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.720]  like Windows or with Amazon like we
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:40.720]  take this Windows phone particular like
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:42.520]  people like Oh Microsoft just needs to
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:45.020]  get developers the problem is
[02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:46.620]  Microsoft's not the one making that
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:49.520]  decision the developers are Microsoft
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.420]  has zero control over what they do or
[02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:55.520]  don't do and and that's and if you're
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:59.420]  if a key to your plan depends on
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:02.720]  independent third-party actors who are
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:04.720]  like wildly disparate and like you can't
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:07.820]  touch it and all of them making a
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:09.420]  decision that's not a very good
[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:11.720]  strategic plan even if from a big
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:13.720]  picture it seems obvious why you should
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:15.720]  do that and I do use and you see this
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:17.520]  company's tripping up on this again and
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:20.520]  again just just like skipping over that
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.520]  one detail that actually will sink the
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.020]  whole thing yep totally agree let me
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:29.520]  take one last break here and thank our
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:32.820]  third and final sponsor of the show and

[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:43.920]  all sorts of apps that are built right

[02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:50.020]  like micro blogs file sharing task
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:51.820]  management and more it's everything you
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:54.020]  need for a small team a bigger team to
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:57.020]  work together in one very configurable
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:20:01.020]  cloud platform how do you use it on
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:05.320]  mobile easy everything on igloo is built

[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.320]  or a webkit like browser it's gonna work
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:20.720]  great and it's gonna be perfectly sized
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:23.720]  everything works great because it's all
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:25.620]  mobile web stuff all scales perfectly

[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:16.520]  this past June last summer Gartner
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:18.720]  released their famed magic quadrant for
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:20.820]  social software in the workplace paper
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:23.220]  this is you hear Gartner and your eyes
[02:21:23.220 --> 02:21:25.920]  start rolling over and whatever well in
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:31.520]  the Indian in enterprise market
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.720]  enterprise I see I'm so far out of it I
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:35.620]  couldn't even think of it in the
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.320]  enterprise market Gartner is a big deal
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:38.920]  this is the thing that Gartner puts out
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:42.620]  for the enterprise where they just rate
[02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:44.820]  all the different types of internets
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:46.020]  that are out there and for the sixth
[02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:48.120]  consecutive year igloo tiny little igloo
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.420]  the upstart is listed right there along
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:53.620]  Giants like Microsoft IBM Google
[02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:58.120]  VMware Salesforce SAP right up with
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:21:59.820]  those guys and in a report that values
[02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.620]  the size of the vendor in Gartner's
[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:03.820]  terms that's called viability igloo is
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:06.020]  praised for their responsiveness and

[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.020]  positive they praised the products quick
[02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:20.520]  deployment configuration and
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:24.320]  customization flexibility with self-service
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:27.220]  options for non-technical users control
[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:29.320]  over branding and information
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:32.120]  organization and ease of use they also
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:34.920]  praise the responsiveness of igloo as an
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:37.320]  organization in other words translated
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:38.820]  to plain English what Gartner is saying
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:40.120]  is what I've been saying on these
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.720]  sponsorships for a while is all true
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:43.320]  it's easy to use you don't have to be a
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:44.820]  technical expert you can configure it
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:48.420]  yourself and set it up just the way you
[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:52.020]  need it for your team to use and same as
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.320]  always is the most amazing part about
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:55.020]  igloo here's the thing it sounds good to
[02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:55.820]  you and you think well what do you got
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:59.520]  to do easy just go there sign up and for

[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:03.420]  so if you have a team that's like 10
[02:23:03.420 --> 02:23:04.920]  people are under you can just use it
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:07.420]  glue for free in perpetuity and not
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:08.820]  worry about it if you have a bigger team
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:11.220]  you can put 10 people together to try it
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:13.620]  out see if it meets your needs before
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:15.920]  you pay a nickel before you give them a
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:18.520]  credit card or anything like that all
[02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.420]  you do is go there sign up and start
[02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:23.120]  using it and see for yourself so here's

[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:37.820]  if you've got a team and you have
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:39.820]  collaborate you're not happy with the
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:41.620]  way you guys are collaborating check out
[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:44.920]  igloo it is really really good stuff my
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:49.020]  thanks to them so last but not least big
[02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:53.020]  week for Microsoft yeah definitely so
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:57.020]  they had a big event and up in Redmond I
[02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.520]  guess it was densably just for Windows
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:00.220]  10 but Windows 10 was really just part
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:02.420]  of it well I think that's I mean that's
[02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:05.020]  that it's a shame I think because
[02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:08.520]  everyone is talking about this project
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:11.920]  hololens and no one is talking about what
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:13.620]  the event was supposed to be about which
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:15.520]  is one problematic and two it's
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:16.620]  particularly problematic because I
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:18.620]  thought the the the part that the event
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.820]  was actually about was actually pretty
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:22.320]  compelling yeah I thought so too I
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.920]  watched live and catch the whole thing
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.920]  but I watched most of it I watched close
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.220]  to two hours of it I forget I missed a
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:29.420]  little bit at the beginning of the
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:31.720]  Windows 10 but I had the exact same
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:33.320]  thought I was like watching the Windows
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.920]  10 stuff and I was like I'm pretty
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:37.620]  impressed this is pretty intriguing I
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:40.120]  like where they're going with this one
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.220]  operating system thing and you know the
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:45.020]  demos were good and they even is funny
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:47.020]  because Microsoft I think is notorious
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:49.220]  for having demos fail during the awards
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:52.220]  and and they promised look this stuff is
[02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:53.820]  all early there's gonna be a lot of bugs
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.620]  in these demos and I thought every demo
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.720]  was seamless which is funny because they
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:59.220]  warned that they were gonna be buggy and
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.220]  they weren't and then I thought it was
[02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.620]  wrapped up I was like that was a hell of
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.220]  an event and then it just kept going and
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:06.920]  I was like wow I can't believe they're
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:09.320]  mixing these things together and on the
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:10.920]  other hand I see how somebody else would
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.620]  say well doesn't Apple do the same thing
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:14.020]  where they announced these two phones
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:16.820]  and they're a big deal and you know you
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:18.920]  know flagship products of the company
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:21.420]  and then at the same event they did
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:23.420]  Apple pay an Apple watch you know and
[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:25.520]  released the preview of this device
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:27.020]  which isn't coming out yet which is
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.220]  exactly you know the HoloLens isn't
[02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:30.920]  coming out yet but there's something
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:34.120]  about it that to me was it was less
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:36.820]  well proportioned in Microsoft's event
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:39.120]  where HoloLens distracted heavily from
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.720]  it well it's funny we last time I was on
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:43.520]  we talked about the fact that the iPhone
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:45.720]  never kind of got its day in the Sun
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:48.520]  yeah well I think I think well here's
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.520]  the I in broad terms I think one factor
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:52.120]  that is that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:54.620]  plus I think by all accounts and it's
[02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:56.420]  next week where we're gonna get Apple's
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:58.220]  quarterly finances and everybody's
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:01.120]  expecting to be gangbusters and I think
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.920]  they're gonna exceed expectations I
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.420]  think so to all the evidence we can see
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:07.620]  and that the cues we can get you know is
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:09.320]  that you know everything everybody
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:10.820]  thought is true that they were selling
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.620]  well in US they're selling and
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:15.120]  particularly well in Asian markets where
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:17.520]  larger sites and there's there's general
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.720]  weights for it for the for it for the
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:21.120]  large one and yet and the other thing
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:23.220]  too is you're seeing especially in Asian
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:25.420]  markets right at the back we were
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:27.120]  talking about like the proportion of
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.320]  the six of the six plus that proportion
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:31.820]  is changing as the six plus gets supply
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:34.920]  so I think is in which means that the
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:36.820]  the average selling price is gonna be
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:40.220]  higher like yeah it's it's a lot higher
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:42.120]  because it's a hundred dollars higher at
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:43.720]  each pricing tier and it's a hundred
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:46.320]  dollars higher at the starting price so
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:48.620]  anything about demand anything that
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:50.520]  shows positive demand for the six plus
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.820]  in particular is huge for Apple in terms
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:57.320]  of average selling price I honestly
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:00.120]  wouldn't be surprised if average selling
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.020]  price year-over-year is significantly
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:04.520]  higher which I don't think it's ever
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:05.720]  happened before I think it's always gone
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:07.920]  down it always pops on the launch
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:11.020]  quarter because because well that's why
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:12.920]  I'm saying you're exactly no I agree I
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:16.220]  agree right it's you know and that Apple
[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:18.320]  has held average selling prices high
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.520]  compared to the rest of the smartphone
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.620]  industry you know obviously you know
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:24.720]  that's an extraordinary their exception
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:27.120]  in that regard but it still has slowly
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:29.720]  trickled down since the original iPhone
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:31.620]  you know in a way that's not worrisome
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:33.720]  for the company it's probably actually
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:34.920]  have been a positive sign that they've
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:36.820]  kept them as high as they hand hadn't
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.520]  kept the trickle low but I think there's
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:40.220]  a serious chance that the existence of
[02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:41.920]  the six plus will actually raise the
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.220]  average selling price year-over-year
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:45.420]  how only the launch I fully expect that
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:47.720]  to be the case I agree and like you said
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:49.120]  I do think I think that there's still
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:50.520]  supply constraint on them I think that
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  they're selling them they're there they
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:54.620]  they you know they can't make them fast
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:59.120]  enough to meet demand yet but the story
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.320]  of the two phones again they're super
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.620]  important I think they're super
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:04.720]  successful like profoundly successful
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.020]  maybe that maybe the most successful
[02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:09.620]  launch year of iPhone to date not just
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:11.320]  in fact of record-breaking numbers but
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:14.920]  just exceeding expectations but there
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.420]  weren't they weren't hard to explain
[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:20.620]  they were like it's like the iPhone but
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:24.520]  it's bigger yeah and you know and what
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.820]  was you know what did Schiller
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.420]  demonstrate well he talked about you
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:28.920]  know a lot of the photography stuff that
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:30.120]  they've done that's new you know it's a
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:31.620]  better camera than it was before not
[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:33.120]  really that hard to explain it's a
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.320]  better camera than ever and they're
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.820]  bigger phones and they're thin and they
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.720]  get amazing battery life and that's it I
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:42.020]  mean it was not a hard thing to explain
[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:44.820]  because it's truly just an iteration
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.620]  over what they've done before and they
[02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:48.620]  made it bigger whereas Windows 10
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:53.020]  compared to everything else is it it
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:56.020]  demanded a story it's a new thing this
[02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:58.020]  this whole strategy of one OS that runs
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:00.220]  on everything from phones to small
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:02.520]  tablets to big tablets to hybrids to
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:06.420]  desktops is all new and the way that
[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:09.520]  they're sort of have this one OS but
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:12.020]  different interfaces that are suited to
[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:16.520]  the different size devices demanded
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:19.520]  demos and attention and you know is it
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:21.120]  store it's the whole story of Microsoft
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.220]  for the rest of the year and it's a lot
[02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:27.120]  to I think brush that aside with the you
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:31.020]  know a prototype pie-in-the-sky thing no
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:33.920]  matter how cool it's not it it's even
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.520]  more profound than that like Microsoft
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:42.120]  like the you they can't take for granted
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:47.120]  Windows on the PC like it it is under
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:50.120]  real threat I believe not just from the
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:53.020]  Mac which is growing remarkably but also
[02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:55.320]  from Chromebooks like the fact of the
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:59.220]  matter is like I I I'm on record as
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:01.920]  saying and and maybe not popular on an
[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:04.220]  Apple podcast but or a you're not a
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:05.820]  podcast you're a all things excellent
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:09.720]  podcast but like yeah that's why
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:12.220]  Chromebook doesn't fit or the pixel does
[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:15.320]  but no most people would be exceptionally
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:16.920]  well served by having an iPhone in a
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:22.620]  Chromebook and and a lot of windows
[02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:24.120]  especially the consumer market is
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.520]  arguably due to inertia but when it
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:28.720]  comes to the enterprise space like the
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:30.520]  enterprise and businesses that's the
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:33.820]  core Microsoft I mean you think that
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:35.520]  consumers hated Windows 8 or that
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:37.120]  reviewers hated Windows 8 or that MG
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.120]  Siegler hated Windows 8 like the
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:42.720]  enterprise hated Windows 8 times 100
[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:45.120]  because it I mean there was actually
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.920]  there under the surface there's a lot of
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:48.620]  good stuff on his eight for for
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.220]  administering and security and all that
[02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:52.520]  sort of stuff but the last thing any
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:54.220]  sort of administrator wants to deal with
[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:55.520]  is having to teach people how to use
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:57.620]  their computer right like that that's
[02:30:57.620 --> 02:31:01.220]  that's that that's awful and that's what
[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:02.520]  Windows 8 kind of brought them and so
[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:05.720]  Microsoft like there's nothing more
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:08.920]  important to Windows I don't think it's
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:09.920]  more important Microsoft because I don't
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.120]  think Windows should be most important
[02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:12.420]  we need that later but there's nothing
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:14.620]  more important to Windows than like
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:17.920]  laying out like we've come to our senses
[02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:20.920]  like this is you can depend on us we're
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:22.720]  like sorry about that this is something
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:25.020]  you can see and believe in and that
[02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:26.620]  message needs to get out and it needs to
[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:28.320]  be pushed out do you think it's do you
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.420]  think it's fair do you think it's fair
[02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:31.020]  to describe it as stop the bleeding
[02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:34.020]  yeah for absolutely I mean what I agree
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:35.620]  point one was stop the bleeding
[02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:38.420]  arguably but that was more of a like a
[02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:41.520]  battlefield like like what's the thing
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.120]  where you wrap around your arm and like
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:45.220]  it it it stanches the like the blood
[02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:47.320]  flow yeah yeah yeah I know what you mean
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:51.920]  a turquette or turn it turn it turn it
[02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:54.320]  turn it turn it we're demonstrating our
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:57.820]  bad population in yeah turn it uh yeah I
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:31:59.120]  agree and this is their way of saying
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:00.820]  look here's something that's new that
[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:02.020]  we've been working on and that it's
[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:04.120]  different and that we're proud to say we
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:05.720]  think you're gonna like it you know
[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:07.420]  here's us saying here's our vision for
[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:09.120]  the future and we think it goes along
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:12.120]  with what you want to hear from us now I
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:13.720]  totally agree with that I even with the
[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:15.220]  Chromebook front my familiarity with
[02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:17.120]  Chromebooks is through my son and they
[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:18.520]  have a lot of them and it's most of the
[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:20.720]  computing devices at a school that he
[02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:22.020]  gets to use their Chromebooks I mean
[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:24.020]  there's a mix there's some MacBooks
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:25.520]  there too but they don't get to touch
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:27.220]  them much and there's some iPads but
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:28.820]  it's mostly when the kids do stuff on a
[02:32:28.820 --> 02:32:31.720]  computer it's on Chromebooks and it's
[02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:33.020]  interesting to me because he complains
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:34.720]  about him and it's not again I've said
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.620]  this before many times it's if anything
[02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:39.620]  he likes to tweak me not please me so as
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:42.220]  he's not like Pro Apple because his dad
[02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:44.120]  writes about Apple if anything he would
[02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:47.420]  love to complain about Apple just to get
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:48.920]  under my skin he complains about the
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.120]  Chromebooks because he just says they're
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:51.620]  pieces of junk I think there's there's
[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:54.820]  all Samsung's you know just flimsy that
[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:56.320]  he complains about the keys and he says
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:57.820]  all his friends do too they all complain
[02:32:57.820 --> 02:32:59.420]  they all want them replaced with
[02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:01.820]  MacBooks and I thought was interesting
[02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:03.220]  though then a couple weeks ago he said
[02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:07.320]  they had a big thing where they all got
[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:08.720]  called together and like the lower
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:10.420]  school or middle school I guess he's in
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:11.520]  middle school now the middle school
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.520]  principal called him together and that
[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:15.320]  one of the other fifth grade classes
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:17.920]  trashed a bunch of the Chromebooks like
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:20.620]  you know just way that fifth grade boys
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:23.620]  probably the boys let's face it and I
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:24.920]  was like and I said to him I said you
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:26.020]  know what that's why they make you guys
[02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:27.620]  just piece of crap Chromebooks instead
[02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:29.920]  of MacBooks because you guys are rough
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:31.320]  with them you know you don't treat them
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:32.420]  like you would your own you treat them
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:35.520]  like you know yeah cool property but it
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.320]  made me think just in large some it's
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:40.820]  there's a market for computers that an
[02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:43.720]  institution chooses for you for other
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:45.320]  reasons and that may not be what you
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:46.720]  would want to use yourself and that
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:49.720]  Microsoft owned that market owned it a
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:51.020]  hundred percent they had like a hundred
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:53.720]  percent of that market of stuff that an
[02:33:53.720 --> 02:33:55.220]  institution of any kind whether it's a
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:56.720]  business a corporation like a fortune
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:59.520]  500 or a middle school or something like
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:02.420]  that and Chromebooks are absolutely
[02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:04.720]  eating into that and it informs
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:07.620]  everything else because you know what
[02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:09.120]  do they do on a Chromebook well they
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.420]  certainly don't use Microsoft Word
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:12.320]  right I mean it's when they're typing
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.320]  stuff it's in Google Docs you know and
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:17.320]  so everything that falls out of that of
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:20.420]  them not buying if they're gonna buy
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:22.120]  kids a bunch of piece of crap notebooks
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:25.220]  that it can be used as beaters them being
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:26.820]  Chromebooks instead of being Windows
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:29.320]  machines has all sorts of
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:31.220]  repercussions other than just the
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:32.620]  licensing fee for Windows that they're
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:34.320]  not getting off the sale yeah well they
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:35.720]  don't they don't get used to office I
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:37.020]  mean the reality is most people don't
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:39.620]  need office but once you're used to it
[02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.420]  you're used to it and that's super
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:44.420]  powerful and yeah and Microsoft
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:49.320]  shouldn't take it for granted it's just
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:50.620]  one you know schools is just one
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:52.020]  everybody I know but you know there's no
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:53.320]  doubt my mind those two Chromebooks are
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:55.820]  a huge thing in education no no yeah no
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:58.720]  I mean the numbers reflect that um yeah
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:00.320]  the Chromebook thing is frustrating
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.820]  because like I I actually genuinely like
[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:04.920]  using it like if your stuff is a is
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:07.520]  actually all in the cloud it's it's it's
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.320]  a delight to use in the way like an
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.120]  iPad is left full to use in that like
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:13.920]  there's just no there's no cruft right
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:16.120]  there's no dealing with updates or like
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.820]  stuff popping up or like you know like
[02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:21.620]  when you deal with OS X or Windows or
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:22.920]  anything there's just so much stuff that
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:25.220]  came before that's still hanging around
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:28.420]  for various reasons whereas with a
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:30.220]  Chromebook it's it's just so it's it's
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:32.420]  an appliance it's you turn it on and you
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:33.620]  type stuff in it and then you put it
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:36.120]  away and I that's why I like it I don't
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:37.220]  like because it's cheap I like it
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:39.820]  because it's so simple and that's why I
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:41.820]  love the pixel because the pixel like
[02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:44.920]  I'm paying for phenomenal hardware like
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:47.720]  the pixel is like I can't I can't speak
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:49.420]  highly enough of it the keyboard
[02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:52.520]  trackpad screen all Apple quality if I
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:54.120]  put the keyboard above Apple actually
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:57.620]  um and but the problem is is most people
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:35:59.820]  buy Chromebooks are cheap so there's no
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.820]  market for it which is which makes me
[02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:05.920]  very sad yeah I wonder how many pixels
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.520]  probably not very money but I bet that's
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:10.120]  another one that's old I'm tempted to
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:12.120]  pull a you in the Apple extended
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:13.620]  keyboard like I want to buy up a couple
[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:16.920]  of them I could keep I write like my
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:18.420]  daily updates where you know which are
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:20.920]  more referential to current events and
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:22.920]  like I'm winking a lot I'll do those I
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:24.320]  mostly write those on my Mac and
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:25.920]  multiple screens stuff like that but
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:28.020]  like my big articles where they're more
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:30.420]  like for lack of a better word like
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:32.320]  thought pieces or like like where I'm
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.520]  trying to articulate an argument I
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:36.320]  almost always write that on those are
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.520]  almost all around the pixel and just
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:39.620]  because I love the environment right
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:41.620]  there's nothing else going on and it's a
[02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:43.220]  great typing environment in the screen
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:46.120]  gorgeous screen and like you just like
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.720]  get lost in your document and so I still
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:52.420]  I still use it like at least weekly if
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.520]  not more yeah I don't well I don't think
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.020]  it's any coincidence that I mean there's
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:59.120]  that whole rise of you know like single
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:01.420]  window window user mode and text
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:03.820]  editors that are you know like by word
[02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:05.420]  and other ones that are meant to be
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:08.320]  distraction-free and run you know as a
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:11.720]  single window but I think in general
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:13.520]  matter what app you use even if you
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:16.120]  don't use a single window user mode or
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:20.420]  any kind of thing that's designed to be
[02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:24.720]  distraction-free writing on a laptop is
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:27.120]  just inherently more distraction-free
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:29.020]  than writing at a desktop with a big
[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:30.320]  window you know where you can see much
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.620]  not totally it just feels more focused
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:34.220]  there's no and there's no question you
[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:35.520]  just hear from people who write anything
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:38.620]  you know from novelists to journalists
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:41.620]  you know the the biggest form to the
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:45.020]  quickest and shortest form you know
[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:46.820]  they just live and die by their yeah
[02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:49.320]  totally totally so the thing with
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:52.820]  windows though is um what what what I
[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:54.420]  was most impressed by it was actually at
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:56.120]  the very very beginning the part that
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:59.420]  you missed um where they basically
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:04.820]  articulated the idea that Windows needed
[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:07.820]  to be or you need to be personal and it
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.220]  wasn't about the device it was about the
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:11.820]  person the person should be able to go
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:14.320]  from device to device like they're
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:15.620]  moving to where where there's more
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:17.820]  devices than people and and if you think
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:19.220]  about it Microsoft has always been about
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:21.720]  the PC and that that's how their
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:23.220]  business models been based on that's how
[02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:24.720]  their product developments been based on
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:26.220]  like everything's been based on the
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:30.920]  device and but the world today is you
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:33.820]  have to focus on the person and so you
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:35.020]  have to have that and this was the
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:36.620]  Apple is doing too with continuity all
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:38.220]  that sort of stuff is you need to have
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:40.020]  the seamless experience it's no longer
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:43.220]  enough to think about just OS 10 like I
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.020]  love John Syracuse's conclusion to Yosemite
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:47.820]  he really take clear this well like it's
[02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:50.220]  not that Apple is now developing
[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:51.920]  disparate operating systems are
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:54.920]  developing one system with various
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:57.220]  manifestations that need to work
[02:38:57.220 --> 02:38:59.920]  together and and go across from wrist to
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.620]  to laptop to desktop to phone to tablet
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:05.820]  and Microsoft articulate this as well and
[02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:07.620]  it's a bigger deal for Microsoft because
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:10.820]  Apple sells sells the actual hardware so
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:13.520]  it this new world fits their business
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:14.820]  model it's actually even better for
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:16.020]  Apple because they can sell that many
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:18.520]  more devices for Microsoft is a big
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:21.820]  shift because it entails a change in
[02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:23.420]  everything that they do in the way their
[02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.520]  companies put together in the way they
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:27.220]  make money and to hear them articulate
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:30.320]  it so clearly and succinctly was really
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:35.020]  encouraging and and I guess my only
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:37.020]  complaint with the first part of the
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:39.520]  of the presentation the part that we
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:42.420]  both liked was the only problem with it
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:46.020]  was that all the demos were were a PC
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.820]  and a Windows phone or Windows tablet
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.820]  and that's just not the reality the
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:53.420]  reality is people they needed to demo I
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:55.420]  think a Windows PC with an iPhone or
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:56.620]  with an Android phone because that's
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:58.920]  that's their customer and I just think
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.620]  they needed to double down on the PC and
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:03.620]  and instead they kind of distracted with
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:05.620]  this thing and then you had Nadella
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:06.920]  getting up and talking about we love
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.420]  Windows or want people to have Windows
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:11.220]  it just kind of went off the rails
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:14.120]  that's a hard sell though to have them
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:16.420]  demo with iPhone and and I know that you
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:17.920]  know part of it part of Microsoft
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:19.320]  certainly is more open to that I mean
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:20.820]  you know if you go back to last year in
[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:22.320]  the build conference where they had you
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:23.920]  know me and Brent Simmons and Dave
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:25.920]  Whiskas come out and you know featured
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:28.320]  in a product video for them because
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:32.720]  Vesper uses the Windows live as server
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:38.720]  stuff Azure and and that's all very true
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:40.620]  but it's a hard sell in a Windows 10
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:42.720]  focused event you know but it is
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.020]  interesting and I do think that in
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:46.220]  general sense that they you know it's
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:48.620]  just you know in an Apple like way that
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:50.320]  they can only do so much year over year
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:52.120]  but that they're iterating and I feel
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:54.020]  like they're going in a very similar way
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.020]  where like you said with Syracuse's
[02:40:56.020 --> 02:40:57.720]  conclusion of the Yosemite review that
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:59.920]  it's sort of one system with different
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.720]  interfaces for the different devices and
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.720]  I kind of feel like they missed that
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.720]  with Windows 8 where they kind of shipped
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:09.420]  everything with this touch interface
[02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:11.520]  whether it was a touch device or not and
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:15.520]  it was really mostly you know I don't
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:16.720]  know that just the overall tiled
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:19.320]  interface just really did not work well
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:22.520]  I think on laptops and certainly not on
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.620]  desktops and it was really just sort of
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:26.820]  a tablet slash phone interface but now
[02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:29.620]  they've got you know it's it's more it's
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:31.020]  really you know really is the same
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.820]  Windows 10 like the whole thing with the
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:34.620]  apps I think is fascinating and it shows
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:37.620]  how they're doing it like a higher level
[02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.720]  than Apple where there's not a desktop
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:41.820]  Windows App Store or not going to be for
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:43.920]  Windows 10 and a phone one like if you
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:46.320]  get a Twitter app it could be the same
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.520]  app and it runs on your phone it runs on
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:50.920]  your tablet it runs on your PC but has
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:52.520]  very different interfaces like when
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:54.420]  you're using it on your PC it won't be
[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:56.220]  like you're running an iPhone app on
[02:41:56.220 --> 02:41:57.720]  you know exactly it I mean I think I
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:59.120]  mean Marco had a had a kind of a
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:02.120]  discourse on on on ATP a few weeks ago
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:03.920]  about what you know is he gonna build
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:06.820]  overcast for the Mac and in the
[02:42:06.820 --> 02:42:08.520]  Microsoft vision that wouldn't really be
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:10.320]  a decision he would already have it you
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:11.920]  have to design a new interface but like
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:15.420]  he right right it's a big step for him
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:17.220]  to write a Mac app there wouldn't be the
[02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:19.420]  case that wouldn't be the case for
[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:22.720]  Windows yeah and it's like I said
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:24.620]  earlier with Instagram where it in
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:27.620]  today's iOS world if you do the stuff
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:29.720]  that's necessary to support the you know
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:31.820]  the iPhone 5s size the iPhone 6 size
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:35.220]  iPhone 6 plus size going to the iPad is
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:37.820]  just a fourth size and you know that's
[02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:39.820]  sort of what they're doing with the
[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:41.620]  Windows stuff and this isn't brand new I
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:42.820]  mean that was a big part of the message
[02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:45.420]  at build last May was the way that you
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:47.220]  can build these Universal apps that
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:50.820]  would run across a incredible you know
[02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:54.920]  it from TVs to phones with interfaces
[02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:57.020]  specific to those devices you know that
[02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:58.820]  you could have the same app you could
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:00.920]  get it from the App Store and on the
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:03.320]  phone clearly it's a touch space device
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:05.120]  where it's all based on touching the
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:08.220]  glass and on your TV it's all based on
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:09.720]  using a remote control to go up down
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:11.020]  left right the thing is though and this
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:12.920]  is the thing for for for Microsoft and
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:15.120]  it's both like the the the problem and
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:19.720]  the opportunity is the this idea of
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:22.420]  moving from device to device it's
[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:25.320]  actually not it's not that much about
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:28.320]  the operating system it because all if
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:30.920]  you think about it like it's all it's
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:33.920]  all about the cloud like if and it's not
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:35.420]  it's not just about the cloud it's about
[02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:38.020]  a whole bunch of clouds so my Facebook
[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:40.520]  is is the same everywhere because it's
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:41.820]  all on Facebook's cloud my Twitter is
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:43.720]  the same everywhere my emails the same
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:45.720]  like a lot of the services we already
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:48.020]  have are already in sync across devices
[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:50.720]  because they're inherently kind of
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:53.820]  cloud-based and and that's I mean that
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:57.020]  that's in so to it's almost like to I
[02:43:57.020 --> 02:44:00.220]  mean he's the word to over index on on
[02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:03.220]  the operating system being consistent
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:05.920]  is if you think about it less important
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:07.720]  than having that kind of service layer
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:09.520]  that that's the part that is actually
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.120]  consistent the cloud is consistent
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:13.120]  across all these devices and oh by the
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:15.620]  way that's Microsoft is doing really
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.020]  great stuff in the cloud and and I do
[02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:21.220]  think that Nadella gets this there's a
[02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:22.720]  clear part of Microsoft that gets this
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:25.320]  and I think is still an opportunity to
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:30.120]  the glue can still be better even on
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:33.520]  iOS on Android and and I think
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:36.020]  Microsoft is making strong moves in that
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:37.720]  area and I don't know I mean yes it
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:39.220]  would have been a radical move but I
[02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:41.320]  would have loved to like how powerful
[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:43.620]  would have been to have Microsoft just
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:47.120]  fully embrace the we are the best PC
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:49.220]  operating system screw the max through
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:51.120]  the Chromebook I mean obviously we can
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:53.020]  disagree or you can disagree but like
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:55.220]  that's a fair position for them to take
[02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:59.720]  and we with our cloud we work well with
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:01.720]  whatever device you bring you know along
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:05.720]  with it right especially with Windows
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:08.320]  Phone but whatever you know whatever
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:10.120]  you're using it'll work great with yeah
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:12.720]  and I just I get Microsoft saying like
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:15.220]  we like if you use all windows it'll be
[02:45:15.220 --> 02:45:16.920]  the best because it is true I mean if
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:18.820]  you if you get everything from one
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:20.720]  company you're likely to get a better
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:22.520]  experience but the problem is it's just
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:24.720]  not it's just not reality and I just I
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:27.620]  don't know I'm a big fan of maybe it
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:29.520]  goes back to the Amazon thing like you
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:32.620]  can live do you want to go with what's
[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:34.820]  best for you or what is like the way
[02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:36.020]  that customers actually live their lives
[02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:39.120]  yeah so I feel like the event should
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:41.520]  have I feel like the surface hub which
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:46.520]  is their big 84 inch 4k TV touchscreen
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:52.720]  whiteboard meeting dingus I feel like
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:53.920]  that that would have been a good way to
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:56.720]  end it right because that fits that and
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:58.820]  it wasn't distracting from the earlier
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:00.520]  message to me it emphasized the earlier
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:02.920]  message which is that Windows 10 runs on
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.520]  everything from this hold up a phone
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:08.020]  right and even a big lumiophone even a
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:09.920]  big five and a half inch phone is tiny
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:13.220]  compared to a giant 84 inch TV and I
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:14.920]  think it was a cool surprise because the
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.120]  TV had been right there showing slides
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:19.620]  the whole presentation you know that
[02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:20.920]  this thing that they were announcing
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:23.020]  which was a surprise was right there in
[02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:24.520]  front of everybody and it's super
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:25.720]  compelling to the enterprise but then
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:27.720]  it and like which is which is the part
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:29.520]  the market that they really needed to
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:33.320]  straight right and it's you know here's
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:34.920]  here's any you know here's one thing
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.920]  where Microsoft can get out in front and
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.720]  you know Apple doesn't sell anything
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:40.320]  like this Google doesn't have anything
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:41.920]  like this nobody has anything like this
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:43.820]  right this is a product that's not
[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:46.420]  really like anything else and like you
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:49.120]  said there's a clear you can easily see
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:50.720]  how there's a lot of people at this week
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.320]  who are saying hey we could use that
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:55.120]  right we we could use that that would be
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:56.920]  good for us whether it's the whiteboard
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:00.720]  part or the meeting part or both you
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:03.620]  know it's it's you could it's not like
[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:04.920]  you have to jump through hoops to find
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:07.520]  a reason to to that you might want to
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:09.420]  buy it and then end it right there
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:11.420]  because I think that the HoloLens stuff
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:12.820]  not that they shouldn't have done it I
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:14.720]  just save it for build right why not do
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:17.220]  that at build and have a cool fun thing
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:18.920]  you know maybe they've got something
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.720]  else for a build too but I don't know
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:22.520]  save that for build and let the Windows
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.620]  10 event breathe for itself I I can I
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:27.820]  think it's a tricky it's a tricky comp
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:30.120]  it's a tricky thing being one of those
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:31.520]  big companies where you've got a lot of
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:33.120]  stuff coming out throughout the year how
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.420]  many events do you break them into you
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:36.820]  know how much do you shoehorn into one
[02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:40.020]  keynote but I think they made a mistake
[02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:42.420]  by doing how well how about announcing
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:44.220]  HoloLens when it's Ellen it's gonna ship
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:47.920]  in a month or it's a ship in two months
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:50.920]  yeah I don't know and it also makes me a
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:53.420]  little skeptical like and and the people
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:54.920]  who got to play with it all raved about
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:57.120]  the experience and so it doesn't seem
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:59.320]  like there's any kind of it's a real
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:03.620]  thing yeah yeah it's it's you know it's
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:05.620]  real technology and every I didn't see a
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:07.120]  single person who tried it who didn't
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:09.720]  give it a very positive response but
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:13.820]  it's clearly prototype hardware you know
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:16.120]  that their promised shipping device is
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.120]  the thing with no cables you just put
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:19.820]  its battery operated and you put it on
[02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:21.620]  your head and that's it whereas the
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:24.320]  thing that they let people try it
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:27.520]  involved like a battery pack on your
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:30.020]  waist and a cable connecting the battery
[02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:33.620]  pack to the thing on your head and they
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:36.420]  had to take physical measurements of the
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:38.320]  distance between your pupils and then
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:39.820]  enter it by hand into the device
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.820]  whereas the you know the shipping
[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:43.520]  product is supposed to be you know like
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.520]  if you've got one and I try it on it's
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.620]  gonna the device itself will measure the
[02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:52.120]  pupil distance to calibrate itself it's
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:54.820]  all very that's raises all sorts of red
[02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:59.220]  stuffs hard I mind right 90% 100% and it
[02:48:59.220 --> 02:49:01.320]  is that's the hard part and it's sort of
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:04.620]  it you know of course I'm gonna bring it
[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:05.920]  back to Apple but it's an interesting
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:09.120]  contrast with the watch where when they
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:15.320]  showed us the watch back in October or I
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:16.720]  guess it was September right September
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.020]  was the watch it was I mean they didn't
[02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:23.220]  say it's final hardware but it was as
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:25.320]  close to final you know I'm sure there
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:26.420]  might be some tweaks or something like
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:27.920]  that but it was you know they were real
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:29.320]  the things they let us and they let us
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.720]  try them on our wrists and you know it's
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:34.020]  the same materials there were stainless
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:36.020]  they were they were gold they were
[02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:39.220]  aluminum all the bands were there we got
[02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:42.520]  to play with the bands and they just
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:44.620]  didn't let us see the software you know
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:45.820]  they just had the demo loop of the
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.320]  software but the actual hardware was
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:50.020]  there I mean it's there's no trickery
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:52.420]  about it that's interesting yet where is
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:53.720]  it sounds like Microsoft had the
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:55.520]  software pretty nailed down but not the
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:58.420]  hardware well no but they didn't really
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.320]  it wasn't it was the software was also a
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:01.520]  can't the software they took people
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:03.320]  through was all canned you know
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.520]  everybody got the same loop well I mean
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.120]  in canned in a way where it wasn't just
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:09.920]  playing like with the watch it really
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:11.620]  just played a loop and there was no
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:13.920]  interactivity at all whereas clearly
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:15.420]  this thing was actually I guess you
[02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:17.020]  moved your head was adjusting what you
[02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:19.420]  saw you know it was all but you know the
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:20.820]  things that you did were very very
[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:22.320]  limited it was everybody got the same
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:24.120]  Minecraft game everybody got the same
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:29.020]  you know a Skype call to how to hook up
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:30.620]  a little switch which I thought was the
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:33.820]  most compelling yeah that's really cool
[02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:36.220]  they did the demo they had it you know
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:39.220]  in the in the product video they showed
[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:41.320]  somebody getting help doing some home
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:43.320]  plumbing repair in the thing that they
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:45.320]  gave to the journalists it was a little
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:46.720]  bit of like it was like hooking up a
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:48.120]  light switch a little home electricity
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:49.620]  and the idea is they had an expert
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:51.420]  electrician on the other end using Skype
[02:50:51.420 --> 02:50:53.720]  on a tablet who could see what you see
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:58.620]  through your hololens and then he could
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.520]  annotate it with his finger on the
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:02.420]  tablet by saying here take this cable
[02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:04.120]  here and then you know draw a little
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:06.720]  line on it and hook this thing up to
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:08.620]  there and do that you know which is a
[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:10.320]  very compelling it's not just compelling
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:12.020]  from a use perspective it's compelling
[02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:13.220]  from a product perspective because that
[02:51:13.220 --> 02:51:15.820]  that's a platform like it you could see
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:18.020]  there being all kinds of services being
[02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:20.920]  offered you know over this and it's an
[02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:23.220]  example like I think you know in the
[02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:25.420]  long run I'm more interested in
[02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:27.020]  augmented reality than I'm in virtual
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:28.720]  reality like I think I mean Oculus Rift
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:31.820]  looks amazing but to me that's in the
[02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:35.120]  same vein as video games it is video
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:37.820]  games I mean and I might mean that to be
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.420]  dismissive because I realize video games
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:42.820]  are an enormous industry you know like
[02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:45.820]  Horace did you just posted a point that
[02:51:45.820 --> 02:51:48.520]  that the App Store is now paying
[02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:51.120]  developers more than the box office
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:54.120]  receipts of Hollywood combined in the
[02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:56.820]  US and some people I link yeah and some
[02:51:56.820 --> 02:51:58.120]  people linked out like they're like so
[02:51:58.120 --> 02:51:59.520]  what and I was like well it's not a huge
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:01.220]  it's not like a magic number it doesn't
[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:03.020]  mean anything in particular it's just a
[02:52:03.020 --> 02:52:04.820]  just put it in context though like you
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:06.520]  we've all grown up knowing that Hollywood
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:08.820]  is Hollywood and it's a big deal you
[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:10.820]  know the Apple App Store alone is now
[02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:14.020]  bigger than that yeah but it's a
[02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:16.120]  destination it's a thing you go and do
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:18.620]  whereas like the what's so compelling
[02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:20.520]  about the smartphone is it's with you
[02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:22.320]  all the time in your actual real life
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:25.120]  and you can see like in like 10 years
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:28.020]  down the road where the what Microsoft
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:30.620]  is doing is actually like a normal pair
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:32.520]  of glasses like the thing with Google
[02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:35.120]  Glasses like the the the fundamental
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:37.920]  concept I don't think was flawed just
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:39.820]  everything about the product execution
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:43.520]  was was horribly flawed right and and a
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.520]  lot of the the contrary feedback I've
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:49.520]  gotten this week you know is it's like
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:50.920]  well how can you how can you say that
[02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:52.820]  this looks cool and you're you know did
[02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:54.420]  nothing but shit all over Google Glass
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:57.320]  for two years and it's again it's like I
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:52:59.320]  never I and I don't think anybody ever
[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:03.020]  said that augmented reality is a goofy
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:04.820]  idea that's never going to take off it
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:06.920]  was glass in particular everything about
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.820]  glass that the actual nature of how it
[02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:10.720]  was presented in their their proposal of
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:13.720]  how you'd use it right was was wrong not
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:15.620]  the idea that augmented reality in
[02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:19.120]  general is bad no you know I can see it
[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:20.620]  I can see it multiple ways I can see it
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:23.920]  where you know obtrusive headsets like
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:26.120]  what you know HoloLens is going to be
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:29.120]  when it ships I mean I you know you look
[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:30.820]  like Robocop looking on that's okay
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:33.720]  they'll see I could see right you know
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:35.720]  there's all sorts of things you do at
[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:38.020]  home that you wouldn't do in public that
[02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:40.020]  you look weird like being you know
[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:41.520]  hunching your shoulders over a little
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:44.220]  video game controller is not something
[02:53:44.220 --> 02:53:47.620]  you would do while you know I you know
[02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:49.520]  out in public but you know while you're
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:52.020]  playing a game it's fine if you think
[02:53:52.020 --> 02:53:52.920]  about something like what's the
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:54.220]  precursor of the iPhone it's like it's
[02:53:54.220 --> 02:53:56.820]  like the iPod but from a fundamental
[02:53:56.820 --> 02:53:58.220]  level they're very different products
[02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:00.120]  the iPod was dependent on a PC the
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:01.820]  center of your existence was the PC the
[02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:04.220]  digital hub and the iPod lets you carry
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:07.220]  music with you yet from a like a hardware
[02:54:07.220 --> 02:54:10.020]  perspective the iPod very much led to
[02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:12.720]  the iPhone you know the what Apple learn
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:15.020]  miniaturization battery technology all
[02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:16.920]  that sort of stuff led to the iPhone and
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:18.720]  I think it's a similar thing here right
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:20.520]  now it will start out as being something
[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:22.220]  you do at home you're not gonna wear
[02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:25.820]  this Robocop thing outside but Microsoft
[02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:28.820]  will develop the expertise and and like
[02:54:28.820 --> 02:54:30.420]  how to build this sort of stuff it'll
[02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:32.820]  get smaller and at some point they will
[02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:36.420]  be ready to make the shift you know to
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:38.220]  being something outside whereas Google
[02:54:38.220 --> 02:54:39.920]  jumps straight to being outside when the
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:41.720]  technology isn't even remotely close to
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:44.320]  being ready and and that's why it was a
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:47.420]  mess and you know and everything fell
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:48.820]  out of that everything fell out of that
[02:54:48.820 --> 02:54:50.420]  because then by trying to make it small
[02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:52.320]  enough that you'd even vaguely want to
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:53.620]  wear it or be willing to wear it in
[02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:55.420]  public it was so technically limited
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:58.020]  that it wasn't compelling there was
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:00.020]  never anything about it that was like a
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:03.620]  Wow holy crap whereas also you know that
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:05.020]  was more or less the response everybody
[02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:06.920]  had who got to try the on the hololens
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.320]  at the Microsoft event was Wow this is
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:11.220]  so frustrating right like the HoloLens
[02:55:11.220 --> 02:55:14.720]  it was genuinely compelling and it's
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:17.920]  compelling from a today perspective and
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:19.720]  it's a compelling from a like 10 year
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:23.320]  from now perspective and and it's just a
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:26.820]  shame that I and so I guess they got the
[02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:29.520]  HoloLens benefit but I mean like why did
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:32.720]  it have to be at this event I that's
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:35.820]  exactly my point exactly I couldn't
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:37.520]  agree more and I and as the week has
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:38.720]  gone on and I've seen what people have
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:41.420]  written about I my that was my initial
[02:55:41.420 --> 02:55:43.620]  reaction on day one and it's only been
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:45.120]  reaffirmed because almost everything
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.420]  I've seen written since it's been about
[02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:49.320]  HoloLens not about windows yeah and in
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:52.220]  one they needed to make points about
[02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:54.020]  Windows 10 that like this is Windows and
[02:55:54.020 --> 02:55:56.020]  chill out you know we've come to our
[02:55:56.020 --> 02:55:58.320]  senses and to like the vision was
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:00.420]  compelling but no one no one's paying
[02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:03.120]  attention to it right and it's a hard
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:04.920]  thing you know I know you're there I
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:06.320]  can see why they're excited about it I
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:07.820]  can see why they might have been excited
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:10.120]  to announce it but I think you gotta I
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:11.320]  think you got to hold that bullet for a
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:13.420]  little longer yeah and again it's not
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:14.420]  that you'd not that you have to wait
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:16.220]  until it's ready to ship you know next
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:19.120]  week but you know just a little closer
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:20.720]  and they have an event coming up they
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:22.120]  have billed coming up in just a few
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:23.620]  months and I you know I don't think
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:24.520]  there's anything that would have happened
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:25.520]  in the next few months that would have
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:28.720]  made it less of a cool thing to unveil
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:31.320]  there well if anything it'll be better
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:33.520]  all right I don't know because it would
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  only be you know further along yeah I
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:39.020]  can't help but think that they really
[02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:40.720]  wasted an opportunity that are mistimed
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:43.420]  that distracted from what the cool
[02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:46.020]  things they did have to announce and you
[02:56:46.020 --> 02:56:50.020]  know it's kind of sad because it's almost
[02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:51.620]  like a lack of confidence right like
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:54.320]  they weren't they weren't confident what
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:56.920]  they had to announce or like their their
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:56:59.020]  status as a company I guess I mean I can
[02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:00.520]  see where that comes from I guess but
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:03.220]  like they felt like they needed to juice
[02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:06.320]  it up and they didn't need to right yeah
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:09.620]  yeah I kind of agree with that yeah
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:12.020]  otherwise it was a pretty well-run event
[02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:13.420]  though I do think that they're getting
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:15.020]  their act together on that front yeah I
[02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:17.420]  mean like like they started on top like
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:19.120]  it sounds stupid but they started on
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:21.620]  time the presentations were tight the
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:26.220]  demos didn't fail like and that's that's
[02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:29.220]  that will that stuff matters and it
[02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:31.020]  wasn't the case even just a couple years
[02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:33.320]  yeah and it's you know I think that it's
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.020]  it's also a sign to me the whole event
[02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:39.020]  even with them in my mind in your mind
[02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:42.020]  the mistake of tossing hololens into as
[02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:44.520]  unnecessary icing on the cake or
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:47.220]  distracting icing on the cake even with
[02:57:47.220 --> 02:57:50.020]  it it still felt like overall like a new
[02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:52.720]  Microsoft which I think they a needed
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:55.620]  and be that Nadella needed you know to
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:58.020]  assert you know in a public way to make
[02:57:58.020 --> 02:58:00.620]  it feel like you know he is changing the
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:04.920]  course of this ship yeah I love the
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:06.420]  frosting idea because that's exactly what
[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:07.720]  it was it's like this is really good
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:09.120]  frosting it's a really good cake but
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:12.120]  these they should go together yeah you
[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:15.720]  know and what else I mean I would say
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.220]  making Windows 10 free I mean they're
[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:20.420]  calling it free a free upgrade for
[02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:22.320]  anybody running Windows 7 or 8 for the
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:23.720]  first year I don't know why they tacked
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:25.220]  on that first year why not just say it's
[02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:28.220]  a free update for Windows 7 or 8 I guess
[02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:29.820]  the ID only thing I can think of is that
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:31.320]  they don't want people to wait they want
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:33.620]  people running Windows 7 and 8 to upgrade
[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:36.920]  within the first year but it just seems
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:39.620]  like a weird like asterisk to put on it
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:41.620]  but the whole idea of it being free
[02:58:41.620 --> 02:58:45.420]  seems like post-balmer Microsoft well
[02:58:45.420 --> 02:58:47.620]  Windows 8 was free for the first three
[02:58:47.620 --> 02:58:51.020]  months if you had Windows 7 I believe so
[02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:53.720]  they did do it before and the reality is
[02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:55.420]  is Microsoft makes the vast majority of
[02:58:55.420 --> 02:58:56.520]  the revenue either from enterprise
[02:58:56.520 --> 02:58:59.620]  licensing or from new PC sold with
[02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:02.020]  Windows like only only like 10% of
[02:59:02.020 --> 02:59:03.720]  Windows revenue has ever come from people
[02:59:03.720 --> 02:59:06.520]  actually paying for upgrades but that's
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:08.220]  that it's still it still matters and
[02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:09.520]  it's meaningful and yeah the one you're
[02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:11.720]  think like it's not just that but also
[02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:13.320]  they basically said anyone who buys a
[02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:15.720]  Windows 10 PC will get upgrades for the
[02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:18.220]  like the life of the life of expected
[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:20.920]  life of the PC and it sounds like it's
[02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:23.420]  gonna be more of it's it really is more
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:26.120]  of a Apple sort of model like OS 10
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:28.420]  today where you get it and you're gonna
[02:59:28.420 --> 02:59:29.820]  get upgrades and you're not gonna pay
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:32.220]  pay for those upgrades and that is a big
[02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:34.020]  deal it's a shift it's a shift to this
[02:59:34.020 --> 02:59:37.420]  the person being the center and sort of
[02:59:37.420 --> 02:59:39.620]  sort of mindset that that that is a
[02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:41.420]  bigger shift for Microsoft than it is
[02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:43.220]  for Apple because it it requires
[02:59:43.220 --> 02:59:45.120]  changing how they how they make money
[02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:47.220]  and and I kind of poo-pooed it on
[02:59:47.220 --> 02:59:48.820]  exponent this week but I think you're
[02:59:48.820 --> 02:59:52.220]  right it is it is it is worth it is
[02:59:52.220 --> 02:59:54.020]  worth acknowledging I think it's also
[02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:55.820]  it's even more worth acknowledging in the
[02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:57.920]  way that like the bugs and Apple
[02:59:57.920 --> 02:59:59.320]  software that we've all been talking
[02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:00.720]  about this month are so much easier to
[03:00:00.720 --> 03:00:02.320]  complain about then the things that they
[03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:05.220]  do that are just work that are kind of
[03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:09.720]  amazing that they just work and you know
[03:00:09.720 --> 03:00:11.020]  it's easy to take those things for
[03:00:11.020 --> 03:00:12.520]  granted I think in Microsoft's case
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:15.020]  praise for hey here's Windows 10 it's a
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:17.420]  free update for Windows 7 and 8 users is
[03:00:17.420 --> 03:00:19.220]  worth praising even more so because of
[03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:21.420]  how complicated Windows pricing has been
[03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:24.320]  in the past you know with the Pro
[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:27.120]  Edition and Pro Enterprise Edition and
[03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:29.820]  you know eight different editions of the
[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:31.820]  new version of Windows with you know
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:34.920]  just it boggled the mind and I feel like
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:37.120]  just saying well it's just Windows 10
[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:38.620]  and it's a free update for Windows 7 and
[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:41.420]  8 is such a you know it's it's deserving
[03:00:41.420 --> 03:00:44.320]  of praise if it's deserving of praise as
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:46.020]  their old strategy was deserving of
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:51.420]  mockery yeah well it's it's always the
[03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:53.120]  old strategy made a lot of money oh it
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:54.920]  definitely did it in it was this but it
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:57.020]  was a salesperson strategy you know and
[03:00:57.020 --> 03:00:59.020]  I feel like and it wasn't good for them
[03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:01.120]  in the long run it definitely made money
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:03.820]  you know there's you know bottom line
[03:01:03.820 --> 03:01:05.820]  any any discussion or complaints about
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:07.920]  Ballmer's leadership of Microsoft have
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:09.820]  to include the but it made a lot of
[03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:13.420]  money and ever-increasing amounts you
[03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:17.220]  know but it the the having it making
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:18.820]  your product line can unnecessarily
[03:01:18.820 --> 03:01:21.020]  confusing even if it's profitable you
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:23.720]  know in the short term I think it's it's
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:25.720]  detrimental to your branding in the long
[03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:28.320]  run yeah I would what's fascinating for
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:29.720]  me to watch on Microsoft though and this
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:32.820]  is part of it is it's you actually saw
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:35.320]  this with Adobe like Adobe has
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:36.820]  fundamentally shifted how they make
[03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:39.120]  money from selling packaged software to
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:41.920]  selling on like software as a service
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:45.520]  basically and Microsoft is kind of going
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:47.220]  through the same transition and it's and
[03:01:47.220 --> 03:01:49.920]  it's I said this on the exponent this
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:52.520]  week like the thing about Microsoft and
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:54.720]  you have to couch everything in this is
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:56.920]  what you're witnessing with Microsoft
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:01:58.820]  and all the criticism on a web against
[03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:01.020]  the company what they're going through
[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:03.320]  is the price of being so absurdly
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:06.720]  successful yeah like like for every
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:08.320]  smidgen that Microsoft was less
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:10.420]  successful the easier their task would
[03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:14.720]  be today right and and so it's like it's
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:17.220]  a testament to how successful they were
[03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:19.020]  that they're having to go through such
[03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:24.520]  wrenching changes now and and it's
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:26.920]  fascinating to watch and like yeah I was
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:30.520]  a little down in Adele's speech and talk
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:32.620]  about Windows and stuff I think now I
[03:02:32.620 --> 03:02:33.820]  think there might have been a political
[03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:36.020]  motive to it but um it's pretty
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:38.720]  remarkable to see the shift in Microsoft
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:41.320]  in just the last year yeah it's you know
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:45.220]  but they needed to move fast they said
[03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.620]  they're gonna move fast but you know
[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:48.220]  actions speak louder than words and I
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:50.020]  think their actions back it up so I
[03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:51.920]  think overall it was you know it was a
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:53.920]  very you know best event I think
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:55.620]  Microsoft has had in a while even though
[03:02:55.620 --> 03:02:57.020]  I think it so could have easily been
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:03:01.620]  better just by holding HoloLens yeah
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:05.520]  yeah it's gotta be frustrating for them
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:07.620]  because like it because it's not like
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:09.920]  they it's not like it was bad it was
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:11.420]  just the wrong time in wrong place all
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:12.820]  right last question when do you think
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:15.020]  HoloLens is gonna ship actually ship
[03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:16.620]  aside get consumer like something you
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:18.120]  can just go online and buy and how much
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:22.720]  do you think it's gonna cost I would
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:27.720]  guess late 2016 in limited supply and
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:30.420]  it'll be hard to get and cuz I think
[03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:32.420]  when they say Windows 10 timeframe that
[03:03:32.420 --> 03:03:34.020]  means like it's like when Windows 10 is
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:35.320]  like the product on the market it's not
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:36.620]  like when Windows 10 ships before
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:38.820]  Windows 11 ships that's what I that's
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:40.420]  how I interpreted it right exactly
[03:03:40.420 --> 03:03:42.520]  exactly although I do one I do wonder if
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:45.620]  there will ever be a Windows 11 like are
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:49.520]  they what one final borrowing from from
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.020]  Apple um the the price that's
[03:03:53.020 --> 03:03:59.520]  interesting $300 $299 oh wow I was
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:04.620]  thinking I think 2016 I I think if I
[03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:06.020]  wanted to actually have to be honest I
[03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:07.420]  would have to say like you probably
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:09.720]  second half of 2016 I was gonna say
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:12.920]  $1,000 yeah that's possible I it was
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:14.620]  more a like are they going to like
[03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:16.720]  actually trying to make a like a
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:19.620]  thousand dollars it would probably be
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:20.720]  the smart thing because I think it's
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:24.820]  important to nail it um the 29 I was
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:26.120]  more a like if they actually I was
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:27.420]  thinking like connect how much connect
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:29.620]  cost I don't know though I could be I
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:31.520]  could see it being more a lot more I
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:33.020]  could see their goal being making it a
[03:04:33.020 --> 03:04:34.920]  lot more consumer friendly you know
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:37.620]  three four hundred dollars but I don't
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:39.720]  know and it's certainly to me and I know
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:41.820]  Apple only revealed the starting price
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:46.120]  of Apple watch but without releasing any
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:48.820]  suggestion of the price and I know I
[03:04:48.820 --> 03:04:50.220]  know part of it is that they don't know
[03:04:50.220 --> 03:04:54.020]  because it's so far off but it it opens
[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:55.520]  themselves up to disappointment if you
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:58.020]  don't set any expectations at all it's
[03:04:58.020 --> 03:05:01.020]  very possible if it's above $500 that
[03:05:01.020 --> 03:05:05.420]  people are going to be outraged yeah
[03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:07.520]  that's true right yeah well you wonder
[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:10.520]  I wonder if um if Apple you know once
[03:05:10.520 --> 03:05:12.020]  Apple watch is really expensive and if
[03:05:12.020 --> 03:05:14.020]  it is successful if that will kind of
[03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:17.320]  reset people's expectations like it
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:19.220]  there's so much there's such a focus on
[03:05:19.220 --> 03:05:21.420]  being cheap in the tech press in
[03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:24.520]  particular and I think it's I think it's
[03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:28.820]  misplaced I I think that especially as
[03:05:28.820 --> 03:05:31.120]  you get the more and more consumers that
[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:34.520]  uh aren't that just want stuff to work
[03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:36.820]  like there's a lot of people that are
[03:05:36.820 --> 03:05:39.720]  willing to pay for for not having a
[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:42.820]  hassle and the reality is I think a lot
[03:05:42.820 --> 03:05:44.820]  of those people who don't want to have a
[03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:46.820]  hassle have actually never really bought
[03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:48.120]  technology products because they've only
[03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:49.320]  viewed technology products as being a
[03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:51.920]  hassle but now you have this but now
[03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:53.620]  they are buying the right smartphones
[03:05:53.620 --> 03:05:57.720]  anyway at a minimum and I I think in
[03:05:57.720 --> 03:06:00.220]  this market of people who a have money
[03:06:00.220 --> 03:06:02.920]  and B are not technical Apple is
[03:06:02.920 --> 03:06:05.320]  particularly well placed and and it'll
[03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:07.220]  be interesting to see if if that ends up
[03:06:07.220 --> 03:06:10.520]  being the case not just for Apple but
[03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:12.120]  for other companies as well well you
[03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:15.320]  know I I just think it's it's telling
[03:06:15.320 --> 03:06:16.920]  that they gave away just the starting
[03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:19.920]  price you know and okay maybe I'm sure
[03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:21.520]  in fact I guarantee it I don't care
[03:06:21.520 --> 03:06:23.720]  whether you pay attention to you know
[03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:26.520]  like people like me and you who've tried
[03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:28.320]  to set the expectation that hey the gold
[03:06:28.320 --> 03:06:29.920]  one the addition is probably gonna be
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:34.020]  several thousand dollars at least even
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:35.520]  it's gonna be so fun even if you've been
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:37.220]  paying attention there's a lot of people
[03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:39.320]  who I know who do not believe us and
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:42.020]  therefore if we're correct are going to
[03:06:42.020 --> 03:06:43.920]  be disappointed if they were hoping to
[03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:46.520]  buy the gold one and without question
[03:06:46.520 --> 03:06:50.220]  there are millions of people who've
[03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:53.520]  never heard of us and have never read
[03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:56.120]  any sort of informed commentary on Apple
[03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:57.720]  but who are aware of the Apple watch and
[03:06:57.720 --> 03:07:00.120]  who think well I like gold I love my
[03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.920]  gold iPhone I'll get the gold watch and
[03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:04.120]  they're gonna be shocked as shit when
[03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:06.920]  they see the price but at the very least
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.720]  no matter how bad their reaction is on
[03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:10.520]  that there still is an Apple watch that
[03:07:10.520 --> 03:07:12.520]  they can't afford because it's at the
[03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:14.120]  349 price that Apple had already
[03:07:14.120 --> 03:07:20.820]  mentioned yeah I remain very excited and
[03:07:20.820 --> 03:07:24.520]  intrigued you know by the watch and how
[03:07:24.520 --> 03:07:27.920]  it goes down and yeah well it's funny
[03:07:27.920 --> 03:07:29.120]  like what are the reviews gonna be like
[03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:30.620]  like what's gonna be like to use it like
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:31.920]  what what are the sales like there's
[03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:34.720]  just new categories are always fun if
[03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:36.420]  it's March if it is March that'll be
[03:07:36.420 --> 03:07:38.120]  there'd be right around six months and
[03:07:38.120 --> 03:07:40.020]  that would be the second one second
[03:07:40.020 --> 03:07:41.720]  major product that Apple's unveiled with
[03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:44.920]  about six months of headway you know the
[03:07:44.920 --> 03:07:47.620]  iPhone being the first back in 2007 so
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:49.120]  if we're right if you and I are right
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:53.020]  about hololens being like over a year
[03:07:53.020 --> 03:07:54.820]  away from coming to market it'll be
[03:07:54.820 --> 03:07:57.220]  interesting to see how that plays out
[03:07:57.220 --> 03:07:59.820]  you know yeah how much how much does
[03:07:59.820 --> 03:08:01.920]  does do other similar products come out
[03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:04.620]  in the meantime do people lose interest
[03:08:04.620 --> 03:08:07.220]  do people get angry when Christmas rolls
[03:08:07.220 --> 03:08:08.320]  around and they still can't buy one
[03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:10.020]  because everybody assumes because they
[03:08:10.020 --> 03:08:11.020]  announced it they're gonna be able to
[03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:14.320]  get one this year what so I don't think
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:16.020]  anyone expects it this year which is
[03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:18.020]  whoa I don't know about that I think I
[03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:20.120]  don't think anybody informed expects it
[03:08:20.120 --> 03:08:22.920]  I think that if you went out and pulled
[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:25.820]  a thousand people who play Xbox games
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:28.220]  you know do you think that when do you
[03:08:28.220 --> 03:08:29.520]  think HoloLens is coming out I'll bet
[03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:31.020]  you'll get a lot of people who said this
[03:08:31.020 --> 03:08:32.920]  year because why else would they
[03:08:32.920 --> 03:08:34.220]  announce it I think I don't think people
[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:35.720]  think it through I think casual people
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:37.020]  just think well they announced it it
[03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:40.020]  must be coming out later this year maybe
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:41.820]  I mean although the Xbox gamers probably
[03:08:41.820 --> 03:08:43.820]  I mean project Natal which I think was
[03:08:43.820 --> 03:08:46.420]  uh the Kinect I mean that that was
[03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:50.120]  demoed a long time before Kinect came out
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:51.520]  yeah people have short memories though
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:55.220]  that's true they're not very forgiving
[03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:57.420]  anyway we can call it a show let's call
[03:08:57.420 --> 03:09:00.320]  it a show Ben Thompson we just got

[03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:44.920]  good show you missed the obvious joke
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:46.620]  though that um my pronunciation is so
[03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:48.620]  bad that I couldn't even decide on the
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:50.420]  presentation my own site yeah well we
[03:09:50.420 --> 03:09:53.720]  always mention that it looks good
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:55.120]  especially when you see the tech in
[03:09:55.120 --> 03:09:59.020]  orange yeah I deserve it yeah we spent
[03:09:59.020 --> 03:10:00.220]  the whole show we didn't talk about my
[03:10:00.220 --> 03:10:01.820]  switch to all caps headlines on my
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:03.620]  link list items that's right that's
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:06.220]  right uh came out as a vocal proponent
[03:10:06.220 --> 03:10:08.820]  of even though well I'm a proponent of
[03:10:08.820 --> 03:10:10.820]  it because uh it's it's similar to my
[03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:13.220]  site like my my non-main articles well
[03:10:13.220 --> 03:10:15.420]  actually all my articles are but um I
[03:10:15.420 --> 03:10:19.420]  don't know I I I for me reading during
[03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:21.820]  fireball I think I I'm not sure I'm a
[03:10:21.820 --> 03:10:24.220]  fan I have to be totally honest yeah
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:26.220]  well we'll see we have to give it yeah
[03:10:26.220 --> 03:10:28.220]  we got to give it a couple weeks to see
[03:10:28.220 --> 03:10:31.720]  let her breathe right uh all right I'm
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:11:01.220]  hit and stop
