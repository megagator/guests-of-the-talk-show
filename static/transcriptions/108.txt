[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  What time you got?
[00:00.840 --> 00:01.660]  What do you got?
[00:01.660 --> 00:02.500]  What do you got?
[00:02.500 --> 00:03.500]  11 o'clock?
[00:03.500 --> 00:04.500]  12 21 a.m.
[00:04.500 --> 00:05.340]  Oh my god.
[00:05.340 --> 00:06.340]  Are you serious?
[00:06.340 --> 00:07.340]  Is this going to be all right?
[00:07.340 --> 00:08.340]  Yeah.
[00:08.340 --> 00:09.340]  No, I have down to science.
[00:09.340 --> 00:14.200]  I took a shower, then I weighed down for a 20 minute nap, and then I drank up coffee,
[00:14.200 --> 00:17.680]  and then I will calm myself down with a couple beers during the conversation.
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.080]  Sounds good.
[00:19.080 --> 00:24.760]  Oh, no, I'm good, don't worry about it.
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.760]  Okay.
[00:25.760 --> 00:35.560]  So we had a nice home Korean barbecue over at the in-laws place, of course, and my mother
[00:35.560 --> 00:40.640]  was a huge whiskey fan, so she always has really good stuff, but I women and myself
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.760]  to a single serving, so you owe me one.
[00:47.760 --> 00:48.760]  I do.
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.920]  That's just deep price to pay to be a guest on the show.
[00:51.920 --> 00:55.920]  I forgot I have you set up, I have Taipei set up in my, uh, today view.
[00:55.920 --> 00:57.520]  I could, I didn't need to ask you what time it was.
[00:57.520 --> 01:00.560]  I could have just, uh, opened today.
[01:00.560 --> 01:01.560]  My world clock.
[01:01.560 --> 01:05.520]  Well, I guess that, that says enough about today.
[01:05.520 --> 01:10.280]  You know what, I, I think the problem is that I usually, I really only open that thing
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.080]  up for, it's, it's kind of weird to have that be today and notifications.
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.520]  Like I understand why they grouped it together that way, but I think in practice, it's weird
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.640]  because it's one or the other is always two steps away instead of one step away.
[01:23.640 --> 01:24.640]  Yeah.
[01:24.640 --> 01:25.640]  Yeah.
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.640]  I agree.
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.640]  I don't know.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.640]  I never click on today either.
[01:28.640 --> 01:31.840]  I'm, I'm looking at, like it actually took me a couple of seconds to remember what you
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.480]  were talking about when he said today, um, it's, I use it for notifications only.
[01:37.480 --> 01:38.480]  And I don't know that.
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.600]  I guess that's kind of true on both of us is, although I was talking about the Mac,
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.520]  not, not iOS, but, uh, it's kind of true on both of us is where I've always got it
[01:46.520 --> 01:50.040]  on notifications, not, uh, today.
[01:50.040 --> 01:51.040]  Yeah.
[01:51.040 --> 01:57.000]  No, it's, it's interesting because, um, I don't know, you, you could almost see that
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.920]  as being, being a shift, right?
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.200]  Like, I mean, almost with everything is, is more, almost responsive in real time.
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.520]  Whereas today, that's like, that's like a plan and, I don't know, maybe it's, we're
[02:08.520 --> 02:13.720]  hardly authorities to talk about, uh, having a set schedule and, uh, marching through
[02:13.720 --> 02:14.720]  the day.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.040]  So we're, we're probably outliers.
[02:16.040 --> 02:19.280]  Yeah, I've seen some people who wanted who've requested they wish that there was a way
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.840]  to make, at least on the Mac, I think only on the Mac would make sense on iOS, but on
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.440]  the Mac that they could make that persistent and like, just say, like, take those two
[02:28.440 --> 02:31.800]  inches on the right side of my screen and just always make it today.
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.480]  And, you know, I've got a big 30 inch iMac here or something, you know, big, uh, Thunderbolt
[02:36.480 --> 02:37.480]  display.
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.680]  I don't need the whole screen for this.
[02:38.680 --> 02:42.440]  Just treat my screen as what's left and give me that today view over there.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.640]  So I've got like a permanent agenda.
[02:44.640 --> 02:45.640]  Oh, totally.
[02:45.640 --> 02:50.200]  I, I, I did something similar to that when, um, like when, when I was at Microsoft and
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.680]  Windows 8 and you can mix like the regular desktop and then like, uh, Windows 8 apps and
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.360]  like a, in like a sliver on the side of the screen.
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.640]  And so I put my calendar there, um, for that exact reason, uh, it was, it, it, it worked
[03:03.640 --> 03:04.640]  out perfectly.
[03:04.640 --> 03:08.560]  And then I just had a quick view was going on, um, people have done that, people have done
[03:08.560 --> 03:14.040]  that virtually or, or in a mismatch of digital and analog for as long as they've been using
[03:14.040 --> 03:18.440]  computers in their office, if you think about like sticky notes on the side of a, of a
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.440]  monitor.
[03:19.440 --> 03:20.640]  Oh, no, totally.
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.640]  Totally.
[03:21.640 --> 03:25.760]  And I think that's, that's something that's, uh, like, what was the, were you talking linked
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.760]  to this?
[03:26.760 --> 03:29.360]  Like there's like that new accessory, like an iPad where you can actually like have it
[03:29.360 --> 03:32.560]  as a secondary display or whatever.
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.640]  Um, to me, though, the, the compile case, if you have an iPad, your desk is just, yeah,
[03:36.640 --> 03:39.920]  just have, have, have it there for your calendar and stuff like that.
[03:39.920 --> 03:42.440]  I mean, it's, yeah, I didn't link to that.
[03:42.440 --> 03:45.520]  I know it's when I forget the name of the thing you're talking about, but I know exactly
[03:45.520 --> 03:46.520]  what you're talking about.
[03:46.520 --> 03:49.480]  And I've been looking at, I've been thinking about trying that out, but I, I, I wouldn't
[03:49.480 --> 03:50.480]  use it again.
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.760]  I would not use it as a, like a, I wouldn't put an app over there, any app, but I could,
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.480]  I would think about using it exactly like you said, like as a sort of, uh, like a pay
[04:01.480 --> 04:02.480]  sport.
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.480]  I don't know.
[04:03.480 --> 04:04.480]  Like a bulletin board.
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.480]  Yeah.
[04:05.480 --> 04:07.760]  I, I, I, I, I, I'm a screen maven.
[04:07.760 --> 04:10.520]  So I have, I mean, I have, I have three screens on my desk.
[04:10.520 --> 04:13.840]  So, um, I don't know if I did, even if room for an iPad.
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.840]  Yeah.
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.840]  What's the name of that thing?
[04:15.840 --> 04:18.240]  Is it reflector or is that a different thing?
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.280]  No, I think, I, I want to say sort of an L, but I, I might be totally making that up.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.680]  Um, but the idea is, I think it was built by a former Apple guy or something.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.800]  So it, like, and apparently it, it actually, it actually works quite well.
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.600]  See, air display.
[04:34.600 --> 04:35.600]  Do that?
[04:35.600 --> 04:36.600]  No.
[04:36.600 --> 04:37.600]  Do what?
[04:37.600 --> 04:38.600]  I think that's it.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.600]  Do that display.
[04:39.600 --> 04:40.600]  Yeah.
[04:40.600 --> 04:41.600]  There we go.
[04:41.600 --> 04:43.520]  I will put it in the show notes.
[04:43.520 --> 04:45.720]  We'll look at it for next week.
[04:45.720 --> 04:46.720]  Yeah.
[04:46.720 --> 04:47.720]  Yeah.
[04:47.720 --> 04:48.720]  First first, yeah.
[04:48.720 --> 04:49.720]  First school response.
[04:49.720 --> 04:50.720]  Do it display.
[04:50.720 --> 04:51.720]  X Apple engineer's turn your iPad into an extra screen.
[04:51.720 --> 04:56.080]  So they, they, and that, that's their, that's actually their, their page title for
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.080]  Google.
[04:57.080 --> 05:01.040]  So they're definitely playing up the, uh, the X Apple engineer angle.
[05:01.040 --> 05:04.080]  So it effectively, because that's, that's what I remembered.
[05:04.080 --> 05:05.080]  That's interesting.
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.560]  I wonder, I wonder how that plays at the company because the other thing,
[05:09.560 --> 05:18.080]  too, is that part of the reason that very few former Apple engineers or, you
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.680]  know, people, any, you know, who've had any kind of involvement managers, too.
[05:22.680 --> 05:26.680]  They don't talk about their experience at Apple, even when they leave is because so many
[05:26.680 --> 05:27.680]  of them go back.
[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  And they know.
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.680]  Yeah.
[05:29.680 --> 05:30.680]  It's like a revolving door.
[05:30.680 --> 05:31.680]  Right.
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.960]  It's like, uh, Steve, Joe, one of the things Steve Jobs did when, when, when he came
[05:35.960 --> 05:40.440]  back to the company is get rid of the, uh, sabbatical program.
[05:40.440 --> 05:44.000]  They used to be, I forget how many years, but I gave me five years, you got like a couple
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.800]  months sabbatical, uh, and he got rid of that because he, you know, it, I forget the various
[05:50.800 --> 05:54.360]  reasons, but one of them was that an awful lot of the time people would take a sabbatical
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.440]  and then at the end of the sabbatical, they'd quit.
[05:56.440 --> 06:02.280]  Um, but there's sort of a de facto sabbatical where if you feel burned out, you just quit,
[06:02.280 --> 06:06.600]  you can leave and, you know, as long as you're on good terms, it's like the easiest way
[06:06.600 --> 06:10.440]  to get a job at Apple is to have been a successful Apple employee before.
[06:10.440 --> 06:14.520]  I can't tell you how many people I know who've left and come back within.
[06:14.520 --> 06:15.520]  Sometimes a year.
[06:15.520 --> 06:16.520]  Sometimes it's actually pretty quick.
[06:16.520 --> 06:18.520]  Sometimes three, four years, but they do.
[06:18.520 --> 06:24.320]  But one of the things you could do that would ruin that would be to, you know, uh, you
[06:24.320 --> 06:26.360]  know, blab about the company in the intern.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.360]  Yep.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.360]  No, totally.
[06:28.360 --> 06:32.000]  No, it's, it's a very like, at this point, it's, I mean, everyone kind of knows about it.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.560]  I think, um, even Apple internally, like they, they, it's, it's, it's like it's totally
[06:38.560 --> 06:42.880]  accepted and, and kind of the assumption, yeah, you could burn out, uh, yeah, only, only
[06:42.880 --> 06:48.040]  at Apple, do you get burned out and go work at a startup to relax and then you come back.
[06:48.040 --> 06:49.040]  Right.
[06:49.040 --> 06:55.480]  It gives you an idea of what the, uh, what the, what the pace and, uh, expectations are.
[06:55.480 --> 06:56.480]  Yeah.
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.200]  But it is, you know, it's, it's, it's, I think it's, you know, it's an interesting way to
[06:59.200 --> 07:00.200]  do sabbatical.
[07:00.200 --> 07:02.200]  Quit.
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.200]  Come back.
[07:03.200 --> 07:04.200]  Yeah.
[07:04.200 --> 07:06.200]  I mean, it works for them.
[07:06.200 --> 07:10.200]  I'm not sure that it's something that other companies want to adopt as, as, as a policy.
[07:10.200 --> 07:11.200]  Yeah.
[07:11.200 --> 07:14.200]  Did Microsoft have a sabbatical policy?
[07:14.200 --> 07:15.200]  Uh, I don't think so.
[07:15.200 --> 07:18.200]  Um, at least not that, not that I remember.
[07:18.200 --> 07:22.200]  Um, I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't really there long enough to, to have it matter for me.
[07:22.200 --> 07:27.200]  Um, but I, I've heard of people taking sabbaticals, but I don't think it was like a formal thing.
[07:27.200 --> 07:30.160]  I think it was those things where if you're, you know, if you're in good standing and,
[07:30.160 --> 07:35.160]  the other, I think what Microsoft is, um, in part because of, of where they're located,
[07:35.160 --> 07:40.160]  I mean, there, there are more and more, you know, tech jobs in, in Seattle and, and startups
[07:40.160 --> 07:41.160]  and stuff.
[07:41.160 --> 07:45.400]  But in general, it's more of a big company town with Microsoft and Amazon and no one from
[07:45.400 --> 07:49.640]  Microsoft wants to work at Amazon for the most part, um, because, you know, everyone thinks
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.640]  that, you know, they, they, they work in say, an hours and no campaign or anything.
[07:53.640 --> 07:58.920]  Um, so it's kind of a plus in Microsoft, it's a plus in that, like, there's still a lot
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.200]  of really good employees there.
[08:00.200 --> 08:04.280]  Whereas if they had been in the valley, like, you take him to like HP or, or Yahoo, especially
[08:04.280 --> 08:09.200]  before, or American back, and they just lost, they lost so many people, you know, in, they're,
[08:09.200 --> 08:11.320]  just like, how do you come back from that?
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.960]  Um, whereas Microsoft, I think, uh, one of the advantage of being there is that they,
[08:14.960 --> 08:17.360]  they, they're still a lot of like really strong people there.
[08:17.360 --> 08:21.120]  Um, it's a disadvantage though, because you get people that are just kind of there and they're
[08:21.120 --> 08:26.200]  not particularly pleased with being there and they're kind of a drag, um, so it cuts both ways.
[08:26.200 --> 08:32.760]  Um, I think, I do recall people, you know, taking some time off and, you know, it being
[08:32.760 --> 08:38.440]  okay because they're valuable employees and, you know, people appreciate that sometimes
[08:38.440 --> 08:41.040]  you need to unplug for a bit.
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.600]  It used to be, I mean, this is ancient history, but it was, you know, when I wasn't getting
[08:45.600 --> 08:54.640]  out of college in 96, I mean, Microsoft was, I don't know, notorious, infamous, famous for
[08:54.640 --> 08:57.880]  being like the hardest place in the world to get hired.
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.560]  It was, you know, that there was the play, I think they practically invented the sort
[09:01.560 --> 09:07.200]  of gimmicky, you know, you know, off the top of your head, how many marbles would fit
[09:07.200 --> 09:11.520]  in a, you know, beer barrel or a Volkswagen bug, right?
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.120]  Of interview question, uh, why, why is a manhole cover around?
[09:17.120 --> 09:23.320]  And, and, and also, but tough like whiteboarding questions too for programmers.
[09:23.320 --> 09:30.840]  Yeah, I think that, that, that's probably, I mean, any, any company that's on top tends,
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.680]  I mean, it shifted to Google, right?
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.800]  And it's, uh, you know, some people have the nature or they want to like get on the next
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.440]  big thing, but for a lot of people, the idea of being at the market leader and knowing,
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.520]  you know, that, that's, that's attractive a lot of people.
[09:44.520 --> 09:48.040]  And those people are valuable too because you need, those are the kind of folks that kind
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.040]  of provide long-term stability because, you know, once, once they're set, they're set.
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.280]  I mean, you, you do need the people that really take risks and push forward, but, um, it,
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.240]  it's always a balance and it can create a certain arrogance, though, like an institutional arrogance,
[10:01.240 --> 10:06.360]  because the gist of it is then it creates this, it created a culture, I think, where the assumption
[10:06.360 --> 10:12.200]  was any, you have to be really smart to work at Microsoft and, and therefore everybody here is
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.200]  like the smartest people in the world. And at the time, Microsoft had this extraordinary success
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.000]  that seemed to back up the idea that the company was staffed with all of the best programmers
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.160]  in the world. Absolutely. No, it's definitely a problem. And, and you get, it's a problem on a
[10:29.160 --> 10:37.160]  few levels. One, you definitely get arrogance or arrogant. Um, two, it also kind of breeds, uh,
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.640]  a little bit of a, a bad culture in that everyone, everyone is all, it's like the first time a
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.000]  lot of these people have gotten to a place where they're not for sure the smartest person in the
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.800]  room. And so everyone's very eager to show that they are the smartest person in the room.
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.200]  And like people trying to show that they're smart is not conducive to, you know, a collaborative,
[10:55.640 --> 11:01.880]  collaborative work or, you know, it is conducive to having a very doggy dog sort of culture,
[11:01.880 --> 11:09.080]  which Microsoft is very famous for. Um, and, and I think that's, that's probably plays into it.
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.680]  Yeah. And I think Google is the inheritor of that. I do think Google, I mean, Google is
[11:14.680 --> 11:20.520]  so much like Microsoft. I mean, just in so many respects, I mean, I've written from just from a
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.920]  big picture, like strategic perspective, I think that they're, they're right now in a place
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.000]  similar to Microsoft, you know, around around 2000. Obviously, that's somewhat controversial,
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.640]  but not even that, but just the way they hire the way they, the way they treat employees,
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.800]  their status and the valley, the way people look at them. I mean, for sure, they're, they're
[11:37.800 --> 11:43.400]  the inheritor. Even, even, and I think you can agree with that, even if you like Google and hate
[11:43.400 --> 11:48.040]  Microsoft or vice versa. Right. And it's, it's just a function of being kind of the big dog.
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.120]  And like, of course, Apple is, is the biggest quote unquote from market perspective,
[11:52.120 --> 11:57.000]  but they've always, Apple's always been very, it's Apple's of the valley, but they're separate
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.280]  from the valley. Like all the startups and all the people like all work towards Google and people,
[12:02.280 --> 12:06.520]  bottoms after that, just as they previously did Microsoft, and Apple's always been kind of a bit of
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.400]  an aberration, um, from a culture perspective, from the product development perspective,
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.920]  and obviously, you know, there's something to that. I think it's also, and from a personality
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.160]  perspective, I think that the, that the, I mean, and I know, I think I've talked about this before
[12:21.160 --> 12:28.760]  in the show. I know people who have gone between Google and Apple, but not very few, fewer than any
[12:28.760 --> 12:34.600]  similar companies that I know of, like they just, the two companies tend to draw very, very different
[12:34.600 --> 12:40.520]  personalities. No, for sure. And I think you can see this from a social perspective, um, you know,
[12:40.520 --> 12:47.240]  I think Apple people tend to hang out with Apple people, whereas Google and, and kind of this whole
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.160]  startup culture is much more, um, much more of a group and goes back and forth. And you see a
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.680]  tons of, you know, people from Google going into going into startups and coming back and stuff
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.320]  like that. And you do see it at Apple, but I think to a much lower degree, I think you, you have more
[13:03.320 --> 13:11.240]  long term employees at Apple. Um, I mean, it's hard to say, I mean, we're, we're, we're probably both
[13:11.240 --> 13:16.120]  definitely have always felt that, you know, the value company is Google. Yeah. Even though Apple's
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.920]  the biggest just Apple is kind of it's in its own world and kind of always has been. Yeah. I also
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.600]  the personality wise, I think a lot of the people who I've gotten to know at Apple, who are very
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.600]  smart though, but they're not the type of smart person who wants to assert that they're the smartest
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.400]  person in the world or in the room that they're and they'd be happy not to be because they think
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.280]  cool. Now I've got these other smarter people and almost like to if you want to bring some
[13:40.280 --> 13:46.280]  uh, sports ball into it, it's, you know, what do you do if you've always been the star basketball
[13:46.280 --> 13:52.680]  player? But now you're only the third or fourth best. Are you happy? Because holy, holy shit,
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.400]  now I've got three guys on the team who are even better than me and I'll settle into a smaller
[13:57.400 --> 14:03.720]  role and we're going to win. Or are you, you know, are you upset and going to complain about
[14:03.720 --> 14:10.600]  how many shots you're getting and stuff like that? No, totally. And I mean, I think of, I'm very
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.560]  vociferous in my, uh, you know, I love the NBA. I love basketball. And one of the reasons I love
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.080]  it is because I think it's, it's a sport that it's one of the hardest sports to kind of figure out
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.320]  right. I mean, I think we might have talked this last time, you know, like baseball is at the end
[14:25.320 --> 14:31.000]  kind of a one on one game. Whereas basketball, the interaction, both on offense and especially on
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.920]  defense is, is so important to it. And it's, and it's not, it's not, you can't distill it to a
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.920]  spreadsheet. It's just one of those, there's a lot of feel to it. If that makes sense. Right. And
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.080]  with only five players on the court at any time, one new player is a significant difference.
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.240]  I mean, I think maybe the canonical example would be when, um, when King James went to the heat
[14:53.240 --> 15:01.160]  and they already had a lineup of all star players and they added, um, you know, almost in
[15:01.160 --> 15:06.200]  arguably the best player in the league, that's not necessarily, that wasn't necessarily going to work
[15:06.200 --> 15:12.840]  out. There wasn't, you know, it was certainly a talent injection, but it, it isn't necessarily,
[15:13.560 --> 15:18.120]  it wasn't, it wasn't fate that it was going to lead to success. Right. It was a fascinating
[15:18.120 --> 15:24.600]  thing. He's received a replay out, right. And then it's arguably going, going worse than it did that
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.360]  time. Um, so no, it was with the Cavaliers. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. So the other thing that's interesting
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.040]  about Apple that I've always found very fascinating is, um, if you look at kind of the executive board
[15:36.040 --> 15:42.040]  of most big companies, it's like Stanford Stanford, MIT, Stanford, Stanford. Um, but that's
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.320]  never been the case for, for Apple. I mean, you look at it right now. I mean, you have, um, you know,
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.880]  Tim Cook went to Auburn, uh, and Angela Aaron's went to, went to ball state, uh, Eddie Q went to,
[15:53.880 --> 15:58.520]  uh, Eddie, he went to Duke, which obviously, um, you know, that, that's a pretty just school, but
[15:58.520 --> 16:01.960]  yeah, but it's not a valley school, right? It's not, it's not a valley school. Um,
[16:01.960 --> 16:08.280]  Shiller was a Boston college, right? Yeah. I think so. Um, and at least it, well, if he's not,
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.400]  he's, for whatever reason, he's a huge fan of their sports. Yeah. I, I think he is, um, I just,
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.480]  I just opened a couple of them here, um, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Dan
[16:17.480 --> 16:26.360]  Riccio, uh, Phil Schiller is Boston college. Yeah. Um, and I, I think that's, uh, Jeff Williams,
[16:26.360 --> 16:32.200]  North Carolina state. I mean, like state schools, right? I mean, good schools, uh, solid schools,
[16:32.200 --> 16:39.160]  um, but not very different than the, than, than a lot of the valley. And I think, I think it's
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.440]  a big deal. I think it matters. And, um, I'm biased in this regard. I went to a state school. Uh,
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.840]  I mean, uh, it was no Drexel University, but, um, Drexel is like Drexel is like the public school
[16:50.840 --> 16:57.400]  for people who were otherwise going to end up in a state school. Um, but, uh, yeah, I think,
[16:58.200 --> 17:04.360]  it's, I don't know. I, I, I, I'm not objective in the slightest in this because when I was, um,
[17:04.360 --> 17:12.200]  when I was getting my MBA, uh, the, I had a very hard time getting a job. And because I had this
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.920]  very kind of non-traditional background, I had been living abroad. I'd teaching English, um,
[17:16.920 --> 17:22.360]  traveling the world, stuff like that. And lots of companies were like, people telling me,
[17:22.360 --> 17:25.960]  oh, it's very interesting, but I would never make the comfort interview. If I got a first interview,
[17:25.960 --> 17:29.800]  it would never make it to a second one, even if I thought the interview went very well. Um,
[17:29.800 --> 17:35.880]  and kind of the one exception was, was Apple, uh, where everything went fantastically,
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.960]  got in, you know, relatively, you know, quite easily. And, and the interview told me right
[17:41.960 --> 17:45.240]  about, or, and I was fortunate because the, like the interview was sick, so I interviewed with the
[17:45.240 --> 17:49.960]  high-end director, like my first interview, so that probably accelerated things. But she's like, um,
[17:51.400 --> 17:56.920]  like, I wanted to hire you to say a resume because it was so off the wall. Like that's,
[17:56.920 --> 18:01.160]  that's the sort of person that we're looking for. And you go there and you meet lots of people and
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.400]  I believe it because most of the people I met, yeah, there were some Stanford people and there were
[18:05.400 --> 18:11.800]  some, you know, MIT people and stuff like that. But, uh, a lot of people had really weird backgrounds
[18:11.800 --> 18:17.720]  and did lots of strange stuff. And they were super smart, but they were the weird, weird people smart.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.960]  And I think that's, I don't think that's an accident. Yeah. Uh, I know a lot of engineers at Apple,
[18:23.960 --> 18:27.240]  or at least a couple, I shouldn't say a lot. I know a couple at least who don't have any degree at
[18:27.240 --> 18:34.440]  all. Um, and I would say I know a lot who have degrees and things other than computer science,
[18:34.440 --> 18:40.520]  you know, physics, a lot of physics. I mean, I, I don't know how many, both indie and people at Apple,
[18:42.520 --> 18:45.960]  you know, people who went to school for physics and were programming on the side,
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.840]  and then just got sucked into it. And it just was irrelevant to their job prospects at Apple that
[18:50.840 --> 18:56.200]  they didn't have a computer science degree or, you know, whatever school. Wasn't there
[18:56.200 --> 19:04.680]  a thing in Nick Carlson just new book on, on Marissa Meyer where she was, uh, I forget who she was
[19:04.680 --> 19:10.200]  dismissive of because she didn't have a college degree. I don't remember. I haven't read
[19:10.200 --> 19:14.840]  it yet. I've read the excerpt. There was something though where she was, you know, she's sort of
[19:14.840 --> 19:21.320]  just turned her nose up at somebody else just because the person had didn't have a college degree.
[19:21.320 --> 19:29.080]  I mean, for, by all, you know, Google is, is kind of notorious for having a very strong bias towards,
[19:29.080 --> 19:34.200]  um, you know, towards your degree in your GPA, in particular, if you're from Stanford. And I think
[19:34.200 --> 19:39.240]  a lot of the, a lot of the valley is. And it's one of those things where I think the problem with it
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.640]  is, is it raises the floor for who you hire, like you're going to get someone that's smart and
[19:43.640 --> 19:48.680]  capable. But anytime you raise the floor, you're also lowering the ceiling because you're kind of
[19:48.680 --> 19:54.520]  constraining, uh, constraining your options. And if someone fits in a box, like you're not going to
[19:54.520 --> 20:00.440]  get out of the box thinking. I mean, it's, it's, and I think Apple, at least in my personal experience
[20:00.440 --> 20:04.360]  and from people that I saw there and for I talked to and this is something that we did talk about
[20:04.360 --> 20:11.560]  in a university like the way Apple thinks about hiring, um, putting much more value on non school
[20:11.560 --> 20:17.800]  stuff and, and, and if they're smart and if they're kind of weird and they've done interesting
[20:17.800 --> 20:23.480]  things, then that's someone that we're interested in. Um, and if they spent their whole day going,
[20:23.480 --> 20:30.680]  going to schools and having a high GPA, it might be useful, but, um, it's almost more of a,
[20:30.680 --> 20:36.680]  more of a challenge in some respects. Yeah. Um, the other thing too, and you like that whole,
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.240]  like asserting who's the smartest person in a room, like I've heard this from other people too,
[20:41.240 --> 20:45.800]  but this is like even personal experience, like way back when probably close to 10 years ago,
[20:45.800 --> 20:52.120]  like about like eight years ago, when I was a joint, we had a meeting with Apple. Um, just, uh,
[20:52.120 --> 20:55.160]  hey, we, you know, we're interested in what you guys are working on. This is when
[20:55.160 --> 21:03.000]  joint was not a hosting company when we were doing like a web-based, uh, email calendar,
[21:03.000 --> 21:10.600]  contacts, notes, syncing type thing. Um, and it was a, you know, it was a pleasant meeting.
[21:10.600 --> 21:15.480]  It was, you know, maybe like 30, 40 minutes, uh, but it was like the opposite of anybody
[21:15.480 --> 21:19.880]  trying to assert who is the smartest. All they wanted to do was listen. That's it. They had,
[21:19.880 --> 21:24.840]  they had questioned, but there was absolutely no, it was the opposite. It was almost like creepy
[21:24.840 --> 21:30.840]  how much they were just observing and listening to us and revealing nothing about themselves.
[21:31.960 --> 21:36.680]  Yeah. Well, if you want, I mean, if you want to get into like, uh, wait, read way too much into this,
[21:36.680 --> 21:40.760]  like we probably already are, but if you want to, if you want to take it full speed ahead, um,
[21:40.760 --> 21:44.280]  one of the best things about being an intern at Apple is they have this, like this intern lecture
[21:44.280 --> 21:49.800]  series where basically the executive team at different members of this executive team for lunch,
[21:49.800 --> 21:53.960]  they come in for an hour and they, and they talk some, some, some just talk the whole time, some
[21:53.960 --> 21:58.040]  give presentations. Others just do Q and A. So it was, I mean, so you got an hour Steve Jobs,
[21:58.040 --> 22:04.600]  an hour Tim Cook, an hour with Phil Schiller, like Ron, uh, with Ron Johnson, like it was an
[22:04.600 --> 22:10.680]  incredible experience, like worth the internship alone. Um, but, uh, there was one that was
[22:10.680 --> 22:18.680]  really interesting because this person came in and he was obviously the smartest person in the
[22:18.680 --> 22:24.360]  room. And he was also determined to make sure that everyone knew who's the smartest person in the
[22:24.360 --> 22:30.760]  room. It is the person is the person no longer at the company. I'll give you one guest as to who
[22:30.760 --> 22:35.480]  this person was. I'm guessing it was Scott Forstahl. It was, it was like, I, I walked out of the
[22:35.480 --> 22:39.320]  meeting and I told him, and I told a friend of mine and we, we, we talked to this right after he
[22:39.320 --> 22:45.160]  left Apple, like we, because we talked about right afterwards, like it was so, it was jarring. Um,
[22:45.160 --> 22:52.040]  I mean, he was so clearly brilliant. Um, but it, like his, it was just such a turnoff to listen to him
[22:52.040 --> 22:58.200]  talk, um, especially relative to, to some of the other executives and, um, and if you were
[22:58.200 --> 23:01.000]  trying to get, you know, we're going to really piss off all the Stanford listeners, but yeah,
[23:01.000 --> 23:08.200]  there's your Stanford guy. Um, and, uh, and, um, I don't know, like I wasn't, it was one of those
[23:08.200 --> 23:15.320]  things where when he left, I was shocked, but I was not surprised, uh, because of that, that lecture
[23:15.320 --> 23:19.320]  that I heard from him. Well, I mean, there wasn't just that. There was, I mean, I had heard stuff,
[23:19.320 --> 23:24.520]  uh, I knew that it was, I mean, I knew that he was a, a difficult person to, to work with just
[23:24.520 --> 23:30.040]  through the grapevine, but, um, I, I, the truth is, I think Apple misses him to be honest. Uh,
[23:30.040 --> 23:36.040]  but I, I also was not, was not surprised. Yeah. I agree with that. I do too. And I think it's
[23:36.040 --> 23:40.760]  easy. Like I laughed and said, I knew who it was and I didn't know. I instantly guessed it was,
[23:40.760 --> 23:46.760]  it was, it was forced all. But I think he's an extremely complicated figure. And I think explaining
[23:46.760 --> 23:52.920]  his role in Apple's success over the last 15 years is extremely complicated. And there's
[23:52.920 --> 24:00.600]  absolutely no way to paint it in either black or white and say, he is missed. They suck without him
[24:00.600 --> 24:06.360]  or it was, it was an easy no brainer to get rid of them. Good riddance to bad rubbish. It is so,
[24:07.400 --> 24:13.320]  so many different. And I wouldn't even say gray. It's just so many interweaved streaks of black
[24:13.320 --> 24:16.680]  and white. Absolutely. Good. Not that part. Good part. Good part. Good part. Good part. Good part.
[24:16.680 --> 24:23.080]  Good part. Bad part. No, he's, I mean, he is, he's on the top five list of people most responsible
[24:23.080 --> 24:27.880]  for Apple being where it is today. I think part of it was that I think he always had. And I don't,
[24:27.880 --> 24:32.360]  you know, again, I met him once, you know, after a keynote and we had like a half hour discussion.
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.240]  And it was great. And he was, it was just me and him shooting a shit in the hands-on area. And
[24:38.040 --> 24:42.920]  he was, you know, clearly a reader of my site. Very complimentary to my work. And we just talked
[24:42.920 --> 24:49.080]  about some cool stuff. And, you know, it was no showy-offy stuff at all. It was just, you know,
[24:49.080 --> 24:55.960]  but he was very, very brilliant. It was actually around the time of, was it 2010? It might have
[24:55.960 --> 25:07.480]  been like WWDC 2010. iPhone 4. Yeah. iPhone 4. Yes. iPhone 4 and the iPad was like four months old.
[25:07.480 --> 25:14.440]  Yep. And a lot of this stuff where I was going to say kids, but it's actually just about everybody,
[25:14.440 --> 25:22.280]  but especially kids with autism and problems like that were found to be doing sensational stuff,
[25:22.280 --> 25:29.320]  communication wise with iPhones. And now with the big iPad, which really helps with fine motor
[25:29.320 --> 25:35.560]  control because every bigger targets that it was a huge thing, he was so amazingly engaged on that.
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.920]  And this, you know, that is not like a, hey, how to make the company another $10 billion. You know,
[25:41.720 --> 25:48.040]  it's clearly a small segment of the overall market for iPads and iPhones. But he was super,
[25:48.040 --> 25:54.120]  super engaged on it and thought that we had this cool discussion about how the, a lot of the things
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.800]  that they designed not think they'd, you know, all these things fell out of things that they just
[25:57.800 --> 26:04.920]  thought were cool for regular people, but it ends up being, you know, super great for people with
[26:04.920 --> 26:10.440]  autism. But it's, it's this whole, the, you know, his, his conclusion, he said that they were looking
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.480]  into it to try to prove it to, you know, not just do it as a hunch, but that it's just about a leave,
[26:15.480 --> 26:20.680]  you know, eliminating a layer of abstraction. That that whole thing where you move a mouse,
[26:20.680 --> 26:25.800]  which moves an arrow on the screen, and you do it, you know, once you get used to using computers,
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.360]  you know, you just forget about it, but that people with autism can never get past it. That it's
[26:30.360 --> 26:35.800]  this abstraction that just their brains don't make the connection. And when they can put their
[26:35.800 --> 26:43.080]  finger right on that button on screen and tap it, it's, it's not just like a little bit easier,
[26:43.080 --> 26:48.360]  it's the difference between unable to make the connection and completely able to make the connection.
[26:49.320 --> 26:53.800]  And that other people who can use a mouse and don't have any sort of impairment like that,
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.280]  they, you know, they might, they, they don't really think about the fact that the iPads a lot
[26:58.280 --> 27:04.120]  easier or the iPhones a lot easier, but that it ends up that subconsciously without thinking
[27:04.120 --> 27:11.560]  about it, it is. And it actually is why they prefer using it. No, I think it was a great conversation.
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.880]  And, and just, it was just, he just was talking. It was just me and him talking and it was great.
[27:15.880 --> 27:20.280]  And he, I thought he was great. And I asked also, no, also, no, just add the other thing,
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.800]  is that there are a ton of people, ton of people who worked under him at Apple, who loved him,
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.640]  love and love working under him. He was demanding, but that it was, he was absolutely not
[27:33.720 --> 27:39.640]  he was, it is proper. Well, and the other thing too that I heard time and time again was that
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.200]  people who worked under him always had the sense that he had their back. Right. Right. That's
[27:44.200 --> 27:49.560]  why I was getting at it. Yeah. No, totally. The other thing is that I actually think, I'm not sure
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.880]  but I think in that talk, I think he actually did talk a lot. It was the same summer 2010 that I
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.800]  was there. And so maybe it was on his mind, but I think he talked a lot about the accessibility
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.440]  stuff. And I think I'm not sure, but I think I've heard that he was really the driving force
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.640]  for iOS being so advanced when it came to like accessibility, like for the blind and for
[28:07.640 --> 28:13.320]  well, it was certainly was a complete advocate for it, like a total ad for him. He may not have been
[28:13.320 --> 28:19.800]  the sole driving force, but he put his full advocacy behind it. So just in general, I mean, I really
[28:19.800 --> 28:26.120]  think like, and this is where I, I think Apple misses him in two parts. I think one is, is like
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.840]  his ability to, like I do think that iOS was incredibly well given, given what it was was
[28:36.840 --> 28:43.640]  not buggy at all and was really, you know, it was really good. I think there's a discussion we had
[28:43.640 --> 28:52.120]  about some of the quality stuff. But too, I think he had a real passion and push for usability
[28:52.120 --> 28:59.240]  and accessibility, not just for like disabled, but for normal people and like, and so much of the
[28:59.240 --> 29:06.680]  original iPhone OS that was so natural and so obvious. And that obviousness, it's obvious when you
[29:06.680 --> 29:11.160]  use it, but it's not obvious when you design it, right? It requires tons of iteration and tons of
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.480]  pushback and doing it again and again. And certainly jobs was, was the head of this and pushed
[29:17.480 --> 29:22.760]  for this, but this was where, this was where in particular, I think, for still really channel jobs.
[29:22.760 --> 29:29.080]  And certainly iOS and I would say, you know, especially now once we're used to look much better
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.840]  than the old iPhone OS, but I still think there's lots of areas where they're more difficult to
[29:34.840 --> 29:40.680]  use and more difficult in a not in that they're less obvious. And that's something that I think
[29:40.680 --> 29:45.640]  is missing still. I think a way that you get there is not so much being able to find
[29:47.480 --> 29:54.920]  the truly simple, seemingly obvious way to do it. It's more of the refusal to accept
[29:56.920 --> 30:03.240]  the complicated, the complex, the this isn't, it isn't clear how you do it. But you, you know,
[30:03.240 --> 30:08.200]  you start, you think, hey, you know, here's how we'll lay out the new calendar app for iOS 8.
[30:08.200 --> 30:12.280]  And we'll do this in this and it sounds good and you build it and then you use it and it's like,
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.520]  but I'm kind of confused, like, how do I just show a list of events? And eventually though,
[30:16.520 --> 30:21.480]  you kind of get used to it and you can just say, well, you can do everything. Now I've been testing
[30:21.480 --> 30:26.280]  it long enough. I know it. Good enough. Let's ship it. Whereas I think four stall and again,
[30:26.280 --> 30:31.640]  like use that channeling jobs had an ability to say, this isn't good enough. This is shit. We've
[30:31.640 --> 30:36.040]  got to start over this, you know, this can't be tweaked. We can't just move a button here. We've got
[30:36.040 --> 30:42.840]  to throw this out because the whole thing is just not brain dead clear. Yeah, it's so hard. It's
[30:42.840 --> 30:47.560]  oh, sorry. Well, it's just you can get you can just talk yourself into accepting something that's
[30:47.560 --> 30:52.280]  not quite clear. Well, it's so hard when you're immersed. Yeah, when you're immersed in it's so hard
[30:52.280 --> 30:57.720]  to look at something through the eyes of a new user or a novice user, like that's a, that's a truly
[30:57.720 --> 31:05.080]  like a skill and a gift that very few people, including myself, I think, you know, have because
[31:05.080 --> 31:13.960]  when you're just used to it. And so it becomes a blind spot. Yeah. I guess I take a break right here.
[31:13.960 --> 31:21.400]  Thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at Fracture. You guys remember Fracture. Fracture
[31:21.400 --> 31:28.920]  is the company that you send them your photos. They print your photos directly on pieces of glass.
[31:29.480 --> 31:33.960]  Not on a piece of paper. That's under glass and putting a frame. They, I don't know what they do.
[31:33.960 --> 31:39.960]  They've got some kind of proprietary technology. It's amazing. They print your photo right on the glass.
[31:41.320 --> 31:48.840]  The effect in person is like the analog equivalent of these modern retinid displays where the
[31:48.840 --> 31:55.880]  LCD is laminated to the touch center, where it looks like the pixels are right on the glass.
[31:55.880 --> 32:00.120]  That's what your photo looks like when you get it back from Fracture. Really, really cool.
[32:01.800 --> 32:06.760]  They have a whole bunch of sizes. Everything from small square ones to really, really big ones.
[32:07.880 --> 32:11.960]  And they ship them in these amazing. It's almost worth ordering your first thing from Fracture just
[32:11.960 --> 32:19.400]  to see how they ship them. Because the box is the frame is the stand. It's all sort of integrated
[32:19.400 --> 32:26.440]  and there's like a total minimal amount of wasted cardboard. But when you get it out, if you want
[32:26.440 --> 32:30.040]  to hang out on a wall or you want to prop it up on your desk, all that stuff is all built in
[32:31.480 --> 32:35.640]  to what you get. So you don't need to take this thing and then put a frame around it or put it
[32:35.640 --> 32:39.800]  in a frame or do anything like that. Everything you need to like say hang it on a wall or
[32:39.800 --> 32:46.520]  prop it up on your desk is all built in to the packaging. Really cool looking. So you can do it
[32:46.520 --> 32:52.760]  and then it's borderless. So it just has a great effect, very, very aesthetically pleasing on your
[32:52.760 --> 33:01.400]  desk or on your wall. And the quality is just top notch. I really, really love the way pictures
[33:01.400 --> 33:08.680]  look from this. It's a great gift. If you haven't tried it yet, you're not. It's a really, really
[33:08.680 --> 33:16.520]  good way. And, you know, I think their big pitch, you know, is that as we go more and more digital,
[33:16.520 --> 33:23.400]  digital, digital, digital with our photography, we lose touch of the almost the humanity of getting
[33:23.400 --> 33:30.760]  analog prints of your family and friends and, you know, events from your life that you want to
[33:30.760 --> 33:35.320]  remember and the way that we used to in the old days, all the best photos we had were of course
[33:35.320 --> 33:39.960]  analog because that's all we had. And you had them hanging under wall or on your desk or on your
[33:39.960 --> 33:47.160]  mantle. So it's a great way to do that. Take your best pictures, get them printed out. And
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.080]  there's no better way to do it than fracture. So where do you go to find out more? Well, their website
[33:53.080 --> 34:05.080]  is at Fracture, F-R-A-C-T-U-R-E-Me.com. Fracture Me.com. And I have a special code just for listeners of
[34:05.080 --> 34:11.880]  the show, Daring Fireball, all one word, Daring Fireball, you'll say five bucks off your order
[34:11.880 --> 34:17.400]  if you use that code, Daring Fireball. So my thanks to Fracture, go get some pictures.
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.960]  So you mentioned the analog nature of photos. Did you see that iPhone app that basically
[34:27.160 --> 34:31.000]  it lets you take, it lets you take a picture but it doesn't show you the picture if you've
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.920]  taken it. And once you've taken 24 pictures, you can pay to have them mailed to you, like print it
[34:36.920 --> 34:42.360]  out. Oh no, I did see something about this. There's just like maybe maybe a couple weeks ago?
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.520]  Yeah, I think it's called white album, I think I was just in a quick search for it. White album?
[34:47.240 --> 34:51.720]  I think so. Yeah, white, white, white album app.com.
[34:52.920 --> 34:54.920]  Surprise the Beatles and something to say about.
[34:54.920 --> 35:01.400]  On an Apple device, no less. Wow, that sounds terrible.
[35:02.600 --> 35:06.920]  It was interesting because I thought it was interesting because lots of people too are like,
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.920]  oh, this is so great. It's so wonderful and it's like,
[35:09.640 --> 35:13.880]  eh, are you sure about that? It's one of the things that it sounds great when you tweet it.
[35:13.880 --> 35:16.440]  I'm not sure it'd be very great in actual real life.
[35:16.440 --> 35:26.680]  Right, and I also feel that there's something about a digital viewfinder.
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.320]  Even though the iPhone viewfinder is, you know, using your iPhone as a viewfinder and holding it up
[35:31.320 --> 35:35.880]  and looking at it, it's so much bigger than what you'd see with like an analog, an old analog
[35:35.880 --> 35:41.320]  film camera when you'd look through the eyepiece. But because it's a sensor, there's something about
[35:41.320 --> 35:48.120]  it that makes it harder to frame exactly what you want. I don't know. I feel like if I tried this,
[35:48.120 --> 35:54.440]  I would not take as good a picture as I would if I were using my old 35 millimeter SLR looking
[35:54.440 --> 35:59.240]  through the viewfinder where I know I can't chimp and look at the pictures as I take them.
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.200]  But I feel like I would get better pictures that way because I'm looking through an actual analog
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.800]  viewfinder and there's no lag whatsoever. No, I agree. Actually, I was just thinking about it. When I
[36:09.800 --> 36:16.040]  use my SLR, I don't look at the photo I took most of the time unless I'm worried about the
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.880]  exposure or something. Right, unless you notice something really weird like, man, this is,
[36:19.880 --> 36:23.400]  there's such strong backlighting like these people, you know, there's no way to get on the other
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.880]  side of them and the sun is behind them. You know, I want to double check that this isn't just
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.440]  going to show up as a silhouette. Right, exactly. Exactly. I choose to take it and then I'll look at it
[36:32.440 --> 36:38.120]  whenever I, you know, put them in like room or whatever. I used to get frustrated. I don't even,
[36:38.120 --> 36:42.120]  I mean, I can't remember the last time I launched it. But I used to use hips to matic a lot
[36:42.120 --> 36:48.600]  because I thought they for a while, I thought they had the best filters by far. But hips to matic
[36:48.600 --> 36:54.680]  had, they were halfway in that regard where they didn't let you apply filters to photos you'd
[36:54.680 --> 36:59.320]  already taken and they didn't let you change the filters on photos you'd taken. You had to set
[36:59.320 --> 37:08.200]  your gimmicky fake lens and your gimmicky fake film and then whatever you took you got. Oh,
[37:08.200 --> 37:14.600]  interesting. I never, I never really used it. Yeah. And it, it's, you know, and it was all in the
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.560]  name of this sort of, well, for lack of a better term, skewer morphic pretending that your,
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.920]  that the hips to matic app was a film camera. You know, and that different lens, you know,
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.120]  you can might find a film you really like and then you put a different lens on and it gives
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.200]  it a slightly, I think the, I think that the, the films always had the strongest effect on the
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.760]  filtering and the lens was a little secondary, but you could get different effects, but you couldn't
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.160]  see until after you took a photo. And it was, you know, and if you took one and it was like,
[37:41.880 --> 37:46.840]  it, you're, you had it set up to look really good outside on a sunny day and the pictures were
[37:46.840 --> 37:50.760]  nice and warm and had a nice, you know, not gimmicky filter, you look, but just, you know,
[37:50.760 --> 37:55.000]  an aesthetically pleasing look. And then you went indoors and the same combination look bad,
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.480]  you were like so many taps and turning the camera around and switching the film is,
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.840]  it was crazy. Like why not just let me do this after I've taken the photos?
[38:05.480 --> 38:10.600]  It's interesting to think about that with, um, with Instagram, right? Because you, you got on like
[38:10.600 --> 38:16.040]  an, an initial pass, you would think that they're going to be, although they're in the same category,
[38:16.040 --> 38:23.080]  but I mean, Instagram is, is an amazing app and service because it's, it's, it's really
[38:23.080 --> 38:29.080]  forward. And what I mean by that is like Instagram, it was kind of the first really pure,
[38:30.840 --> 38:36.120]  we were built for a mobile phone. And part of that's in the workflow, like you can just take a
[38:36.120 --> 38:40.840]  picture and then you apply the filter. And yeah, you may be applying, applying a kishi skewer
[38:40.840 --> 38:47.640]  morphic type filter, but it fits with the way you actually take pictures on a phone. Yeah. And then,
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.880]  and then just beyond that, the actual service, you know, only really working on a phone and having
[38:51.880 --> 38:57.480]  a bare bones website at best for a very long time. Even today, it's pretty bare bones. Like they,
[38:57.480 --> 39:03.240]  they've always been a mobile first company that is, that is built around the phone with the
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.240]  assumption that you're going to use your phone. And I think that's a big part of why, you know,
[39:07.240 --> 39:12.440]  they've been so successful. Yeah. On the aesthetic side, there's no doubt Instagram, I wouldn't call
[39:12.440 --> 39:18.120]  it a rip off. I would just say that the day eight hips, thematics lunch, where there's so much
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.560]  that they, that they just took from hypnotic, the square, the only side, the only, the only size
[39:23.560 --> 39:31.880]  you can are ratio, you can have is square. Um, hypnotic has, has had, I don't know, uh, the, the
[39:31.880 --> 39:36.200]  fake borders to make, you know, some of the films, depending on what film you had, had like
[39:36.200 --> 39:41.560]  Polaroid style borders, which if you recall, Instagram had for like the first couple of years of its
[39:41.560 --> 39:49.000]  existence. Right. Um, you know, the basic, the basic look like, like, not just, you know, that the
[39:49.000 --> 39:58.760]  films tended to look like old analog, uh, instant films. All of that, you know, Instagram just borrowed
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.680]  from hypnotic or followed hypnotic's lead. Right. Um, but they did that in a better way because
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.960]  they, they took advantage of, they, they did all the things aesthetically that made people
[40:09.960 --> 40:14.520]  like that look. They, you know, that's all that, you know, just the pleasure it gives you to have
[40:14.520 --> 40:20.120]  photos from your camera that look like that and that make, you know, just look cool, uh, or look
[40:20.120 --> 40:27.640]  better or whatever you want to say. Look, hipper. Um, with none of the, none of the goofy restrictions
[40:27.640 --> 40:33.320]  that hypnotic imposed in the name of just pure hipsterism, you know, the whole, once you've set a
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.560]  film, you know, you have to take the photo, the photo with the filter and if you don't like it,
[40:37.560 --> 40:42.200]  tough, take another photo. Whereas Instagram would let you pick camera images from your camera
[40:42.200 --> 40:48.360]  roll. They would let you change the filter if you'd already taken it in Instagram, etc. And then,
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.640]  you know, multiply that by a hundredfold by having the genius of turning it into a Twitter like
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.360]  social network. Right. I mean, that's, that's, you know, but it's all part of it. I mean, if I
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.400]  think that if they had launched without filters at all, it would have taken a lot longer and may not
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.720]  have taken off. Well, that, that, that, that's what's so brilliant about, about Instagram as a
[41:07.720 --> 41:13.640]  social network is they, there was a reason to use Instagram from day one, even if you do have
[41:13.640 --> 41:19.000]  any friends. And that, that's what's so hard about getting any social network off the ground is,
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  is just finding people or discovering people. And even Twitter today has this problem where
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  people get on there and they don't really have many followers and now Twitter's cut off from
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.880]  the Facebook, you know, kind of connection feed. Uh, and it's like, so I'm just like farting in the
[41:31.880 --> 41:36.600]  wind here, like who's listening to what I have to say, whereas with Instagram, like, you're getting
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.440]  value, you can get value from Instagram, even if you have zero followers. Yeah, even if your
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.520]  Instagram feed is more or less just your own photos for now, nobody's looking at them there,
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.320]  you can send, you know, email them and keep them and, you know, right. And it's because of the
[41:51.320 --> 41:56.360]  filters. I mean, because they're, they're cool and they look neat. And, and no, I agree. The other
[41:56.360 --> 42:02.280]  thing is just in general, and you, I think you just said something along these lines is appreciating
[42:02.280 --> 42:09.320]  a product is so much more than just like the actual like, like Instagram is successful. Yeah,
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.440]  maybe they, they borrowed the, the filter concept and a lot of was very similar,
[42:14.440 --> 42:19.960]  hips to matic. But that's not an, it's very easy. It's stuck on that in like comparing
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.320]  companies or comparing products and all this sort of stuff. But if you think about the whole,
[42:23.320 --> 42:28.120]  like the whole thing is the product, it's, it's all of it. And even, even with Instagram,
[42:28.120 --> 42:32.520]  you can argue like, it's, they have a, how they're going to make money in the future in the
[42:32.520 --> 42:36.600]  long run, that's going to be part of the product. And like, it's much more, there's all these
[42:36.600 --> 42:41.160]  different facets that go into it, ensure some companies are products may be similar on one facet,
[42:41.160 --> 42:44.680]  but they may be very different other ones. And maybe those different things that end up making
[42:44.680 --> 42:49.320]  the difference. If you have any insight on this a couple of weeks ago, Dan Fomer was on the show.
[42:49.320 --> 42:55.480]  And he, it's been so long that I have almost forgotten the complaint that Instagram still
[42:55.480 --> 43:03.160]  doesn't have an iPad app. I do actually. I think it's, I think it's okay. I mean, I, I understand
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.360]  I understand the, the objection, but it, I think it comes back to Instagram being,
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.640]  being a, a phone first app, like that, that's where like, so just from a very kind of
[43:15.640 --> 43:21.720]  narrow perspective, uh, I think Instagram still sees more benefit from working on improving their
[43:21.720 --> 43:28.840]  phone apps and they do on building, building an iPad app one, um, to, uh, the problem, I mean,
[43:28.840 --> 43:34.840]  now that people use iPads as cameras, this isn't as quite a strong idea, but I think this,
[43:34.840 --> 43:37.720]  what's compelling about Instagram is I think Instagram more than almost
[43:37.720 --> 43:43.240]  Instagram is like Facebook in that there's a very solid balance between creating content and
[43:43.240 --> 43:49.960]  consuming content. Whereas, uh, Twitter, I think a lot of people might just consume it. They
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.280]  don't really put stuff out there. Um, where, where is Instagram? Like people use it to make stuff
[43:54.280 --> 44:00.120]  and they use it to get stuff. And I think, but I, I almost think it's an outdated view of the iPad,
[44:00.120 --> 44:05.560]  though, like I think in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to photography, the iPad is a lot
[44:05.560 --> 44:15.560]  more big iPhone than, than tablet laptop. I do think so, especially for, um, you know, for
[44:15.560 --> 44:19.080]  a certain segment of the, of the population. I mean, it's my mom's primary camera. I mean,
[44:20.280 --> 44:23.880]  you like to go into our podcast, not mention your mom, but literally it's my mom's primary
[44:23.880 --> 44:27.320]  primary camera. Yeah, there's too many people like that. I, you know, every time I go to,
[44:27.320 --> 44:31.160]  I used to, I used to, I used to make a note and I used to even like when we'd go to Disney world,
[44:31.160 --> 44:38.200]  like a year or two ago, I would just snap photos of people using tablets as, as cameras,
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.400]  just as like a, like a thing to do while walking around the park. And I didn't publish them anywhere
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.240]  to make fun of them, but I just had them privately and see how many, how many photos of people
[44:47.240 --> 44:52.840]  using that tablet as a camera could I rack up in a day? Um, and my son, you know, my son used to
[44:52.840 --> 44:58.120]  laugh that it was, that's stupid as hobby to have it Disney world ever. You know, but I could
[44:58.120 --> 45:02.440]  usually get like 20 in a day and then I would just delete them all. Um, it's not, you couldn't even do
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.000]  anymore. You'd, you'd never, you wouldn't be able to get from point A to point B. It's, it's, it's
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.840]  common to seeing somebody using the phone as a camera. And there's too, too many people who, you know,
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.560]  they just don't see the distinction. Like, I don't even see people, and when I first tried to get
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.000]  off, I tried to get off my own high horse about making fun of people using tablets as cameras,
[45:21.640 --> 45:27.800]  maybe like a year ago or so. Um, I'd still get pushback from like listeners of the show and they'd
[45:27.800 --> 45:31.640]  be like, oh, come on, it's stupid looking. And now I don't even get that. Everybody, it's just sunk
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.520]  in. And I feel like it's almost ridiculous for an app that's photocentric like Instagram not to
[45:36.520 --> 45:42.520]  be native on what is for a lot of people, their primary camera. And then for the consumption side,
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.240]  consuming photos, it's always better to be bigger. So it would, you know, to look at your friends
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.480]  photos, it's always going to look bigger are the bigger on the biggest device you, you know, you can use.
[45:51.480 --> 45:58.520]  No, that's fair. I like, and I think your point is right that the, that, that justification may
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.520]  have made sense, but it makes increasingly less sense. That's, that said, they, they, I mean,
[46:02.520 --> 46:07.880]  they're part of Facebook. They, they have access to numbers and where, what people are using and
[46:07.880 --> 46:13.720]  where they're using it. So I would imagine it's a, it's not a uninformed decision. And the third
[46:13.720 --> 46:20.920]  factor is that it's different. I think in iOS eight era with the two font with the new phones,
[46:20.920 --> 46:28.920]  because the difference between making an iPad app and an iPhone app is nowhere near as different
[46:28.920 --> 46:36.040]  as it used to be. Like it's, it's really more in with these, if you're doing it the right way,
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.480]  if you can support the multiple iPhone sizes, there's almost no reason you shouldn't be supporting
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.920]  the iPad too. It's the same thing. It's no longer two big things. It's these different, you know,
[46:48.920 --> 46:53.240]  what are the comp scaling factors or whatever? To the scaling though, I think there is a resolution
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.880]  issue. Um, I know some people have raised that as a possible reason as well. Like the Instagram
[46:57.880 --> 47:03.720]  photos are just super low resolution and might look like crap on the iPad. Yeah, I don't know. Then
[47:03.720 --> 47:07.720]  again, this, this, this is a company I got off the ground by, you know, utilizing like the iPhone 3G
[47:07.720 --> 47:14.920]  camera. So, right. Yeah. So my guess is it's coming, but it's, it's almost, it's almost a, you know,
[47:14.920 --> 47:19.480]  it's almost like they're doing it on purpose at this point because they do support the native
[47:19.480 --> 47:25.640]  iPhone six sizes and six plus. Um, you know, and I would suggest as, as a iPad app, just,
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.480]  you know, I think that's an app where you don't have to, you know, just a, just a, just a natively
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.280]  scaled version of the iPhone app would be just fine. You don't have to redesign it or relay it
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.080]  out or do something different. Oh, I mean, their website is basically a, a scaled version of the
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.480]  iPhone app. Like it's, it's literally just like a column of photos that, that might as well be
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.680]  the app put on a, put on a web page. Yeah. I think the more, I, my guess is the explanation is that
[47:50.680 --> 47:57.640]  I think that, you know, they're a very conservative company that gives us a weird thing for a four
[47:57.640 --> 48:04.360]  year old, what five year old startup that is part of Facebook. And that is, you know, gone from
[48:04.360 --> 48:13.480]  13 people to, you know, a billion dollar acquisition to a multi billion dollar asset in just a
[48:13.480 --> 48:16.760]  handful of years, you know, usually you don't think of such companies as being conservative,
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.440]  but they are. They're very, very conservative in my opinion. We can always design wise.
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.960]  You can already see the, you can arguably see the conservatism and the fact that they sold
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.240]  out so early. Right. And, you know, uh, yeah, I would say that's actually part of the conservatism.
[48:29.240 --> 48:35.320]  And I would say the biggest sign of it is just how close what they have today is to what they
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.120]  shipped with the first day. Like it's, it, you know, they've definitely added a bunch of features
[48:40.120 --> 48:45.560]  and they've rewritten the filters. Um, but it's more or less the same thing. Yeah. I mean,
[48:45.560 --> 48:53.480]  you would be somebody who got to who like on the day that Instagram came out, um, for iPhone and just
[48:53.480 --> 48:58.840]  bought it or, you know, and you have to buy it, just downloaded it, got into it and said, I love this. I
[48:58.840 --> 49:03.240]  love this Instagram thing and just, you know, consumed the whole app, understood the whole thing.
[49:03.240 --> 49:08.360]  And if you took today's Instagram to that person five years ago, four years ago, whatever it is,
[49:08.360 --> 49:13.720]  they would be right at home. They'd have like two or three new things to like, oh, that's cool.
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.720]  But that's it. No, it's a good point. There's very few companies that you can say that about.
[49:19.720 --> 49:25.560]  Yeah. Well, I mean, it gets to the genius of the genius of the, of the, of the whole entire concept too.
[49:25.560 --> 49:30.760]  Right. Think about how different Twitter today is like logging into Twitter.com and what you're
[49:30.760 --> 49:37.240]  exposed to compared to what you were, you know, five years ago. It's very different. Um, what
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.560]  else is in the news before we get to big picture stuff? See box head their IPO today?
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.240]  They did. And, uh, it popped very nicely, uh, which is, I think great for them. I kind of
[49:47.240 --> 49:52.760]  suspect that they, they underpriced a little on purpose. Um, just because there's been so much,
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.560]  there's been a bit of a cloud around the company for the last year, which is not, which is not a
[49:57.560 --> 50:01.400]  good thing to have if you're trying to sell into very large enterprises and assure them that you're
[50:01.400 --> 50:06.520]  going to, you can hold on to all their data and for the long run. Um, whereas now I think they're
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.920]  going to come out of this and there's going to be a ton of good news, uh, you know, wow, you know,
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.720]  what a fantastic the market loves them. And I think it's going to be really good for them from a,
[50:15.720 --> 50:20.200]  just a sales and momentum perspective. So I, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.480]  if they kind of knew they were probably leaving some money on the table, but, um, but that they
[50:25.480 --> 50:30.920]  deemed kind of the, the shift in perception that this will result in to be, to be worth it.
[50:30.920 --> 50:37.720]  Yeah. The psychology of an IPO is so weird because it's like ideally in some sense you want to
[50:37.720 --> 50:42.920]  price your IPO at, at exactly what the market is going to value it at because otherwise you're
[50:42.920 --> 50:48.920]  leaving money on the table. But then you're, from your investor's perspective, there's a financial
[50:50.040 --> 50:56.920]  drive to under price your IPO. So that all of those investors shares, you know, go up and value
[50:56.920 --> 51:01.240]  once the market prices it. You know, I think, and I think it, I think it matters and because the
[51:01.240 --> 51:05.880]  people you take like, uh, take Facebook versus Twitter, like Facebook basically didn't pop at
[51:05.880 --> 51:10.360]  all. And then over time, it actually went down. And, and there's a lot of people who look at it
[51:10.360 --> 51:14.840]  from a narrow perspective and say, well, Facebook did it just right. They captured every available
[51:14.840 --> 51:20.040]  sent. And, and then they'll look at Twitter and Twitter had a huge pop. And they're like,
[51:20.040 --> 51:23.800]  oh, Twitter screwed up. They left a lot of money on the table. But I think if you actually
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.760]  look at it, like Facebook was under a ton of pressure right after IPO. And I think they were
[51:28.760 --> 51:35.560]  constrained, like strategically. Like I suspect that Facebook should have bought ways, for example,
[51:35.560 --> 51:41.480]  the mapping app. But I think that one reason they didn't is they couldn't really justify
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.120]  spending over a billion dollars when they were under so much pressure from, from investors.
[51:47.080 --> 51:51.240]  Because that was the kind of the height of like Facebook is doomed mania with their stock had
[51:51.240 --> 51:56.280]  dipped to like a third of what, what did IPO would have or a half or whatever. Whereas Twitter,
[51:56.280 --> 52:01.960]  Twitter, arguably Twitter has kind of been a disaster since the IPO and almost everywhere
[52:01.960 --> 52:06.680]  earnings call has been, been worse than the last. Yet, yes, there's pressure and there's been a
[52:06.680 --> 52:11.400]  lot of talk about Costello and stuff like that this year, particular. But I don't think it's been
[52:12.360 --> 52:18.200]  nearly to the degree that Twitter probably deserves to be perfectly honest. And I think part of
[52:18.200 --> 52:22.760]  that is because the stock is still up from the IPO. Like that, it, like, and so you look at it,
[52:22.760 --> 52:27.000]  yeah, the stock's down from its high, but it's still higher than what did IPO would have. I think
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.640]  that that that that matters. And if, whereas if Twitter was down like Facebook was down and had way
[52:33.640 --> 52:39.560]  worse fundamentals than Facebook ever had, man, like the, the sky would be falling to a much
[52:39.560 --> 52:44.520]  greater degree than it is right now. Yeah. And there's also some, like the incalculable part is
[52:44.520 --> 52:54.920]  the PR value of an IPO that pops, as you say. Absolutely. Like net, net, net escape is, you know,
[52:54.920 --> 53:00.840]  maybe the canonical example? I don't know. I mean, but that it, it gave this sense that net
[53:00.840 --> 53:04.920]  escape was the future, you know, that, that, you know, however much money they left on the table
[53:04.920 --> 53:11.080]  because the IPO popped on day one was worth, I don't know. I think tens of millions of dollars in
[53:11.080 --> 53:16.760]  the perception of, you know, holy shit, there's a new tech industry tightened in town.
[53:17.560 --> 53:22.280]  Absolutely. And it matters from, why it matters for hiring, it matters for morale. And it matters
[53:22.280 --> 53:28.520]  for like, I mean, the stock market a lot of it is about perception. And, right, the popping is like,
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.400]  oh my God, everybody else thinks this company is going to kick ass. Right. And that sticks with you.
[53:33.400 --> 53:40.280]  Like, and so like, when it matters, when like, the bad news doesn't matter. The way people
[53:41.080 --> 53:46.200]  perceive the bad news is what matters. And if people come at it with the assumption that this
[53:46.200 --> 53:50.120]  is a valuable company that people are excited about, then it's like, oh, that's okay, they'll,
[53:50.120 --> 53:54.120]  they'll get over it. Whereas if it's a, this company, man, everyone's down on it and then a
[53:54.120 --> 53:58.840]  piece of bad news comes on. I was like, Oh, man, this is terrible. And like I said, I think you saw
[53:58.840 --> 54:05.800]  that with Facebook, which, uh, in retrospect, it was ridiculous. You know, I mean, the, now the,
[54:05.800 --> 54:12.520]  now the stock is, is well up from its IPO stage. But it took, it took a lot longer than it
[54:12.520 --> 54:17.320]  should have for kind of the, the perception of Facebook to change. And arguably, I think even in
[54:17.320 --> 54:25.320]  the valley, I feel like Facebook is, is still seriously underappreciated for what a force it is,
[54:25.320 --> 54:31.960]  not just, not just, uh, as, as a service in an app, but as a financial, as a, as a business.
[54:32.760 --> 54:40.440]  Yeah, I agree with them. I, and I think it's, it's funny, because it's complicated as Facebook
[54:40.440 --> 54:48.120]  itself as a product is, in my opinion, it's a pretty simple story financially. It's, you know,
[54:48.120 --> 54:54.280]  they sell a lot of ads into the feed and they make people pay to get placement. And because everybody
[54:54.280 --> 55:01.960]  uses it, uh, it's worth it. And therefore, you know, the money's growing, you know, whereas Twitter
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.680]  is a much simpler product. And any kind of argument they try to make is how they're going to make
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.800]  money is my eyes roll back in my head and I fall asleep, because I don't understand.
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.320]  Now, there, there is something to that. And I think the, the Facebook ad unit is like the best
[55:17.320 --> 55:23.640]  ad unit in, in like, in tech. I mean, it's like people are looking at that feed multiple times a day,
[55:23.640 --> 55:30.040]  every day, more and more. And of, in a Facebook ad takes over your entire screen. It might only be
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.680]  for a few seconds, but for a few seconds, like your entire screen is filled with an ad, which on the
[55:34.680 --> 55:39.000]  web was never the case, like the ads were always off to the side. They were accompanying stuff. And
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.040]  so they were easy, they were much easier to, to ignore. And now it's super compelling. And what
[55:44.040 --> 55:48.040]  the other thing is, there's those, you say, you say Twitter is simple. I almost wonder if this is a,
[55:48.040 --> 55:52.920]  like we talked about with, with, when we talk about, four stall, like, we're used to it. And it,
[55:52.920 --> 55:57.640]  it feels simple and 140 characters seem simple. But then you start trying to explain to people,
[55:57.640 --> 56:03.640]  like, oh, don't start your tooth and at mention, or, uh, some people still use RT or MT, like,
[56:03.640 --> 56:09.160]  there's all these kind of conventions that actually, Twitter, Twitter is pretty complicated. And,
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.920]  and there's a lot of stuff. Like, I think the last really smart thing Twitter did from a product
[56:14.920 --> 56:21.560]  perspective was the native retweet, because that did simplify a convention. And there's so much
[56:21.560 --> 56:26.840]  other stuff that's cruff that's risen up like these multi tweets or the tweet storms and like all
[56:26.840 --> 56:34.360]  this and attaching photos to, to an image, like that, the company I find, it's so frustrating because
[56:34.360 --> 56:37.400]  they're doing all this stuff and they're buying these things and they're, we're going to do
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.560]  developer tools and all this sort of crap when it's like, there's so much low hanging fruit just
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.560]  from a product perspective. And from an onboarding perspective, which is still a disaster.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.760]  Yeah, I know, I mean, it's, it comes, I think it can come across, it comes across even to my
[56:50.760 --> 56:58.440]  eyes as very jargony, like computer jargony with all the RTs and MTs. And honestly, even, I think
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.080]  people get the app username. And it's certainly one of the, I think it's the most powerful asset
[57:03.080 --> 57:08.520]  Twitter has. I really do is the fact that when you turn on TV, it doesn't matter whether it's politics
[57:09.240 --> 57:16.280]  or sports, it's like the people who are on TV, they tell you their name and they tell you
[57:16.280 --> 57:24.280]  their Twitter handle and people get that. And that is super valuable. But I think and combine that
[57:24.280 --> 57:29.240]  with hashtags and to me, the whole thing, it comes across looking very jargony. I mean, I, I could
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.720]  we could do the whole rest of the show on my feelings on hashtags. But I know, I realized they've
[57:33.720 --> 57:38.680]  taken off and I realized that people somewhat get them and that regular people do use them,
[57:38.680 --> 57:45.080]  but I do feel that it contributes to a visual jargonyness when you, especially for new users,
[57:45.080 --> 57:48.680]  where you're, you know, you look at this stuff and you see all these weird punctuation characters,
[57:48.680 --> 57:53.640]  you know, and starts to look like programming code. And the weird short hands like RT and MT and
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.840]  stuff like that. Yeah. Now, I think, I think we might have titled Twitter on my very first time in
[57:58.840 --> 58:03.320]  this show, but I'm still, I'm still like they're now they're messing with the timeline. Like there's
[58:03.320 --> 58:09.240]  well, you were gone and stuff. I honestly think like the timeline is such at this point as so much
[58:09.240 --> 58:15.240]  cruft associated with it. It's fantastic for all of us who are familiar with Twitter and used to
[58:15.240 --> 58:22.440]  it, but it's pretty intimidating for a new user. And I wish they would re embrace lists and like
[58:23.160 --> 58:27.080]  have channels and the idea that you could like a new user should be able to come under in the
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.480]  World Cup and dip into the World Cup channel without having to like, you don't want to, like,
[58:31.480 --> 58:36.680]  what's, you don't want to follow people in the World Cup every day of the year. You just want
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.000]  to dip in and dip out. And there's no dip in and dip out experience for a new user on Twitter right
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.640]  now. Yeah, I think, and I think it kind of gets into some of the stuff that Evan Williams
[58:45.640 --> 58:50.040]  has was writing about and talking about in the last couple of weeks, you know, with the whole
[58:51.320 --> 58:57.880]  when Instagram passed Twitter in terms of, I forget the metric, monthly average users,
[58:57.880 --> 59:02.600]  active users, yeah, active users. And he was like, I don't give a shit how many monthly active
[59:02.600 --> 59:06.840]  users Instagram has, you know, and he has a great argument. And it's, you know, the line can be
[59:06.840 --> 59:11.240]  taken out of context and make it look like he's arrogant or whatever. And he read his, his, you know,
[59:11.240 --> 59:16.520]  essay on it on medium. And it's unsurprisingly for Evan Williams, very, very thoughtful. And
[59:16.520 --> 59:23.080]  he's right. And it's, you know, when there's, you know, Twitter has important uses that you just
[59:23.080 --> 59:29.560]  would never do on Instagram, like when there were the, the uprising in Egypt and stuff like that.
[59:29.560 --> 59:35.080]  And people use hashtags to get the news out. And it, you know, breaking news and stuff like
[59:35.080 --> 59:42.280]  that happens in a way on Twitter that there's no equivalent on any other service. The stuff in
[59:42.280 --> 59:52.760]  Ferguson's, you know, St. Louis demonstrations and stuff like that all had a part on Twitter. I mean,
[59:52.760 --> 59:58.280]  I think that it's Twitter is central to the way that the, the protesters have organized for things
[59:58.280 --> 1:00:03.800]  like that. And there's, it's just unique. But I feel like the thing that Twitter, Twitter, though,
[1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:07.480]  you know, Evan Williams doesn't run Twitter anymore. And I feel like the problem is that Twitter has
[1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:15.480]  gotten at a leadership level, gotten caught up in that sort of Facebook-esque monthly average
[1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:21.160]  users as an important metric, which has tied them up because I feel like what Twitter's natural
[1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:25.960]  place is for most people is far more about consumption than about actually tweeting.
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:32.440]  Right. Whereas Facebook is all about everybody sharing all of their stuff with their people,
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:36.120]  you know, with their friends and family and stuff like that. Whereas I think the problem is,
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:39.400]  well, what am I supposed to tweet? Maybe you're not supposed to tweet anything. Maybe you're just
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:45.240]  supposed to, you know, like you said, get on a list or follow a hashtag for the World Cup or for
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:53.000]  your favorite team or for some sort of news event that you're interested in and just follow along.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.760]  And, you know, maybe it's like a hobby that you want to follow all the time or maybe it's just,
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:03.640]  I just want to follow the Super Bowl until next Sunday. Yep. No, I don't, you don't want to
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.680]  contribute anything. You're not tweeting. You're just following along.
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:11.400]  No, what I said, when that happened in the Instagram thing, like my take was like, I'm really sad
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:17.960]  that Twitter didn't buy Instagram mainly because if they had Instagram would make all the money
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.200]  and Twitter could just be Twitter. Yeah, because I mean, Instagram is going to make billions of
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.920]  dollars. I mean, it's, it's like Facebook, but even better. Like you're going to scroll through
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:30.360]  your photos. There's going to be ads in there. And you're going to do it anyway because you're
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:38.120]  addicted to it. And, and it's, it's, it's such, it's so, it's so obvious and Twitter surprised,
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:41.960]  I'm surprised we don't see more ads in Instagram. I don't know if I've ever seen one.
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:45.800]  And I know that they announced it and I know that they had some demo versions of it, but I've
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:50.760]  still, I, I check it almost every day and I can't remember seeing an ad in Instagram.
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:55.000]  No, it's, it's still like very limited sort of trial. As one of those things where Facebook
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.960]  doesn't need to, like Facebook is making so much money right now that they can, I mean, they can
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:05.080]  spend billions of dollars on whatever they want to and not, and not monetize. And it's, I almost,
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.960]  I almost think it's, it's smart, not just from a, they want to do it the right way, but it's smart
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:16.440]  from a, they can always turn that faucet on if they need to. Um, and, and like what's the rush,
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:22.200]  the stock market loves them. They're flying high. They, they have like pretty much, they're as
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:26.680]  independent as an independent company can be for the most part. I mean, just from a one,
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.040]  the stock market loves them in two, Zuckerberg controls everything anyway. Um, so I, from that
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:36.760]  perspective, you know, what's, what's the rush? Right. And then just of it, as I, you know,
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:40.600]  I don't know, I agree with you. I'm surprised we just haven't seen it. I'd, you know, or just,
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:47.160]  because I feel like the way to do it is a, you know, the old, slowly boiled frog, you know,
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:51.960]  start them slow and then slowly dial it up to where you want it to be. But you got to start at some
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:03:00.120]  point. Yeah. Uh, but which they have, but I think they are going slower than they need to just
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:09.320]  because they can. Right. Um, you see Tim quick, Tim quick tweeted, congratulations on the box.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:16.920]  Yeah. That's surprising. And I take note of that, you know, in my, because Tim cooked tweets
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:25.000]  and I'm almost dead certain that it's actually him doing the tweeting. Um, but he doesn't tweet
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.440]  very often. Right. And so it's usually worth noting. And I know he tweeted earlier in a week,
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:35.080]  or I guess it's almost a week ago now, uh, uh, for Martin Luther King Day,
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:40.680]  the holiday here in the US. And, you know, he's repeatedly, you know, his two heroes are Martin
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:46.120]  Luther King and, and Robert Kennedy. So no surprise that he would tweet something like that.
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:51.960]  I'll, you know, a nice thing for Apple CEO to tweet, but not necessarily newsworthy,
[1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:56.200]  but him tweeting to, you know, box on an IPO is to me a little interesting.
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:01.080]  Totally. I mean, for what I've seen on Twitter, there's been a fair bit of speculation
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:07.720]  already and that speculation just like raised eyebrows. Yeah. I don't know. I kind of feel like
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:13.720]  it's, you know, an IP, one thing about an IPO is it certainly, it doesn't mean that box is not
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:19.880]  going to be acquired by somebody else, but it certainly makes it a lot less likely. And, you know,
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:29.480]  I think Apple is happier in a world where more companies like box IPO and stay independent satellites
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:36.760]  of the, you know, the mammoth titans like Microsoft and Facebook and Google, then a world where
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:42.040]  every company that gets to that size and stability gets acquired by somebody. Absolutely.
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:45.960]  I think because Apple is not going to do those acquisitions, right? Apple is never going to be the
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:52.200]  one that that acquires a lot of companies. And therefore, it means that most of those companies
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:59.960]  would be going into companies that are more like competitor's to Apple, like Google or Microsoft
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:06.520]  or Facebook or, you know, what have you? No, that's how I read it. That's a really great,
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:13.640]  I think that's exactly it. That's how I read it because I feel like Apple can, you know,
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:18.680]  happily and wholeheartedly partner with box on things like that, you know, the extent, you know,
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:27.000]  the file sharing integration and Yosemite and I was eight. And it would be a lot less likely to
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.680]  do that if they thought box was going to be acquired by Google. Even though it's an open API
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:37.400]  that everybody can do. So I guess who, you know, after box, you know, Dropbox would be next,
[1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:41.560]  right? Yeah, I think, I'd deal with cyber, like formerly Sammy the Waller. It's like he was
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:44.840]  one of those that's kind of speckling about it. And he's like, well, what would Apple do the same
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:50.120]  for Dropbox? And I think, for the reason you said, yeah, absolutely. And I think when they demoed
[1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:56.840]  extensions, I think they had both box and Dropbox. Yes, there. And I think that's, yeah, Apple,
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:03.880]  it's a good, it's the exact sort of relationship, Apple likes where they need Apple more than
[1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:12.600]  Apple needs them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think, you know, Apple has any desire to crush Dropbox.
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:15.960]  I really don't. I mean, I know some people read into it and they think, you know, that they
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:20.520]  would just like everybody to, you know, they want people to use iCloud drive, no doubt about it.
[1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:24.280]  I mean, they've made it so people would use it. But if people would rather use Dropbox instead,
[1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:28.120]  use Dropbox instead, you know, there's no way that they would go through the work to make things
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:33.640]  like Dropbox official, because, you know, up until Yosemite Dropbox was just a dirty hack to integrate
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:37.880]  with the finder. That's right. They actually, they did like things for Dropbox in
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:43.720]  in Yosemite to actually make it make it work. Yeah, it's all officially sanctioned and on the
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:47.320]  up and up those green check boxes that show you, you know, like in the finder view when you're
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:52.520]  looking at something in your Dropbox, Dropbox is the one I use. I don't use box. I don't use any of
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:57.080]  the other third party ones, but I use Dropbox. And now you get these official green checkmarks that
[1:06:57.080 --> 1:07:01.960]  you never got before. Like when you used to get like a little badge on your finder icon,
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:07.720]  that would show you that a file was sinking to Dropbox and then it would go green when it was there.
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:14.760]  That was all using private APIs, you know, on Dropbox's part. And, you know, to their credit,
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:21.800]  I've been using Dropbox from very early days. And I'm very low, always have been low to install
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:30.280]  third party extensions that are using private APIs on Mac OS X. But Dropbox, you know, Dropbox,
[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:35.800]  the features were worth it. But I've always been like one foot, you know, like, hey, if I ever see
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:40.280]  problems, if the finder starts going wacky, you know, you're out the door. But they've never really
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:44.760]  been a problem. No, they've always been, they're very, very, very, excellently engineered for
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:51.000]  something that was using private APIs. And I also think it's interesting. I always, when they
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:57.560]  announced that at WWDC, I specifically thought about Dropbox, A, because I'm the most familiar
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:03.800]  with them and I use them and B, because they had their own thing that was working. And in my
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.880]  experience, and I think most people's experience, I've never heard of anybody say, wow, Dropbox,
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:11.720]  you know, crash makes my computer crash or anything like that, or corrupts my file system.
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:17.000]  But they had their own thing. Would they be willing to dump their own thing that they'd spend
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.120]  all that work on to use Apple's thing? And they did. They've done the right thing. And I wonder how
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:27.240]  much of that is, you know, that they they considered a good allocation of engineering resources to go
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:32.280]  with the official APIs in Yosemite and how much of it, because they still have the old stuff,
[1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:38.760]  because you can still run Dropbox on Mac OS 9. I mean, I don't think it runs at OS 9.
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:45.960]  Now, 10.9, 10.8, 10.7. I don't know how far back they go. So they've still got to keep their
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:51.000]  private API stuff going for their supportive older versions of macOS. And so a lot of times,
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.920]  I think, you know, in my experience is watching the way the industry goes a lot of times,
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:59.160]  and then, you know, a company isn't going to go with the new thing because they want to go with
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:04.120]  the backwards compatible thing, even though it's not using the public API. But Dropbox did the
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:08.520]  right thing, which, in my opinion, the right thing, which is to go with the official API,
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:13.560]  even though it sort of forks their code. And I wonder how much of that was about engineering,
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:19.480]  and how much of it was about politics and keeping a good relationship with Apple.
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:25.640]  Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple worked with them on it. There was a bit of a,
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:31.240]  you know, quid pro quo here, like, you know, not a quid pro quo, but a like, like, okay,
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:37.400]  we'll help you fix this. But you, I mean, you have to stop on day one. Yeah. And I, as a user, it was
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:41.880]  seamless. I didn't even notice when they switched over. I think at some point, because I, you know,
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:46.760]  I've been running Yosemite since the public beta is in summer. And I'm pretty sure at the time,
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:51.400]  originally, I'm almost certain that Dropbox didn't already support it. I didn't even notice.
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:56.760]  I actually didn't notice when Dropbox started supporting it until one day, I was like, Oh,
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:01.080]  there obviously are because I've got the, the new style check marks, not the ones that are
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:08.280]  superimposed on the icon. Yeah. It's interesting. Um, the other thing, the other thing too is, uh,
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:14.600]  I think, um, you know, Aaron Levy, I haven't, I haven't really heard you would say a bad word about
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:19.560]  him. I think people are, are just happy that like, it's been such a torturous journey for box
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:25.880]  that, um, they, they finally made it. I would be surprised there's just a bit of like, you know,
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:32.920]  cooks just genuinely happy for him. Yeah. Um, I'm going to take another sponsor break. But before
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.480]  I do, that's a good reminder, I have a correction to make, uh, just a minor one. But last on the last
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.960]  show with Marco, I forget what we were talking about, but I said something about me running, uh,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.160]  iOS nine. And what I meant, I, I, I am not running. I was, I'm running iOS eight, but combine that
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:54.600]  with the things where like Mac rumors has like an increase in the number of hits of people running
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:02.120]  iOS nine, um, from Cupertino. Uh, and I got it. I don't know. It does an email from people
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:08.120]  asking whether I'm running iOS nine. No, I'm not running iOS nine. And if I were, I wouldn't be able
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:14.920]  to say anything about it anyway. It was just a stupid, uh, uh, what's the verbal typo? I don't know.
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:21.000]  Miss speak. Um, yeah. There's that. We better work on that. Well, whatever a verbal typo is, that's
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.200]  all it was. In the same way that I just said that Dropbox still runs on, uh, Mac OS nine. Yes.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:32.680]  The nine seems to be a bit of a kryptonite number for you. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I've,
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:39.640]  I don't know something. And I think, uh, Mac OS going to 10 point 10 somehow set over my
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:47.720]  trip odometer as well. It's like, uh, I don't know. Well, I should, according to urban dictionary,
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:53.320]  or verbal typo is the thing. So, okay, I could just call it a verbal typo. It works for me.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.400]  Yeah. Uh, what about maloprop? Is maloprop to the right word?
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:05.640]  Uh, I don't think so, but I'm not confident. A maloprop or malopropism is the term for
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:10.440]  misspoke in words. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Maloprop, the mistaken use of a word in place of a
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:14.440]  similar sounding one often with on the tension. Well, that's not quite right. Dancing of
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:19.480]  dance a flamingo instead of dance a flamingo. Although I do make a lot of help. So,
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:26.360]  I think, I think that's a characteristic of like someone that like read a lot and like, um,
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:31.240]  you know, I mean, neither of us. I think go out that often and then you, so you encounter a lot of
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:36.680]  words. Uh, but then when it actually comes to articulating them, sometimes you, I, I, I swear to God,
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:41.480]  we talked about this out of previous episode about how we constantly mispronounce words. Yeah.
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:46.280]  Yeah. Because I've, you know, there's, there's a huge chunk of my vocabulary or things that I
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:51.240]  read when I was growing up and never heard anybody say. And so I just made up my own punctuation,
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:57.880]  our pronunciation in my, in my head, totally no idea of how it was actually supposed to be pronounced.
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:08.440]  Anyway, um, our second sponsor is our good friends at need and EED. Need is a refined retailer
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:15.720]  in lifestyle publication for men. That's their official slogan. Uh, my friend, um, Jim Ray,
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:24.680]  very well dressed man knows his stuff. Uh, really likes this stuff at need. Um, has described
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:31.160]  need as a refined retailer in lifestyle publication for men who generally don't like
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:36.040]  retailer in lifestyle publications for men, which is a great way to put it. So if you hear
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:42.680]  lifestyle publication for men and roll your eyes like, uh, not for me, maybe you should check out
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:48.360]  need because it's a different style and vibe. Each month, here's what need does. They source and

[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:31.640]  It's weird. I feel I feel over the last few weeks, I've encountered a few people that, uh,
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:37.480]  that don't drink hot or the gave up coffee. Um, and I just, I just don't understand. I just
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:39.960]  understand what drives, what drives the one to do such a thing.
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:45.960]  They claim all, they claim all I feel great, but that just reminds me of the, uh, of the
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:50.840]  Frank Sinatra quote, uh, what is it? I feel sorry for people that don't drink because when they
[1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:55.400]  wake up in the morning, that's the best they're going to feel all day. Such a great line.
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:17:02.600]  I think when you and Merlin talked about the, uh, the blogger, the blogger, uh, the,
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:06.600]  what was it? The blogger drinking routine or something like that. Basically you, you tell a time
[1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:11.800]  it is by what you're drinking. Um, in the morning, it's coffee, then it's, uh, like, so to stream
[1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:16.360]  and then it's scotch or something on those lines. And that's, that's about how you know a time
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:21.720]  at or martini in your case. I said, yeah, exactly. Well, I don't drink martinis every day.
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.680]  I am all over the place on, on alcohol. I'm trying to expand my palate. I just linked to,
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:33.640]  I'm so proud of it. I don't know. Sometimes I really like to, uh, I like it when I, my linking to
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:39.000]  something like blows it up. Um, a guy named, do you see this guy named Mark Bylock? I did.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.160]  I put it in my Amazon car, so it probably is this big book and they don't, you know, they don't
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:49.560]  ship. The back story on this is I don't remember where I saw it. I don't remember. And it's,
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:54.280]  you, do you ever pre order stuff from Amazon? I do it all the time. It's like sending gifts to myself
[1:17:54.280 --> 1:18:00.520]  because I always forget, like always forget. And so it was like, at some point in December,
[1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:05.080]  I got a thing from Amazon and it was close to Christmas, really close. I might have been like the
[1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:09.800]  23rd or something like that. And I had no pending gifts coming. Everything I had ordered
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:14.760]  had already shown up. I'd gotten everything done at a, you know, not last minute. And, and,
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:18.760]  I think came and I assumed it was for my wife and instead it was addressed to me. It was from
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:22.840]  Amazon. I thought, shit, I don't remember. I don't, I've no idea what this is. I opened it up and
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:27.960]  here it is, the whiskey cabinet, this beautiful beautiful book by Mark Bylock. And then I remembered,
[1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:35.000]  oh, a couple months ago, I pre ordered this. Oh, here it is. And I thought this book is beautiful.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:41.320]  It is beautiful photography, beautiful paper, beautiful typography. And, you know, and I couldn't
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:46.280]  wait to read it. I was very excited. I went up and it is, so it's such a weird coincidence,
[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:50.360]  because you know, I'm terrible. I would go days, I literally go days without checking my email
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:55.240]  sometimes. And I, it's, I was just talking about this. Like I get less email than like when I
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:19:00.040]  worked at Microsoft, for example, way less. But it's so much more Roberta now because it's not my
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:05.160]  job. Like it's, it's pure additive. Whereas before, like I lived in it. So it was, it was like
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:10.440]  almost more tolerable. This was a day where I had gotten caught up on my inbox and I was, you know,
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:16.600]  down to the inbox zero, at least for like, you know, this week. And I had two new emails. One
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:22.440]  was junk. And the other was from Mark Bylock. And I was like, well, that's crazy. The same guy's name
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:26.840]  is what's on the book. And he's like, hey, you know, no idea if you're interested. I just wrote
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:33.960]  in a book on whiskey. You might be interested. No, no, you know, I, no, no pressure to link it up
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.560]  or anything. I just thought you might want a complimentary copy. Tell me where to send it and I'll send
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:43.720]  one. I just, I was like, literally after it right after I answered the ding dong of the UPS,
[1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:47.560]  giving me the book that I'd paid for. So I cricked snapped a photo with my phone and I was like,
[1:19:47.560 --> 1:19:52.760]  too late. I pre ordered it months ago. That's awesome. Was just like an amazing story. Anyway,
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:57.880]  long story short, I read the book and I loved it. So I linked it up on during fireball and it
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:02.840]  like sold out in Amazon. So they have to like, they had like order more from its publisher or
[1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:09.000]  something like that. No, I mean, I, I, I, I, I can certainly relate. I mean, I think, I mean,
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:14.440]  back when I, back when I first, I mean, I started trajectory with the, I had a five year plan,
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:18.600]  like I thought maybe in five years, I could make, you know, make a living from it. And then I
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:24.280]  moved back to Taiwan and, you know, which is we wanted to do. And, and it obviously, it's taken
[1:20:24.280 --> 1:20:29.560]  off far more quickly than, than I anticipated. I haven't, it's not even two years old yet.
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:36.360]  Um, but, uh, but I mean, the big kind of the, the real big jump was I might have told this story
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:39.480]  in the title previously, but was you linking to it and saying, you know, it's great new blog and
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:44.600]  stuff like that. But it was funny about it. And I'm sorry if I told this one before, but, uh,
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:51.080]  I got an email from you, uh, like saying, oh, you've been really prolific, really great stuff.
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:56.040]  By the way, I noticed and you like went on this like three paragraph dissertation on a bad
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:00.120]  word choice I had made. And you're like, oh, I always make the same mistake as well. So I actually
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:04.200]  have a script to fix it when I do it. Well, it was like what the etymology of the word and how
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:10.040]  it was used, all sort of stuff. And it was, it was so classic, like the John Gruber that, you know,
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.800]  anyone might imagine. And so right after that, like I opened up Google analytics, I started
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:17.800]  like refreshing your page. I'm like, I bet he's going to link to me soon. And then, like, like
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:23.560]  30 minutes later, boom, there it was. Uh, and, uh, but it, I mean, I, I'll, I'll take the
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:27.960]  opportunity now being your show to thank you for that, because it certainly was, um, you know,
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:33.480]  a good, uh, you know, I think I, when you linked to me, I probably had like 600 followers on Twitter
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:39.000]  and within, you know, a couple of days I had about 1500. And, um, I mean, obviously, I've gotten
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:44.360]  watch since then, but that, that was certainly kind of the, the ignition or jumpstart. So thanks,
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:49.400]  John. I do that. I, if I see a typo or something like that and something I'm going to link to,
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:54.280]  I do try to con, and I know, if I know the person at all, I do try to tell them it before,
[1:21:54.280 --> 1:22:00.040]  but I never say that I'm going to link to it, because I, I don't know, I don't, you don't want to
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:05.320]  lock yourself in. Well, partly I don't want to lock myself in. What if I change my mind? What if I
[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:09.640]  think, you know what? It's not worth linking to. And the other part is it somehow sounds a little
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:14.440]  presumptuous. It's, to me, it's like, if I just say, hey, you have a typo here, it's like,
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.280]  I'm doing you a favor, I'm pointing it out. If I say, I'm, you know, I'm about to link to you,
[1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:22.920]  but you have a typo. It's, it feels a little bit more like I'm not linking to you to fix this
[1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:27.800]  typo. Yeah. Right. And it, and I don't want to put that, you know, I don't want to put any pressure
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:34.760]  on them. I should, I should find out what the word was. Yeah, we could look up the email later,
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:38.600]  I'm sure. But anyway, it made me think of that book by Mark Bylock, because the whole
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:45.320]  gist of the book is, it's, it's not comprehensive. It's not encyclopedia. It's just a sort of,
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:51.160]  I don't know. I would guess maybe like 100 whiskey's from around the world, you know,
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:58.200]  Scotland, Ireland, United States, Canada, Japan. And like his, you know, expert opinion and
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:04.040]  discussion on what makes the different region, you know, what are the traditions and, you know,
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:09.320]  what makes them different and what you should be looking for if you're, you know, if you like one.
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:17.320]  And, you know, I'm mostly a US bourbon ride drinker. But, you know, I really like it. And so I've,
[1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:20.680]  you know, I've been trying to expand my palette to other things around the world.
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:24.360]  I think there's something, especially about it not being comprehensive. Like, and that just makes
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:30.360]  us so much more accessible. Right. And I can, I have from years and years ago, and he has the
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:36.840]  unfortunately coincidental name, Michael Jackson, he's a famous, famous beer writer, like I drank
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:42.440]  beer a lot more before I got into any kind of spirits. And it's a useful, it's just a different
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:49.960]  type of book. But Michael Jackson has like a beer book that's encyclopedic. It is, you know,
[1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:53.640]  no, I guess, you know, beer is, there's so many microbrews. I don't think anybody could cover
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:57.160]  them all. But I think it's probably more like thousands of beers than hundreds of beers.
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:03.000]  Yeah. No, exactly. And I share the affinity for the beer. By the way, I did find the email.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:10.600]  Um, I wrote, uh, I wrote this Jives with data showing little cyclicality and Android purchases.
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:15.800]  Oh, yeah. Jive is a dance or an adjective for US black slang. The word you want is jive.
[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:23.160]  And this is what killed me is you had verb bracket, no objective bracket informal, be in a
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:28.600]  court semi colon agree. Like it was like literally a dictionary definition. It wasn't like a
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:33.800]  op hand. This is what it means. It was like, they had the nomenclature of a dictionary definition.
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:38.280]  And they're like, I note this because what I have was always to use jive with a G when I'm at J.
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:42.840]  And you actually said you, you created a Texas banner snippet to fix it automatically. So, um,
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:48.200]  yeah. And then that's a common, it still kicks in every time I try to use it. I always use the wrong
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.880]  way. Well, as you note, confusingly enough, jive as a verb means make insulting or mock your
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.640]  remarks year, which is actually very close when the ultra meetings of jive, which is taught or
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:02.120]  scenarios. Right. Yeah, it's very confusing. Wait, so which is the one we want when we say that
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:08.760]  it's in agreement with something? Jive J I B E your problem is you say G I B E and I said J V E,
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:14.040]  which is like a right, right, right, right, right. Yeah, I actually now that I think about it,
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:17.880]  I think I finally got that down and I do tend to type it, right. Because if I had to guess I would
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:23.480]  have, right there, I would have guessed J I B E. Yep. So, uh, no, you that that that's, that's the word
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:31.960]  jive. That's the type of thing that you get when you're pals with me. And you're your ability
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.800]  to be able to tell with you determines of whether you find that endearing or just absolutely
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:41.800]  irritating. Yeah. Also, some sad news to report ends up Michael Jackson, the beer hunter died in
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:52.520]  2007. So my condolences to his family, but his, his world guide to beer. I don't know how many beers
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:56.600]  are in there. But anyway, it's not that type of book that whiskey cabinet. It's, you know, I think
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:00.920]  he's like, I like I said, probably a hundred hundred. I don't know in the book, but it's, you know,
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:05.080]  it's just a couple from each region in each style. It's too bad for Michael Jackson that he never
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:08.200]  liked, he didn't even give a single year of his life where he was the only Michael Jackson.
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:14.040]  Oh, that's right. I guess he died first. Wow. That's really a shame.
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:23.880]  I had a little bit of that with that, uh, Jonathan Reuber, economist guy. So what percentage of
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:30.760]  those tweets did you retweet? Oh, only the, I would say maybe 10% of them. Wow. So it was,
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:37.320]  you retweeted quite a few and they were all hilarious. Yeah, that was, uh, that was a real quick
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:43.560]  on and off. It was like a week long firestorm. I know if I do think I think the maker that the
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:48.200]  guy's name was Jonathan, not John. I don't know if he goes by John or what? And at first,
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:52.440]  when it first started breaking, there were an awful lot more John Gruber's and he's, you know,
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:58.120]  because he's Jonathan, he's J.O.N. So it is spelled differently, but that's certainly, I mean,
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:03.640]  you know, when you are named John, you're very sensitive to the H no H thing, but it's, you know,
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:08.280]  let's face it, you know, that's a very typical mistake, you know, like half the half the,
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:13.240]  I, well, I'd say a third of the Valentine's I got in elementary school or spelled J.O.N.
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:16.440]  A third were spelled correctly and a third were spelled J.O.N.H.
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:22.040]  I can totally sympathize because I'm, I'm Benjamin Thompson and Thompson actually has like
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:28.120]  multiple spellings like right there's the P at P no P. It's so unfair because I both have a
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:32.280]  boring name and I have to spell it all the time. Like it should be one or the other. Like if you
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:35.080]  have to spell the time, it should because you have a really kick ass name that no one's heard of
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:39.240]  before. Right. But now I have to spell all the time and then I'm just Benjamin Thompson.
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:44.680]  So, right. So somebody who does something famous or infamous named Ben Thompson with no P is
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:49.080]  not the same name as you, but you're going to get conflated. Well, I do appreciate that. My nemesis
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.080]  on Google when they always trying to be the, the top result for Ben Thompson, which I, which I am
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:59.400]  now was, um, Ben Thompson lawman. And like the top article from his bad ass of the week,
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:03.160]  I like, well, if I'm going to get confused with someone, I'll get confused with the bad ass of
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:08.280]  the week. Wow. I just noticed. I just, I haven't done this in a while. I don't know if it's true
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:13.880]  for you. For years, I, I, I even gave up on it. I was not the top search in Google for
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:20.680]  Gruber, just Gruber. It was always, uh, Gruber industries, the people, but this might be because,
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:23.880]  well, I'm not signed in. What do you get? If you search Google for Gruber?
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:29.320]  I get Daring Fireball. Huh. See, I get different. I get Twitter.com slash. If I'm not signed in,
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:33.880]  I get Jonathan Gruber, the economist. And then Daring Fireball's next and then John Gruber,
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:38.680]  Twitter. But the other thing is because, um, I mean Taiwan. So there's all that stuff that affects
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:41.320]  it. I have a VPN year, but I won't sign anything. So I'll probably mess up my connection.
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:46.600]  Yeah. I haven't searched for years. I, because I honestly don't, I don't know. I'm vain in other
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:53.400]  ways, but I'm not super, I, I, I, I, I have good enough Google juice, but, uh, Gruber.com used
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:57.400]  to come up first for years and years and years. It's some kind of industrial company down in
[1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:05.320]  Arizona who got the domain name, like in 1993, much to my certain. Yeah. I can't help it.
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:09.160]  But I've never really heard anything about them. I can't help but think that there was some
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:15.720]  kind of rearranging of Google's algorithm that they used to favor, uh, search term in the dot
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:21.640]  comp over anything else. Oh, but for years and years and years, but Gruber.com doesn't even
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:28.200]  show up in my first page. Stupid Jonathan Gruber guy. What it, what it.
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:33.000]  That guy made me so much. But anyway, the best thing that happened with that was that at some point
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.760]  during the week where he was really in the news, people who don't know, like John, he said
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:42.360]  something about like Obama care passed by because people were stupid or something like something
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:49.720]  like that. He is a world renowned economist at MIT, and especially is healthcare legislature,
[1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:55.960]  and he wrote the Massachusetts law or helped write the Massachusetts healthcare law that
[1:29:55.960 --> 1:29:59.800]  met Romney when it's this whole, you know, I don't want to get into the politics of it, but this
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:05.560]  weird situation where it was a healthcare law that gave everybody a Massachusetts universal
[1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:11.080]  healthcare coverage, uh, in a Republican style because they had a Republican governor who
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:17.560]  eventually went on to run for president. And the way that, uh, president Obama went about trying to
[1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:22.280]  get healthcare was instead of pursuing a traditionally democratic style, you know, which is a single
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:27.240]  pair, uh, single pair was like, look, I just want people to have healthcare. Let's go to the
[1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:32.600]  Republican route and, and, you know, follow the Massachusetts model and, you know, ended up being,
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:39.240]  you know, obviously it's a political hot button thing. Anyway, he was also a consultant on the
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:44.680]  national version of this law. And then years ago, this is what the weird thing about it is that
[1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:50.600]  it wasn't something he said recently, but it was like years ago at some kind of, um, uh,
[1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:54.760]  conference for other economists. So he wasn't speaking to the public had no, you know, it was
[1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:58.760]  being videotaped obviously, but you know, it wasn't, he's not a politician. It wasn't going to
[1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:06.120]  go spread wide. It was this discussion about how the word tax is just toxic in American political
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:10.360]  culture. And so to pay for the new healthcare law, they couldn't call anything they did to raise
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:16.120]  money for it attacks. And so they called it, I don't know, what a subsidy instead. There's some kind
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:23.560]  of way that through the, the, the vagaries of the way that the US Congress, uh, budget department,
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:27.080]  classifies different types of legislature. It wouldn't be called a tax. It would be called a
[1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:32.920]  subsidy, but it's a rose by any other name. It's people paying more money to a collection that would
[1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:40.760]  then be distributed to pay for the mechanics of the law. Uh, and his explanation was very, it was
[1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:46.680]  honest, but it was more or less that the, you know, American voters are too stupid to know the difference,
[1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:52.920]  you know, that calling it something else doesn't make it something else, right? Which is true,
[1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:58.360]  in a sense, but, you know, I mean in a way that, but it was taken by Republicans as an insult that
[1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:03.720]  he was, you know, that the, the law was passed under false pretenses and he became, you know,
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:10.600]  the public enemy number one of American Republicans and, and all a lot of them, uh,
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:18.280]  to that at Gruber at Gruber was because they would like, I, even if they went so far as to see
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:23.720]  what at Gruber was and then saw, it was in fact somebody named John Gruber, whether it had nature
[1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:29.480]  or not, and he had a bunch of followers, uh, they just assumed it was him. And so for about a week,
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:36.680]  I, I was inundated with vitriolic. And, and I think part of it is that you had to make a mistake
[1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:41.800]  to do that, which increased the chance that the people doing it weren't really the sharpest
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:49.640]  pencils in the case. And so I took to retreating some of them. It was, it was interesting. It was,
[1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:55.160]  you know, if you think that like the vitriol that I, I get, you know, from, let's say,
[1:32:55.160 --> 1:33:00.120]  Android fanatics when I say something disparaging about Android or something like that,
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:04.680]  if you think that's harsh, the way that the political stuff is, is just unbelievable.
[1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:09.800]  Well, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, people, I mean, just seriously saying things
[1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:16.280]  like, you know, go kill yourself at Gruber. I mean, no, no exaggeration. Uh, and I, you know,
[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:19.400]  it just occurred to me and I would write back to some of that, some of them I would retweet,
[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:23.720]  some of them I would tweak a little, and then some of them I would just write back totally honest.
[1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:27.800]  It's like, did you, you know, what were you thinking, you know, were you thinking that I would
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:32.680]  see this when you wrote it? You know, like what goes through your mind if you're doing that,
[1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:37.480]  do you, do you assume, do you think that the Jonathan Gruber was going to read that and perhaps
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:42.280]  feel bad about himself because here's somebody wishing you would kill him, like kill himself?
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:47.320]  Why, why would you write that? Like, what is going through your mind? How can you go through your
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:54.360]  day with so much hate? It was interesting to me. It's like the extreme opposite of like,
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:57.960]  we were talking about before, like the ability to like see a product through someone's eyes.
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:04.280]  It's like just a complete and utter lack of empathy. Yeah. And, you know, you go through the rest
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:09.320]  of your life like that or does this only spew out on Twitter? And then there were a few people
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:13.320]  who I tweaked. I told some people that we were, I was, we were going to next, the next step was
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:21.560]  we were going to come take your guns. Wait until next year when we come take your guns, it's
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:27.960]  a healthcare issue. They're like, I'd like to see you try and it's like we're on our way.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:33.640]  You tell some of these people you're coming to take their guns and it really rattles them up.
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:41.560]  Those are the best. Oh, anyway, that's died off for the most part. But it really elevated this
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:47.000]  guy in the Twitter rankings for Gruber though. Jeez. Anyway, but it's the best thing that happened.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:54.360]  I know it was Fox in particular. Um, it would really help to, but Fox News, it was very clear to me
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:35:00.680]  has like probably the second most interesting observer in the country that they, they, uh,
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:04.280]  there must have been a memo that circulated with, and I don't know, I don't think it had anything
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:09.960]  to do with me. I don't think it had anything to do with me. But they, they, they, they clarified on
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:15.480]  Jonathan Gruber instead of John Gruber. MIT economist, they at first, when the whole thing first broke,
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:20.280]  it was like half and half where they would spell it J-O-N or spell out the whole Jonathan in about
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:25.640]  halfway through the week. Fox started consistently calling him Jonathan Gruber and it helped a lot,
[1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:30.520]  I think. Interesting. Well, maybe, uh, you know, your friendship with, uh, with Clayton Morrison helped out
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:36.040]  there. You know, I thought about it. I actually was like at the, it's funny because I was thinking
[1:35:36.040 --> 1:35:41.320]  about it. And I was halfway thinking maybe I should write to Clayton and, and just say, you know,
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:45.240]  I know you can't do anything about this whole thing. But if you could just, you know, pass the
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:49.160]  word around to call the guy Jonathan instead of John, I would appreciate it. But I never even had to do
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:56.120]  that. It seemed like Fox, uh, it happened on its own. Much, much too, uh, the decrease in entertainment
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:01.960]  for the rest of us. Yeah. Um, only other thing I could see in the news this week was, uh, other than
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:06.360]  a big Microsoft stuff, which I do want to talk about. But, uh, did you see Mark Gurman's report on
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:12.440]  Apple Watch? Yeah. Somebody had Apple or sold them there. Yeah, which is a little weird. I
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:17.000]  thought the more interesting thing that he had was that according to Mark Gurman and it's
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.920]  unnamed source at Apple that they have 3,000 units, uh, already in use by Apple employees,
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:28.200]  although he doesn't say by Apple employees. But from what I understand, you know, I had heard a
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:32.520]  few weeks ago that there were a thousand in use. So, Gurman says 3,000. It could just be that they've
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:38.840]  expanded it. But it's all that they are all in the hands of Apple employees. Well, I mean,
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:44.920]  you, you have to think it's relatively easy to pull off. I mean, more, even more so than, than a
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:51.240]  phone. Um, I mean, I guess the, the kind of screen being black is a bit of a giveaway. But I mean,
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:56.280]  a watch, watch is a watch, especially now, I mean, I mean, California never gets particularly cold,
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:36:59.960]  but people are more like who are in long sleeves and jackets and stuff like that. It's kind of an
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:05.000]  ideal time to do it. I've thought for weeks, uh, when I heard weeks ago that there were a thousand
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.960]  of them in use, uh, I was a little surprised we haven't seen more, because I remember in the six
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:15.160]  month run up to the iPhone coming out, there were none of them leaked. It wasn't like the time
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:20.840]  the iPhone 4, you know, was found in a bar. But there were like a steady stream of, here's a,
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:25.880]  here's a blurry shot of a guy on Bart who was using an iPhone until I took out my, you know,
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.240]  camera phone to take a picture of him and then he put it back in his pocket. You know, but
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:33.960]  there were all, there were a steady stream of reports of people who had spotted Apple employees with
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:38.520]  iPhones before it came out at the end of June. And I haven't seen the single people of anybody saying,
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:42.920]  you know, I saw a guy with an Apple watch at such and such. No, that's a good point.
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:48.760]  I think it's, you know, I think it's like, you said a watch is just to, you know, especially if
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:53.400]  you're being even just a little bit circumspect about when you take it out, when you're not at work
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:58.280]  or at home, it's really, really hard to notice that somebody's got an Apple watch.
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:04.280]  That said, I mean, I, I mean, I saw someone using, using a smartwatch the other day and it was like,
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:09.320]  it was super obvious he was using a smartwatch. Uh, so maybe they're, they're just not using them
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:13.960]  in public. Maybe that's part of the, the instruction. Yeah. Well, my understanding is the
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:18.120]  instruction is your allowed to use it and take it. And if anybody even asks, they are allowed
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.640]  to say yes, it's an Apple watch. I work for Apple, but they're not allowed, certainly not allowed
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:26.040]  to take it off. And they're not allowed to do any kind of demonstration. Yeah. And they are, but
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:28.920]  but they're allowed to say, but I'm not allowed to do a demonstration. Well, that's one of the
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:34.440]  benefits of having announced it already is there's, there's nothing to hide. Right. There's nothing
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:38.600]  to hide. And, and what you see when you're not using it is all, you know, you'll get a much better
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:43.080]  view of it on apple.com than you will on somebody's wrist. It's interesting. I mean, we, I think
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:47.000]  the last time I was on, we were talking about all of the watch. Um, and it was funny because like,
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:51.560]  I have a, I have a spidey sense when you're going to bite me on the talk show. Uh, so I kind of
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:55.480]  kind of had an idea that this week was going to be one of those weeks. Um, the safety with, with
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:39:02.840]  the watch thing, uh, probably because I had to be clear. I asked you to be on about 30 seconds
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:08.760]  before we started recording. That's a, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but um, it was funny.
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:13.320]  I swear to God today. I went to the gym. I came back and I was, um, I don't know why I was thinking
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:18.440]  about it. Oh, I think I was listening to last week's episode was working out. And I was like,
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:21.960]  oh, I think I was thinking like, Oh, I actually, I thought John was going to hand me on this week,
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:26.520]  but I guess not. And then like 30 minutes later, God measures from you. I know it's a little late,
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:36.120]  but, uh, the, the uptime today. Um, but, uh, no, the, I mean, um, one thing with the watch is, uh,
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:43.400]  another program actually pretty intrigued about is the Amazon Echo like the box in your room.
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.000]  And the reason I am, and I'm actually much more intrigued by that than I ever was by the fire
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.320]  phone. And I think people kind of just dismissed out of hand because it came on the heels of the
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:57.960]  fire phone. But, um, like it sounds stupid, but the idea of just like talking to something,
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:02.280]  instead of like pulling something out of your pocket and then talking to it, or with the watch
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:06.280]  just looking at your wrist instead of pulling out your phone and looking, looking at something,
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:12.920]  like it sounds, it sounds so trivial, but like convenience always wins, right? I think we might
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:20.120]  have talked about this before, but it's, it's little conveniences add multiplied by all the times
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:26.040]  that they matter, end up being a big deal. And, uh, and it's funny, I think that Echo has gotten
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:30.280]  kind of mixed reviews, but I'm still, a lot of people, there are people who do really like it.
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.760]  And I think it's, it's because it's, it's in a similar vein to what I think the watch is going to
[1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:42.040]  be where it's, you don't kind of realize until you use it like how it just makes life a little bit
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:49.080]  less a little more frictionless. And, um, you know, it's the idea of it being the center is
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:54.840]  a long ways off just for all the technical reasons more than anything. But I think the conveniences
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:41:01.000]  always, convenience is always are easier to see backwards than forward. Yes. Yes. It's more easy to
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:07.720]  tell how much you appreciate it when it's taken away than when you first get it always, you know,
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:14.600]  and it's the same way that like, uh, uh, when you go back to an older iPhone, it makes your current
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:19.240]  iPhone feel so much faster than it felt when you first got the new iPhone. You get a new iPhone next,
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:23.640]  next generation A, whatever chip. You're like, wow, this is great. It's a lot faster. And if you
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:27.960]  put it down and take your year old old one or your two year old one, especially like a two year
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:34.680]  old one, you're like, holy shit, this is so jaggy and school. Um, uh, you know, coming out of college
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:38.440]  and you get your first apartment and it has a dishwasher and you're like, great, this is great.
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:43.400]  I love having a dishwasher. Well, when your dishwasher breaks and you don't have a dishwasher anymore,
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:48.760]  you're like, holy shit, how do I live without a dishwasher? Right? Yep. No. And I think, I think,
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:54.200]  you know, that voice could be something like that. No, I agree. And I think it's one of those
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:42:00.360]  things where if you, I mean, it's easy to look back and just like, but I really do think that
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:04.040]  people said like when the phone came out, it's like, well, I could do this, I can do this on a
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:07.480]  computer or I can do this or it was supposed to be the iPad. I think you probably saw this more
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:15.880]  than anything. Um, like little, little, making it just a little bit easier, uh, makes, uh, makes a
[1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:22.760]  really big difference. And, um, and I, I, I think that that's a good vector to look at any new
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:27.720]  product. Like, does it, does it make life just a little bit easier? And if it does, then that product
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:32.440]  probably has a chance. The thing I didn't understand about Amazon Echo when they announced it,
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:36.600]  and I, you know, they announced it and I watched their, their little video with the family,
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:42.680]  you know, using it. Uh, I didn't understand that it was going to be invitation only for some
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:47.000]  period of time. Um, Dave Whisk is actually was just telling me he was thinking about getting one,
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.760]  but it's like, you don't buy one. You can't just buy one. You go to the site and you request an
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.680]  invitation to buy one. Yeah. Uh, so I actually just in the, in the other thing is I just got,
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:59.240]  I, my request just got granted and it said it's going to ship in three to four months or something
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:05.080]  like that. Uh, I suspect like they just got burned so badly by the phone that they way,
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.200]  like they got way too conservative, like they over corrected. And it's really hard to ramp something.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:15.240]  And if you, if you, if you kind of started out with the assumption we're going to sell 100,000
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:20.840]  units or you get a million orders, like it's not just that you're behind infinite million orders,
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:26.920]  but that, that being behind kind of compounds. Yeah. So it's interesting though, I do think that,
[1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:31.640]  you know, like you said, there is something, and this is, you know, it's this,
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:37.480]  this is sort of closest to the how style interface of 2001, right? Where what was the interface
[1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:43.720]  with how on the discovery it was, you just talked to how, you know, there was no button to push,
[1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:47.640]  there was nothing. You didn't have to go and push a button to start talking to him. You just
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:52.680]  talk to him because he was always listening. No. Yeah. That's the thing. It's so when you look at
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:59.800]  any new product, you have to think it's so easy to, to, um, so made a bingo card for my podcast
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:06.200]  exponent and a notorious word I say is over index, so I'm going to use it. It's so easy to over index
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:11.480]  on what the product is today, but to evaluate, you have to think about what's this product going to
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:15.480]  be after three or four iterations. And like for example, the original Kindle, like the original
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:20.920]  Kindle was a piece of crap. And it looked terrible and it felt terrible, but like it was so obvious
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:26.040]  that this is how we're going to read books going forward, right? And once it's thin and easy to hold,
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:31.400]  and actually I think the version two Kindle was, was very good. They actually, the, there's a huge
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:36.600]  jump from one to two. But I think that, that's something with, see with the iPhone, and I think
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:40.680]  that's something with something like the Echo. And I think, I think it will be the case with the watch
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:45.320]  as well, where it's not just, you, you have to look at it not just as what it can do right now
[1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:49.080]  and what capability has right now or what battery life it has right now. You have to think about
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:55.000]  what is this going to be in five years? And can you see a path from here to there? And if that
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  path is a path that's easily understandable as in like, our chip's going to get more efficient.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:04.680]  Yes, our shoes get more efficient. Yes, our battery's going to improve not as fast as those are
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:10.040]  getting more efficient, but yes, they're going to improve. Like there's, and you, it's just like
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:12.840]  you have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of a new user. It's the same sort of thing when
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:17.560]  you look at a product, you have to, you have to be able to assimilate what you know about the way
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:21.800]  technology progresses. And that's how you evaluate a product. Not, you can't evaluate it on
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:26.760]  version one. Yeah, one of the interesting things about Echo is to me, it's the first new product
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:33.160]  from any of these companies in my memory, where battery isn't an issue because it's not battery
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:36.360]  operated. It's something you plug in. Yeah. Like when's the last time somebody's come out with
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:43.960]  something that doesn't, isn't battery operated? It's, you know, that's fascinating to me because
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:50.360]  it's, it just hasn't happened in so long. No, it's, it's a great point. Um, yeah, I think people
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:53.800]  were like joked about it. Like Amazon actually sold, tried to sell that as a feature I can plug it
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:59.480]  in. And I totally got that. Like yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's like it's your home, it's your home
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:04.920]  assistant a lot of ways. Um, I think the problem for Amazon obviously is, uh, you know, they're,
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.920]  they don't have the entire like, they don't have the mobile companion really to go with it.
[1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:14.520]  Um, which, you know, obviously the phone, you know, their phone was intended to be, I would imagine,
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:20.440]  but, uh, but still, I think, I think the concept is at least compelling. And if, if Echo is in it,
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:25.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, in five, 10 years, we all have a similar sort of device,
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:31.960]  uh, in our houses that we just talked to. Yeah, I wonder, I wonder if it's already in the works,
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:37.560]  if the, you know, whatever the next generation Apple TV is, is always listening. Uh,
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:42.360]  Xbox, you know, Microsoft's done it with Xbox for a while or, I don't know, is it okay Xbox,
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:47.000]  something like that has been a trigger for, you've been able to give vocal commands to your
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:52.120]  Xbox for a while. Yeah. I think going back to the previous Xbox, the 360. No, I mean, it's,
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:56.600]  it seems like an obvious thing for the Apple TV. I mean, man, talk about a product that's stagnated.
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:02.840]  Yeah. Well, yeah, I think that's basically I don't know if they've missed a deadline,
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:06.920]  you know, and something is slipped or what, but there's clearly something that was coming.
[1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:12.040]  I mean, at this point, I would say, I probably would have bet on something, you know, a year ago,
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:15.320]  if we had talked to year ago, I probably would have bet on some kind of new Apple TV at the end of
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:21.720]  2014. So at this point, I would call it overdue. And I kind of expect to see, or more,
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.240]  I wouldn't be shocked if we don't see it in 2015 because I, you know, maybe they've,
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:30.760]  but if we're talking a year from now and they still don't have a new, uh, like a truly new
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:35.320]  Apple TV, then then I would, at a year from now, I would think maybe they've written it off.
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:41.800]  Maybe they've, you know, abandoned. Yeah, I thought it was in 2013. So like, yeah, that's what I
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:47.880]  meant by stagnating, like, stagnating as in like the Mac Pro stagnated. Um, like, so yeah, either
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:54.200]  it's dying or it's because there's a wholesale kind of like refresh coming. They're way,
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:59.160]  yeah, they're waiting on something either piece some kind of hardware or end or software that
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:04.120]  they need to make the one they want to make and it's not ready. I don't think they're giving
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:09.240]  up on it though, because especially, I mean, I think that home kit is, is important, even though
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:15.320]  we haven't heard a ton about it. And Apple TV is pretty important to home kit. So, uh, I don't think
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:21.320]  they would do that if it was something they were giving up on. Yeah. And at the very least, even in a,
[1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:27.400]  in an Apple TV list world, you need something in your house always plugged in to make home kit
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:33.000]  really sing. And so why not just make it a thing you put in your TV, since everybody has a TV?
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.920]  Yep. Nope. Right. Like, it doesn't have to be Apple TV. It could be anything, but why not just
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:43.160]  make it Apple TV? Yeah. No, I've always thought, I mean, I've, I've, I've long thought like they're
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:49.560]  going to unify like the router and the Apple TV. And, you know, that would, I would take
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:55.640]  care of some lag issues for one for, for airplay. Um, if you, like, if the app ecosystem ends up
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:01.000]  like running off an iPhone or whatever, whatever it might be. Um, but now I love the idea that you
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.200]  perform of like, they're being an echo types type angle to it as well. I think it makes, I mean,
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:10.680]  obviously Siri would be involved in it, but having it be kind of a, an assistant that you can just
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:15.640]  talk to, I think is, is really compelling. I thought about that two years ago that why, why not
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:21.960]  combine Apple TV with, um, the airport router? So then there's only one thing to plug in. And I didn't
[1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:28.200]  think latency is even, it's just a plus. I'm just thinking, Hey, just one thing, plug this in, put
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:33.480]  your cable thing in the back, put the power plug in and you're done. Um, and then I kind of thought,
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:38.680]  ooh, maybe not when I got the latest generation airport, which was so much bigger. Right. But,
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:43.880]  I think, I mean, I think that, but that has, that has the, that's an actual router like an
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:50.040]  has multiple ports and stuff like that. Um, I think the airport express is probably a, a fuller
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:54.600]  expression of like Apple's ideal router in a lot of ways. Well, my understanding is that the reason
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:50:01.480]  that the new airport extremist, so tall is that it was it, and who knows, you know, who knows how
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:06.600]  long it was in the works, you know, with Steve Jobs being gone, but it was just purely engineering
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:11.960]  that having antennas that are up bigger antennas that are up just is big part of why it gets
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:16.840]  better reception to your house. No, I, whereas deal, whereas the older ones that were so much smaller,
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:20.520]  we're always constrained in terms of the energy, you know, the power of their intent. Right,
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:24.680]  because like the super like long range ones have like actual antennas that like stick up.
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:30.200]  So that makes sense. It's a little bit more of a practical design than a, you know,
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:36.920]  it's, it's function over form. But I don't know, it might be a hard sell when all the other boxes
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:42.120]  are so small and the old Apple TV was so small to say your new Apple TV is, you know, 10 times.
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:46.680]  Yeah, that's a good point. I don't know, but, you know, but on the other hand, hey, just plug
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:53.640]  this one thing in and you're done is is compelling. Um, what was the other thing? So german's
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:59.080]  other thing was all about how the battery sucks on Apple watch. Uh, but I see to me, that's
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:02.840]  like no surprise. Of course it does. All right. Of course that's the biggest thing that that's
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:08.440]  holding them up. I mean, I, you know, I don't really need sources to tell you that. Yeah, I mean,
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:15.880]  it's going to, the thing I've always kind of maintained about the, about about the watches,
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:23.240]  20, it just has to get you through the day. And the funk, the way to address battery life is
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:27.800]  not to make like week, long battery life or month, long battery life. It's to make battery life that
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:31.880]  it's to make the functionality so great that you're willing to put up with charging it all the
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:35.800]  time. And that, like that's what they do with the phone, right? The iPhone, iPhone, battery,
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:42.280]  life relative to our old phones is still drastically worse than it was before. But we don't care
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:48.440]  about that because the functionality is so superior that we put up with charging it like it's
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:53.160]  assumed that we're going to carry, like you go around, like you can go to any shopping mall here
[1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:57.400]  and there's lockers when you walk in the door where you can pay to plug in your phone. And
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:01.880]  like, you know, you can go shopping and go back to your phone. It'll be charged. Like that's,
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:06.360]  if you kind of think about it, that's kind of crazy, but it's, it's not crazy anymore because
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:11.640]  that's, of course, why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you, no one's going to give up functionality to get
[1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:16.360]  better battery life today. That's just the way it is. Right. Every, every time an airport is a new
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:21.960]  terminal is added or a terminal is, is refurbished. It's always, you know, a huge factor is,
[1:52:21.960 --> 1:52:30.040]  you know, getting power outlets to, to, to more people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's so fresh
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:33.160]  to go to an airport with no power outlets. And then, yeah, people are like huddled around,
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:38.440]  like, we'll never always are there. It's it, you know, it's like, it's nobody had the idea,
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:43.960]  but it's a just, you know, a dystopian science fiction future come to life where, you know, everybody
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:47.640]  waits around sucking up power. Yeah. There's, there's like rows of seats and notes in there,
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:51.960]  I would say on the floor on like the one pillar that has like outlets with it. Right.
[1:52:53.160 --> 1:52:55.880]  It's interesting because I've eventually that'll happen though, because you remember,
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:53:02.200]  and I know Jason Snow has written about this lately where clearly Apple has these target numbers in
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:09.400]  mind like X number of hours for an iPhone and 10 hours battery life for an iPad. And they stick to them.
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:16.600]  And with the iPad in particular, like it's been dead solid every single iPad. And they have that
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:21.240]  number in their head. And then they just keep making the devices as thin as they possibly can walk
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:26.680]  hitting that number, you know, and it's every single year when iPhones come out or every other year
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:31.080]  when a new generation comes out and it's so much thinner. There's a decent chunk of people who have,
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:35.080]  you know, personally have different sets of priorities who say, why couldn't they just make it as
[1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:39.720]  thick as the last one, which was plenty thin and just give me more battery life. But eventually
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:43.880]  that's going to happen because it happened with laptops, laptops, MacBooks, Powerbooks,
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:48.680]  or everyone to call them got like three to four hours of battery life year after year after year
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:55.720]  after year after year. And then all of a sudden, boom, you know, it's shot up to seven, eight, nine
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:59.800]  hours of battery life. And eventually that'll happen with phones, like eventually we'll have an
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:05.000]  iPhone that instead of getting thinner instead gives you like you go two or three days without
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:12.200]  plugging. Yeah, well, I mean, I obviously I'm I'm not a the right person to measure this because I
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:19.880]  work from home. But the iPhone 6, my favorite feature, even more than than having a larger screen is
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:25.240]  that I never worry about battery life anymore. Again, like I probably haven't plugged in more than
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:29.640]  most people and I've heard from people that yeah, it's still not good enough. But for me anyway,
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:35.160]  like it's it's crossed that line compared to the 5S, which if I was always worried about it.
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:41.640]  Yeah, no, I've, you know, going to Disney World is a good test for me because it used to
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:47.640]  root, you know, I'd need my mofi to get through a day. And I don't anymore. Yep. Or any kind of
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:51.800]  travel day, any kind of day where I'm, you know, in an airport and going somewhere and doing
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:57.720]  all of my computing from the phone, uh, always used to need a mofi and I don't generally anymore.
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:04.600]  The other thing, I mean, I think is more german's reporting 2.5 to four hours of active application
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:11.160]  use. I've that seems pretty good to me. I mean, I, yeah, I think that's all it's interesting
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:14.440]  because I'm sure that those, you know, he's got great sources and I'm sure they're real numbers,
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:19.400]  but I, I feel like it's, it's hard to think about that as a user because for me,
[1:55:19.400 --> 1:55:22.600]  user perspective, you're not going to think about stuff like that. And in particular,
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:25.000]  the other one he called out, I agree. I think that's actually pretty good.
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.240]  Considering how I think we'll be using these things, the other one was the time telling and the
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:37.560]  time telling as I understand it, I've heard from people is, um, so the watch is off most of the
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:42.680]  time or the, the, the face is off most of the time. And it has to be because it's, you know,
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:47.400]  I, I, we don't know yet whether it's OLED or LCD. I think it might be some kind of OLED though
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:54.760]  because they're using black as the background instead of white. Um, but regardless, any kind of color
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:56:01.960]  screen like that, whatever the technology is, you know, the, the biggest power sink that you're
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:08.760]  going to have on the device. So it's off most of the time. Um, my understanding is that they've put
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:13.720]  like inordinate, like a huge chunk, the whole three year long effort, there've been teams
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:21.320]  devoted to it or an A team devoted to it is that when you twist your wrist to look at the time,
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:27.160]  it is already, you know, it turns on like the detection of this is the type of motion of a person
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:34.760]  checking the time is like an A1 priority for the thing and that apparently it works already works
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:40.360]  really, really well. It's very, very smart about turning on when you want to look at it. Um,
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:46.360]  but then when you turn your wrist back, it goes off again. So it, it's, I forget how long it said
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:50.520]  it was like three hours, like the watch last three hours of continuous telling the time or something
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:55.160]  like that. Yeah, the, the only thing with the, the only thing with that is I think this is the one thing
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:57:02.360]  that really kind of detracts from the, uh, watch as fashion accessory thing. Well, because the, the,
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:09.960]  I mean, the face of a watch is, is super important to it. Being a fashion accessory, like they
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:16.600]  can have beautiful bands, they can have a beautiful case, but if it's just a black box, um, it's
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:20.840]  that that that is an area where I mean, if they were ever to get to a point where they could
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:27.400]  actually have those watch faces on all the time, I think that would be a, that would be a,
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:32.120]  a big deal just from, from, I mean, we're, yeah, if they could do it, they would, but they
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:35.960]  yeah, we're, we're, we're watching our pajamas podcasting, we're, I don't think we're fashion experts,
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:40.520]  but I do think, yeah, that, that will be, when and if they can get to that point, I think that
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:46.280]  will be, that will be a big deal. Right, but it's definitely in this, you know, you know,
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:51.320]  they're Apple clearly is going way more as this is a watch watch and we're, you know, we were
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.800]  going right up against any watch brand you want than anybody else in the smart watch game,
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.200]  but clearly one of the areas where they just can't compete is the fact like you said that the
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:06.360]  face is black, you know, and, and whatever choice you make in terms of which style of, of the many
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:11.720]  that they offer from for, for your watch style has no bearing on what other people see when they
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:17.400]  see it on your right, right. You know, the guy across from you in the aisle on the train,
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:20.840]  who's not moving his wrist or checking the time, all you see is that he has an Apple watch, you
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:27.160]  have no idea what face is on that said, and that's definitely a factor. There's, there's no getting
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:33.000]  around what's interesting is at least for at the beginning before they are, you know,
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:38.040]  obviously Apple would like them to be as widespread as phones, but if you think back when the phone,
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:44.280]  iPhone first came out, like it was, it said something that you had an iPhone, it was, it was obviously
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:49.400]  that you had one and there weren't very many people that had one. And so it's almost like it's not
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:55.240]  that big a deal at the beginning because just seeing that, that black square will be meaningful
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:01.960]  enough. Whereas once in, in, in ideally once they get to the point, if they're successful and
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:07.320]  they become ubiquitous, that by that point their power management will also be to the point where
[1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:13.160]  they can be fully customized and on all the time and fully fulfill that kind of like
[1:59:15.240 --> 1:59:21.720]  personal personalized fashion angle. Yeah. Yeah, I read it so much so much as how much time
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.280]  how much it can tell the time, but how much how long the screen can be on. So if it can be on for
[1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:32.280]  three hours, that sounds pretty good because it doesn't seem to me like you would, it doesn't seem
[1:59:32.280 --> 1:59:36.440]  like, how could you spend more than three hours looking at the little thing? Right, exactly.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.680]  I mean, if you're, if you're going to be interacting with that long, you might as well take out your
[1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:51.240]  phone. Right. Um, 3000 users. So I wonder how, I wonder if that's right. It seems like a lot,
[1:59:51.240 --> 1:59:57.880]  but again, a lot for it not to elite, but on the other hand, maybe it's a lot easier to conceal.
[2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:06.280]  It'll be interesting. It's soon. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about that? German said that
[2:00:07.880 --> 2:00:13.960]  it's still on pace to ship at the end of March. I, it seems reasonable. I, like, I suspect
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:20.040]  they were shooting for February. Um, you know, just, maybe for the Chinese market like China
[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:27.480]  is a super late this year, people get cash for Chinese New Year. Um, but, uh, so I, it fits with a,
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:31.960]  well, let's shoot for this. Um, well, it didn't quite make it, but it's still, it's still early in the
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:38.280]  year. Um, you know, I don't, I don't think, uh, I would, I would, you know, of course, you know,
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:42.200]  Mark German is number one at pointing out that Tim Coak said every product's released throughout
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:46.760]  2014 and they didn't release anything until the second half of the year. Um, but that said,
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:52.520]  I think that, uh, you wouldn't drop a date lightly. Right. Yeah. I don't know. I've still
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:57.080]  think March is, I'll be impressive. It ships by March because I don't, my impression from the few
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:01.640]  people I second hand, all second hand, no firsthand information from everybody who's wearing one,
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:06.280]  but secondhand information and no people who are wearing them is that they're still buggy enough
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:11.960]  and have poor enough battery life that March would be an achievement. Because they're out,
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:16.440]  you know, if, if it's too buggy and too, your battery life is too bad, there's, you know,
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:21.080]  it's not going to come out in March. You know, they're, they have the wiggle room to push it
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:27.240]  until April or May or even June. Uh, like June will give, you know, people will roll their eyes
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:33.720]  because that's about as late as early 2015 can be. Um, but they, you know, they have that wiggle.
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:38.520]  Right. And in first impressions will matter. Right. It would be better to have people complaining that
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:45.400]  June is pretty damn late for early. To that, you know, quote unquote early 2015, then to ship it in
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:52.520]  March just to hit the first quarter and, you know, have it be riddled with bugs or not make it
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:58.520]  through the day. Um, what was the other thing? Do you know, I can't, I made a note here when
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:03.000]  you were talking about it. Can't talk about the fire phone without talking about Austin cars.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.200]  It's not new. I guess it was a sometime in the last month his fast company piece on the making
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:14.040]  of a fire phone. Surely you read it. I was good in it. Um, yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right.
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:18.040]  I remember that. I, that's actually one of the things that I was like, Oh, I should, I should get
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:23.000]  Ben on the show this week. I actually remember that. It was it. I thought it was a tremendous piece
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:27.480]  of Oh, yeah. I mean, he talked to a lot of people. Um, and, and got, you know, a lot of inside
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:31.720]  people at that point, what 26 that it was definitely very compelling. And if you haven't read it,
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:36.040]  you should, I'll link it in the show. So I actually want to link it on Darren. It'll be linked on
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:41.160]  Darren Firewall in between us recording and, and, uh, the show airing, but I'll put it in the show
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:46.440]  notes too, but it's just a tremendous piece of reporting and rather scathing. It's interesting
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:55.880]  because, um, the, the one, he talked about like Amazon not being focused. Uh, and that's a comic
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:03:00.840]  critique that any Apple fan will have about Amazon. Um, but actually when I told him this when I
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:07.960]  talked to him, um, Amazon is not that kind of company. Like Amazon is in many respects the
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:15.160]  anti Apple or the Bizarro Apple. Like the, the way the company works internally is it's a lot of
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:19.240]  companies. Some of them are mature companies that throw off cash and some of them are startups that
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:25.640]  devour cash. And because they're under one roof, uh, that money can be funneled from the ones
[2:03:25.640 --> 2:03:30.520]  throwing off money to the ones that need it. And, and, and so there are lots of groups that, that,
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:34.120]  that kind of start. And so you go to Amazon.com and it's like one website, but actually,
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:39.800]  like there's the clothing section and there is the, the car section. And like all these are
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:44.920]  within Amazon, completely separate groups. And they have their own, they have their own procurement
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:50.520]  managers, they have their own marketing managers, they have their own, uh, you know, their own
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:57.000]  P&Ls. It's like it's the exact opposite structure from the way Apple is set up. And it's meant to
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:03.720]  almost be like a self incubator in a lot of ways. And so from that perspective, uh, to say that
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.840]  Amazon is doing this, like the phone can fit in that. And actually almost, if you look at it this
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:12.600]  way and that if you accept that this is the way Amazon is, and that's the way they're going to
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:18.920]  operate, my critique of the phone and what I took away from that reporting is that Jeff Bezos,
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:26.440]  in particular, was too focused on the phone. And like he, he got too obsessed with it and didn't let
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:33.000]  it kind of breathe and go through a natural sort of like startup process. And that more than
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:38.440]  anything was, was a, and he's, he got a blind spot about like the viability of this product,
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:43.960]  which, which I mean, everyone was kind of new was a lot of us were saying there was no point
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:47.000]  to it before they even announced it. And what's saying now it's like, what, you know, what,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:54.120]  this makes no sense. Um, what it's, it's a cautionary tale. I think in that you get so wrapped up in
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:05:01.240]  something you, you lose all perspective. Well, that gets back to my argument earlier in a show with
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:07.560]  forced all and the ability to look at it like an interface and say, you know what, we put a lot of
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:11.960]  effort in this, but this is crap. We need to scrap this, right? You get too close to it and you lose,
[2:05:11.960 --> 2:05:17.400]  yeah, it's, to me, it's the same type of thing that you can, I can see how it happened, you know,
[2:05:17.400 --> 2:05:22.200]  because I know that's just human nature. But I mean, just the big point of it is that all this
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:28.120]  emphasis and it came from Bezos directly was on this 3D, whatever they call it, you know, the camera
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:34.520]  centers on the front to make a face that you don't need glasses for on the screen. Um,
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:43.160]  and the, the on within the team, there was some, you know, it's a neat trick. It's a neat idea,
[2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:47.240]  but what in the world, how in the world is it a selling point? What is the actual purpose of this?
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:53.960]  And yet Bezos got hung up on it and thought it would be the selling point. And it certainly
[2:05:53.960 --> 2:05:57.960]  was the selling point in the initial marketing. The marketing was all about this 3D effect.
[2:05:58.680 --> 2:06:03.320]  And then in reality, it turned out exactly what the naysayers on the team had thought,
[2:06:03.320 --> 2:06:07.320]  which is nobody sees the point of it. Yeah, that's, that's the one differentiation. It's not just
[2:06:07.320 --> 2:06:12.520]  having a unique feature. It's actually making a difference in customers lives in the way that
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:18.200]  another product cannot. Right. It actually isn't, it didn't make it a better device. And that's
[2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:25.400]  the whole problem. Uh, and yet it also made it something that was expensive because it was a high
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:29.800]  end phone. It was a premium phone, you know that, and I, this is the part where I disagree with
[2:06:29.800 --> 2:06:33.400]  cars and houses. The reporting is interesting that there was, that there were people within the
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:38.440]  team who set all along. I don't see the point of this. It's, it's just, you know, it's, it's pure
[2:06:38.440 --> 2:06:45.880]  gimmickry and no utility. Um, and they were right. And then, and then without it, then the fire
[2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:49.320]  phone was left with nothing compelling because the other stuff that it has, none of it was best
[2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:53.480]  of breed, doesn't have the best apps, doesn't have the best ecosystem. Well, you know, there was
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:58.040]  nothing else about the device that was, that was worth hanging your hat on. The only thing they had
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:03.640]  to hang their hat on was the 3D effect and the 3D effect was pointless. But Bezos was all caught up
[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:08.600]  in it for like, well, well over here, you saw that in the keynote too. Like the keynote was so long
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:13.400]  and it was so self-absorbed. I actually wrote this at the time, like I thought I found the keynote
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:21.800]  very distressing, not just just because it was, it was, it, it reeked of hubris and, and basically
[2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:28.280]  this, this article said, yeah, that's basically exactly it. Yeah. And so there, I agree. And I
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:33.240]  get spot on where I disagree and the article several times touches on it. And I think you can
[2:07:33.240 --> 2:07:37.320]  kind of see car goes along with it. He has sources saying it too. So it's not just cars,
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:42.920]  the writer projecting it, but it's the idea that the whole idea of a high end phone from Amazon
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:47.720]  is contrary to their brand and doomed from the start. That this idea that they can make a phone
[2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:52.040]  that competes with Apple was a terrible idea because Apple competes on branding and design.
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:56.280]  And Amazon is just low end prices. And so if Amazon wanted to do a phone, it should have been a,
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:08:01.400]  you know, some piece of junk that was super cheap. And I disagree with that. I disagree with
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:08.520]  that entirely because, I mean, what was the one quote there, it was like, there was a branding issue,
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:13.160]  you know, is the quote from one of the sources that he had. I really disagree with that. And
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:18.040]  it's to me, it's like, it's to me, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of what branding and
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:22.680]  marketing are about. To me, branding and marketing always come from, eventually, from the actual
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:29.800]  quality of the products or services, wherever it is themselves. And so sure, it is a little bit
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:35.400]  outside of Amazon's expected brand to ship a high end, you know, phone that competes with the
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:40.760]  iPhone and quality. And maybe some people wouldn't have gotten that right away. But the problem
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:45.560]  isn't that it, that the fire phone was outside Amazon's brand. The problem is the fire phone was
[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:50.680]  a crappy phone. And so therefore, it's not, it's the product that all comes from the product. The
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:55.160]  product was a piece of crap that no one wanted to buy and that was poorly reviewed. If it actually
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:00.200]  had been a really good phone, if it had been something that was compelling, it may not have been
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:04.120]  a smash hit right away. But at least would have fit with the brand they were trying to do. And
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:08.280]  then they could iterate for two or three years and eventually it might catch on. But it all comes
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:13.880]  from the product itself. It had to be a good thing. No, I think, I think that's right. The other
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:20.360]  thing too is if you step back and look at the e-commerce market, Amazon is a high-end brand. And
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:25.880]  they're a high-end brand because their number one proposition is selection and convenience. Yes,
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:31.960]  they push price. But you see a brand like Jet.com is like the former diapers.com CEO is like
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:36.600]  launching a new thing. It's like a Costco model basically, where you pay membership fee. And then
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:42.840]  they will give you their margin effectively. And they'll think there's all these rules and it's
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:47.240]  convoluted and it takes longer to get your stuff. And there's all weird ways to get discounts,
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:51.800]  use a debit card is cheaper. It's a pain in the ass and it sounds awful to me. Like I would not
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:58.360]  want to use it. But I am the sort of person that is willing to pay for convenience, for a guaranteed
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.680]  to day delivery, for going to one place and get what I want. I don't want a price compare. I don't
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:08.360]  want to jump through hoops to get a little price. But there are people who do. And I don't think
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:16.760]  Amazon ultimately, when push comes to shove, I think they will prove out to be more of a high-end
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:21.560]  offer. Another another interesting e-commerce app is Wish. Wish is a mobile app where you can
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:27.720]  basically buy stuff from China. And it's really cheap and it's sometimes it's crap and it's sometimes
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:32.120]  it takes like two weeks to arrive and sometimes it doesn't arrive like it's but it's super cheap
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:38.600]  and it's like interesting stuff. And it's exploding. And it's a very different proposition than Amazon.
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:43.640]  And I think we will look back at the e-commerce industry as a whole. And Amazon actually is going to
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:49.640]  be Amazon's primarily in rich countries and it's used, I think primarily by relatively rich people.
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:54.120]  And so not only are you right that the phone is crap and that was the biggest problem. And if
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:58.200]  they made a good phone, it would accrue to their brand. But I actually think the characterization of
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:05.000]  their brand was wrong as well. Yeah, I kind of agree with that too. And I think especially when
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:11.160]  you're getting into a new initiative, you've kind of got a blank slate in terms of establishing
[2:11:11.160 --> 2:11:16.920]  the brand, right? I mean, like think about the Kindle, what you said was a hit right from the start.
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  Well, as long as I wasn't known for making their own products at all period, they'd never done it
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:28.600]  before. It was the first gadget they made. And, you know, they defined the brand by the fact that
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:35.000]  it was a product that made people who were voracious readers very happy, right? It's the Kindle,
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:40.200]  as at least as an e-reader, is I think a very well-perceived brand and is, you know,
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:45.640]  sits atop the e-reader market. I mean, and I have all sorts of little niggling complaints about
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:54.840]  the design of the devices. God, I would love to see Amazon poach some Apple engineers and let them
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:12:03.400]  have at the Kindle e-ink hardware for a year or two. But overall, it's, you know, I admit them,
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:08.440]  all my complaints are more or less niggling. And that the basic gist of it's this magic box that
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:11.880]  you can just read and read and read and read forever. And when you get to the end of the book,
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:19.400]  you're 15 seconds away from putting another book on it. It all just worked. And the brand for
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:24.200]  the Kindle, it didn't really matter what Amazon's brand was before. The brand for Kindle was defined
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:28.440]  by the experience of using a Kindle, you know, and that's why it's a good brand. And if the phone had
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:32.840]  actually been compelling in some kind of profound way, then the fire phone would have had a good
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:39.960]  brand. And again, it might take years for it to really catch on. Traction is a weird, you know,
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:49.640]  is a weird thing. But I really don't think that the brand is defined by the products. It's not
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:55.720]  the other way around. The thing is, like, I mean, the era of differentiating on the OS layer
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:04.840]  is over. Like, it's iOS and Android. And the thing is, like, Amazon has lots of pieces to do
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:11.960]  interesting, to do interesting stuff. You know, like, like the most compelling thing in the
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:16.360]  presentation was like the Firefly, you know, application where it identifies stuff and you could
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:22.120]  put in your card or you could buy it or whatever. Like, that, that, that fits Amazon. Now, I think
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:29.080]  Amazon, you know, I think the whole endeavor was, was a bit misguided. They would have been better
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:35.160]  off, they would have been better off focusing on the Amazon app on on iOS and Android. But if they,
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:39.240]  if they felt that was the right way to go, like, that should have been the central point. And
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:43.160]  the reason should have been central point is because that's where Amazon can actually bring
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:47.080]  what they have to bear to create something truly unique. That's, that's really compelling.
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:51.160]  Yeah. So what do you think the, what do you think they're going to do? That's one thing I didn't
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:55.240]  really get out of the car articles. What are they going to do going forward? Is this such a disaster
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:14:00.680]  that they're done making phones? Or are they going to stick with it and do a fire phone too? I honestly,
[2:14:00.680 --> 2:14:05.000]  I thought that was the most surprising thing that he is so well sourced to get the story that he got,
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:08.360]  but it doesn't have anything about what their future plans are. I don't know. It's a really
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:15.480]  interesting question. I mean, I mean, I mean, it was a huge flop. I mean, it was, uh, I, what was the,
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:19.240]  I think it was, they only sold like 10,000 phones or something like that. At least until they'd
[2:14:19.240 --> 2:14:23.000]  radically cut the price and we're selling. Yeah, like eight or until they write off or something like that.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:28.120]  Yeah. I mean, a huge write off. I mean, what's it? Eight hundred million. I know it was hundreds
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:33.720]  of millions. But all the 170 million, sorry, I was confusing with the surface. Um, yeah. Yeah.
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:40.920]  Yeah. So even so, that's an awful, that's an awful lot. I mean, it was, and it's clearly,
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:44.520]  internally, they had projections that were a lot higher. Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah.
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:52.200]  It wasn't a mild disappointment. It was a profound disappointment. So I don't know. What do you think
[2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:57.400]  they're going to do? I honestly can't guess because it's, they're, they're a tenacious company
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:03.560]  and Bezos strikes me as somewhat stubborn. But on the other hand, man, it was such a turd
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:08.920]  of a, of a, you know, market failure. I think that they,
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:18.920]  I, like I said, I think that trying to really build out a, a third platform
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:26.120]  is, is a bad idea. And like, and it's really a second and a half platform. Right. Bip.
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:29.880]  I don't know. It doesn't make it any easier, right? It's like, there's Windows Phone,
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:35.240]  which is trying to be a third platform. And it's all new UI, all new APIs, even in a different
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:42.520]  programming language. And Amazon phone is certainly, you know, it's mostly Android, right? And it's
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:46.840]  the same language at least. And, you know, games and stuff like that. I think you can pretty much
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:51.480]  just submit to their store and they just run, but still it's, yeah. Basically, if anytime you make
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:58.760]  like a location API call or anything involving the store APIs, anything like that uses Google services,
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:03.800]  you have to go in and change. And it's, it's in the grand scheme of things, a simple change,
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:09.320]  but it gets back to like the convenience factor, right? You're like, one developer has to actually
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:18.120]  do it and which they have other stuff to do. And two, they have to support it. And it's one like
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:23.640]  that barrier. And like I've, I've done developer work, working with developers before, like those,
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:27.880]  those little barriers that seem, especially to someone trying to create a new platform. Oh, it's not
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:33.480]  that big a deal. You only have to do X. It is a big deal. And it's a lot bigger deal than you
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:37.720]  appreciate. And it's a bigger deal, not just for the big guys that you talked to before the long
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:43.560]  tail of, of developers that, you know, that are out there. Um, you know, if, well, the other thing,
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:47.960]  the other thing too is that strategically, that's exactly where Google has sort of short up and
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:54.120]  protected and, you know, not to get political, but closed Android is by putting more and more stuff
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:17:00.360]  in the Google service. Absolutely. And lesson, you know, and actually taking stuff out of the
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:05.400]  Android, you know, and the part that's called Android is open and the part that's Google services
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:10.200]  is completely closed. Uh, and, you know, even just little things like the way that they've stopped
[2:17:10.200 --> 2:17:15.400]  development of the web browser on the Android side. And they've only officially now develop
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:22.360]  Chrome, but that's part of Google services. Yep. No, it rightly so because that, that is the
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:30.440]  bulwark. Like it is the app store that, uh, prevents like they're being, uh, viable alternatives,
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:35.800]  you know, with the exception of China, uh, which has multiple app stores, but that's like that's,
[2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:39.480]  that's now the expectation for customers in China, like you just go get different app stores and
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:42.600]  people have multiple apps or something in their phone. That's not the expectation anywhere else in
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:50.200]  the world. And it's an expectation that is so cemented that I, I generally believe, uh, an alternative
[2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:55.400]  isn't, isn't, isn't a viable, isn't a viable thing. And that's why what's more compelling and
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:18:02.680]  interesting to me is, is what's going to be built on top of iOS or Android. Uh, and, and that's
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:08.440]  where I think Amazon should, Amazon should be, that's where their efforts should be focused on.
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:15.000]  Again, this is balanced with like this is such a problem for companies is companies get so wrapped
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:22.680]  up in what like you can make a good argument strategically why it's important for Amazon to own
[2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:27.400]  their phone. And it's really easy to just kind of ignore the part of like it actually happening.
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:30.840]  It's like the, um, you know, like question more question more question more profit,
[2:18:30.840 --> 2:18:33.960]  it's like question more question more question more question more we have a platform like, but,
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:39.720]  but, but, um, I mean with like Windows or with Amazon, like, who's taking Windows before in
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:45.080]  particular, like people are like, oh, Microsoft just needs to get developers. The problem is
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:50.680]  Microsoft's not the one making that decision. The developers are Microsoft has zero control over
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:59.720]  what they do or don't do. And, and that's, and if you're, if, if a key to your plan depends on
[2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:05.320]  independent third party actors who are like wildly disparate and like you can't touch it and
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:11.640]  all of them, uh, making a decision. That's not a very good strategic plan. Even if from a big
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:16.600]  picture, it seems obvious why I should do that. And I use, and you see this company's tripping
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:23.320]  up on this again and again just just like skipping over that one detail that actually will sink
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:29.960]  the whole thing. Yep. Totally agree. Um, let me take one last break here and thank our third
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:37.800]  and final sponsor of the show. And it is our very good friends at igloo igloo is the internet
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:43.960]  you'll actually like it's easy to use. It's built with all sorts of apps that are built right
[2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:50.680]  into the system shared calendars, Twitter like micro blogs, file sharing, task management,
[2:19:50.680 --> 2:19:55.880]  and more. It's everything you need for a small team or bigger team to work together in one
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:20:05.000]  very configurable cloud platform. Um, how do you use it on mobile? Easy. Everything on igloo is
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:10.760]  built with responsive design. So your internet already works like a champ on virtually any device,
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:16.920]  uh, you name it iOS Android, even modern blackberry. Um, anything with web kit or a web kit
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:22.600]  like browser, it's going to work great. And it's going to be perfectly sized. Uh, everything works
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:28.280]  great because it's all mobile web stuff all scales perfectly for the new iPhone plus iPhone six
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:35.160]  right from the start. You can review documents. You can post project updates. Uh, you can change
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:43.400]  administrative settings, talk about, um, uh, anything related to your team all from your phone
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:48.440]  exactly the same as you do from the desktop. Anything you can do in igloo, you can do from mobile
[2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:55.000]  really, really they take it super seriously and it really looks and works great. Um, their file
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:21:03.400]  preview engine is fully HTML five compatible. So, um, anything that you can look at in the regular
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:14.760]  version of into, uh, uh, igloo will render perfectly on your device. Um, this past June last summer,
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:21.160]  um, Gartner released their fame magic quadrant for social software in the workplace paper.
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:25.720]  Now this is, you know, you hear Gartner and your eyes start rolling over and whatever. Well,
[2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:34.920]  and in, in, uh, enterprise market enterprise, I see I'm so far out of it. I couldn't even
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:38.760]  think of it. In the enterprise market, Gartner's a big deal. This is the thing that Gartner puts
[2:21:38.760 --> 2:21:45.080]  out for the enterprise, um, where they just rate all the different types of intranets that are
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:49.880]  out there. And for the six consecutive year igloo, tiny little igloo, the upstart is listed right
[2:21:49.880 --> 2:21:58.040]  there along giants like Microsoft, IBM, uh, Google, VMware, Salesforce, SAP, um, right up with
[2:21:58.040 --> 2:22:02.280]  those guys. And in a report that values the size of the vendor in Gartner's terms, that's called
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:08.280]  viability. igloo is praised for their responsiveness and customer support. You call igloo and you need
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:13.960]  help. Guess what? You get igloo and you get help. Uh, here's, here's right from the Gartner report.
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:18.680]  Feedback from igloo's reference customers was consistently positive. They praised the products
[2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:25.160]  quick deployment, configuration and customization, flexibility with self service options for
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:31.960]  non technical users, control over branding and information organization and ease of use. They
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:37.400]  also praised the responsiveness of igloo as an organization. In other words, translated to
[2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:41.160]  plain English, what Gartner is saying is what I've been saying on these sponsorships for a while
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:45.240]  is all true. It's easy to use. You don't have to be a technical expert. You can configure it yourself
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:52.360]  uh, and set it up just the way you need it for your team to use. Uh, and same as always, this is
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:55.480]  the most amazing part about igloo. Here's the thing. It sounds good to you and you think, well,
[2:22:55.480 --> 2:23:02.120]  what do you got to do? Easy. Just go there, sign up and for up to 10 people, it's just totally free.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:06.280]  So if you have a team that's like 10 people or under, you can just use igloo for free in
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:11.320]  perpetuity and not worry about it. If you have a bigger team, you can put 10 people together to try it
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:16.760]  out. See if it meets your needs before you pay a nickel before you give them a credit card or
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:22.680]  anything like that. All you do is go there, sign up and start using it and see for yourself.
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:27.000]  So here's the special URL. It's got a code. Uh, so they'll know you came from the show. It's
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:35.080]  igloo software dot com slash the talk show igloo software dot com slash the talk show. If you've
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:41.160]  got a team and you have, uh, collaborate, you're not happy with the way you guys are collaborating,
[2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:48.760]  check out igloo. It is really, really good stuff. My thanks to them. Um, so last but not least,
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:55.960]  big week for Microsoft. Yeah, definitely. So they had a big event in up in Redmond. Uh,
[2:23:56.840 --> 2:24:00.760]  I guess it was sensibly just for Windows 10, but Windows 10 was really just part of it.
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:07.640]  Well, I think that's, I mean, that's, it's a shame, I think, because, uh, everyone is talking
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:12.840]  about this project, whole lens and no one is talking about what the event was supposed to be
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:17.160]  about, which is one problematic. And two, it's particularly problematic because I thought the,
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:20.280]  the, the part that the event was actually about was actually pretty compelling.
[2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:25.880]  Yeah, I thought so too. I watched live, uh, and catch the whole thing, but I watched most of it.
[2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:29.480]  I watched close to two hours of it. I forget I missed a little bit at the beginning of the
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:34.920]  Windows 10, but I had the exact same thought. I was like watching the Windows 10 stuff. And I was like,
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:40.520]  I'm pretty impressed. This is pretty intriguing. I like where they're going with this one operating
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:45.880]  system thing. And, you know, the demos were good. And they even was funny because Microsoft,
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:51.560]  I think is notorious for having demos fail during the awards. And, and they promised, look,
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:55.560]  this stuff is all early. There's going to be a lot of bugs in these demos. And I thought every demo
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:59.480]  was seamless, which was funny because they warned that they were going to be buggy and they weren't.
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:04.280]  And then I thought it was wrapped up. I was like, that was a hell of an event. And then it just
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:09.240]  kept going. And I was like, wow, I can't believe they're mixing these things together. And on the
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:12.680]  other hand, I see how somebody else would say, well, doesn't Apple do the same thing where they
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:18.520]  announced these two phones and their big deal and, you know, you know, flagship products of the
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:24.520]  company. And then at the same event, they did Apple pay an Apple watch, you know, and released the
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:29.160]  preview of this device, which isn't coming out yet, which is exactly, you know, the HoloLens isn't
[2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:36.360]  coming out yet. But there's something about it to me was, it was less well-proportioned in Microsoft
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.120]  event where HoloLens distracted heavily from every. Well, it's funny, we last time I was on, we
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:47.560]  talked about the fact that the iPhone never kind of got it stay in the sun. Yeah, well, I think,
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:51.720]  I think, well, here's the, in broad terms, I think one factor of that is that the iPhone 6 and
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:56.600]  iPhone 6 Plus, I think, by all accounts, and it's next week where we're going to get Apple's
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:01.640]  quarterly finances, and everybody is expecting to be gangbusters. And I think they're going to exceed
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:07.480]  expectations. I think so too, all the evidence we can see and that the cues we can get, you know,
[2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:11.800]  is that, you know, everything everybody thought is true, that they were selling well in US,
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:17.000]  they're selling in particularly well in Asian markets where larger size. There's, there's
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:22.440]  still weights for the, for the, for the large one. And the other thing too is you're seeing,
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:26.920]  especially in Asian markets, where like, we're at the map, we were talking about like the proportion
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:34.120]  of the 6 to the 6 Plus, that proportion is changing as the 6 Plus gets supply. So I think which
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:39.000]  means that the, the average selling price is going to be higher. Like, yeah, it's going to be crazy.
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:45.160]  A lot higher because it's $100 higher at each pricing tier and it's $100 higher at the starting
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:51.320]  price. So anything about demand, anything that shows positive demand for the 6 Plus in particular
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:58.760]  is huge for Apple in terms of average selling price. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:04.520]  average selling price year over year is significantly higher, which I don't think it's ever
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:08.440]  happened before. I think it's always gone down. It always, it always pops on the launch quarter
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:13.240]  because, because well, that's why I'm saying you're over here. Yeah, exactly. No, I agree. I agree.
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:19.640]  Right. It's, you know, and Apple has held average selling prices high compared to the rest of
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:24.680]  the smartphone industry, you know, obviously, you know, that's extraordinary. They're exception
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:30.680]  in that regard. But it still has slowly trickle down since the original iPhone. You know, in a way
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:34.920]  that's not worrisome for the company, it's probably actually been a positive sign that they've
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.240]  kept them as high as they had and kept the trickle low. But I think there's a serious chance
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:43.160]  that the existence of the 6 Plus will actually raise the average selling price year over
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:47.720]  year. How, only the launch. I fully expect that to be the case. I agree. And like you said,
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:51.400]  I do think, I think they're still supply constraint on them. I think that they're selling them,
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:55.480]  they're, they, they, you know, they can't make them fast enough to meet demand yet.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:03.320]  But the story of the two phones, again, they're super important. I think they're super successful
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:09.160]  like profoundly successful. Maybe that maybe the most successful launch year of iPhone to date,
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:15.320]  not just in fact, of record breaking numbers, but just exceeding expectations. But they weren't,
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:20.120]  they weren't hard to explain. They were, they, you know, it was like that. It's like, it's like the
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:26.360]  iPhone, but it's bigger. Yeah. And, you know, and what was, you know, what did Shiller demonstrate?
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:29.640]  Well, he talked about, you know, a lot of the photography stuff that they've done that's new,
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:33.320]  you know, it's a better camera than it was before, not really that hard to explain. It's a better
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:39.240]  camera than ever. And their bigger phones and their thin and they get amazing battery life. And
[2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:45.240]  that's it. I mean, it was not a hard thing to explain because it's truly just an iteration over
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:51.240]  what they've done before. And they made it bigger. Whereas Windows 10 compared to everything else is,
[2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:58.520]  it demanded a story. It's a new thing. This, this whole strategy of one OS that runs on everything
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:06.360]  from phones to small tablets to big tablets to hybrids to desktops is all new. And the way that
[2:29:06.360 --> 2:29:13.560]  there sort of have this one OS, but different interfaces that are suited to the different size
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:20.600]  devices, demanded demos and attention. And, you know, is it store, it's the whole story of
[2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:26.200]  Microsoft for the rest of the year. And it's a lot to, I think, brush that aside with the,
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:34.120]  you know, a prototype, finest guide thing, no matter how cool it is. It's not, it's even more
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:44.120]  profound than that. Like Microsoft like the, you, they can't take for granted Windows on the PC.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:52.600]  Like it, it is under real threat, I believe, not just from the Mac, which is growing remarkably,
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:29:59.720]  but also from Chromebooks. Like the fact of the matter is like I, I, I'm on record, I sing and
[2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:05.080]  maybe not have learned on an Apple podcast, but or a, you're not an Apple podcast, you're a,
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:11.800]  all things excellent podcast. But like, yeah, that's why Chromebook doesn't, or the pixel does.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:17.400]  But no, most people would be exceptionally well served by having an iPhone and a Chromebook.
[2:30:17.400 --> 2:30:25.720]  And, and a lot of windows, especially in the consumer market is arguably due to inertia.
[2:30:25.720 --> 2:30:30.760]  But when it comes to the enterprise space, like the enterprise and businesses, that's the core
[2:30:30.760 --> 2:30:36.440]  Microsoft, I mean, you think that consumers hated Windows eight or that reviewers hated Windows
[2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:42.040]  eight or that M. G. Seagler hated Windows eight. Like the enterprise hated Windows eight times
[2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:47.160]  100 because it, I mean, there was, there was, there under the surface, there's a lot of good
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:52.040]  support on those eight for, for administering and security and all that sort of stuff. But the last
[2:30:52.040 --> 2:30:55.640]  thing any sort of administrator wants to deal with is having to teach people how to use their
[2:30:55.640 --> 2:31:01.560]  computer, right? Like that, that's, that's, that's, that's awful. And that's what Windows eight
[2:31:01.560 --> 2:31:07.160]  kind of brought them. And so Microsoft like, there's nothing more important to Windows.
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:10.680]  I don't think it's more important to Microsoft because I don't think Windows should be the most
[2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:15.400]  important we can do that later. But there's nothing more important to Windows than like laying out
[2:31:15.400 --> 2:31:22.520]  like, we've come to our senses, like this is, you can depend on us. We're sorry about that. This is
[2:31:22.520 --> 2:31:27.400]  something you can see and believe in. And that message needs to get out and it needs to be pushed
[2:31:27.400 --> 2:31:30.680]  out. Do you think it's, do you think it's fair? Do you think it's fair to describe it as stop the
[2:31:30.680 --> 2:31:37.320]  bleeding for absolutely? I mean, what, what a great one was stop the bleeding arguably. But that was
[2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:43.000]  more of a, like, a battle field, like, like, what's the thing where you wrap around your arm and
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:47.400]  like it, it, it stanches the, like the blood flow. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean.
[2:31:49.560 --> 2:31:53.240]  I don't turn, turn, turn, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it,
[2:31:53.240 --> 2:31:58.520]  turn it, we're demonstrating our bad pronunciation. Yeah, turn it, yeah, I agree. And this is
[2:31:58.520 --> 2:32:02.040]  their way of saying, look, here's something that's new that we've been working on and that it's
[2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:06.680]  different and that we're proud to say we think you're going to like it. You know, here's us saying,
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:10.360]  here's our vision for the future and we think it goes along with what you want to hear from us.
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:15.960]  Now, I totally agree with that. I even went with the Chromebook front. My familiar with Chromebooks
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:19.560]  is through my son and they have a lot of them. And it's most of the computing devices that at
[2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:24.600]  a school that he gets a user Chromebooks. I mean, there's a mix. There's some MacBooks there too,
[2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:28.440]  but they don't get the touch and much and there's some iPads, but it's mostly when the kids do
[2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:33.240]  stuff on the computer. It's on Chromebooks. And it's interesting to me because he complains about
[2:32:33.240 --> 2:32:38.120]  them. And it's not, again, I've said this before many times. It's if anything, he likes to tweak
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:43.880]  me, not please me. So he's not like pro Apple because his dad writes about Apple. If anything,
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:49.240]  he would love to complain about Apple just to get under my skin. He complains about the Chromebooks
[2:32:49.240 --> 2:32:54.040]  because he just says their pieces of junk. I think there's there's all Samsungs, you know, just
[2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:57.800]  flimsy that he complains about the keys. And he says all his friends do too. They all complain,
[2:32:57.800 --> 2:33:02.440]  they all want them replaced with MacBooks. And I thought it was interesting though, then a couple
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:08.840]  weeks ago, he said they had a big thing where they all got called together and like the lower
[2:33:08.840 --> 2:33:12.840]  school or middle school, I guess he's in middle school now, the middle school principal called him
[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:18.120]  together and that one of the other fifth grade classes trashed a bunch of the Chromebooks like,
[2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:23.960]  you know, just way that fifth grade boys, probably the boys, let's face it. And I was like,
[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:27.320]  and I said to him, I said, you know what, that's why they make you guys piece of crap Chromebooks
[2:33:27.320 --> 2:33:31.480]  instead of MacBooks because you guys are rough with them, you know, you don't treat them like you
[2:33:31.480 --> 2:33:36.680]  would your own, you treat them like, you know, the old property. But it made me think just in large
[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:44.040]  some, it's there's a market for computers that an institution chooses for you for other reasons
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:49.000]  and that may not be what you would want to use yourself. And that Microsoft owned that market,
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:54.680]  owned it 100%. They had like 100% of that market of stuff that an institution of any kind,
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:59.640]  whether it's a business, a corporation like a fortune 500 or a middle school or something like that.
[2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:06.200]  And Chromebooks are absolutely eating in that. And it informs everything else because,
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:11.000]  you know, what do they do on a Chromebook? What they certainly don't use Microsoft Word, right?
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:16.120]  I mean, when they're typing stuff, it's in Google Docs, you know, and so everything that
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:21.640]  falls out of that of them not buying, if they're going to buy kids a bunch of piece of crap
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:27.240]  notebooks that can be used as beaters, them being Chromebooks instead of being Windows machines
[2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:32.760]  has all sorts of repercussions other than just the licensing fee for Windows that they're not
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:36.600]  getting off the sale. Yeah, well, they don't get used to office. I mean, the reality is most
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:43.320]  people don't need office, but once you're used to it, you're used to it. And that's super powerful.
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:50.440]  And yeah, and Microsoft should take it for granted. It's just one, you know, schools is just
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:53.400]  one. But I know, but you know, there's no doubt in my mind, though, it's the Chromebooks are a
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:59.240]  huge thing in education. No, no, no, no, no, I mean, the numbers reflect that. Yeah, the
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:04.200]  Chromebook thing's frustrating because like, I actually genuinely like using it, like if your stuff
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:09.720]  is, is actually all in the cloud, it's, it's, it's a delight to use in the way, like an iPad
[2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:15.080]  is leftful to use in that like, there's just no, there's no cruft, right? There's no dealing with
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:21.640]  updates or like stuff popping up or like, you know, like when you deal with OS 10 or Windows or
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:26.040]  anything, there's just so much stuff that came before that's still hanging around for various
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:32.280]  reasons. Whereas with a Chromebook, it's, it's just so it's an appliance. It's, you turn it on and
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:36.360]  you type stuff in it and then you put it away. And I, that's why I like it. I don't like because
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:41.560]  it's cheap. I like it because it's so simple. And that's why I love the pixel because the pixel,
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:47.800]  like I'm paying for phenomenal hardware. Like the pixel is like, I can't, I can't speak high
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:53.720]  enough of it. The keyboard trackpad screen, all Apple quality, if I put the keyboard above Apple
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:59.320]  actually. Um, and, but the problem is, is most of it by Chromebooks because they're cheap. So
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:05.880]  there's no market for it. Uh, which is, which makes me very sad. Yeah, I wonder how many pixels
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:10.120]  there's probably not very money. I bet that's another one that's sold in this. I, I'm tempted to
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:15.320]  pull a, uh, you in the Apple extended keyboard, like I want to buy up a couple of them. So I could keep,
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:21.080]  I write like my daily updates, you know, which are more referential to current events and like,
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:25.000]  I'm winking a lot. I'll do those, I'll, I most of my, those are my Mac and multiple screens,
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:30.200]  stuff like that. But like my big articles where they're more like for lack of a better word,
[2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:35.400]  like thought pieces or like like where I'm trying to articulate an argument, I almost always
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.400]  write that on those are almost all around the pixel. And just because I love the environment,
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:43.720]  right? There's nothing else going on. And it's a great typing environment in the screen,
[2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:49.880]  gorgeous screen. And like you can just like get lost in your document. And, um, so I still,
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:56.360]  I still use it like at least weekly, if not more. Yeah. I don't, well, I don't think it's any coincidence
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:37:01.800]  that I mean, there's that whole rise of, you know, like single window, window user mode and text editors
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:07.240]  that are, you know, like, uh, by word and other ones that are meant to be distraction-free and run,
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:13.560]  you know, as a single window. Um, but I think in general, no matter what app you use, even if you
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:21.480]  don't use a single window user mode or any kind of thing that's designed to be distraction-free,
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:29.000]  writing on a laptop is just inherently more distraction-free than writing at a desktop with a big
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:32.840]  window, you know, where you can see much. Yeah, totally. It just feels more focused. There's
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:37.800]  no, and there's no question. You just hear from people who write anything, you know, from novelist
[2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:45.160]  to journalists, you know, the biggest form to the quickest and shortest form, uh, you know,
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:50.280]  they just live and die by there. Yeah, totally, totally. So the thing with Windows though is, um,
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:56.120]  what, what, what I was most impressed by was actually at the very, very beginning, the part that
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:06.040]  you missed, um, where, um, they basically articulated the idea that, uh, windows needed to be, or
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:11.080]  needed to be personal. And it, it wasn't about the device. It was about the person, the person
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:16.120]  should be able to go from device to device, like they're moving to where there's more devices
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:20.920]  than people. And, and if you think about it, Microsoft has always been about the PC and that,
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:24.200]  that, that's how their business model's been based on, that's how their product development's
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:31.560]  been based on like everything's been based on the device. And, but the world today is, you have to
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:36.520]  focus on the person. And so you have to have that, and this was the apples doing too with continuity
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:41.720]  odds sort of stuff is you need to have the seamless experience. It's no longer enough to think about
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:47.560]  just OS 10, like, I love John Syracuse's conclusion to Yosemite. He really took it as well. Like,
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:53.560]  it's not that Apple is now developing disparate operating systems or developing one system
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:59.880]  with various manifestations that need to work together and, and go across from wrist to,
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:05.880]  to, to laptop, to desktop, to phone, to, to tablet. And Microsoft articulate this as well. And
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:12.200]  it's a bigger deal for Microsoft because Apple sells, sells the actual hardware. So this new
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:15.880]  world fits their business model. It's actually even better for Apple because they can sell that
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:22.360]  many more devices. For Microsoft, this is a big shift because it entails a change in everything
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:26.680]  that they do in the way their companies put together in the way they make money. And to hear them
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:35.960]  articulated so clearly and succinctly was really encouraging. And I guess my, my only complaint with
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:42.200]  the first part of the, of the, of the presentation, the part that we both liked was the only problem
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:49.400]  with it was that all the demos were, were a PC and a Windows phone or, or Windows tablet. And
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:54.600]  that's just not the reality. The reality is people, they needed to demo, I think, a Windows PC
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:58.920]  with an iPhone or with an Android phone because that's, that's their customer. And I, I just think
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:04.440]  they needed to double down on the PC and, and instead they kind of distracted with this thing. And
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.520]  then you had Nadella getting up and talking about, we love Windows or want people to love Windows,
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:11.480]  it's just kind of went off the rails.
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:17.160]  That's a hard sell though to have them demo with iPhone. And, and I know that, you know, part of it,
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:20.760]  part of Microsoft certainly is more open to that. I mean, you know, if you go back to last year in
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.000]  the build conference where they had, you know, me and Brent Simmons and Dave Whiskus come out and,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  you know, featured in a product video for them because Vesper uses the Windows live server stuff,
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:41.480]  Azure. And, and, and that's all very true, but it's a hard sell in a Windows 10 focused event,
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:46.760]  you know, but it is interesting. And I do think that in general sense that they, you know, it's just,
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:51.480]  you know, in an Apple like way that they can only do so much year over year, but that they're iterating.
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:56.600]  And I feel like they're going in a very similar way where like you said with Syracuse's conclusion
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:02.440]  of the Yosemite review that it's sort of one system with different interfaces for the different devices.
[2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:08.360]  And I kind of feel like they missed that with Windows 8 where they kind of shipped everything with
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:15.000]  this touch interface, whether it was a touch device or not. And it was really mostly, you know,
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:20.360]  I don't know that just the overall tiled interface just really did not work well, I think on
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:26.440]  laptops and certainly not on desktops. And it was really just sort of a tablet slash phone interface.
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:31.000]  But now they've got, you know, it's, it's more, it's really, you know, really is the same
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:35.320]  Windows 10. Like the whole thing with apps, I think is fascinating. And it shows how they're doing it
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:41.560]  like a higher level than Apple where there's not a desktop Windows app store or not going to be
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:46.760]  for Windows 10 and a phone one. Like if you get a Twitter app, it could be the same app,
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:51.560]  and it runs on your phone, it runs on your tablet, it runs on your PC, but has very different
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:56.200]  interfaces. Like when you're using it on your PC, it won't be like you're running an iPhone app on
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:00.360]  your phone. No, exactly it. I mean, I think, I mean, Marco had a, had a kind of a discourse on on
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:05.480]  HTTP a few weeks ago about what, you know, what is he going to build overcast for the Mac.
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:10.120]  And in the Microsoft vision, that wouldn't really be the decision. He would already have it,
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:16.360]  he'd have to design a new interface, but like he, right, it's a big step for him to write a Mac app,
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:19.880]  there wouldn't be the case, that wouldn't be the case for Windows.
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:27.640]  Yeah, and it's like I said earlier with Instagram where in today's iOS world, if you do the stuff
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:31.960]  that's necessary to support the, you know, the iPhone 5s size, the iPhone 6 size,
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:38.520]  iPhone 6 plus size, going to the iPad is just a fourth size. And, you know, that's sort of what
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:42.440]  they're doing with the Windows stuff. And this isn't brand new. I mean, that was a big part
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:47.400]  of the message that build last May was the way that you can build these universal apps that would
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:56.600]  run across a incredible, you know, from TVs to phones with interfaces specific to those devices,
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:43:01.480]  you know, that you can have the same app. You could get it from the app store. And on the phone,
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:06.680]  clearly, it's a touch space device where it's all based on touching the glass. And on your TV,
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:11.160]  it's all based on using a remote control to go up down left. The thing is though, and this is the
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:17.320]  thing for Microsoft, and it's both like the, the, the problem and the opportunity is the,
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:25.480]  this idea of moving from device to device. It's actually not, it's not that much about the
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:31.720]  operating system. Because all the, if you think about it, like, it's all, it's all about the cloud,
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:37.240]  like, if, and it's not, it's not just about the cloud, it's about a whole bunch of clouds. So
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:41.880]  my Facebook is, is the same everywhere because it's all on Facebook's cloud. My Twitter is the
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:46.920]  same everywhere. My email's the same, like a lot of the services we already have are already in
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:53.880]  sync across devices because they're inherently kind of cloud based. And, and that's, I mean, that's,
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:44:02.280]  that's, and so to almost like to, I mean, he's the word to over index on, on the operating system
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.800]  being consistent is, if you think about it less important than having that kind of service layer,
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:12.520]  that that's the part that is actually consistent. The cloud is consistent across all these devices.
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:19.400]  And oh, by the way, that's Microsoft is doing really great stuff in the cloud. And, and I do think
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:24.200]  that no delegates this, there's a clear part of Microsoft that gets this. And I think is still an
[2:44:24.200 --> 2:44:34.280]  opportunity to, the glue can still be better even on iOS on Android. And, and I think Microsoft is
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:39.000]  making strong moves in that area. And I don't know, I mean, yes, it would have been a radical move,
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  but I would have loved to like how powerful would have been to have Microsoft just fully embrace the,
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:50.920]  we are the best PC operating system, screw the max, screw the Chromebook. I mean, obviously we
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:57.160]  can disagree or you can disagree. But like, that's a fair position for them to take. And we,
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:02.040]  with our cloud, we work well with whatever device you bring, you know, along with it.
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:09.480]  Right, especially with Windows phone, but whatever, you know, whatever you're using, it'll work
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:15.160]  great with it. Yeah, I just, I get Microsoft saying like we like, if you use all Windows, it'll be
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:19.800]  the best because it is true. I mean, if you, if you get everything from one company, you're
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:24.680]  likely to get a better experience. But the promise is just not, it's just not reality. And I just,
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:30.040]  I don't know, I'm a big fan of, I mean, it goes back to the Amazon thing. Like, you can live,
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:35.720]  do you want to go with what's best for you or what is like the way that customers actually live
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:41.640]  their lives? Yeah. So I feel like the event should have, I feel like the Surface Hub, which is
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:53.320]  their big 84 inch 4K TV touchscreen, uh, whiteboard, meeting dingus. I feel like that, that would
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:58.440]  have been a good way to end it. Right? Cause that fits that. And it wasn't distracting from the
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:04.120]  earlier message. To me, it emphasized the earlier message, which is that Windows 10 runs on everything
[2:46:04.120 --> 2:46:08.920]  from this, hold up a phone, right? And even a big Lumia phone, even a big five and a half inch
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:14.760]  phone is tiny compared to a giant 84 inch TV. Uh, and I think it was a cool surprise because the
[2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:20.040]  TV had been right there showing slides the whole presentation, you know, that this thing that
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:24.360]  they were announcing, which was a surprise was right there in front of everybody. And it's
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:28.440]  super compelling to the enterprise market and like, which is, which is the part, the market that
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:34.200]  they really needed to share. Right. And it's, you know, here's, here's, here's any, you know,
[2:46:34.200 --> 2:46:38.760]  here's one thing where Microsoft can get out in front and, you know, Apple doesn't sell anything
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.600]  like this. Google doesn't have anything like this. Nobody has anything like this, right? This is a
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:48.920]  product that's not really like anything else. And like you said, there's a clear, you can easily
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:54.280]  see how there's a lot of people at this week who are saying, Hey, we could use that, right? We could
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:47:00.600]  use that. That would be good for us, whether it's the whiteboard part or the meeting part or both,
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:05.960]  you know, it's, it's, it's, it's not like you have to jump through hoops to find a reason to,
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:10.920]  to that you might want to buy it. And then end it right there because I think that the hollow
[2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:14.920]  lens stuff, not that they shouldn't have done it. I just save it for build, right? Why not do that
[2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:19.720]  it build and have a cool fun thing, you know, maybe they've got something else for build too,
[2:47:19.720 --> 2:47:24.680]  but I don't know, save that for build and let the Windows 10 event breathe for itself.
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:30.760]  I, I think it's a tricky, it's a tricky comp. It's a tricky thing being one of those big companies
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:34.600]  where you've got a lot of stuff coming out throughout the year. How many events do you break them
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:40.360]  into, you know, how much do you shoehorn into one keynote? Um, but I think they made a mistake
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:44.440]  by doing hollow. Well, how about, uh, announcing hollow ends when it's, it's going to ship in
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:51.640]  a month or it's going to ship in two months? Yeah, I don't know. And it also makes me a little
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:56.440]  skeptical like, and the people who got to play with it all raved about the experience. And so
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:03.160]  it doesn't seem like there's any kind of, it's a real thing. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's, you know,
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:07.320]  it's real technology. And then every, I didn't see a single person who tried it who didn't give
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:14.280]  it a very positive response, but it's clearly prototype hardware, you know, that the,
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:19.160]  their, their promise shipping device is a thing with no cables. You just put, it's battery operated
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:23.240]  and you put it on your head and that's it. Whereas the thing that they let people try,
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:30.520]  it involved like a battery pack on your waist and a cable connecting the battery pack to the
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:37.160]  thing on your head. And they had to take, uh, physical measurements of the distance between your
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:42.200]  pupils and then enter it by hand into the device, whereas the, you know, the shipping product
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:46.520]  is supposed to be, you know, like, if you've got one and I try it on, it's going to, the device
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:53.560]  itself will measure the pupil distance to calibrate itself. Um, it's all very, that's, uh,
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:49:01.160]  raises all sorts of reds of hearts in my mind. Right. And it is, that's the hard part. And it's sort
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:06.120]  of, you know, and of course, I'm going to bring it back to Apple, but it's an interesting
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:15.560]  contrast with the watch where when they showed us the watch back in October, or I guess it was
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:21.560]  September, right? September was the watch. Um, it was, I mean, they didn't say it's final
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:26.200]  hardware, but it was as close to final, you know, I'm sure there might be some tweaks or something
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:29.720]  like that, but it was, you know, they were real. The things they let us, and they let us try them on
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:36.440]  our wrists and, you know, it's the same materials. They were stainless. They, they were gold. They were
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:43.080]  aluminum. All the bands were there. We got to play with the bands. Um, and they just didn't let us
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:47.400]  see the software, you know, they just had the demo loop of the software, but the actual hardware was
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:52.920]  there. I mean, it's, there's no trickery about it. That's interesting. Yeah, where is my, or it sounds
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:58.280]  like Microsoft had the software pretty nailed down, but not the hardware. Well, no, but they didn't
[2:49:58.280 --> 2:50:01.960]  really, it wasn't, it was the software was also a can. The software they took people through
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:07.480]  was, yeah, it's all canned, you know, everybody got the same loop. Well, I mean, and canned in a way
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:11.720]  where it wasn't just playing, like with the watch, it really just played a loop, and there was no
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:16.280]  interactivity at all, whereas clearly this thing was actually, I guess you moved your head was
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:20.520]  adjusting what you saw, you know, it was all, but, you know, the things that you did were very,
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:26.520]  very limited. It was everybody got the same Minecraft game. Everybody got the same, um, you know,
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:31.240]  a Skype call to how to hook up a light, which I thought was the most compelling.
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:39.400]  Yeah, that's really cool. The demo they had, it's, you know, in the product video, they showed
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:44.440]  somebody getting help doing some home plumbing repair in the thing that they gave to the journalist,
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:48.360]  it was a little bit of like, it was like hooking up a light switch, a little home electricity.
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.000]  And the idea is they had an expert electrician on the other end using Skype on a tablet who could
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:51:00.520]  see what you see through your, um, HoloLens, and then he could annotate it with his finger on the
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:06.040]  tablet by saying here, take this cable here and then, you know, draw a little line on it, and hook
[2:51:06.040 --> 2:51:10.280]  this thing up to there and do that, you know, which is a very compelling, it's not just compelling
[2:51:10.280 --> 2:51:14.600]  from a use perspective, it's compelling from a product perspective, because that's a platform,
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:20.280]  like you could see there being all kinds of services being offered, you know, over this.
[2:51:20.280 --> 2:51:25.480]  And it's an example of like, I think, uh, you know, in the long run, I'm more interested in
[2:51:25.480 --> 2:51:30.120]  augmented reality than in virtual reality. Like, I think, I mean, Oculus Rift looks amazing, but
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:37.480]  to me, that's in the same vein as video games. Um, it is video games. I mean, I might mean
[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:43.080]  to be dismissive because I realized video games are an enormous industry. Um, you know, like,
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:50.120]  uh, Horace, did you just put posted a point that, uh, that the app store is now paying developers more
[2:51:50.120 --> 2:51:56.440]  than the box office receipts of Hollywood combined in the US. And some people, I link. Yeah. And
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:51:59.640]  and some people linked down like, they're like, so what? And I was like, well, it's not a huge,
[2:51:59.640 --> 2:52:03.800]  it's not like a magic number. It doesn't mean anything in particular. It's just to just put it in
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:07.960]  context, though, like you, we've all grown up knowing that Hollywood is Hollywood and it's a big deal.
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:14.760]  You know, the Apple App Store alone is now bigger than that. Yeah, but it's a destination. It's
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:20.520]  a thing you go and do. Whereas like, what's so compelling about the smartphone is it's with you
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:26.200]  all the time in your actual real life. And you could see like, in like 10 years down the road,
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:32.120]  where the Microsoft is doing is actually like a normal pair of glasses. Like the thing with
[2:52:32.120 --> 2:52:38.440]  Google Glass is like the the the fundamental concept I don't think was flawed. Just everything
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:44.840]  about the product execution was was horribly flawed. Right. And the, a lot of the, the contrary
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:51.000]  feedback I've gotten this week, you know, is like, well, how can you, how can you say that this
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:55.880]  looks cool? And you're, you know, did nothing but shit all over a group of glass for two years.
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:53:02.040]  And it's, again, it's like I never, I and I don't think anybody ever said that augmented reality
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:07.400]  is a goofy idea that's never going to take off. It was glass in particular. Everything about glass
[2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:12.920]  that the actual nature of how it was presented in their, their proposal of how you'd use it was,
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:19.160]  was wrong. Not the idea that augmented reality in general is bad. No. You know, I could see it,
[2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:24.680]  I could see it multiple ways. I can see it where, you know, obtrusive headsets like what,
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:29.560]  you know, HoloLens is going to be when it chips. Uh, I mean, you know, you look like Robert
[2:53:29.560 --> 2:53:35.400]  Apple looking on. That's okay. You see, I could see right, you know, there's all sorts of things
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:40.120]  you do at home that you wouldn't do in public that you look weird. Like being, you know,
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:45.480]  hunching your shoulders over a little video game controller is not something you would do while,
[2:53:45.480 --> 2:53:50.520]  you know, I, you know, out in public, but, you know, while you're playing a game, it's fine.
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:54.920]  If you think about something like, what's the precursor to the iPhone? It's like, it's like the iPod,
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:53:59.960]  but from a, a fundamental level, they're very different products. The iPod was dependent on a PC,
[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:05.560]  the center of your existence was the PC, the digital hub, and the iPod lets you carry music with you.
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:11.320]  Yet from a, like a hardware perspective, the iPod very much led to the iPhone, you know,
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:16.280]  the, what Apple were in miniaturization, battery technology, all that sort of stuff led to the
[2:54:16.280 --> 2:54:20.520]  iPhone. And I think it's a similar thing here. Right now it will start out as being something
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:26.440]  you do at home. You're not going to wear this robo cop thing outside, but Microsoft will develop
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:32.440]  the expertise and, and like how to build this sort of stuff. It'll get smaller. And at some point,
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:38.280]  they will be ready to make the shift, uh, you know, to being something outside, whereas Google
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:42.600]  jumped straight to being outside when the technology isn't even remotely close to being ready.
[2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:48.840]  And, and that's why it was a mess. And everything fell out of that, everything fell out of that,
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:52.840]  because then by trying to make it small enough that you'd even vaguely want to wear it or be
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:58.120]  willing to wear it in public, it was so technically limited that it wasn't compelling. There was
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:04.040]  never anything about it that was like a, wow, holy crap. Whereas also, you know, that was more or
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:08.360]  less the responsibility had who got to try on the HoloLens at the Microsoft event was,
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:14.680]  wow, this was so frustrating, right? Like the HoloLens, it was genuinely compelling. And it's
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:20.600]  compelling from a today perspective, and it's a compelling from a like 10 year from now perspective.
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:28.760]  And, and it's just a shame that I, and so I guess they got the HoloLens benefit, but I mean,
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:30.840]  like, why did it have to be at this event?
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:37.880]  I, that's exactly my point exactly. I couldn't agree more. And as the week has gone on,
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:42.360]  and I've seen what people have written about, I, I, my, that was my initial reaction on day one,
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:47.400]  and it's only been reaffirmed because almost everything I've seen written since has been about
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:52.840]  HoloLens, not about Windows. Yeah. And one, they needed to make points about Windows 10 that
[2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:58.040]  like this is Windows and chill out, you know, we've come to our senses. And two, like, the vision
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:56:03.880]  was compelling, but no one, no one's paying attention to it. Right. And it's a hard thing, you know,
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:07.480]  I know you're there. I could see why they're excited about it. I can see why they might have been
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:11.880]  excited to announce it, but I think you got to, I think you got to hold that bullet for a little longer.
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:15.560]  Yeah. And again, it's not that you, not that you have to wait until it's ready to ship,
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:20.600]  you know, next week, but it's, you know, just a little closer. And they have an event coming up,
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:24.040]  they have build coming up in just a few months. And I, you know, I don't think there's anything that
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:28.760]  would have happened in the next few months that would have made it less of a cool thing to unveil
[2:56:28.760 --> 2:56:33.960]  there. Well, if anything, it'll be better. All right, I don't know, because it would only be,
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:40.040]  you know, further along. Yeah, I can't help but think that they, they really wasted an opportunity
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:45.880]  there missed time that distracted from what the cool things they did have to announce. And,
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:52.360]  you know, it's kind of sad because it's almost like a lack of confidence, right? Like they weren't,
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:58.120]  they weren't confident in what they had to announce or like their, their status as a company.
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:02.840]  I guess, I mean, I can see where that comes from, I guess, but like, they felt like they needed
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:10.680]  to juice it up. And they didn't need to. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of agree with that. Yeah. Otherwise,
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:14.280]  it was a pretty well-run event though. I do think that they're getting their act together on that
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:19.480]  front. Yeah. I mean, like, like they started on like, it sounds stupid, but they started on time.
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:27.480]  The presentations were tight, the demos didn't fail. Like, and that's, that's, that will,
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:32.120]  that stuff matters. And it wasn't the case, even just a couple years ago. Yeah. And it's, you know,
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:38.440]  I think that it's, it's also a sign to me, the whole event, even with them in my mind,
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:44.280]  in your mind, the mistake of tossing HoloLens in two as unnecessary icing on the cake
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:50.840]  or distracting icing on the cake. Even with it, it still felt like overall like a new Microsoft,
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:57.720]  which I think they a needed and b that Nadella needed, you know, to assert, you know, in a public way
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:58:05.240]  to make it feel like, you know, he is changing the course of this ship. Yeah. I love the frosting
[2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:08.520]  idea, because that's as that little was. It's like, this is really good frosting. It's a really
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:15.720]  good cake, but these, they shouldn't go together. Yeah. You know, and what else? I mean, I would say
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:21.080]  making Windows 10 free. I mean, they're calling it a free free upgrade for anybody running Windows
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:25.000]  7 or 8 for the first year. I don't know why they tacked on that first year. Why not just say
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:29.880]  it's a free update for Windows 7 or 8? I guess the I only thing I can think of is that they
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:35.240]  don't want people to wait. They want people running Windows 7 and 8 to upgrade within the first year,
[2:58:35.240 --> 2:58:41.800]  but it just seems like a weird like asterisk to put on it. But the whole idea of it being free
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:47.880]  seems like post Balmer Microsoft. Well, Windows 8 was free for the first three months
[2:58:48.920 --> 2:58:54.600]  if you had Windows 7, I believe. So they did do it before. And the reality is is Microsoft makes
[2:58:54.600 --> 2:59:00.040]  the vast majority of the revenue either from enterprise licensing or from new PCs sold with Windows,
[2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:05.000]  like only only like 10% of Windows revenue has ever come from people actually paying for upgrades.
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:09.400]  But that said, it's still, it still matters. And it's meaningful. And yeah, the one
[2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:14.040]  you're thinking like it's not just that, but also they basically said anyone who buys a Windows 10
[2:59:14.040 --> 2:59:20.680]  PC will get upgrades for the like the life of the life expected life of the PC. And it sounds like
[2:59:20.680 --> 2:59:26.840]  it's going to be more of it. It really is more of a Apple sort of model like always 10 today
[2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:30.840]  where you get it and you're going to get upgrades and you're not going to pay pay for those upgrades.
[2:59:30.840 --> 2:59:36.040]  And that is a big deal. It's a shift. It's a shift to this. The person being the center
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:42.680]  sort of mindset that that that is a bigger shift for Microsoft than it is for Apple because it
[2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:47.960]  requires changing how they how they make money. And and I kind of put it on exponent this week,
[2:59:47.960 --> 2:59:54.120]  but I think you're right, it is, it is, it is worth, it is worth acknowledging. I think it's also,
[2:59:54.120 --> 2:59:58.680]  it's even more worth acknowledging in the way that like the bugs and Apple software that we've
[2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:02.840]  all been talking about this month are so much easier to complain about than the things that they do
[3:00:02.840 --> 3:00:10.200]  that are just work that are kind of amazing that they just work. And you know, it's easy to
[3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:14.680]  take those things for granted. I think in Microsoft's case, praise for, hey, here's Windows 10,
[3:00:14.680 --> 3:00:20.040]  it's a free update for Windows 7 and 8 users is worth praising even more so because of how complicated
[3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:26.760]  Windows pricing has been in the past, you know, with the pro edition and pro enterprise edition
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:31.560]  and you know, eight different editions of the new version of Windows with, you know,
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:37.720]  just it boggled the mind and I feel like just saying, well, it's just Windows 10 and it's a free
[3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:44.360]  update for Windows 7 and 8 is such a, you know, it's deserving of praise if it's deserving of praise as
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:52.200]  the old strategy was deserving of mockery. Yeah, well, it's always the old strategy made a lot of
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:57.320]  money. Oh, it definitely did and it was this, but it was a salesperson strategy, you know, and I
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:01:02.200]  feel like it wasn't good for them in the long run. It definitely made money, you know, there's,
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:07.720]  you know, bottom line, any, any discussion or complaints about Balmer's leadership of Microsoft
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:13.960]  have to include the, but it made a lot of money and ever increasing amounts, you know, but
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:20.760]  it, the, the, having it making your product line can unnecessarily confusing, even if it's profitable,
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:25.800]  you know, in the short term, I think it's, it's detrimental to your branding in the long run.
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:31.960]  No. I would, what's fascinating for me to watch on Microsoft though, and this is part of it is, it's,
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:37.560]  you, we actually saw this with Adobe, like Adobe has fundamentally shifted how they make money
[3:01:37.560 --> 3:01:44.760]  from selling package software to selling, like software as a service, basically. And Microsoft is
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:49.720]  kind of going through the same transition and it's, and it's, I said this on next point
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:55.560]  of this week, like the thing about Microsoft, and you have to couch everything in this is what
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.400]  you're witnessing with Microsoft and all the criticism you want to levy against the company,
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:05.160]  what they're going through is the price of being so absurdly successful. Yeah. Like, like,
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:10.920]  for every smidgen that Microsoft was less successful, the easier their tasks would be today.
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:18.680]  And, and so it's like, it's a testament to how successful they were that they're having to go
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:25.800]  through such wrenching changes now. And, and it's, it's, it's fascinating to watch in like,
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:32.680]  yeah, I was a little down in a Dell speech, and talk about windows and stuff. I think now I
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:37.240]  kind of think there might have been a political motive to it, but it's pretty remarkable to see
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:44.600]  the shift in Microsoft in just the last year. Yeah, it's, you know, but they, they needed to move
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:48.040]  fast. They said they're going to move fast, but, you know, actions speak louder than words,
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:52.600]  and I think their actions back it up. So I think overall, it was, you know, it was a very,
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:56.520]  you know, best event to I think Microsoft has had in a while, even though I think it so could have
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:03.080]  easily been the better just by holding HoloLens. Yeah, it's a little bit that, yeah,
[3:03:04.440 --> 3:03:08.920]  it's gotta be frustrating for that because like, it, because it's not like they, it's not like it
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:12.840]  was bad. It was just the wrong time and wrong place. All right, last question, when do you think
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:17.320]  HoloLens is going to ship actually ship a site, a consumer, like something you can just go online
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:27.480]  and buy and how much do you think it's going to cost? I would guess late 2016 in limited supply
[3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:32.760]  and it'll be hard to get. And because I think when they say Windows 10 timeframe, that means like,
[3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:36.440]  it's like when Windows 10 is like the product on the market, it's not like when Windows 10 ships.
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:39.960]  So for Windows 11 ships, that's what I, that's how I interpreted it.
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:43.880]  Right, exactly, exactly. Although I do, I do wonder if there will ever be a Windows 11,
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:52.760]  um, like, are they, uh, when, when final borrowing from, from Apple? Um, the, uh, the price,
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:04:04.760]  that's interesting. Uh, $300 $299. Oh, wow. I was thinking, I think 2016, uh, I think if I wanted
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.080]  to actually have to be honest, I would have to say like you probably second half of 2016,
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:14.520]  I was going to say $1,000. Yeah, that's possible. It was more a like, are they going to like,
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:20.680]  actually trying to make a, like $1,000, it would probably be the smart thing because I think it's
[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:26.520]  important to nail it. Um, the two I was more a like, if they actually, I was thinking like,
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:30.760]  can I how much can I have to cost? I don't know though. I could be, I could see it being more,
[3:04:30.760 --> 3:04:34.680]  a lot more. I could see their goal being making it a lot more consumer friendly,
[3:04:34.680 --> 3:04:40.920]  you know, $300, $400, but I don't know. And it's certainly to me, and I know Apple only revealed
[3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:47.480]  the starting price of Apple watch. Um, but without releasing any suggestion of the price,
[3:04:48.280 --> 3:04:52.520]  and I know, you know, part of it is that they don't know because it's so far off, but it,
[3:04:53.160 --> 3:04:57.640]  it opens themselves up to disappointment. If you don't set any expectations at all,
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:05:02.360]  it's very possible if it's above $500 that people are going to be outraged.
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:11.240]  Yeah. That's true. Okay. You wonder, I wonder if, um, if Apple, you know, once Apple watches
[3:05:11.240 --> 3:05:16.920]  really expensive, and if it is successful, if that will kind of reset people's expectations,
[3:05:16.920 --> 3:05:22.120]  like there's so much, there's such a focus on being cheap in the tech press in particular.
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:29.800]  And I think it's, I think it's misplaced. I think that, especially as you get into more and more
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:37.240]  consumers that aren't that just want stuff to work, like there's a lot of people that are willing
[3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:44.440]  to pay for, for not having a hassle. And the reality is I think a lot of those people who don't
[3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:48.120]  want to have a hassle have actually never really bought technology products because they've only
[3:05:48.120 --> 3:05:52.840]  viewed technology projects as being a hassle. But now you have this, but now they are buying the
[3:05:52.840 --> 3:06:00.360]  wrong smartphones anyway at a minimum. And I think in this market of people who may have money
[3:06:00.360 --> 3:06:06.200]  and be are not technical, Apple is particularly well placed. And, uh, and it'll be interesting to see
[3:06:06.200 --> 3:06:11.640]  if, if that ends up being the case not just for Apple, but for other companies as well.
[3:06:11.640 --> 3:06:17.640]  Well, you know, I, I just think it's, it's telling that they gave away just the starting price,
[3:06:17.640 --> 3:06:22.760]  you know, and okay, maybe I'm sure. In fact, I guarantee it. I don't care whether you pay attention
[3:06:22.760 --> 3:06:28.040]  to, you know, like people like me and you who've tried to set the expectation that, hey, the
[3:06:28.040 --> 3:06:33.880]  gold one, the addition is probably going to be several thousand dollars at least. Um, even
[3:06:33.880 --> 3:06:37.880]  it's going to be so fun. Even if you've been paying attention, there's a lot of people who I know
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:43.480]  who do not believe us. And therefore, if we're correct are going to be disappointed if they were
[3:06:43.480 --> 3:06:50.920]  hoping to buy the gold one. Uh, and without question, there are millions of people who've never
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:56.920]  heard of us and have never read any sort of informed commentary on Apple, but who are aware of
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:07:02.120]  the Apple watch and who think, wow, I like gold. I love my gold iPhone. I'll get the gold watch.
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:07.000]  And they're going to be shocked to shit when they see the price. But at the very least,
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:11.400]  no matter how bad their reaction is on that, there still is an Apple watch that they can't afford
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:14.520]  because it's at the three forty nine price that Apple had already mentioned.
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:24.520]  Yeah. Uh, it's amazing. I remain very excited and intrigued. Uh, you know, by the watch and how
[3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:29.560]  it goes down and yeah, well, it's fun. Like what are the reviews going to be like? Like what's
[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:34.120]  going to be like to use it? Like what, what are the sales like? There's just new categories are
[3:07:34.120 --> 3:07:38.200]  always fun. If it's March, if it is March, that'll be, it'll be right around six months. And
[3:07:38.200 --> 3:07:43.160]  that would be the second one, second major product that Apple's unveiled with about six months
[3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:48.200]  of headway, you know, the iPhone being the first back in 2007. So if we're right,
[3:07:48.200 --> 3:07:54.440]  if you and I are right about HoloLens being like over a year away from coming to market,
[3:07:54.440 --> 3:08:01.240]  it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. You know, how much does, does do other similar
[3:08:01.240 --> 3:08:06.920]  products come out in the meantime? Uh, do people lose interest? Do people get angry when Christmas
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:10.440]  rolls around and they still can't buy one because everybody assumes because they announced it,
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:15.640]  they're going to be able to get one this year? Well, so I don't think anyone expects it this year,
[3:08:15.640 --> 3:08:19.400]  which is kind of amazing. Oh, I don't know about that. I think, I don't think anybody informed
[3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:26.440]  expects it. I think that if you went out and pulled a thousand people who play Xbox games,
[3:08:26.440 --> 3:08:30.040]  you know, do you think that when do you think HoloLens is coming out? I'll bet you'll get a lot
[3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:34.280]  of people who said this year because why else would they announce it? I think, I don't think people
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:37.640]  think it through. I think casual people just think, well, they announced it and must be coming out
[3:08:37.640 --> 3:08:43.000]  later this year. Maybe, I mean, although the Xbox gamers probably, I mean, project guitar,
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:50.120]  which I think was the connect, I mean, that that was demoed a long time before connect came out.
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:54.360]  Yeah, people have short memories. That's true. They're not very forgiving.
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:09:00.840]  Anyway, we can call it a show. Let's call it a show. Ben Thompson, we just got started three
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:06.600]  hours a minute ago. My thanks to you. I super appreciate your time. Anybody who wants to get more

[3:09:25.640 --> 3:09:31.320]  And anybody who enjoys hearing the dulcetones of your voice can also hear you on your regular
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:41.720]  podcast, exponent at exponent.fm with your co-host James Allworth. Good show. Very good show.
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.520]  You missed the obvious joke, though, that my pronunciation is so bad that I couldn't even decide
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:53.240]  on the pronunciation of my own site. Yeah, well, we always mentioned that. It looks good,
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:59.640]  especially when you see the tech in orange. Yeah, I deserve it. Yeah, we spent the whole show. We
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:03.480]  didn't talk about my switch to all caps headlines on my linked list items. That's right.
[3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:09.000]  You came out as a vocal proponent of, even though everything. Well, I've overpoted of it,
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:14.520]  because it's similar to my site, like my non-made articles. Well, actually, all my articles are,
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:22.600]  but I don't know. For me reading during Fireball, I think I'm not sure I'm a fan. I have to be
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:28.440]  totally honest. Yeah, well, we'll see. We've got to give it a couple of weeks to see. Let
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:38.440]  it breathe. All right. All right, I'm hitting stop.
