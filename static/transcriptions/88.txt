[00:00.000 --> 00:02.680]  How's your week? Oh my god. Oh
[00:07.280 --> 00:09.840]  Geez why did I why did I launch an app? I
[00:11.040 --> 00:12.420]  Forgot how much work this is
[00:12.420 --> 00:15.940]  It's been a while since I've had an app in the store and the last app that was in the store was the magazine
[00:15.940 --> 00:18.140]  Which wasn't very popular and didn't require tech support
[00:19.840 --> 00:21.840]  Man what was I thinking?
[00:23.320 --> 00:25.320]  What what's gone wrong?
[00:25.320 --> 00:32.400]  Um, it's it's mostly the funny thing is it's been a very successful launch overall like there have been very few
[00:34.720 --> 00:38.480]  Real major problems there have been a few minor bugs
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.620]  many of which I've been able to fix server-side just like, you know, some certain podcast feeds weren't being crawled right or something, but
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.200]  Overall the launch have been really good
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.960]  The problem is I've gotten nothing done since yesterday when I launched it because I've been trying to keep up with all the tweet
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.920]  Responses trying to read all the reviews trying to and it you recently charged to try to answer all these emails
[01:02.840 --> 01:04.840]  Yeah, I currently have
[01:05.580 --> 01:07.580]  1099 unread emails on my inbox
[01:08.040 --> 01:12.960]  I've just finally started tackling them tonight after making a bunch of text text spender snippets
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.400]  All the common responses the worst part is the worst part is that that's over a hundred higher than the number you quoted me about
[01:20.640 --> 01:24.240]  Six or seven hours ago when I checked to see if you wanted to be on this show
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.600]  Yeah, and I just bought it to like 150 of them
[01:27.720 --> 01:34.480]  But they're coming in faster. I can respond you're at like 900 around noon or so. Yeah
[01:34.480 --> 01:36.680]  I mean, so I guess that was nine hours ago
[01:36.680 --> 01:40.840]  So that's give you some idea like the over the total downloads of the entire app
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.360]  like the number of people who have even downloaded it not even the people who've made an account just people have downloaded the app at
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.520]  All is roughly 35 to 40 thousand. I don't know. I haven't gotten today's stats yet
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.160]  But so I'm estimating a little bit but roughly 35 or 40 thousand. Wow, and I've gotten I
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.640]  Mean that's and that's a fantastic launch. I'm very happy with that. But
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.120]  Out of those at least 1500 of them have emailed me
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.040]  That seems like a kind of high ratio to me. I don't know that kind of seems too high
[02:09.040 --> 02:15.480]  Yeah, that does seem high but it's I think it's also though the nature though. You're the weird dual nature and you know
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.600]  I'm in the same boat, but but where we're media personalities, you know people read our sites
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.240]  We're sort of have a columnist style and we do podcasts, of course
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.560]  obviously, I think we do I
[02:30.520 --> 02:32.680]  think that encourages a sort of
[02:32.680 --> 02:40.120]  The wanting to give feedback, you know what I mean? Like yeah, and I don't think and again, I yeah
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.240]  I'll bet you'll agree with me
[02:41.240 --> 02:44.960]  I will bet you will agree with me with this that even though you're complaining about being swamped
[02:44.960 --> 02:51.440]  But you're it's a privilege and a thrill that people want to do that and say nice things about your app or ask questions and stuff
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.920]  I don't begrudge it. Oh, definitely
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.020]  I mean, I I really want to do as much of the support of this myself
[02:59.020 --> 03:03.780]  And and I I probably would get saying that. Oh god bless you
[03:04.220 --> 03:09.420]  Well, but what I've done instead is I've tried to ridiculously minimize the number of support emails
[03:09.420 --> 03:11.420]  I actually get so I can actually
[03:11.460 --> 03:16.660]  Treat them like like a human being or at least hire somebody to do it and keep an eye on it very closely
[03:17.020 --> 03:21.300]  Whereas with instant paper, I was never able to do that. There was too much support and that's sort of a
[03:21.300 --> 03:28.420]  a virtuous circle where you being motivated to minimize support issues
[03:29.060 --> 03:32.100]  Design and development wise because you know, you're gonna have to deal with them yourself
[03:33.060 --> 03:37.740]  Means that if you succeed it works and you have less time doing support and vice versa, you know
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.860]  whereas if you had somebody doing support you may not maybe you wouldn't be as
[03:41.860 --> 03:44.900]  You wouldn't care quite as much right? This is something that you know
[03:44.900 --> 03:46.900]  A friend of the universe Daniel Jockut has always said
[03:46.900 --> 03:51.780]  That he I believe this is still the case that he always answers all of his own support email
[03:52.260 --> 03:58.060]  so that he is both, you know on top of issues as they arise and aware of what people are asking for and
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.320]  so that he is motivated to
[04:00.740 --> 04:05.880]  You know fix problems in the app that cause a lot of support issues so that people don't even have to email it
[04:06.140 --> 04:10.080]  So, you know everyone wins there. So I'm trying it out. I'll see I mean I
[04:11.580 --> 04:14.660]  Don't have any idea what the like stable
[04:14.660 --> 04:15.980]  Email
[04:15.980 --> 04:22.900]  Email rate will be you know, I five weeks from now on a Tuesday, you know, what's what's gonna be the email rate that day?
[04:22.900 --> 04:23.900]  I don't know
[04:23.900 --> 04:26.740]  So I'll see if I can still handle it myself
[04:26.740 --> 04:31.620]  I would like to do as much about myself in the early days as possible like this this initial batch of oh
[04:32.020 --> 04:37.240]  Now it's 1100 got one more this this initial patch of 1100 plus emails
[04:37.740 --> 04:43.140]  I would like to go through myself just so I have some idea like what are people asking for what you know?
[04:43.140 --> 04:45.180]  What what should I be doing differently?
[04:45.180 --> 04:49.120]  What what is confusing people about the app that I should they should you know?
[04:49.120 --> 04:56.100]  Think about rearranging or relabeling or rethinking. I know I know cable Sasser does the same thing with major releases
[04:57.300 --> 04:59.060]  I don't know if he does it with every major release
[04:59.060 --> 05:04.620]  But I know that he's done that like and I don't think he hesitates to dive into the support on a regular basis
[05:04.620 --> 05:08.900]  But like when they launch like coda, you know, I don't know 4.0 whatever the next version is
[05:08.900 --> 05:14.260]  He'll spend like that that like 36 hour manic period of okay. It is out
[05:16.260 --> 05:23.340]  On the front lines of the support queue, you know working through it because he wants that experience he wants to see that, you know
[05:24.020 --> 05:26.740]  Initial feedback and it's true. It's valuable
[05:26.740 --> 05:34.100]  There's there's like an endorphin high of a big release like this that and it to me it it's you know
[05:34.100 --> 05:36.460]  In hindsight, you're gonna look back and say this was a great week
[05:36.460 --> 05:42.820]  If it's you know, as long as the launch is successful and it's not something like holy crap the you know
[05:42.820 --> 05:49.980]  The server actually can't you know take more than 100 users and that I lucked out big time with that because I was that's what I
[05:49.980 --> 05:53.460]  Was most worried about I had forgotten about the the concept of support email
[05:53.460 --> 05:59.460]  I was much more worried about the servers holding up and because I didn't really I couldn't really predict
[06:00.100 --> 06:02.100]  How heavy the load would be on the server?
[06:02.100 --> 06:08.420]  So I went to line ode where all my stuff is a couple days ago and I just added like eight new servers
[06:08.420 --> 06:11.740]  Yes, because because you can add and destroy them whenever you want. They're built hourly
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.140]  So it's like, you know
[06:13.140 --> 06:16.660]  let me just add way more capacity than I think I will need and
[06:16.860 --> 06:19.980]  and make a way that I can easily clone them if I need even more than that and
[06:20.620 --> 06:22.940]  And then you know, I can always take them all down next week
[06:22.980 --> 06:23.480]  Yeah
[06:23.480 --> 06:31.260]  and and you you have the advantage where you've done large scale things before instapaper had a ton of users and you know,
[06:31.260 --> 06:33.260]  you know a lot like
[06:34.260 --> 06:39.440]  Overcast is largely, you know, it's the whole thing is the whole premise is built on this the server
[06:40.860 --> 06:43.820]  Tumblr obviously, I think has a fair number of users a
[06:45.220 --> 06:46.700]  Little bit. Yep
[06:46.700 --> 06:50.700]  And even you know, however much smaller they were when you left tumblr
[06:50.700 --> 06:53.860]  The tumblr was a big-ass website when you left. Yeah
[06:53.860 --> 06:59.620]  I mean when I left if I screwed up I would serve about 1200 error pages per second, right? Well, there you go
[06:59.620 --> 07:05.760]  that's that's kind of pressuring but the thing and so Brent Simmons was in the same boat and I will return to this because one
[07:05.760 --> 07:11.360]  Of the reasons are I'm so interested by overcast is I do see some a fair number of similarities
[07:12.180 --> 07:14.180]  situation wise with Vesper
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.940]  And design wise even but
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.880]  One of the things was that Brent has built large-scale, you know online things, you know
[07:21.880 --> 07:26.020]  There's net news wire syncing some of the other stuff he did at Newsgator
[07:26.020 --> 07:30.460]  So I felt really good being you know, having nothing to do with writing the code
[07:32.020 --> 07:34.220]  Betting on Brent Simmons and it did work out
[07:34.220 --> 07:39.260]  We had a great launch the sync wall went fine and I would have been just as happy betting on you know
[07:39.540 --> 07:43.860]  Overcast and Marco Arman having a good thing because experience really matters
[07:43.860 --> 07:48.020]  But on the other hand and Brent, you know had a couple of these things in mind
[07:48.020 --> 07:56.260]  Especially for online stuff every couple of years the state-of-the-art changes and there's little things that are new and different, right?
[07:56.260 --> 07:58.180]  It didn't used to be that you could go to
[07:58.180 --> 08:03.180]  Li node and say you know what give me a couple of extra database servers. You couldn't do that
[08:03.180 --> 08:09.580]  Oh, yeah, right and so in in in the large part and I think the reason by both his launches went well
[08:09.580 --> 08:11.140]  Those things work really well
[08:11.140 --> 08:16.860]  But you just never know because there might be something there might be something that you overlook because that's what bugs are bugs are
[08:16.860 --> 08:20.580]  Always things that you overlook and you can say here's all that
[08:20.580 --> 08:24.940]  Here's the seven things that have bit me before scaling wise and I'm gonna make sure all seven of these I've handled
[08:24.940 --> 08:29.060]  Well, there might be a new one an eighth one that you don't know about and then all of a sudden
[08:29.420 --> 08:35.500]  You've got a big launch. All these websites are writing about you. You're on the front page of this website that website
[08:35.860 --> 08:41.300]  all sorts of Twitter's going nuts people talking about it and your server is down and
[08:41.300 --> 08:46.500]  And yeah, it would you know, you probably would be a much less happy Marco
[08:46.500 --> 08:47.340]  Oh, yeah
[08:47.340 --> 08:52.520]  and you know because the difference like I mean I did a beta test with about 40 people for about two months and
[08:52.940 --> 08:58.060]  40 people because Apple has not as far as I know it rolled out that new testing thing it that they made test flight
[08:58.060 --> 09:00.860]  Into no, so you're still limited to a hundred device slots
[09:01.060 --> 09:05.760]  So 40 people if you want to leave any room for anyone to get new phones in the fall or anyone to have an iPad
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.860]  That's about as big of a group as you can do
[09:08.220 --> 09:09.420]  and
[09:09.420 --> 09:13.940]  You know III this was the biggest beta I've ever done by a long shot the longest beta
[09:13.940 --> 09:18.580]  I've ever done and the beta uncut didn't cover tons of issues and which I'm very thankful for
[09:19.140 --> 09:20.540]  and
[09:20.540 --> 09:24.980]  yet there were there are still bugs that none of us found because the difference between
[09:25.500 --> 09:27.780]  40 people and you know
[09:28.460 --> 09:34.020]  30,000 people is is substantial and out of the and out of the 40, you know
[09:34.020 --> 09:37.820]  We were mostly it was mostly people I know like you and you know other like tech people
[09:37.820 --> 09:40.820]  so it wasn't a very diverse group and so certain things like
[09:41.060 --> 09:44.500]  We just never ran into because that isn't how we use the podcast app
[09:44.620 --> 09:45.220]  You know
[09:45.220 --> 09:47.900]  Whereas a lot of people do runs that any any
[09:48.060 --> 09:53.060]  that's part of a problem of I'd love to hear an example of that if you can think of one that's good like if there's like
[09:53.060 --> 09:54.580]  already like a
[09:54.580 --> 09:56.420]  frequently
[09:56.420 --> 09:59.020]  Run into oh, yeah sharp edge or something like that
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.100]  What do you think what do you think the average number of podcasts is that somebody subscribes to?
[10:06.100 --> 10:08.100]  three
[10:08.580 --> 10:12.740]  Yeah, right. I mean, you know ruling out anyone who's who does zero, you know, obviously, right
[10:13.980 --> 10:19.140]  So I don't I don't have that number available for overcast yet. However, I have heard from many people
[10:20.260 --> 10:27.180]  Apparently my opml importer is having problems for people who have opml files that have like a hundred feeds in them
[10:27.700 --> 10:30.100]  And there's a lot of these people who keep telling me this
[10:30.100 --> 10:38.420]  and I like I listen to my my feed list is about 35 or 40 long because a lot of those are shows that that are
[10:38.420 --> 10:43.420]  Retired or on a hiatus or a lot of them are shows that I like I had one episode of but I didn't subscribe to
[10:43.420 --> 10:46.460]  The whole show and they they're still on my list. I haven't deleted them
[10:47.140 --> 10:49.780]  And so the number of podcasts I listen to
[10:50.540 --> 10:54.380]  Actively that you know at new that actually produce new episodes every week
[10:54.380 --> 10:58.880]  It's probably about 10 maybe and that I consider myself a heavy podcast listener
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.640]  and
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.280]  But compared to the general public like there are these edge cases out there
[11:05.280 --> 11:11.680]  there are these people who listen to over a hundred one guy complained that his had over 150 and I couldn't import it properly and
[11:12.520 --> 11:14.520]  I just never considered
[11:14.520 --> 11:17.520]  and that also that also creates problems, you know, the my
[11:18.080 --> 11:21.880]  The problem with opml is that there's no way to specify
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.680]  Episodes you can only say which podcast you subscribe to it's in other words in other words
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.920]  It's the the URL of the podcast feed not the URL of the episode, correct?
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.560]  And that's it. And so it the opml standard cannot communicate to be no between apps
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.920]  What you know whether you've heard all the episodes or not, which ones are unplayed how far you've gotten in them
[11:43.920 --> 11:50.600]  It only knows which podcasts you subscribe to a period that's it. Well, that's not and to be pedantic here
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.040]  I'll fill in for Syracuse
[11:52.040 --> 11:59.440]  It's not really a limit of opml in general because I believe opml is a general purpose outliner file format
[11:59.440 --> 12:06.280]  It's it's the specific flavor of opml that is widely understood as the lingua Frank Frank
[12:06.280 --> 12:13.840]  Well, how do you say that lingua Franca? I don't know of sharing person of sharing a list of feeds that you subscribe to
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.680]  And that's right. It's true for RSS readers, too. It's probably the exact same format and and there's actually a very good reason why
[12:20.680 --> 12:29.400]  Nobody's implemented episode exporting and importing it's mostly because there is no good way to uniquely identify the episodes
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.600]  Yeah, I would have mad because GU IDs are not required in the standards
[12:34.280 --> 12:37.680]  So so there's and there's a lot of feeds that do GU IDs wrong
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.040]  anyway
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.880]  and aren't there some feeds that you couldn't even use the URL for the audio file because there's some
[12:43.040 --> 12:49.720]  Aren't there some shows where they'll give it and they'll put two in and they'll say like here's here's two different formats MP3 and m4a
[12:49.720 --> 12:55.640]  Oh, yeah, there's even still some people who put in ogg vorbis and then there's there's a new format called ogg opus
[12:55.640 --> 13:01.040]  I think that I've met I didn't even hear of until yesterday. I I don't know how popular it is. But yeah just to give you
[13:02.080 --> 13:05.000]  I think that tells you how popular it is probably
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.840]  But but yeah, and so like there's and you know now I'm dealing with broken feeds, you know feeds that have clearly broken markup
[13:13.880 --> 13:15.800]  But you know that people are angry about that
[13:15.800 --> 13:18.920]  I don't support and so I have to figure out how to support them and it's a mess
[13:18.920 --> 13:24.100]  But anyway, so the one of the biggest complaints I've gotten is from people who subscribe to a lot of shows
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.760]  my my default behavior when importing opml is
[13:28.160 --> 13:33.520]  I will assume that you want the one most recent episode in every one of those feeds listed
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.680]  That is a bad assumption. Yeah
[13:37.760 --> 13:40.280]  And so when you have 150 feeds
[13:40.280 --> 13:43.640]  I try to immediately download 150 episodes and
[13:43.640 --> 13:49.960]  people are complaining that I'm filling up their phones because all of a sudden they have three gigs of podcast downloaded after their import and
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.040]  They and I don't have like a bulk cancel operation
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.960]  And again, this is something that that is a valid problem. I didn't think of it. It never came up in beta
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.280]  I have to figure out some good way to solve that now, but that is very much a valid problem
[14:05.720 --> 14:11.880]  yeah, and I'm I was a bad tester for that because I don't keep like an archive of
[14:11.880 --> 14:17.480]  Old shows like I don't want I don't have a subscription to hypercritical anymore
[14:17.480 --> 14:22.960]  Just because I want to go back and listen to if I do it might strike me my fancy someday
[14:22.960 --> 14:25.920]  But then I would I wouldn't think I want to have subscription to it
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.260]  I would think I'll go in a directory find it find the episode
[14:30.260 --> 14:32.760]  I want and play and then add it there
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.280]  I would never think I want to even though I understand the mindset that someone would want to do that
[14:37.280 --> 14:42.200]  Here's the 150 podcasts I've ever been interested in and I want to move this file around from app to app
[14:42.520 --> 14:49.200]  My mind that that seems crazy to me a new I kind of like the idea of switching and trying a new podcast
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.460]  App every once in a while just to start clean and say here. Let me find two or three shows
[14:54.460 --> 14:57.580]  I want to listen to I've got a long drive ahead of me, right?
[14:57.580 --> 14:59.820]  And I think it's easier because you know despite those outliers
[15:00.040 --> 15:05.760]  You know like RSS has always had that problem where usually people listen there are people subscribe to
[15:05.760 --> 15:08.720]  Usually a pretty good number of RSS feeds if they use it at all
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.680]  Like I subscribe to probably 200 RSS feeds and again, most of them don't get every day. So it's easy to follow
[15:15.200 --> 15:20.840]  But podcasts, you know, there's there's a limit on how many podcasts you can listen to on a regular basis
[15:20.840 --> 15:24.120]  And so I always assume the numbers would be substantially lower
[15:24.360 --> 15:29.060]  For your number of podcast feeds that most people be subscribed to I assume that would be a very low number
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.200]  And yeah turns out not necessarily a safe assumption
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.960]  Right. So what what they want is they want to be able to maybe even default to zero
[15:38.320 --> 15:43.060]  Downloads per podcast and then go through and then change it from there
[15:43.680 --> 15:48.000]  right, and I think honestly, I mean a safe default might be zero and
[15:48.340 --> 15:51.060]  Just just make people pick one from everything, you know
[15:51.060 --> 15:54.580]  Like I think my assumption that you want the latest one from everything is
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.000]  Probably problematic enough that I should probably change it because I can change that one server-side
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.840]  Yeah, maybe that's a good one that you'd want to do if I add and just a single new subscription in the app
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.800]  Maybe assume I want to get the most recent episode. But if I'm importing an opml file don't assume I want any of the episodes
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.580]  Yeah, I mean that's that is certainly well actually no
[16:15.580 --> 16:20.020]  I think I think my default behavior now is that if you tap subscribe on a new show
[16:20.020 --> 16:24.040]  I download the latest episode if you add it from the directory, which so that I think that is a safe assumption
[16:24.040 --> 16:27.120]  But yeah, I think you're right with opml it I think I think it isn't
[16:27.120 --> 16:29.800]  So yeah, I think maybe I'll change that later tonight after I'm done with you. Yeah
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.280]  That leads directly to another question I've had and I've seen it and I'm not even following
[16:37.800 --> 16:43.360]  Anywhere nearly as religiously as I'm sure you are on Twitter the day one commentary about it
[16:43.360 --> 16:46.680]  But I've seen a lot of people remark about the lack of streaming
[16:47.920 --> 16:50.840]  yes, that that is a big one and I
[16:50.840 --> 16:58.240]  I again, I never really noticed I guess I have because I guess there have been times like I've been trying to
[17:00.320 --> 17:03.400]  To run on a more regular basis and I that's you know
[17:03.400 --> 17:07.040]  One of the times where I do listen to podcasts and it'll be like hey
[17:07.040 --> 17:09.820]  I know that there's got to be a new ATP out
[17:11.320 --> 17:13.320]  Let me go look and
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.620]  There it is and I do I have to wait until I get the whole thing before I go out
[17:17.620 --> 17:21.840]  But I don't have to wait that long that it would ever even have occurred to me to
[17:22.400 --> 17:24.000]  you know write in as a
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.720]  suggestion that I would like to just leave the house and have it stream over LTE or something like that because it doesn't take that
[17:29.720 --> 17:32.860]  Long for you know a hundred and some megabyte
[17:33.800 --> 17:37.720]  File but it seems like lots of people want that what they want is
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.600]  They want it to start downloading and playing at the same time. Oh, yeah and and streaming it's you know
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.000]  It isn't there because it's it's hard to do and I didn't have time to do it and it's going to take months to do
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  It right. That's why it's not there
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.400]  You know, a lot of people assume that I just forgot to add it. It's just some oversight, right? Just just
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.040]  That's what I check box that's what I figured the answer is that the answer is that it's not it's like a lot of these
[18:04.040 --> 18:06.320]  Things it's not easy. It's really hard and
[18:07.120 --> 18:13.080]  And it's harder for me because of my audio engine like it's it's easier for the other players that that don't use the low-level
[18:13.080 --> 18:17.360]  Stuff that I do to do my audio effects. It's easier for them, but it's a lot easier for them
[18:17.360 --> 18:19.360]  The way I'm gonna have to do it is gonna be more
[18:19.560 --> 18:22.420]  manual like I'm gonna have to build more of those parts from scratch, but
[18:23.160 --> 18:29.400]  The main argument for it. I mean first of all, I think the I think the need for it is exaggerated on day one
[18:30.000 --> 18:31.920]  because so many people
[18:31.920 --> 18:35.660]  Want to just jump in and try and try playing it and they have to wait for their files to download
[18:36.120 --> 18:42.120]  Whereas if you just use the app regularly most new episodes you'll get we push to you in the background and you won't even notice
[18:42.120 --> 18:44.680]  Them downloading about time, you know, you launch the app next. They're just there
[18:45.320 --> 18:48.520]  so, you know background download I think removes much of the need but
[18:49.040 --> 18:51.040]  There are still situations where you need
[18:51.720 --> 18:55.080]  where streaming is very nice to have the big two are
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.660]  Immediate feedback like if you just wanted to add an episode and listen to it right now
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.480]  like right as you add it then you want to hear it you can start playing it immediately and then the second big one is
[19:04.880 --> 19:10.520]  if you like a lot of the other clients offer a streaming only mode where
[19:10.520 --> 19:15.280]  Nothing is ever downloaded. You only ever stream things and that way you don't use any disk space
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.600]  See now that that would never even occur to me and it's it's a really good idea and like it
[19:20.600 --> 19:22.240]  You know if you think about you know for me
[19:22.240 --> 19:23.600]  I would never use it because I you know
[19:23.600 --> 19:29.240]  I have I live in an area that has spotty reception and I often you know travel and go upstate or on a plane or
[19:29.240 --> 19:33.640]  Something and so I I want everything to be just downloaded and there and ready
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.960]  But a lot of people don't work that way a lot of people
[19:36.960 --> 19:41.560]  want everything to always only be streamed and leave all the space free on their phone and
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.980]  We'll see what happens like with iOS 8 with the new photo management thing
[19:46.840 --> 19:52.340]  You know, maybe maybe there won't be as much of a space crunch on iOS devices as there used to be who knows
[19:53.080 --> 19:57.040]  But either way I am gonna add streaming. It's just a matter of of doing it
[19:57.040 --> 20:04.000]  We're just gonna probably gonna take a few months. Yeah, it seems like there's that's actually sort of under the radar like one of the big
[20:04.000 --> 20:11.080]  Priorities of iOS 8 is space management because they're doing it. It's a similar thing. They're doing with
[20:12.840 --> 20:14.040]  Messages
[20:14.040 --> 20:20.720]  Where exactly it's defaulting to not keeping the images and it to other attachments that you've been sent
[20:20.720 --> 20:26.000]  And I think part of that is a sort of trend towards privacy in
[20:26.520 --> 20:32.240]  General and you know things like snapchat and stuff like that where it works like that and people seem to like it
[20:32.240 --> 20:35.680]  And maybe it just never occurred to them before but I think another big part of it
[20:35.680 --> 20:39.280]  is that you know, even for me, it was not like a super heavy texture, but
[20:40.640 --> 20:46.120]  Whiskas and I communicate a lot about Vesper. I've got tons of screenshots in my iMessages with him
[20:47.360 --> 20:51.480]  If I look in the usage, I do have a couple of gigabytes
[20:51.480 --> 20:56.880]  I don't know four four four five gigabytes in messages and there's no way to get them to get them out
[20:56.880 --> 21:02.120]  I mean, I think you can go through one by one, but you know that that's that way lies madness, right?
[21:02.120 --> 21:07.600]  Or you can delete the entire conversation with Dave Whiskas and lose that entire history. Yeah, which I don't want to do
[21:07.640 --> 21:14.760]  Yeah, and and it's also the way the weird way iMessage works where I've actually got like seven conversations with Whiskas
[21:14.760 --> 21:21.800]  I don't know if they're based on different, you know, like his phone number to my Apple ID my Apple ID to his Apple ID
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.880]  I don't I don't know quite know how that counts
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.620]  but everyone's you know, that would be less I would probably be easier to delete seven conversations with them, but
[21:28.620 --> 21:34.020]  But you know, who knows how much of those gigabytes is all sorts of other people too
[21:34.020 --> 21:36.940]  And I'd have to keep deleting all those things. I don't know one thing
[21:36.940 --> 21:42.580]  I don't know and I would love to know the answer to maybe somebody who's upgraded their regular phone to iOS 8 betas would know
[21:42.580 --> 21:48.980]  Whether that applies to your old messages like if you upgrade your phone to iOS 8
[21:49.180 --> 21:56.220]  Well that that new world only apply to new messages as they come in or is iOS 8 going to do something smart
[21:56.220 --> 21:59.380]  about your archive of old images
[21:59.740 --> 22:03.580]  That's a tough one because you certainly you can see the other problem is like, you know
[22:03.580 --> 22:06.220]  If if they just default to all right
[22:06.220 --> 22:09.100]  We're just gonna stop keeping all old stuff by default
[22:09.100 --> 22:14.740]  Then as soon as you upgrade to iOS 8 all your old messages get deleted and that's that's kind of bad
[22:15.500 --> 22:18.500]  So I can see the problem there, right? It's one thing if
[22:19.220 --> 22:24.860]  New messages start coming in with that little keep button and you you know, even if you don't quite notice it right away
[22:24.860 --> 22:29.180]  Well, it was there and you had the opportunity to press keep it's another thing to say
[22:29.180 --> 22:29.500]  Yeah
[22:29.500 --> 22:32.820]  all those messages you got over the last three years that
[22:33.220 --> 22:36.020]  You never even had to worry about whether they were going to be kept or not
[22:36.020 --> 22:39.980]  You you knew they were gonna be kept. Yeah, we did you a favor and deleted them, right?
[22:39.980 --> 22:42.100]  I mean, I think what would probably make more sense
[22:42.660 --> 22:48.780]  Would be to treat those attachments just like entries in your photos library
[22:48.780 --> 22:50.980]  Where they are all kept on iCloud
[22:50.980 --> 22:55.780]  And then they can just be pulled down on demand if you if you actually scroll up and go like, you know
[22:55.780 --> 22:58.660]  Three years back in history. They can be pulled off the off the network
[22:58.660 --> 23:01.340]  Yeah, that would make that makes a lot of sense have it use your storage
[23:01.340 --> 23:04.740]  But unfortunately with some people that might use a ton of storage, right? Yeah
[23:04.740 --> 23:09.180]  I was just about to say it the problem is that it for a lot of people a couple of gigs of
[23:10.020 --> 23:16.580]  iMessage images is probably pretty close to the number of gigs they have in in their iCloud storage, right? Exactly
[23:16.580 --> 23:18.820]  Yeah, and there's also a lot of duplication
[23:18.820 --> 23:21.180]  I think like like if you send a picture to somebody
[23:21.780 --> 23:23.780]  Do you not have two copies of that in your storage?
[23:24.620 --> 23:28.260]  Like like the one in your camera roll and when you sent them, I don't know like I don't know how that works
[23:28.260 --> 23:30.260]  Yeah, I do think that
[23:31.140 --> 23:33.140]  That's a good question. I think you might
[23:35.980 --> 23:41.140]  Because it might also I don't even know I actually never even checked whether they like shrink them at all or anything
[23:41.140 --> 23:43.180]  I don't think they do
[23:43.180 --> 23:48.980]  but I don't know that's a good question and when you do get a copy like when you you definitely get a dupe when you
[23:48.980 --> 23:56.180]  Take the photo with your phone and then you switch to your iPad or your Mac or something and the conversation is over there, too
[23:56.180 --> 23:58.900]  That's obviously a copy of the image, right? Exactly
[24:00.180 --> 24:02.180]  Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question
[24:02.180 --> 24:12.900]  Obviously something you have to concern yourself about though. That's one area where you know overcast. I think it's in a unique situation where you
[24:12.900 --> 24:20.340]  Know you some some users might reasonably want overcast to literally take up a majority of the storage on their device
[24:20.580 --> 24:27.180]  You know somebody with a 64 gigabyte iPhone might might actually want a podcast app that that
[24:27.180 --> 24:32.740]  Stores about 40 gigabytes of podcasts, right, you know, especially if you're going on a trip or something
[24:32.740 --> 24:35.140]  And you're gonna be without coverage or you're going international
[24:35.140 --> 24:38.700]  you don't want to use data roaming or or you're just going out for a while and
[24:38.900 --> 24:43.940]  You're in a country where cell coverage or cell data is very expensive, you know, either way
[24:44.500 --> 24:48.180]  you know, there are so many reasons why you want it downloaded and
[24:48.660 --> 24:53.040]  Why you want it to be taking up space in your phone rather than requiring it to be streamed constantly
[24:53.040 --> 24:59.280]  but the other side of that is probably just as frequent which is you have, you know, a 16 gig device and it's full and
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.200]  You want to download some podcast and you don't have enough space and that sucks
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.440]  and so like I can see both sides of the argument, but
[25:07.240 --> 25:09.640]  There's also a problem in having the app
[25:10.360 --> 25:17.960]  offer a very healthy blend of those two things because then everything becomes way more complicated both the both the code and
[25:17.960 --> 25:22.360]  the interface because then you have to you have to like manage these states and offer ways for people to like
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.600]  Transform our stream into a download or you know
[25:25.600 --> 25:32.120]  delete something but leave it streamable and and all these things that really complicate the interface and and the data model and then and even
[25:32.400 --> 25:36.760]  The mental model of the user as to know like do I have this thing or not?
[25:37.400 --> 25:39.400]  That's I'm trying to keep it very simple
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.960]  so that people can
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.080]  Can know what what's happening? They can know what they have by looking at it
[25:46.080 --> 25:47.280]  They can see they can tell okay
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.680]  I have this file and they can be kind of assured of that and they can depend on that, you know
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.080]  but it's it's hard this and this is why podcast apps are so challenging to make I think because
[25:56.840 --> 26:01.520]  It's one of those categories like to-do lists where like it seems simple at first and then you start getting
[26:02.200 --> 26:04.200]  Requests from people and you start realizing wait a minute
[26:04.280 --> 26:07.480]  There is not only is there no way to satisfy all of them
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.800]  No, like any change you make is going to satisfy this group, but anger this other group
[26:12.520 --> 26:15.740]  but also that the problem space is so
[26:15.740 --> 26:22.260]  Complicated of what somebody might want and exactly how they might want it that there is infinite potential
[26:22.700 --> 26:27.640]  For improvement for every person. No one is ever a hundred percent satisfied with their podcast app
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.900]  everyone's always like 60% satisfied and I'm you know, so I made one that
[26:33.740 --> 26:37.060]  Satisfies my 60% I'm very happy with it
[26:38.180 --> 26:42.800]  But it's it's never gonna appeal to everyone and it's not even close
[26:42.800 --> 26:49.220]  I think that's another it's one of the broad areas where I see it is similar to Vesper in that there's a ton of
[26:49.780 --> 26:54.460]  Notes apps and right looting one that ships with the system from Apple
[26:55.980 --> 27:01.740]  That's not horrible, you know and and it is there it's you know, it's it's at least you know
[27:01.740 --> 27:05.220]  One of the things I like about it though is at least you see where Apple's coming from with it
[27:05.220 --> 27:09.300]  So you don't have to worry like it's more worrisome if Apple doesn't have an app in your category
[27:09.300 --> 27:15.380]  Right, like it was you're always wondering like either why isn't there an app in my category?
[27:15.380 --> 27:17.380]  does my category suck that badly or
[27:18.020 --> 27:21.740]  What will happen if they make one right like then they'll crush us all, you know
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.780]  And even if it ends up not being crushing
[27:23.780 --> 27:25.100]  It's it's stressful
[27:25.100 --> 27:30.320]  Like you must have gone through that with the reading list because you start hearing about it before it comes out
[27:30.540 --> 27:32.580]  Then they announce it and then you have to worry
[27:32.580 --> 27:36.540]  Well, how popular is it going to be it's coming out in three months when the beta is over
[27:37.220 --> 27:38.740]  and
[27:38.740 --> 27:42.780]  It's stressful. I mean I you know, it's better to know that wow
[27:42.780 --> 27:45.380]  Here's Apple's podcast app and here's all the reasons
[27:45.380 --> 27:50.860]  I don't like it and I know that there's a lot of other people who don't like it and they're probably not going to
[27:51.660 --> 27:54.060]  Wipe it out and start over. I don't think
[27:54.700 --> 27:59.980]  Well, and and you know, there are things about Apple's podcast app that are the way they are
[28:00.700 --> 28:06.380]  Because that's how Apple does things or because there's a strategy tax in place. Like there's there's a certain amount of
[28:06.380 --> 28:08.380]  Of
[28:08.660 --> 28:14.300]  Cludginess in the app that is entirely because it has to use the iTunes podcast directory
[28:14.300 --> 28:17.780]  well, and it has to be tied so so firmly to that and
[28:19.220 --> 28:24.300]  So like they can't do anything that that like breaks that it has to cater to a casual
[28:24.300 --> 28:28.340]  I don't even I don't even know what a podcast is yet person in certain arrays
[28:28.340 --> 28:34.140]  And it also it has to it has to cater to every territory in the world every language in the world
[28:34.140 --> 28:37.220]  every genre of podcasts in the world and
[28:38.860 --> 28:42.700]  It and like, you know think about like whenever the podcast app team
[28:43.220 --> 28:47.780]  Wants to get something changed or improved about the API to the store
[28:48.060 --> 28:49.980]  How likely is that to really happen?
[28:49.980 --> 28:54.420]  You know like inside Apple, you know that the iTunes store team has enough to do
[28:54.420 --> 28:59.540]  Do you think if the podcast team if the podcast app on iOS team makes a request?
[28:59.540 --> 29:05.900]  How higher priority is that really to the to the iTunes store team? That's that's all this other stuff to do with
[29:05.900 --> 29:09.940]  You know the more high-profile things like the App Store and the music store, you know, and so
[29:10.940 --> 29:16.700]  The Apple podcast app is always gonna be limited by that plus it's limited by Apple's like 80% strategy
[29:16.700 --> 29:18.900]  Yeah, you know where they they're they're never going to do
[29:19.580 --> 29:21.580]  features that are as
[29:21.580 --> 29:27.700]  nerdy as like my playlists like the way I do playlists is so crazy with all that these filters and everything and it's it's
[29:27.700 --> 29:33.460]  It's a playlist system for nerds and Apple's never gonna do one like that because that's not the way to do things
[29:33.460 --> 29:36.020]  Yeah, I don't think so either. And in fact, it might even
[29:37.540 --> 29:42.740]  Might even be problematic for them in the way that their podcast app for iOS
[29:43.780 --> 29:45.460]  is
[29:45.460 --> 29:47.460]  Has like this weird
[29:47.580 --> 29:54.860]  Relationship with iTunes on Mac and Windows which is where you let you know Apple's solution for how you listen to podcasts on your Mac
[29:54.860 --> 30:00.260]  Or PC where playlist has a very different word. I mean, maybe they could just add I
[30:00.820 --> 30:04.820]  Guess they could maybe piggyback on playlists that include audio file, you know
[30:04.820 --> 30:10.780]  Regular audio files from your library or whatever, but that just turns it into more of a mess in my mind, right?
[30:10.780 --> 30:14.480]  And well, that's why like when the Apple put the Apple podcast I've added something
[30:14.480 --> 30:17.260]  I believe they call it channels, which is basically a smart playlist
[30:17.260 --> 30:21.700]  It's you can just select like select which feeds go into this and that's your playlist
[30:21.700 --> 30:25.940]  And they added that to the podcast app and I think the reason they had to call it channels
[30:25.940 --> 30:30.060]  Yeah, that's probably mean something else in the in iTunes land. I I never thought about that
[30:30.060 --> 30:34.420]  I was always confused as hell by their channels. I thought their channels were a little bit more like
[30:35.220 --> 30:41.340]  Categories in the store and and I think that's why I found it so confusing is that they're not really categories in the store
[30:41.340 --> 30:47.460]  They are probably more like it would have made more sense to me if they call them channels and then in parentheses playlists, right?
[30:47.460 --> 30:51.060]  Yeah smart playlist. That's what they are. They're smart playlists for podcasts
[30:51.060 --> 30:54.580]  It's has there ever been anything in the history of technology
[30:55.460 --> 30:57.380]  after the television
[30:57.380 --> 31:02.540]  Where the word channels was used for something that ended up being a success. That's an excellent question
[31:03.100 --> 31:09.140]  Because it's been used in a bunch of like half-assed terrible things like the windows 98 channels bar on active desktop
[31:09.140 --> 31:15.180]  Yeah, anybody who's listening to the show actually remembers that you don't you were a Mac person. You probably saw it. No, no, it was very lucky
[31:15.180 --> 31:23.020]  Imagine imagine Microsoft at its worst at a time when when PC hardware was at its worst
[31:23.860 --> 31:25.340]  where
[31:25.340 --> 31:27.340]  The software was trying to do way too much
[31:27.700 --> 31:32.900]  Web technologies were brand new and this is when Microsoft tried to integrate IE into the desktop
[31:32.940 --> 31:35.540]  so that the desktop was basically a giant web view on
[31:36.700 --> 31:41.820]  Hardware that was like a Pentium 90 with 16 megs of RAM like
[31:41.820 --> 31:48.220]  It was it was an awful time to be a PC user and and there are many awful times to be a PC user
[31:48.220 --> 31:54.500]  But I think like 1997 was a particularly awful one. That's pretty bad for being a Mac user, too
[31:55.020 --> 31:57.420]  Yeah at their point just a bad year for computers
[31:57.420 --> 32:03.500]  There's as Steve Jobs called it in the interview in the interview with cringey a dark ages of computing. Yeah, exactly
[32:04.100 --> 32:09.080]  Yeah, he was not that far off about that. Yeah, it was bad for everybody, you know next had like three developers
[32:09.080 --> 32:14.560]  Like a really cool system in like six apps and they were super expensive
[32:15.120 --> 32:17.280]  You know the the machines that could run it
[32:18.360 --> 32:23.520]  Maybe by 97, I guess they ran on PCs. It was net next step or open step
[32:24.400 --> 32:26.400]  But like no market whatsoever
[32:27.680 --> 32:35.440]  Macs were part of a company that was dying and had no no no real operating system. No modern operating system and
[32:35.440 --> 32:39.120]  And then Microsoft beyond Microsoft was so powerful
[32:40.240 --> 32:44.720]  Yeah, and they shipped Windows 98. They just gave in to all of their worst impulses
[32:45.240 --> 32:47.600]  So bad, it was so so bad
[32:48.480 --> 32:55.800]  and the internet was you know, the internet was so new in 97 that everyone was like the most used application on your computer started to
[32:55.800 --> 33:01.120]  Become the web browser, but web browsers were so bad and the hardware was so primitive and there was no RAM
[33:01.120 --> 33:06.960]  So just 1997 just sounds like hard drives grinding as everything just swaps constantly
[33:06.960 --> 33:13.080]  That's that's the entire year of thing was just swapping for a year and waiting for dial-up. Yeah, exactly. That's it. Yep. Oh
[33:16.520 --> 33:19.760]  My god things that you just could not even imagine explaining
[33:20.360 --> 33:24.960]  To your kids today would be the dial-up dial-up is impossible
[33:24.960 --> 33:32.480]  You can explain slow internet but dial-up was so much worse than being slow because I remember being I can't remember when
[33:33.200 --> 33:39.360]  Eventually, I think we eventually Amy and I eventually broke down and bought a second phone line got a second number just for internet
[33:40.920 --> 33:46.000]  But I remember it just you know, and I understand this stuff and I was able to set up a thing
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.800]  I'm gonna I'm gonna draw a blank on the software, but it was by a
[33:49.800 --> 33:56.180]  Great indie Mac developer named Peter sichel. I'm gonna have to take a moment here and Google this and look him up
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.680]  But he had this great Mac utility that would let you share a dial-up with multiple Macs on your local network
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.600]  So Amy and I could both get on the internet at the same time and she could just she didn't have the modem hooked up
[34:09.600 --> 34:11.080]  The whole modem was hooked up to my machine
[34:11.080 --> 34:17.420]  But she could just get on the internet go check email and then you know, wait the 90 seconds for the whole thing
[34:17.420 --> 34:22.480]  But then she'd have internet, you know with just one modem shared between us and we could both be on at the same time
[34:22.960 --> 34:24.960]  Yeah, that was unheard of back then. Oh
[34:25.680 --> 34:27.680]  Game changer. It was awesome
[34:28.680 --> 34:34.600]  This is where I need I need the forum that you guys have the live audience because somebody would get a chair. I
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.880]  Don't know. This is pretty obscure even our chat. I'm not sure. Yeah, but I just feel like Peter sichel s I ch
[34:40.880 --> 34:43.640]  El sustainable softworks. Let me see what?
[34:43.640 --> 34:48.840]  I don't remember the name of it. But yeah, I'll give you I'll give a shout out to it
[34:48.840 --> 34:54.600]  He's still got his URL. Sust works as you st works calm. I
[34:55.440 --> 35:00.160]  Used to have to I we only had one phone line on my house and I was I was like in seventh grade in
[35:00.160 --> 35:01.840]  1997
[35:01.840 --> 35:04.520]  So I was a little bit different. I couldn't just buy another phone line
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.360]  we only had one phone line and my mom had a lot of friends who would call her all the time and
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.400]  And and so I was not allowed to disable call waiting
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.480]  I had to and it was an external modem. So anybody calls your house
[35:20.000 --> 35:20.520]  Yeah
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.640]  I had I had to listen I had to leave the you could you could figure the modem in its string to leave the speaker
[35:25.640 --> 35:31.600]  On all the time instead of turning off after it connects. So the whole time I was just sitting there listening to static like
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.640]  And then you could hear beep if a call waiting came in and I had to listen for that
[35:37.640 --> 35:40.960]  and if I heard a beep I had to flick the modem off so it would hang up immediately and
[35:41.440 --> 35:43.280]  Let the phone ring and pick it up and you know
[35:43.280 --> 35:46.240]  Then just not be on the internet for the next 20 minutes during this phone call
[35:47.720 --> 35:50.000]  I've got it here. It's IP net router
[35:50.120 --> 35:57.000]  It's a complete IP router and firewall solution including a built-in DHCP server NAT with inbound port mapping and IP
[35:57.240 --> 36:02.500]  Filtering to set up your own firewall. I think it costs like 40 bucks. May I may I what was it here?
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.520]  Here's a comment from so it was 89 bucks. It was a steal. It was 89 bucks
[36:07.520 --> 36:10.080]  And you you had superpowers
[36:10.760 --> 36:17.320]  But that's a pretty advanced functionality and like a pretty immense network stack for that time. Well, that was it was built on
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.200]  I'm going way out in the weeds here, but
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.000]  Mac OS 9 for as crazy
[36:25.240 --> 36:32.140]  Convoluted, you know a terrible bag of wires. It was in some areas under the hood had some amazing stuff
[36:32.140 --> 36:40.020]  I think was called open transport was the networking stack. So he didn't necessarily write the whole networking stack all the way to the bottom
[36:40.020 --> 36:43.580]  it was built on open transport, but his stuff was almost like
[36:45.260 --> 36:51.440]  Like the flagship of why open transport was great and why a lot of Mac developers were
[36:53.580 --> 36:58.880]  Beside themselves when Mac OS 10 went with the you know, the Unix
[36:58.880 --> 37:05.480]  Networking I forget that there was a whole controversy in that, you know, there were all these many
[37:05.480 --> 37:07.480]  There's thousands of these little mini converse
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.980]  Controversies between classic the which parts of the classic Mac OS would stay in which pad parts of next step would stay
[37:15.120 --> 37:17.120]  And that was one of them. I
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.340]  Kind of feel very lucky that I didn't even come to the Mac until
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.160]  10-4 in
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.240]  2004 and I bought an aluminum power book. So like I didn't come to the Mac until it was awesome
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.320]  Yeah, that's actually a good point because they're like it's like somebody coming to the iPhone with the 5s
[37:35.320 --> 37:39.960]  Yeah, you know, it's like you've missed this whole history of like a little bit of rough patches here and there
[37:39.960 --> 37:43.740]  Although the iPhone was way easier. I think than being a Mac owner in the 90s
[37:43.740 --> 37:43.960]  Yeah
[37:43.960 --> 37:46.200]  There were a couple of years in there
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.440]  Where it was and it really it was the early years of daring fireball exactly around 2002 2003
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.880]  That's when I started but maybe even count 2001 where?
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.680]  Mac OS 9 was half awesome and half terrible and Mac OS 10 was
[38:05.240 --> 38:11.400]  Half terrible and half awesome and you know, maybe those percentages were 60 40 40 60 and then they got 55th
[38:11.400 --> 38:17.160]  And they you know, they shifted over time, but it took years for Mac OS 10 to really be overwhelmingly
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.880]  Yeah, you know what? I just want to use it all all the time clearly
[38:20.880 --> 38:27.320]  And so it was you know switching I remember for a while. I had two machines at my desk. I had a I had a
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.160]  Forget what it was running Mac OS 10. I think it was a power book running Mac OS 10 and an old
[38:33.880 --> 38:40.480]  Really old power Mac running Mac OS 9 and the older machine running Mac OS 9 of course felt way faster
[38:40.480 --> 38:42.600]  Oh, yeah, cuz doing way less, right?
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.880]  Yeah, I mean and Microsoft to their credit like the 90s they had a similar
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.920]  Scale of transit. Well, not similar. They had a much easier transition
[38:50.920 --> 38:56.740]  but it was it was a still a pretty substantial transition between the Windows 95 98 ME kernel and the
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.800]  NT kernel that that powered 2000 and then XP and everything after XP
[39:01.240 --> 39:05.680]  and that like I was I was using it heavily during that transition and I was like
[39:05.680 --> 39:10.840]  I would be using the the beta of Windows 2000 and it was way more stable than Windows 98
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.520]  Yeah, even at even like the very first beta of it in like February
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.040]  1999 was way way more stable than Windows 98 and
[39:20.360 --> 39:21.120]  But you know
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.560]  It was easier back then to go through that transition because Microsoft stuff was always mediocre
[39:25.560 --> 39:29.120]  Like it was to give that, you know to their credit they were consistent
[39:29.480 --> 39:31.200]  You know, whereas Apple it sounded, you know
[39:31.200 --> 39:36.520]  Sounds like they would have some some amazing times then some terrible times whereas Microsoft was always impressively mediocre
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.260]  It was like you could count on the mediocrity. It was the you know, it was the Starbucks and McDonald's of computer
[39:41.260 --> 39:44.980]  operating systems and I would argue probably still is and
[39:46.060 --> 39:49.080]  That's actually kind of valuable for a lot of people to know what you're gonna get
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.640]  You know, it's it's dependable and and the transition, you know from 98 to 2000
[39:55.220 --> 39:56.460]  was
[39:56.460 --> 39:58.460]  Not that bad
[39:58.500 --> 40:01.220]  Unless you had to scan or print anything and there were no drivers
[40:01.220 --> 40:06.660]  But besides that if you as long as you didn't have to scan or print it was actually a really easy transition
[40:06.660 --> 40:07.020]  Yeah
[40:07.020 --> 40:10.740]  I think that was the basic idea of why they didn't go to NT even earlier because I even
[40:10.740 --> 40:15.900]  I actually had to use Windows in some ways like in college when I had jobs and stuff where you know
[40:15.900 --> 40:17.900]  That's what people use
[40:18.300 --> 40:20.580]  And I remember the first time I saw Windows NT
[40:20.580 --> 40:25.620]  I don't even know what the version number was, but it was before 2000, but it was probably like NT for
[40:26.460 --> 40:31.380]  Or three, I think because they numbered it. Yeah, because they numbered it to match Windows 3
[40:31.460 --> 40:35.980]  Yeah, NT for I believe it was NT for 2000. It was that NT 5 and it doesn't matter
[40:35.980 --> 40:40.860]  Uh, and I remember asking like the the guys who knew a lot more, you know, we're into the PC side
[40:40.860 --> 40:45.660]  I was like, why isn't everybody using this? This is actually like, you know, it's not five. It's still uh, yeah
[40:45.660 --> 40:52.420]  That was it. That was it NT 5 was 2000. Well NT 4 was the one that that looked like Windows 95
[40:52.420 --> 40:54.020]  Yeah, it was NT for that
[40:54.020 --> 40:58.060]  I that I had seen and used I had some experience with and I was like this is you know
[40:58.060 --> 41:01.660]  I still think it's kind of gross design wise but technically this is so far superior
[41:01.660 --> 41:05.220]  Why isn't everybody using this and then they were like duh, there's no drivers for it
[41:05.220 --> 41:09.880]  I was like, well, I was like what don't you say there's an easy way to solve this shouldn't everybody just
[41:10.620 --> 41:15.980]  Switch to this and then everybody will write drivers for it. It did. I mean transitions are hard
[41:15.980 --> 41:19.740]  I know it's not but it just seemed crazy to me that they were in active development for so many years
[41:19.860 --> 41:23.660]  Well that and the PC world is I mean, I don't know it's probably better now
[41:23.660 --> 41:25.980]  I'm actually not sure I've been out of it too long, but
[41:26.780 --> 41:30.120]  You actually couldn't count on new drivers for almost anything like if you upgraded
[41:30.120 --> 41:37.640]  Your version of Windows you would probably almost certainly you'd have to get a new scanner at least like some of your hardware would just stop
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.160]  working reliably or at all because then because they wouldn't put out a new driver or
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.240]  They would put out a new beta driver and then go out of business or something
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.400]  It would and like scanners were scanners and printers were some of the worst
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.080]  and then like it like the more
[41:52.520 --> 41:58.440]  Specialized your hardware peripherals were the worst they would be so like like I had like I had a couple of game pads
[41:58.440 --> 42:04.320]  so I wanted to like play emulators and so I bought these game pads and they were always the absolute worst and
[42:04.920 --> 42:08.960]  So you could almost be sure that any any hardware or any time you upgraded your Windows OS
[42:09.680 --> 42:17.080]  You'd have to also spend maybe 200 bucks upgrading some of your hardware because just just because of driver issues
[42:17.080 --> 42:23.720]  You'd have to replace perfectly working hardware just because there wouldn't be drivers anymore or they wouldn't be workable drivers anymore crazy
[42:23.720 --> 42:30.760]  Dark days and and that's one of the reasons why Microsoft had to jump through hoops for backwards compatibility all that crap because that was the
[42:30.760 --> 42:33.160]  World they were operating in that was like the hardware environment
[42:33.160 --> 42:36.000]  They were operating in where they they couldn't just dictate to people
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.880]  You know what everyone's now using this so you have to catch up, you know the way Apple does that today?
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.640]  Microsoft could not do that in in the 90s and I I don't even know if they can do it today
[42:44.640 --> 42:46.640]  They probably still can't do it
[42:46.760 --> 42:51.600]  alright, let me jump in here in the early minutes of the show with our first sponsor break and
[42:51.600 --> 42:54.920]  Remind everybody about our good friends at
[42:56.400 --> 42:59.840]  Connected data makers of file transporter
[43:00.480 --> 43:05.320]  Right. I use this analogy every time I talk about these guys. It's like your own private Dropbox
[43:06.040 --> 43:10.720]  You buy a device or you buy multiple devices. They come to your house
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.520]  They have hard drives in them or you hook hard drives up to them. You put them on your local network
[43:15.520 --> 43:18.040]  They're right there in your house in your office
[43:18.040 --> 43:21.320]  wherever you want them to be but they're in your control and
[43:22.040 --> 43:28.040]  Then you install the software on your Mac and you get a little folder on your Mac like Dropbox and it sinks and where?
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.440]  Are those files in the folder?
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.120]  They are stored on your transporter device and you can share between multiple people
[43:35.280 --> 43:39.680]  You can share between multiple devices multiple places. You can hook more than one of them up
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.160]  but the basic idea is you have
[43:44.160 --> 43:46.680]  sync between computers through the cloud
[43:46.680 --> 43:53.960]  But not stored on servers in the cloud. They're stored on devices that you own and control
[43:54.120 --> 43:58.640]  Maybe that's just for your own peace of mind because you're interested in the privacy implications of that
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.280]  Maybe it's because you have legal reasons that you actually can't store things on
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.920]  Devices that you don't control
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.200]  For HIPAA or things like that. They have an iOS app and this is new fairly new
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.400]  iOS app for the iPhone and iPads been updated that has a pretty cool feature where it does things like
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.480]  Upload all your photos and videos from your camera roll right to a special folder on
[44:21.080 --> 44:28.040]  Transporter for safekeeping so you want to again if that's one of your things you really want to do is have a cloud-based
[44:29.720 --> 44:31.720]  Effectively cloud-based
[44:31.760 --> 44:38.040]  Backup automatically of your photos so that if something happens to your phone, you know, you've got them automatically somewhere else
[44:38.720 --> 44:43.200]  But you don't want that somewhere else to be a server in
[44:43.200 --> 44:50.540]  California or who knows where controlled by some big corporation that might have the NSA tapping it or whatever
[44:51.600 --> 44:53.640]  Transporter can do that for you really cool
[44:54.280 --> 44:59.160]  Great stuff. If any of that appeals you go check them out where you go is you go to
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.240]  www.file transporter
[45:02.440 --> 45:04.440]  store calm
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.320]  File transporter store calm and they have two deals for listeners
[45:09.320 --> 45:16.280]  You want to save 10% you can save up to 35 bucks on any of the regular transporter models by using the code
[45:16.960 --> 45:19.880]  TTS 10 the talk show 10
[45:20.480 --> 45:27.800]  TTS 10 they have 500 gigabyte 1 terabyte 2 pair of terabyte capacities save 10% big bucks
[45:28.160 --> 45:33.220]  Or if you want to buy the little thing the little thing that's like the puck is the transporter sync
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.480]  Same functionality, but what you do with this one instead of having a hard drive built into it
[45:38.480 --> 45:40.160]  You just hook any
[45:40.160 --> 45:41.320]  USB drive up to it
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.380]  So if you already have a big USB drive or a couple of them sitting around
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.400]  You can get a cheaper device smaller device and just hook your own drive up to it
[45:49.400 --> 45:55.200]  You can save 20 bucks on one of those by using the code TTS
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.160]  20 so TTS 20 if you want to get the little sync
[46:00.600 --> 46:04.120]  TTS 10 if you want to get the the big regular transporter and
[46:04.120 --> 46:10.840]  Anybody who uses either of those codes gets free shipping. So go check them out at file transporter store dot-com
[46:12.040 --> 46:17.580]  So what are we talking about? We were talking about overcast before before the detour into old windows of Mac
[46:17.580 --> 46:22.360]  Yeah is horrible days of the late 90s of using computers. God. I don't know how that happened. That was terrible
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.440]  All right, that was up. The entire computer industry was in middle school
[46:26.280 --> 46:31.680]  Middle school always sucks for everybody and it sucks for the computer industry. And that was it. That's a pretty good analogy
[46:31.680 --> 46:34.880]  It really was and you're the worst of your personality comes out
[46:36.600 --> 46:39.080]  Right Apple Apple went pie in the sky
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.120]  You know off smoke and pot thinking they were gonna write a universal
[46:44.120 --> 46:47.420]  I just linked that up today the intelligent thing with IBM
[46:47.720 --> 46:55.120]  Like I Apple had had was writing multiple operating systems that never actually came to exist, you know, and there was Copeland
[46:56.960 --> 47:00.700]  And they did the whole Newton thing which wasn't a failure wasn't a bus
[47:00.700 --> 47:03.120]  but obviously, you know wasn't a hit and therefore didn't
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.540]  You know, they took their eyes off the ball and left the thing that was actually keeping the company around
[47:09.120 --> 47:11.120]  they let it languish and
[47:11.140 --> 47:16.640]  Then Microsoft man, it's just it really got they got bad. But anyway, that's enough of that
[47:16.640 --> 47:21.820]  I do think it's amusing that that like the biggest Apple news this week is probably the IBM thing and
[47:22.220 --> 47:29.520]  You choose to have me on I am probably the least qualified person in the world to comment on that in any fashion whatsoever
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.520]  Well, maybe next to me
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.480]  Let's get well, let's save it. Let's go. Let's do news at the end of the week
[47:34.480 --> 47:37.800]  That wasn't keep going on overcast. I had a couple more programming questions
[47:37.800 --> 47:38.640]  So yeah
[47:38.640 --> 47:43.240]  Brent wanted me to ask this when I told him you were gonna be on the show he wanted to know how hard the audio
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.060]  Programming was because he said it sounds like it would be hard
[47:47.060 --> 47:50.560]  it sounds like it would be hard for him and knowing just some of the
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.160]  Trickery that you're implementing that it's even harder
[47:55.160 --> 48:01.560]  So that's that's a question. How hard was audio programming and you had no background in audio programming before you got into this, correct?
[48:01.640 --> 48:03.640]  Well, it's not entirely true
[48:03.640 --> 48:10.480]  I I did a project in college where I was I was trying to make a better lossless compression algorithm like flack
[48:10.480 --> 48:12.480]  And you know those those kind of losses ones
[48:13.380 --> 48:17.080]  My project in college failed because the compression on that I wrote
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.840]  Took like 10 hours to compress one file and the resulting file was actually larger than the input file
[48:22.840 --> 48:24.840]  So
[48:25.160 --> 48:32.960]  It was not a success my idea for for how I could lossily compress them was not a good idea turns out I
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.280]  Remember when I was in college and I was taking computer science courses, this is mid 90s. I
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.840]  Was you know 91 to 96?
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.960]  Everybody was writing ray tracers ray tracers were like maybe there's still a common thing
[48:49.960 --> 48:56.280]  But man, and I was nowhere near good enough to even try but I remember that there are some some kids
[48:56.280 --> 49:02.120]  I knew who wrote one and they they were getting like like one frame a day. I mean, this is just
[49:03.440 --> 49:09.200]  Unbelievably slow and it just had no idea how to improve it and just like despondent
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.180]  It was like we it's so slow that we can't even figure out why it's slow
[49:14.880 --> 49:17.140]  Well when I was writing this thing in 2003
[49:17.140 --> 49:19.140]  About
[49:19.140 --> 49:24.940]  The same number of people cared then as now about lossless audio encoding which was about five and
[49:25.940 --> 49:29.420]  I don't even use like I'm an audio file. I
[49:30.100 --> 49:35.360]  Love high quality audio. I have all sorts of ridiculous equipment to listen to high quality audio
[49:36.020 --> 49:38.020]  But I don't even use lossless audio files
[49:38.140 --> 49:42.420]  like even even that doesn't even make sense for me to have those giant files sitting there when like a
[49:43.060 --> 49:46.740]  256 K mp3 well encoded sounds just as good to me. I can't tell the difference
[49:46.740 --> 49:49.260]  Yeah, so it was it was a ridiculous background anyway
[49:51.060 --> 49:57.460]  Compression in general compression in general though is hard whether it's lossy or lossless because you're still focused on quality
[49:57.460 --> 50:02.780]  I mean, you know, even if you're writing lossy compression, you know JPEG or something like that
[50:02.780 --> 50:05.500]  You still you don't it's not it's not like you can disregard
[50:06.060 --> 50:07.340]  quality
[50:07.340 --> 50:13.500]  Right, and it's just mathematically. It's just it's really mind-bending. I mean that to me at least. Oh, yeah
[50:13.500 --> 50:19.980]  I mean like the once you get past very elementary forms of compression the met. It's all math and it's all like very
[50:20.940 --> 50:28.260]  Complicated difficult to understand math that is far beyond my comprehension most of the time or like I might understand the general concept
[50:28.260 --> 50:31.020]  But I certainly couldn't implement it or do it myself, right?
[50:31.020 --> 50:37.100]  There's like a one a one level deep of compression that anybody can understand and it's like well if there's like what zip does
[50:37.100 --> 50:40.780]  yeah, if there's if there's 16 ones in a row you could just
[50:40.780 --> 50:47.020]  Write it down as six, you know say that there's 16 ones and that takes fewer space than there's 16 actual ones
[50:47.020 --> 50:49.860]  Oh, yeah. Well, guess what? That doesn't get you very far
[50:50.380 --> 50:55.740]  Yeah, exactly. That's that's called RLE and that was in Windows 3.1. You know 15 20 years ago
[50:56.460 --> 51:00.600]  There's these very obvious repeated patterns. That's how gif works actually
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.860]  Yeah, but that's gift as well. That's why gif has such wonderful compression that Twitter
[51:05.860 --> 51:12.760]  Re implemented. This is the movie files right before living exactly see the cat pictures. I
[51:14.440 --> 51:17.980]  Saw people because that's I don't know if anybody doesn't know that the Twitter
[51:18.500 --> 51:23.220]  Added quote unquote added support for animated gifs a couple of weeks ago
[51:23.220 --> 51:26.880]  And then somebody figured out that they're not actually animated gifs. They're sending out
[51:27.820 --> 51:33.220]  It's 264 video and then I saw people who were upset about this and it's like well
[51:33.220 --> 51:39.580]  There's a reason they did it that the the h.264 video files are like ten times smaller than the gifts
[51:39.580 --> 51:42.620]  Oh, yeah, I mean like I wrote the gif processor in tumblr
[51:43.180 --> 51:46.100]  It's dealing with gifts is a ridiculous pain in the ass
[51:46.460 --> 51:50.020]  they it's a terrible format it for so many reasons and
[51:50.460 --> 51:54.200]  You know not least of which is that it isn't very efficient at compression
[51:54.860 --> 51:58.380]  But it for so many other reasons like it has the fixed
[51:59.020 --> 52:02.100]  256 color palette right which is really limiting
[52:02.100 --> 52:06.540]  Oh, it's soul-crushing. It's so like that's and and those colors
[52:06.540 --> 52:10.660]  I don't think those colors can change between frames of an event animation video about that
[52:10.660 --> 52:17.220]  Oh, I'm almost certain that I don't think so. I don't think between frames. Yeah, I I would be very surprised if that were true
[52:17.220 --> 52:21.200]  Yeah, I remember can't change the path. Anyway, yeah, it's a terrible format. It's terrible
[52:21.540 --> 52:23.740]  Well, you know right back to the 90s, you know
[52:23.740 --> 52:28.700]  But there was that whole debate when when was it unisys started trying to enforce the patent on gif
[52:28.700 --> 52:35.260]  It was like they had it patented and didn't do anything with it and while they didn't do anything with it
[52:35.580 --> 52:37.580]  You know the world the World Wide Web
[52:37.740 --> 52:42.440]  Grew up with tons and tons of gif files and then all of a sudden somebody unisys was like well
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.760]  We have a patent on that. Yeah, the submarine patent
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.600]  It's like the canonical example of
[52:49.460 --> 52:56.420]  Like a submarine patent I think yeah patent role. Yeah, right why you should never trust a company that says hey just use our stuff
[52:56.420 --> 52:57.780]  We're never gonna enforce it
[52:57.780 --> 53:03.980]  Yeah, but I remember that that the subcurrent of the whole argument about what we should replace it with and what are we gonna do?
[53:03.980 --> 53:09.780]  And blah blah blah was we're doing all this to replace an awful truly awful file format
[53:09.780 --> 53:16.060]  And you can find people who complain about JPEG and that other there were other formats at the time for photographs
[53:16.060 --> 53:22.420]  You know, which you know the role that JPEG plays that that there were better alternatives and stuff like that
[53:22.420 --> 53:26.340]  There could have been done better in certain ways, but nobody really says JPEG is terrible
[53:26.340 --> 53:32.220]  I mean JPEG is JPEG. It's you know, pretty good served. Yeah, I mean JPEG like it and similar mp3
[53:33.420 --> 53:35.700]  MP3 is a very old format
[53:36.580 --> 53:44.660]  What people don't realize it stands for mpeg1 layer 3 right like mpeg1 files are I believe from the late 80s
[53:44.660 --> 53:49.220]  I mean it was what it was why before they were commonplace but late 80s or early 90s
[53:49.220 --> 53:53.420]  I believe is when mpeg1 became a standard and became playable
[53:53.420 --> 54:00.500]  And like that is when the mp3 format like it's from that era. Yeah JPEG is not from that much later than that
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.620]  It's I think it's also from the very early 90s
[54:02.620 --> 54:09.340]  Yeah, and and it was a while before it was, you know fast enough that computers could display them very quickly. But now
[54:10.020 --> 54:13.060]  Like and there are better formats like there was a format called JPEG 2000
[54:13.060 --> 54:18.780]  Yeah that no one ever uses and I believe there were some patent issues with it, which is one of the reasons why but
[54:18.780 --> 54:26.220]  You know JPEG is good enough. Yeah GIF is a horrible just a horrible format. Yeah, but it was there were billions
[54:26.220 --> 54:29.980]  I forget there are the estimates for how many gif files that were on like the early internet
[54:29.980 --> 54:34.380]  But it was it quickly went from like hundreds to billions. Well, and they're back now
[54:34.380 --> 54:40.220]  I feel like this is like our bell-bottoms moment. Yeah, we're like it like this this this thing that was like a weird fad
[54:41.100 --> 54:47.440]  15 years ago 20 years ago like mostly 15 years ago that thing that this thing was a weird fad back then
[54:47.440 --> 54:52.360]  Now it's back and all of us who were around back then like why is this back? This is terrible
[54:53.080 --> 54:55.080]  It's the fashion has come back around
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.960]  These are definitely these are definitely our bell-bottoms. Yeah, but it's used in a way that that is
[55:01.760 --> 55:03.440]  There's a little bit of retro to it
[55:03.440 --> 55:07.840]  But then in most ways there's not because the gifs that people post now these huge
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.620]  animated ones with lots of frames from video and TV and stuff like that are so humongous that that
[55:13.620 --> 55:19.180]  In computers in the mid 90s and internet connections in the mid 90s couldn't even handled one of them
[55:19.180 --> 55:20.540]  Oh, yeah, they're like three megs
[55:20.540 --> 55:27.100]  I mean you got a figure like imagine the concept of a three meg gif in 1997
[55:27.620 --> 55:30.980]  Right. We used to try to make I forget the target for our web pages
[55:30.980 --> 55:33.980]  But you know, you know a lot of times you have part of your
[55:34.740 --> 55:41.140]  Project specs for building websites were what was the target size for the web page and it was always measured in kilobytes
[55:41.140 --> 55:45.260]  You know, it was like how many seconds would it take to load over a 56k modem, right?
[55:45.260 --> 55:51.300]  It was you know somewhere between for most projects that I worked on was usually like 10 20 kilobytes for the whole page all assets
[55:52.340 --> 55:56.700]  Right because old cuz that would take a few seconds to load it would take forever to love it. It was horrible
[55:58.740 --> 56:06.020]  So to answer your actual question, but it's about three megabyte gif mile in the middle of the page would be terrible, right?
[56:06.020 --> 56:10.340]  I mean if it could even load without something running out of memory and crashing while decoding it
[56:10.340 --> 56:14.180]  Which is unlikely but if it could even load it would have taken 45 minutes to load
[56:14.740 --> 56:21.060]  I also think if I'm remembering correctly I'd been this hike here. I could be I could be way off my rocker
[56:21.060 --> 56:22.940]  But I seem to recall
[56:22.940 --> 56:24.740]  that like
[56:24.740 --> 56:26.060]  early
[56:26.060 --> 56:32.580]  Hosting accounts like if you were hosting a website somewhere like storage and bandwidth were measured in megabytes
[56:34.140 --> 56:37.180]  Like I don't know how many megabytes but like, you know
[56:37.180 --> 56:43.420]  You you just you couldn't serve up a couple hundred copies of a three megabyte file. You just definitely not
[56:44.660 --> 56:46.740]  God and now people just crap them out
[56:47.700 --> 56:51.020]  Well, cuz now you can host them for free and a million different services that all want your privacy
[56:51.940 --> 56:55.180]  All right back to audio programming. So you did have some experience in college
[56:55.660 --> 57:02.500]  Yeah, and I I've I've like toyed with it here and there which was a complete failure. Yeah. Yeah, my college experience was awful
[57:02.500 --> 57:08.900]  But uh, but you know, I got the basic concept of you know, the samples and the frames and the formats and everything
[57:08.900 --> 57:12.060]  So, you know, I and I've I've always been an audio nerd
[57:12.700 --> 57:17.420]  So I was I've always been familiar with you know, editing audio and in basic forms
[57:18.140 --> 57:20.140]  playing with it, you know, I I've
[57:20.580 --> 57:26.500]  Music and and talk radio have always been very important to me. And so I've always kind of been in this
[57:27.140 --> 57:28.780]  anyway, so
[57:28.780 --> 57:30.860]  the audio programming in overcast
[57:30.860 --> 57:37.780]  was by far my favorite part and it was ridiculously hard, but it was the it was the kind of good
[57:38.300 --> 57:41.740]  hard for a programmer which is like it's very intellectually stimulating and
[57:42.140 --> 57:46.300]  So it was it's exactly what I love to do which is working at very low level C code
[57:46.860 --> 57:50.780]  Doing stuff that you don't think will be possible to do quickly
[57:51.580 --> 57:57.060]  And you know, like it's questionable whether it will run on an iPhone at reasonable speed and that reasonable battery drain
[57:57.060 --> 58:01.620]  You know doing very low-level stuff like that using things, you know, try to make it even more efficient
[58:01.620 --> 58:06.020]  Try to take an even better trick to get this way, you know throw in some of the vector algorithms and stuff like that
[58:07.540 --> 58:10.260]  That it was it was a very very fun
[58:10.900 --> 58:12.900]  hard if that makes sense and
[58:13.300 --> 58:19.220]  It didn't take that much time, you know relative to the entire rest of the app the audio engine
[58:20.580 --> 58:24.020]  It's it's actually easier in in many ways because
[58:24.020 --> 58:31.300]  It is self-contained and and what it's doing. It's a relatively simple task. It's easy to test. It's easy to benchmark. It's easy to
[58:32.180 --> 58:34.180]  Find bugs and fix them
[58:34.820 --> 58:39.860]  whereas if you compare if you compare that to like UI programming or sync logic to the server
[58:40.500 --> 58:42.980]  Like those things are much higher level code
[58:43.780 --> 58:46.340]  There's much more code to do that sort of stuff
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.980]  You know relatively in total for the whole app
[58:48.980 --> 58:54.980]  And it's much harder to test. There's always all these weird edge cases, you know, the audio code really was it isn't that way
[58:54.980 --> 59:00.260]  it you have a stream of numbers coming in and you got to put out a stream of numbers and there's some buffering issues you
[59:00.260 --> 59:02.260]  Got to take care of and some some performance issues
[59:02.260 --> 59:07.620]  you got to take care of and and you know some edge cases here there, but it's nowhere near the level of
[59:08.420 --> 59:10.420]  of like possibility complexity
[59:11.300 --> 59:13.300]  That programming and interface is
[59:13.300 --> 59:18.340]  Hmm, I think it helps that you're an audio file. I really in fact, I don't know that it would have worked that way
[59:18.340 --> 59:22.820]  Otherwise because I'm not I'm a complete anti audio file. I just want to hear it
[59:23.460 --> 59:24.180]  Yeah, I don't know
[59:24.180 --> 59:30.820]  I'm well, I shouldn't say anti because I do care about quality but my threshold for what sounds good seems a lot lower than than
[59:31.460 --> 59:36.900]  People who you know like you who are really into headphones and stuff like that like like my you know
[59:36.900 --> 59:39.220]  line up 20 pairs of headphones and
[59:39.220 --> 59:45.220]  I'm gonna say there's a decent chance. I might find that they all sound pretty good if you know, they're all cost
[59:45.220 --> 59:47.460]  I don't know 60 70 80 bucks or above
[59:48.820 --> 59:54.900]  And I would have a harder time talking about the differences if I did hear a difference between the two I'd have a harder time
[59:55.300 --> 59:56.740]  Describing it
[59:56.740 --> 01:00:01.860]  Right, right and I think that helps because I would think most people and I wondered you know, maybe you know this
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.460]  Maybe you can even tell like if I were gonna write a program
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:11.220]  Or I were gonna be part of a team that was writing one. My idea would be well, I would just let the system
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.580]  I'd let iOS handle all the audio playback we get that there's a part we get for free we give the system
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:22.980]  An audio format that core audio knows how to play and then to play it and we don't have to worry about that
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.620]  And then start from there
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.700]  And I think that you know clearly that would rule out a whole bunch of the features that you know
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.900]  And I think that you know clearly that would rule out a whole bunch of the features that are in overcast
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:43.940]  Yeah, I mean the biggest one like you can do voice boost using the simpler apis
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.380]  It is not you can't do it very well, but you can do it
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.900]  There's just a few little downsides, but most people wouldn't notice it. It'd be fine
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.500]  You definitely cannot do smart speed
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.140]  in any reasonable approachable way
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.060]  and so
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.500]  I had to do this if I wanted smart speed and
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.780]  It was an important enough feature for me that I that I said it was worth it, you know, and and the reality is
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.660]  As I said, like the audio engine
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.460]  Was very very hard for about you know, a few weeks or a month maybe and then it was done
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.500]  And then the rest of the app was was the rest of the development time
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.700]  I haven't touched the audio processing code in months
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.900]  Because it's just it's fine. Like I made it over the course, you know
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.300]  I'd like i'd go in every once in a while and make a little tweak to like how something was dealt with or
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.500]  you know the levels or the eq stuff like that, but
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.940]  Uh for the most part it has barely changed in almost two years since I wrote it
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:43.060]  Um, so those are the two like magic here just make this better
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.780]  features in
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.100]  In overcast smart speed and voice boost and I I think of them
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:55.220]  Is there the audio equivalent of like that magic wand thing in the photos app exactly, right?
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:00.180]  And you say just make it better and a lot of times for me that button makes the photo better
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.020]  And then every once in a while it doesn't and then you can tap it again and it goes away
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.700]  And it's just like that with podcasts where you can say turn on smart speed
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:13.300]  And if you think this is better, this is an easier way to listen to the show. Keep it on if not turn it off
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:19.140]  Exactly, and and there are some shows where one or both those options will actually make it sound worse
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.780]  And that's why there's buttons for those instead of just being on all the time
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.980]  But I found in the majority of shows I listen to
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.980]  The combination of both of them usually make it sound better
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.300]  What was the deal? I remember this there was a really interesting thread on the beta
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.900]  glass board about the names of those features
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.260]  And early on I hope i'm not talking
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.260]  No, no behind the scenes, but the voice voice boost had a different name, right? I think it just said boost
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.340]  early on
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.220]  Voice boost was not on or off there were
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:58.580]  There were three modes to it. There was um, there are four modes. There was off where it didn't process anything there was
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.580]  enhance
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.980]  And then boost and then also reduce
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.060]  Yeah, deuce was was a mode that would actually cut off the spectrum on the extreme highs and extreme lows
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.700]  So it would like if somebody sometimes you have a podcast where it's like way too much bass
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:19.780]  And if you play it like in a bathroom or something like it, it sounds really echoey and horrible and it's it's hard to listen to
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:26.340]  Some of them also will leave in like very very high-pitched wines as an artifact of
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.700]  Some part of their processing and I never quite figured out what causes that but some podcasts will have that occasionally
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.460]  And this has been true for years way before overcast
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.900]  And so reduce mode would cut those ends off
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.020]  And then enhance and boost
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.660]  Boost both did the same thing just boost did it more severely
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.020]  Boost was like a larger boost basically
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.900]  um, and so I had this this slider reduce off enhance boost and
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.180]  That was true for about half of the beta really
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:02.500]  Yeah, I was always confused as hell by the whole thing. Yeah, I I kind of just wanted I really just wanted
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.220]  Marco just make it sound better for me
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:12.660]  Right, and I think that was that was a common request actually and and what I what I eventually found what I realized is that even myself
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.620]  I was just leaving everything on boost all the time
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.700]  Yeah, like I wasn't using any of the other settings
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.220]  I thought I would when I made them and then it turns out I was not using them at all
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:26.340]  Yeah, and so that's when I redesigned that screen to just be just a button. Is this on or off?
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:35.140]  Yeah, and it sounds like it's also a real interesting difference between where you listen to podcasts and it's like it seems like
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.300]  This feature the voice booster in particular really comes in handy to people who listen in their car
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.420]  Yes, definitely. That's I mean, that's why I made it because I listen all the time in my car. I I
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.980]  I I got a new car a couple years ago
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.780]  And it came with a serious radio and probably like, you know, a six-month trial subscription. I never activated it
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.060]  I've i'm only listening to podcasts now. I I used to listen to
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:01.060]  Satellite radio before that I would listen to like mp3s and cds and everything now in my car
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:08.500]  I'm always listening to either either nothing like if i'm talking to tiff or if i'm writing alone, usually it's always podcasts. That's it
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:13.940]  Yeah, and yeah voice boost makes a massive difference in the car, right because it's a noisy environment and you yeah
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.900]  It's a noisy environment. So the baseline for where you need the quietest voice on the show to be
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.620]  audible is
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.300]  potentially dangerously high for like a burst of laughter or
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.060]  Somebody else who's who was recorded at a higher level, right?
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.540]  You know if you have somebody who's very, you know, polite and soft-spoken like brent, you know
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.740]  I I used his old show as an example the um
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.020]  What was that show called with the calendar guy?
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:46.660]  Oh the simmons the simmons brothers. I don't have cousins. Yeah. Um, yeah, I use that show as one of the oh, that's good
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.740]  Because michael simmons is
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.300]  So loud. He was like a loud boisterous voice and brentwood was soft-spoken
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.780]  Yeah, that's a perfect example and they didn't level it very well at first because they you know
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.320]  They were when they first started the show they were you know, they were in the experience producing podcasts
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.740]  And they got better at it afterwards
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:07.220]  but I use I use the earlier episodes as a test for this feature because it was the perfect case where I wanted to hear
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.220]  What brent was saying without having my ears blown out when michael would talk?
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:16.420]  And so it was uh, it was exactly the situation where voice boost is necessary
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.760]  So voice boost is a it's a combination of an eq and a compressor
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.640]  And the compressor, uh, and it looks at the files in a couple other ways, but for the most part it's a compressor
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.440]  That's that most of what you're hearing is the compressor
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.800]  um
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.600]  and uh
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.960]  And and that was exactly exactly what it's for which is make brent loud enough so I can hear him in the car
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.760]  Without blowing out my ears when anyone else talks. Yeah, and there's like an old record producer adage that you know, you don't
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.680]  You don't optimize like a music album for
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:53.480]  High quality studio headphones you optimize it for the actual way that people in real world are going to listen to this music
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.960]  Which might be you know, 10 20 years ago
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.160]  You know a piece of crap portable radio
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.280]  You want to make sure it sounds good on that because that's where you know that
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.680]  If it doesn't sound good on that you're never going to have a hit song no matter how good it sounds on your you know
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.800]  Thousand dollar studio headphones exactly. Yeah, you got to optimize for the real world
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.080]  Yeah, and that's true. It's true web design app design. It's true of everything
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:21.160]  Um, one more question I had i'm surprised brent didn't ask uh is I was is feed parsing a nightmare
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.120]  For podcasts. Is it just like as bad as rss because
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.960]  you know, first of all podcasts are just simpler than
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:38.200]  the entirety of rss feeds because you know the entirety of rss feeds first of all includes adam and four different versions of rss and
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.160]  And four different versions of rss and and the the use cases for rss feeds are very varied
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.680]  Uh, there's all sorts of things like it isn't just a site like in gadget posting news headlines
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.640]  There's all sorts of things that publish rss feeds that that any feed parser has to handle
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.720]  podcasts have two things going for them not only are
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:06.920]  Is the scope of what they cover much smaller than that because for the most part it's audio shows that are produced
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.240]  You know once a day once a week
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.160]  Maybe the most extreme ones might be published once an hour if it's like a dump from a radio station
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800]  But there's you know, not much more than that
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.400]  And you know, usually it's pretty, you know, pretty well formed for the most part and the and the second big thing
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:30.120]  Is that for all of the mediums history itunes has been the dominant player and historically it itunes is less picky now
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.280]  But before in in previous years itunes used to be very picky
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.640]  About what kind of feeds it would accept if your feed was malformed at all itunes wouldn't take it
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.980]  And so it kind of enforced a level of consistency and quality even even a format itunes
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.960]  For the for the longest time only supported rss. It didn't even support adam and it still doesn't support it that well
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.960]  Right. Yeah exactly today
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.080]  it does support adam but not well because I looked into that when I had to take over the feed for this show and
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.480]  Yeah, my back end publishing stuff is all set up for adam
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.080]  Or at least it would work better with adam in theory
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:14.040]  And the bottom line was you could but you don't want to if you really want you really want your podcast to be our rss
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:23.480]  Exactly actual rss not rss as a catch-all term that includes adam, which is confusing and adam in I know this is like
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:29.880]  This is like a holy war of 2003. But uh, I really don't like adam as a format. Um,
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.560]  You know rss was clearly designed to be pragmatic and adam was designed
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.560]  To be the standard that ends all standards. It can and can reproduce anything. Yeah, and it shows, you know
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.720]  It shows in the complexity of these two formats and and adam has a lot of uh, ambiguity in like, okay
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:47.960]  well
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.120]  there are 17 different ways to represent the date and you have you need to support all of these because some people might use
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.640]  this one and then what the heck is an author does everything have an author what how is this author relevant to this other author and
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.320]  there's like
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:06.360]  Everything in adam is well, it depends, you know, and there's like 17 different ways to do it and in rss
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.120]  You know, it isn't a perfect format
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:13.480]  There are there are some ambiguities built in the into the format that are kind of annoying like the lack of required gu IDs for instance
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.920]  but
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.920]  for the most part
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:23.880]  Rss, you know as its name states, uh is way simpler and just to deal with to publish and to consume
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:30.440]  It is so much simpler because the format just can't represent all the little tiny nuances that adam can
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.560]  And adam sees that as a flaw. I see that as a feature
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:41.400]  Yeah, I totally agree in hindsight and who knows maybe someday i'll just change everything at during fireball to go rss instead of adam
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.840]  But for some reason I picked the wrong side back then and I somehow
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.960]  Convinced myself that I don't know. I think I kind of bought into the
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.360]  The the the that does sound good arguments behind the adam people
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.320]  I mean, I never got involved in it and wasn't really active but
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.120]  You know rick reading mark pogrom's blog back then and a couple other people who were involved
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.480]  It all made a lot of sense to me and there were certain aspects of it
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.560]  That if you if you rendered a very simple feed in adam
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.000]  It looked better to me than rss and still does in a way
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.400]  Like i'm not thinking about it from the perspective of someone writing a parser and you have to handle everything
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.600]  I was thinking of it in terms of what would make my the daring fireball feed look better if you just looked at it
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.840]  And I still think adam is better
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.960]  In that regard but that's a stupid thing to make the judgment on I think I think
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:40.200]  The smarter way to look at it is just to say rss is super pragmatic and it is
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.800]  Designed from the get-go for doing exactly and only what I was doing which was here's a bunch of articles
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.200]  Yeah, right as opposed to like here we have to we have to design an overarching standard that will encompass every possible thing
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  Everyone will ever want to do again. Yeah, you know, it's it's all and and adam was also, you know
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.800]  a lot more strict with certain things and it's it's almost there's almost a parallel between
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:06.200]  X html being adam. Yeah, and like html5 or even old html being rss
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.720]  Yeah, where it's just like, you know, they it was more structured more defined but way more complex
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.680]  Yeah, and it sounded good in in theory that in practice. It just doesn't really work that well
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.240]  And it's it's actually more complicated to deal with in practice
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.320]  Yeah, and the rss thing went by really quickly in just a handful of years. Whereas the html thing played out over
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:33.240]  Almost 20 years, but I think it is pretty I think that's a pretty decent high-level analogy and then in that analogy
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.280]  I think rss 2.0 is html5
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.120]  Which is yeah. Yeah. Yeah the early the rss and it had weird numbers. It was like
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.000]  0.9 and 0.91 and 0.92 and the weird thing was that like
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:51.720]  0.91 was from netscape and dave wiener had nothing to do with it and 0.92 went back to dave wiener
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.640]  And ignored everything that was in 0.91. It was really a sequel to 0.90. I know i'm getting these version numbers wrong
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.640]  But it doesn't matter
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.560]  It doesn't matter that i'm getting the exact version numbers wrong. It's it's yeah, and brent was
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.240]  Literally at ground zero for all of that. Yeah, he was like writing all the parsers and generators for all of these things
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.400]  And and to be clear when i'm talking about rss i'm talking about rss 2 the earlier ones
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.040]  Yeah, like the rdf based ones that disaster but we went but that was the battle though, right?
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.480]  That was you know, that's like with a x x html never really was pitted against html4
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.120]  It was really pitted against it, you know html5
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:32.440]  I mean even though the time, you know, they weren't at the same time effectively. It was well the world's gonna move off html4 eventually
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.400]  and you know the standards people, you know, really thought it was uh,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.800]  Gonna be xed html because my god it's gonna be great
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:50.600]  It'll enforce that all of your web pages are xml compliant because if it's not it won't render right? Yeah, everything everything was like
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.760]  Structure and this is a battle that you know computing has gone on for a long time
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.680]  This is a battle that you know computing has gone back and forth in this in cycles for decades
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:06.780]  It was a battle for like structure and definitions and schemas and well-defined everything and extremely unforgiving
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:13.960]  implementations versus you know, forgiving flexible just kind of you know, spew something out and we'll try to figure out what it is and
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.920]  the same the same thing is happening now with like objective c versus swift even I mean
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:25.160]  It's like it's this that we keep having the same battle over and over again where you know, somebody will want you know, the there
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.920]  will be some kind of uh, you know class of problems that
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:35.560]  Academic, uh people will try to will think needs to be solved and the way to solve it is to require standards
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560]  so everything can be strictly typed and
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.560]  And you know
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:45.000]  We can validate everything and everything has to be defined in a file and we're going to write everything in java with 10
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.800]  Met with 10 class deep hierarchies of every model. This isn't this isn't just a person
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:56.200]  we need to have a person factory constructor to construct the factory that builds people and like all this like there's levels and levels of
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.420]  complexity and structure
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.000]  Um to combat the free-form wild west of dirty data, you know
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.680]  and then the dirty data people come in and do everything faster and everything just works anyway, and then
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320]  Then the cycle repeats again. It's
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.560]  I'm I think we're going to always see this cycle just go back and forth
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.660]  I don't even know I was not going to get into this and this could be this could absolutely
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.680]  sink the entire um
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.920]  You might as well now I mean
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.960]  Have you seen this thing where there's this group that wants to turn markdown into an ietf standard?
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.880]  No, it let me guess jeff atwood. I I don't even know you know what it it broke
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.960]  last weekend I was out of town with with amy and
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.160]  It wasn't paying attention and i've been busy this week on other stuff. I haven't even paid attention to it
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.080]  But I don't know if it's I don't know if it's associated with atwood's crusade or not
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.720]  um
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.600]  And there's talk from some people and the funny thing is they're doing it on a mailing list that I still host
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.280]  and I haven't participated on in in years and I don't know why I haven't pulled the plug on the damn mailing list, but
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:06.200]  I still host the markdown discuss mailing list and there's people saying that they should just take the name markdown from me
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.200]  um
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.240]  Because i've been such a lousy steward of it of it and whatever meanwhile, you know
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:18.600]  There's the the the web pages on my site for markdown with describing the syntax and everything
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.720]  Are more popular every single day
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.480]  It's more popular the mark I could actually i've thought about selling a sponsorship just for markdown alone
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.640]  Because it's more popular the markdown pages on daring fireball get more traffic
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.120]  Than daring fireball did as a whole when I went professional with daring fireball
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.120]  um
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:43.160]  And you could even you could get like, you know web development kind of advertisements for that too. Like it's a different market, right?
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.920]  That's what i've that's exactly why I've thought that I could have a job board just on that page
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.040]  Um, although I do actually think a lot of the traffic is not coming from web developers
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:58.460]  It's coming from people who are using a new a site that is switched to markdown as the format
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:05.240]  Um, you know for that makes sense comments or whatever. But anyway long story. I mean I could go on forever about this but to me
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:11.020]  markdown's not successful despite not being a standard, uh,
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.180]  and and
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.460]  And etcetera etcetera and all that would entail but it because of that
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.820]  Now it's possible that it would be better off if there were some kind of
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:26.300]  Spec that could you know, if there were a spec that implementers could implement for some things. Um,
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.980]  And you know, maybe i'll do there's
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.460]  I don't want to get too deep in this but there's some ideas and some work that some people have done
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:41.900]  That's really interesting in that regard because 99.999 of people wouldn't have to worry about it and it wouldn't change things
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.340]  um
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:49.420]  But some of the things that people see as a problem like the fact that different markdown implementations are slightly different
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.980]  Is not a problem. It's actually you know, that's actually a good thing because then github
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.500]  Which has to my opinion a great flavor of markdown they even call it and they have a great name for it
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:07.500]  perfect name it's called github flavored markdown and it is exactly suited for github users and it does code a little differently because
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:12.460]  Uh, no shit github users are writing a lot of you know code blocks, right?
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940]  um
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.580]  And it would not and almost none of their changes would make sense for markdown everywhere
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.700]  So, you know, it's great
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:28.620]  I don't know people see the world is broken regarding markdown because there's not one true markdown
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.060]  uh
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.620]  And meanwhile in the real world, everybody's happy writing markdown
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.660]  Yeah, I I think you're right. It doesn't
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.740]  It doesn't seem like it's a problem that needs to really be solved exactly
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:46.460]  And you know, it's I think I think there's this temp. There's a tendency for programmers to want to
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:52.860]  Clean up standards and and and formalize things like that and in many cases that is warranted
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:59.100]  Um, but I I think saying that everything has to be a standard is like saying open always wins exactly
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:04.860]  Like, you know that that is true sometimes, but it is not a generalization that holds all the time
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.340]  and
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.980]  I don't know. I mean, maybe there are things that should be standardized
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.420]  But it seems like markdown has gotten along just fine without that and it's moving along fine and you're right that
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.860]  You know different implementations will have different needs right and it is it is not wise
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:25.340]  To try to cram all these specialty needs into one standard that everybody must
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.380]  Follow and then and then everything gets versioned then you have to be like, oh well, does this support markdown 2.0 or not?
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:37.820]  And it's it's kind of a mess. I don't know. It's a hard problem to solve but I wouldn't assume that a standards body is
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.340]  Necessarily the right solution to this problem. I would almost certainly say it is
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:49.020]  Absolutely not. Well, of course you would say that because they're basically trying to fire you, right?
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.020]  but I don't know it I
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.660]  I think that the success of markdown
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.660]  Despite not having a standards body behind it all this time
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:05.500]  Is the biggest evidence why it probably doesn't need one right exactly and you know part of what let's it get by without a spec
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.660]  and you know, and I I don't like
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:14.140]  It would be better in some ways there are there's things that could be clarified and there's things that make markdown very hard for example
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.140]  to write a syntax coloring
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.700]  syntax coloring, um description for
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:21.260]  Because of ambiguities there's things
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:26.620]  The the general assumption with markdown the thing that that the reason why it doesn't have a spec and why I think it probably shouldn't
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.380]  Is the general assumption is that whoever is writing it knows what they're doing
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.520]  And isn't going to put input random gibberish
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.580]  and there's all sorts of the problems that people are talking about is well, what if you
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.420]  Put seven asterisks in a row. What does that generate? Well, don't do that. That's my answer
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:47.900]  I don't know what it generates. Does it generate a bunch of empty m tags or strong tags?
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.820]  I I don't know. It just seems like just why would you do that?
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.860]  You know check what it looks like before you publish it and if you see oh
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:02.860]  I forgot that if I put a bunch of asterisks there that means something at markdown I should backslash escape them
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940]  Just you know, take a look at it
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.500]  It could be better. I'm not trying to brush aside all criticism of it
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.860]  And say that there's nothing I could do better. There's I maybe I should wait
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.380]  Take a couple of weeks and wade back in and clean up some things
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:20.380]  But I think what markdown needs from me would be like a version
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.900]  I don't even know what the official version but like if it's at 1.0
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020]  One I should do like a 1.0
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:34.540]  Right or at most like a 1.1. Yeah, maybe at 1.1. There's no need for a markdown 2.0
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.900]  Markdown 2.0 and there's no need for a standard or respect but people get really worked up about it
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:45.500]  What if they just make their own thing and give it another name and see if it catches on exactly that's i've said that
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.420]  That's like I probably should set up a text expander snippet for that
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.620]  Make up your own thing and see if it catches on yeah
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.540]  Because it might and then then fine problem solved then you have your own thing that you control
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.660]  It has it has a different name and fine. You got it, right?
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:04.700]  I don't know. We'll see how that goes. It's it's either going to peter out or it's going to be a thing
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.900]  That i'm going to have to take a little more public and then you know and be like, uh, no
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.980]  you cannot take the name markdown and
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.700]  I I do have a nice soapbox for that and I have a lot of people who are probably going to be on my side
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.620]  Of this and then everybody's gonna be like, oh my god
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.260]  I remember him talking to marco about that on his podcast a couple weeks ago
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:27.660]  You can even trademark it maybe yeah. Well, it probably isn't worth it. I mean, you know, I don't know I probably should try
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.660]  I probably should try. I don't know. It's probably it probably is not worth it
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.820]  might be harder because it's a general it's a
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:40.860]  You know getting a regular word even though the pun involved in the name. I think it's I still think it's rather clever. But uh,
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.660]  I don't know. It might be hard because it's a dictionary word
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:50.460]  I am not a trademark lawyer. However, I filed for a number of trademarks now, so i'm familiar with the process and uh,
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.020]  from what I understand, um
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.860]  You know, you could you could almost definitely trademark it. It doesn't matter that you haven't yet
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.180]  It doesn't matter that it's out there. You know, the fact is it's still your thing your project
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:05.340]  Yeah, i'm not asking for it has not become a generic term that describes all things like this
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:09.180]  it is still a specific thing that that you made and
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.900]  you could just make the
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.060]  Because you know, like when you this is a very common thing. I hear people
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.860]  Talking incorrectly about on podcasts all the time
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.660]  They assume that a trademark is is like a universally unique name, right?
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:25.580]  Uh, when in fact when you file for a trademark you have to you have to file for it in certain
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:32.700]  relatively narrow categories and the more broadly you want that trademark to apply the harder it is to get and
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.140]  Sometimes is it possible to get it more broadly? Um, there might be someone else that's too close to you. So like
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:46.860]  So, you know like you like I have to file for overcast's trademark within like the parameters of a website that does
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:52.620]  That that you know lets people search and find and play podcasts and also a mobile application lets people search and find and play
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.020]  Podcasts and audio files and you know, you have you have to be that specific and
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:02.620]  And and you know the and the more the more generic and overcast is a word it's an english dictionary word
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.660]  But I still have a trademark pending on it. That looks like it's going to go through just fine
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.860]  And there are other trademarks for the word that are in different industries and that's fine, too
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:12.940]  And so yeah
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.300]  trademarks are are
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:19.820]  Trademarks are are limited to a certain scope and if you make that scope narrow enough you can trademark almost anything
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.140]  Yeah, it's not like getting the twitter account name
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.860]  That's impossible. Yeah
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.340]  Every time it comes up where someone's like, oh, yeah
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:31.420]  How do I want to recover this abandoned name on twitter every time this comes up?
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:35.500]  There's like three people who are like, oh, I know a guy I I can get that done or oh, yeah
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:39.100]  You could just email this person and every time if anyone else does it
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.980]  They can't do it anymore. The process has now changed. It is now more strict. You know, sorry, I can't do it
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.820]  Yeah, I think there might have been some lucy uc early days where you could get
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:49.820]  uh
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.340]  you know like in 2009, you could still get a claimed but
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.220]  vacant twitter name, but it's it's
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:01.900]  I don't know. I think for obvious reasons that it's gotten harder. I have at markdown
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.780]  I don't think i've ever even posted from it, but I do have that
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.220]  Do you know this I think I talked about this on the show, but it was years ago
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.740]  um
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.740]  Do you know who wanted to buy it from me?
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.700]  Um matt mullenweg, nope, glenn beck
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.620]  What?
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:22.300]  Talk show right wing talk show personality glenn beck. Does he have like a show with that name or something?
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.580]  He started he got involved in some kind of um
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.940]  Um
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.700]  Like an overstock.com, uh competitor
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.180]  Okay, so it's like price markdown either. Yeah, or maybe it was like groupon or something
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:42.300]  I went and looked at it and tried to figure out what the hell it was and I was just like no so and I just
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:47.580]  I got emails from them that they wanted to make a very serious offer about the twitter account and I
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.140]  Just never answered them
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:55.180]  That that is that is really truly something I just couldn't live with myself. I didn't want to hear the number
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.900]  Because I don't think it would have been that big anyway, I really don't yeah, I doubt it
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.700]  I really don't yeah, I doubt it. I don't think it would have been an offer that I couldn't refuse
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.500]  But I was afraid that it would be an offer. I couldn't refuse
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.380]  So on the other hand, it would be nice to take a whole lot of glenn beck's money. Oh, I don't know
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.540]  There's something about that
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:20.060]  Yeah, I thought of that too that wouldn't it be nice to you know, buy a new car with glenn beck's money
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.220]  but then I don't know there's something about taking his money that
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.940]  I don't know. But anyway, he wanted to buy it but I think his whole thing fell apart
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.940]  anyway, now his markdown is is
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.900]  Not even remembered. I don't think anybody remembered it
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940]  Does anyone remember him?
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:39.820]  I don't know because he's not on tv anymore. I still he pops up on the politics sites. I read every once in a while
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:47.020]  You can actually you actually read politics. I can I like politics make me so angry like every every political news thing
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:51.260]  I've ever read has just made me angry. So I I just try to avoid it as much as I used to be really into it
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:57.980]  When I did another enormous digression, but circa 2002 when I thought you know what i've got to start a blog
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.980]  a blog and it was
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.860]  Maybe it wasn't quite 50 50 and I know in hindsight
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:08.220]  everybody's going to say come on it couldn't have been but I it felt closer to 50 50 me whether I would write about
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.700]  tech and etc or
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.620]  Politics and etc. And then I thought well, maybe i'll start the the daring fireball one first
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.700]  Which I always knew was going to be would be the name of
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:21.420]  this one
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.980]  And I thought maybe i'll start a second blog I even have a name for it, but I won't I can't say what it is
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.260]  um
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:32.300]  Where I would write about politics, but it it's just to me. It's not that it makes me angry anymore
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:37.260]  It just bores me. It bores me to death. Yeah, because it's the same story all the time, you know, it's
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.020]  Everyone's getting screwed
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:43.500]  these people are you know being bribed or being bought by lobbyists and you know,
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.980]  the common people are getting screwed even further and
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.100]  Everything just sucks and there's no hope in sight. Like that's basically it
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.780]  Like if you if you boil it down, that's basically what every political
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.220]  Story is and yeah, I awful. I think if I had been alive
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:03.820]  If my you know been born a few decades earlier and had been like a same like a columnist type writer in the 70s or 80s
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:07.660]  I think it would have been about politics because I think it was so much more interesting then
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.620]  And I know there's a lot of a lot of some of the problems are exactly the same and the partisanship and stuff
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:15.260]  but
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:21.100]  It wasn't the money wasn't as as corrosive it wasn't so much that it was really all just about business
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:26.460]  Business, you know, it was it was more, you know, the partisanship was actually interesting and kind of fun to write about
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:31.580]  I just think it's funny also that you know, you and I have a similar problem
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:35.260]  You have it to a larger scale because your audience is much larger than mine
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.060]  We have a similar problem in that
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.460]  We say things that are opinionated
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:42.860]  about topics that shouldn't be
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.500]  emotionally charged but for many people they are
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.700]  and we get a lot of
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.540]  craft from people
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.540]  Who are like unreasonably?
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.620]  Surprisingly angry about some statement we make about like a phone
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:03.420]  I can't even imagine what it would take in your mind to think that it would be a good idea to enter political writing
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.740]  As an additional thing that you did
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.580]  From that point of view
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:14.460]  Yeah, and when i've dabbled in it on daring fireball, it's you know, I I don't mind the criticism, but it was enormous
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:20.220]  It was it peaked in 2008 with the sarah palin thing because I couldn't I couldn't not hold my tongue
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.940]  I was so clear that the woman was you know
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.340]  Borderline mentally disabled. I mean, you know
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.620]  Real a real real
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.340]  Problem and she was that was a scary time, right?
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:40.140]  When it appeared that like there was a very good chance like most people today who weren't voting or paying attention in 2008
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.300]  don't realize that like
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:46.540]  There was a very good chance. Sarah palin was going to be president right because you know mccain
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:51.420]  Yeah, mccain's still around now, but at the time everyone's looking at mccain saying he's not in great health. He's pretty old
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.980]  He was like one of the oldest people to run for president
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:30:00.620]  Well, and there was a tremendous and I think well-grounded fear that the polling numbers might be severely off
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.060]  Because there were an awful lot of people who wouldn't want to tell a pollster that they wouldn't vote for the black guy
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:12.380]  But when they go in in the privacy of the voting booth would right and there was a very real chance
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.620]  That mccain and palin were going to win
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:18.700]  And and that and because of mccain's age and health there was a good chance
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:25.440]  He might not make it for a full eight years and that she might become president like these were really like non-trivial possibilities
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.340]  And when i'd write about her man
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:34.540]  People would just a certain subset of people would just go nut and it was funny because some of them were clearly themselves very low iq
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:39.100]  But others were not others were you know, but that you know, they're because that's their
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:43.020]  Side and and they'd say, you know, if she was a democrat you'd love it
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:49.020]  It's like no if she was if i'm not that partisan. It's like my politics are certainly not conservative, but i'm not
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:55.900]  You know if if if a true moron ran on a democratic ticket I would do the same thing
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:31:03.500]  Like it's way more dangerous way more dangerous. I I prefer to have a democrat in the white house than a republican I do
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.140]  But I would much rather have
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.360]  any republican of reasonable intelligence
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:16.320]  Than a moron who's a democrat. I think that's terrifying like, you know, because when the democrats sell out the public
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:22.640]  They at least try to do it quietly and and in subtle in more subtle ways that are that are less likely to be traced back
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:28.480]  To them the republicans have have learned that they can sell out the public in public like
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.240]  You know
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.120]  Brashly, they they can they can just they can do
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.280]  Things that seem ridiculous to to thinking people
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:43.440]  But they can get away with it because no one cares it like they just the the public does not give a crap
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.360]  And so they just they can they can do whatever, you know
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.040]  At least at least the democrats give us the illusion that they are that they have us in mind which of course they don't
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.120]  But at least they give us that illusion
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.320]  And here's marco
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:03.760]  Proving in the email i'll get in the coming seven days exactly why I made the right choice in two totally
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.720]  No, and I I think I think it's best for for you and I to keep doing
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.520]  What we already do with this issue, which is like
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.400]  for truly important issues
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.640]  Blog about them on our tech blogs. Um
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.400]  Because if you know if we if either of us had a political blog
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.520]  The only people who would read it with people who agree with us
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.320]  Yeah, that's true basically or and there'd be there'd be occasional drive-by trolls who wanted to yell at us
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320]  But that doesn't really do anything. Um
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:33.760]  And so I I think I think you could make more of a difference
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.400]  for a cause you care about
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.400]  by not usually being political
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:44.160]  And choosing occasional times where it's worth it to be and then you kind of trick some people who don't agree with you into seeing
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.600]  That opinion. Yeah
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.240]  Here's the thing I keep thinking about when I look back at it
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.760]  I think that I wish that our system were set up in a way that it would be a lot easier for whoever won the
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.480]  Last election to get whatever shit done that they want
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:02.560]  And and if it turns out to be unpopular they're going to get voted out and whoever comes in next can undo it
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.720]  I think there should be a lot more
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:13.760]  Of that whereas we've got a system now where it's like nothing happens right like one one major I know i'm
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:18.640]  Exaggerating to some extent but really only one major thing has happened since obama
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.480]  Was elected president which is the health care reform, right?
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.960]  And look at how well that like everyone keeps trying to repeal that somehow which is comical, you know
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.600]  But and that's one thing right and yeah, it's a big thing. But still like that's yeah
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.960]  Somebody's gonna say, you know, it's because you know, that's that's people are gonna email me and say it's because obama's a terrible president
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:42.240]  A bad leader blah blah blah, but it's not it's because it's so the system is set up in a way that nobody can get anything
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.980]  Done bush didn't get much done other than start the wars in terms of major accomplishments
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.920]  Because it was like you know, it's not like you know, it's not like you know, it's not like you know
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.520]  Because it was like this thing that both sides could somehow for a few brief
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.680]  Years, it was like everybody felt like we had to get behind them. Um
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.400]  Uh, i'm not saying I was behind it
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.480]  But i'm just saying that like democrats who were in the senate and house also voted for it
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:10.480]  It was something that but other than that not much, you know, nobody passes anything
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.480]  I think it would be so much better and I say this knowing
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.640]  That in my lifetime there will be republican presidents and republicans control of the house and senate
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.360]  And all those things ebb and flow i'd rather see even the republicans get to get more of their stuff done while they're winning
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:32.320]  And vice versa then the current system which seems to be set up basically around the idea of let's try to make sure nobody can
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.520]  Do anything?
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:40.480]  Yeah, it seems like there there are some like security holes and in the procedures, uh in congress where like, you know
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.720]  it's very easy for
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:47.920]  For a party to block everything ever even when they're not really in power like the whole filibuster thing
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.600]  and certain majority rules like there are certain things where like it's just
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:59.600]  It seems like when these rules were considered or made or implemented. It was not really it was not really a thought put into it that
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.640]  What if one party or the other just decides to block everything for a decade?
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.120]  Like just says no to everything the party ever does for a decade and no one ever compromised on anything like
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:13.280]  I think that thought never crossed anyone's mind before because it it never really happened before
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:20.000]  Yeah, and now that now we're we're being shown. Oh, this is kind of a problem because we can't get anything done
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.480]  Even things that are fairly moderate like we can't even get moderate things passed
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.240]  so yeah, I it could use some rethought like some some
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.040]  Some rule changes in congress just just to just to make it so that it's possible to get
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:39.040]  Something through you know for for whoever has an uh, the the technical majority
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.240]  Yeah, and I think in terms of looking at a career as a you know
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.080]  Podcasting host and columnist on a blog, you know, that's what I mean when I say it to me
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.160]  It's just it would be it would be too boring
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.000]  I think I you know, I might have burned down on it not because I would have worked harder at it
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.840]  Or that it would have been more stressful it I think I would have burned out from boredom
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.360]  You know, like I think what makes what we talk about in general interesting is how quickly things can change, you know
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.160]  I mean just look at the phones alone that we've gone from a world, you know
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.920]  You know where the iphone didn't exist seven years ago
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.240]  Or I guess it would just come out a couple weeks ago seven years ago
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.320]  To a world where ibm and apple are selling iphones together to corporate customers. It's crazy
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.880]  Yeah, that's pretty nuts
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.360]  All right. Let me thank our second sponsor. It's our good friends at

[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.040]  Speaking of commercials, you know who what I saw the other day blew me away
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  i'm in a bar
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:07.920]  With amy having a drink and on on the tv behind the bar. It's showing espn and
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.480]  You know, I see a tv i'm going to pay attention to it and all of a sudden adam lisa gore is on tv
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:19.920]  Oh, yeah for what uh that there's a commercial that he shot a sandwich video for a company called true car
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.160]  true car
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.200]  It's the future of car buying. I actually I haven't watched the whole thing. I was in a bar. I couldn't hear it
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.200]  All I did was see him
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.480]  Uh now his videos have gone on real tv like national tv
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.800]  Now his videos have gone on real tv like national tv. That's gotta be like that's definitely a strange thing to see like your friend
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.920]  All of a sudden appear on tv. I went nuts. I think i'm usually pretty you know, I was like that
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I know that guy that's my
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.920]  He's been on my show
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.360]  Right my guy
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:55.360]  And there he is up there and it's just a classic sandwich video there and he's the spokesman. He's he's in it. He's all you know
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.920]  That's awesome
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.760]  I'm, I am so happy for him for everything. He's like I remember back when he was, you know before he started sandwich video
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.840]  He was just doing like video work for people and he didn't seem like he was that happy doing it
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.440]  I don't want to you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.920]  But it seemed like he was he was not incredibly happy with his previous jobs
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.920]  and he uh
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.200]  He did this thing on his own and it just exploded he is because like now everyone sees
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:27.840]  how cool he is like how his his style how talented he is and how good his work is and
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.200]  His unique like style and voice that he puts into these things that are so appealing to so many people like
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.840]  It's so great to see your friends have that kind of success
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.760]  And he's like the nicest guy in the world, you know, it couldn't happen to a better guy
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.960]  no, and he's such a thrill but it's so it's so because
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.520]  too it's like
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:50.640]  Who would have thought that that he you know, he just doesn't look like what you think of as celebrity pitch man
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.120]  Right, he's and he's like deadpan and like so like muted right and and it works and it works really well and we oh we you
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.760]  Know we all thought that you know, like internet nerds because we would see his video his previous videos and love them
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.800]  But yeah, I I think it's it's a surprise
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.240]  in a very good way that wow, everyone else feels this way too, it's it's like like
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:16.240]  Nerdy smart stuff like what we so often like around these parts is now popular everywhere
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.320]  it was so funny like I was making the directory in overcast and I had like whipped together directory a few days ago and and
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:31.120]  Jason Snell suggested this category titled pop culture and almost everything in it is about geek culture
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.640]  And part of that's because Jason Snell is a geek like us
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:41.360]  But part of it's also because geek culture now is pop culture and that was a very strange thing to realize, right?
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.840]  Yeah, like the thing the other day where that turned out that turns out the next Thor is a is a woman
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:51.280]  And it was like I couldn't like it was on every site
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.560]  It didn't matter whether it was a geek site or like a mainstream site. It was covered with equal
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  You know
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.880]  Excitement
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.680]  And you know, it it was a perfect example to me because I remember growing up
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.760]  What happened in comic books would be like something like only the other kids in fifth grade?
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:18.240]  We're talking about you couldn't turn on tv and find out about the new spider-man outfit. You know what I mean?
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.080]  Yeah, well because they weren't making movies that made billions of dollars with it
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.280]  Right, but it's just funny how it's crossed over and I but that's the thing though
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.760]  Is that it's I think it's highly doubtful that that the you know
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.200]  All sorts of stuff that happens in the comic books doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen in the movies, you know
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.440]  So it it's it's only in the comic books where there's going to be a where thor is now a woman
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.280]  I mean, I guess it could eventually be turned into a movie
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.760]  I don't know but I love that you've had me on here to talk about ibm tv and comics comics
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.520]  I'm, like so incredibly unqualified. I don't I don't read comic books. It's for babies
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.680]  I just think it's in I just think it's an interesting example of what you were talking about
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.200]  yeah, yeah
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.200]  I think I think it's more like, you know, it's
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.600]  You know a lot of people know, you know one or two nerds who or maybe you are one of these nerds, uh who?
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.680]  You were a nerd socially growing up. It did not serve you well
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.240]  And then you got a job that paid you good money
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:24.880]  And then all of a sudden people are interested in you. I feel like that has happened to the entire
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.000]  nerd industry like the whole nerd and all the geeky category of things like
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.240]  Now geeks are big business
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.720]  You know, we we control all the internet stuff our comic books and all that crap are now like billion dollar movie franchises and stuff like that
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.200]  Like I feel like the rest of the world now cares about us because we have all the money
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:48.320]  I guess to a certain degree that describes me but I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.360]  I guess to a certain degree that describes me, but I think I was always a little bit a little bit outside that
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.080]  a little bit harder to to
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.640]  Pin down in that sort of you know, like my high school years were not unhappy
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:05.280]  I wasn't I wouldn't I would say the only thing that made me really unhappy is I just wanted to already live on my own
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.320]  not that I don't love my parents and they're not great, but I felt like I was
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.680]  I was I felt clearly able to make my own decisions. It's about when to go to bed, you know
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.240]  Yeah when I was around 11
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:24.640]  You have now reached the conclusion of side one of your official national lampoon stereo test and demonstration record
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.400]  And what better time for our special end of the record test?
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.240]  first of all
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.240]  This is a test of your equipment
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:38.720]  No matter what brand or type of record player you have the tone arm should now be close to the center of the record
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.320]  And almost at the shiny area just before the label
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.440]  If you own an automatic turntable in a few seconds
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:52.880]  The arm should raise itself as if by magic and then return to its rest near the outside of the unit
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  If you do not have an automatic turntable
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.560]  This should not happen
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.280]  The second part of this test involves you
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:07.840]  If you have been correctly installed as part of your stereo system, you will now lift the record up
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:12.480]  Turn it over and replace it on the turntable with side two on the top
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.720]  You will then proceed to listen to all of side two
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.680]  If you do not do this
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:38.480]  You have failed the test and you have the worst hi-fi system in the world no matter how much money you spent
