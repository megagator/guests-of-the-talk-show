[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not, I'm not worried.
[00:04.240 --> 00:08.360]  I'm concerned. Yeah, me too. I don't know.
[00:08.600 --> 00:12.040]  I never have problems sleeping. Are we recording? How did last night go?
[00:12.360 --> 00:16.200]  Terrible. Just John. Yeah. It's like I fall asleep.
[00:16.240 --> 00:20.600]  And then it's like a, uh, just don't, don't, I don't know. Wake up.
[00:20.640 --> 00:23.160]  I got the sweats, you know, it's ugly stuff.
[00:26.800 --> 00:28.720]  What's your, you got, you got thoughts on sleeping?
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.200]  Oh man, I got so many thoughts on sleeping. Um,
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.440]  geez. Um, I mean, let's, let's, uh,
[00:37.480 --> 00:40.600]  let's be a doctor. Did, has anything changed recently?
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.360]  I don't think so. Are you drinking way more or way less or just way more?
[00:45.720 --> 00:48.000]  Yeah, probably just what? Are you drinking like a lot, a lot, a lot more?
[00:49.080 --> 00:51.360]  Maybe. I don't know. Maybe that's a problem.
[00:51.920 --> 00:54.600]  That's probably unrelated. It's just, they, they call it ruling out.
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.040]  I just need to rule out alcohol and it sounds like that's not a factor. I don't
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.400]  know. I'll tell you what I've, I have never, I don't,
[01:02.560 --> 01:05.560]  I can't remember the last time I canceled a podcast. We were supposed to,
[01:05.560 --> 01:09.440]  we were recording here on what is today? Friday, the May the 10th.
[01:10.640 --> 01:13.480]  We were supposed to record yesterday. I had a beg off. I had a,
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.320]  I had a pull up abort. I just like the, what the, the Cal Ripken,
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.640]  a podcast. I know. What did I, when did I text you? I texted you in the morning,
[01:22.640 --> 01:27.160]  right? Yeah. See, my problem is, I'll, I'll talk all you want about sleep.
[01:27.160 --> 01:29.960]  I'm kind of an early riser now and I think I, I don't know.
[01:29.960 --> 01:33.160]  I hope I didn't jostle you awake. Are you a DND man? You leave? Oh, I'm a DND.
[01:33.160 --> 01:36.880]  I'm a DND man. That's huge. That that's Mark. That went off the list.
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.080]  That is huge. Yeah. And you are, you very, I was a, here's me,
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.000]  like here's some ideas. There's some stuff to talk about. And you know,
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.440]  I updated the document and you sounded like you were again,
[01:49.440 --> 01:53.520]  the medical term, you were super out of it. I was under the weather. Yeah.
[01:53.560 --> 01:55.440]  I don't want to complain. You know what I mean? I don't want to,
[01:55.480 --> 01:58.480]  I don't want to sit here and bring the listeners down that, you know, people are,
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.960]  people don't come on to the talk show for, uh, to hear about, uh,
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.160]  sad story, but yeah. But we'll talk about what? But butterfly keys.
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.960]  Yeah. That's what people want to hear about. Uh, a guy Rambo, right?
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.040]  I will tell you, I, I, I'll talk about sleep a little. I,
[02:19.040 --> 02:19.880]  I would love, John,
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.200]  I would love to talk about sleep and I have notes on this and I have an apple
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.040]  angle on this.
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.000]  I am extremely lucky and privileged that,
[02:29.560 --> 02:33.960]  uh, I, I'm just a natural sound sleeper. I sleep like a rock.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.200]  I joke when I do the, the Casper ad reads that I spent half my life in bed.
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.120]  It's not a joke. I sleep a lot. I sleep, I sleep long, I sleep deep.
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.400]  And I, and I really, I, I enjoy sleeping. I really do. I feel it,
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.600]  it's, you know, maybe the best part of the day. I'll tell you what, when I,
[02:52.960 --> 02:56.800]  but, but not being able to sleep when you're like,
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.720]  I feel bad complaining that I've had a week here where I feel a little bit under
[03:00.720 --> 03:02.560]  the weather and I'm not sleeping well. Uh,
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.560]  because some people I know don't sleep well, period. Right. Yeah.
[03:07.920 --> 03:12.080]  You know? Yeah. So who am I to spend 99% of my life sleeping like a rock?
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.640]  And then the one week when, uh, you know, not sleeping well,
[03:16.440 --> 03:17.960]  what's the point of privilege if you don't use it?
[03:17.960 --> 03:20.520]  Right. I don't know what to do. I honest to God don't know what to do.
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.160]  So, okay, so let's do some diagnosis just quick and we can get to the tech tips.
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.200]  You're saying that for as long as you can remember, you're a sound sleeper.
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.440]  So to me that, okay, so that means, uh, whatever,
[03:33.440 --> 03:37.600]  whack ado time you do go to bed, you don't have problems falling asleep.
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.280]  I'm gonna give you an array. You don't have problems falling asleep.
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.000]  You don't have problems staying asleep. And it sounds like you,
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.120]  uh, you don't like wake up in a panic feeling unrefreshed.
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.960]  That's, that is all true. Wow.
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.400]  So you don't have, I mean, one of the things people get wrong,
[03:56.440 --> 03:58.160]  insomnia is a lot like procrastination,
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.200]  I think where people really misunderstand, you know, what's the cause,
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.640]  what's the effect. I mean, I don't want to trigger anybody here,
[04:04.640 --> 04:07.800]  like content warning, insomnia. But like, you know,
[04:08.120 --> 04:11.560]  one problem with insomnia is that true insomnia is very,
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.640]  I think very misunderstood because you could be a person,
[04:15.640 --> 04:18.040]  you notice I asked you, you know, that array had three parts to it.
[04:18.240 --> 04:21.960]  Some people are fine getting asleep. Some people are fine staying asleep.
[04:22.120 --> 04:24.520]  Some people are fine waking up feeling good.
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.520]  And some people have one or more of those problems that make their life
[04:28.560 --> 04:32.000]  unmanageable. For some people, if you do,
[04:32.440 --> 04:35.720]  for whatever reason, medical, mental, emotional, whatever it is,
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.640]  you get into insomnia, a pattern can emerge that's harrowing,
[04:40.840 --> 04:44.760]  which is, I mean, again, I don't want to trigger people, but insomnia,
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.920]  the part that's misunderstood is that you, you know, you want to sleep.
[04:47.920 --> 04:49.280]  You don't want to be up all night.
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.480]  You started to dread the idea of going to sleep because now you feel like you're
[04:54.480 --> 04:58.000]  never going to fall asleep and ask yourself like whether that helps again,
[04:58.160 --> 05:00.800]  like procrastination. It's not a switch that you can flip,
[05:01.440 --> 05:03.840]  but it sounds like historically you, you haven't suffered from that.
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.880]  This is a recent thing. God, I hope this isn't too boring,
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.240]  but I think you say, so you're sitting here right now,
[05:09.880 --> 05:12.440]  I'm gonna throw you in a sec. You, you're sitting here right now and you're
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.720]  saying like, Oh gosh, who could sympathize with this? Boo hoo. Uh, you know,
[05:15.720 --> 05:18.200]  Apple boy, uh, gets to sleep whenever he wants.
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.200]  But the truth is like people don't talk about this enough or when they do talk
[05:22.200 --> 05:24.000]  about it, it's always, Oh yeah, you know,
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.120]  I really should be getting more sleep. I'm here to tell you, man,
[05:26.480 --> 05:29.440]  if you don't get your sleep wired right,
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.240]  it has the first day you'll feel an impact like,
[05:33.240 --> 05:35.640]  and then over the next days you might feel different impacts.
[05:35.640 --> 05:40.600]  But if you do that over and over again, it'll mess up pretty much everything.
[05:40.600 --> 05:42.800]  Yeah. Like the balance that your body wants,
[05:42.800 --> 05:45.320]  you're going to be kind of the equivalent that you remember coming back from
[05:45.320 --> 05:50.000]  New Zealand and it's like, Whoa, that was going, there was no problem.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.520]  It was the coming back was brutal and you had an extra like eight hours on top
[05:53.520 --> 05:55.760]  of that. But anyways, that's the thing is like,
[05:55.760 --> 05:59.680]  I don't think you should feel bad about this and I think your listeners should
[05:59.680 --> 06:03.200]  be open to the idea that, and I'm not saying you're going to get a perfect
[06:03.200 --> 06:07.480]  sleep, but the idea of improving the way you sleep, it's so goddamn boring.
[06:07.480 --> 06:10.760]  But like you, if you get this wired even a little bit,
[06:10.960 --> 06:15.160]  your life improves like so quickly and when it goes wrong,
[06:15.200 --> 06:18.840]  you really notice. Yeah. I'll tell you what, if you,
[06:18.880 --> 06:22.760]  if you feel like me nodding off here on the show, just, uh, you know,
[06:22.760 --> 06:25.080]  reach out and slap me. Well, I'm the perfect guy for that. You know,
[06:25.080 --> 06:27.800]  it just becomes like a kind of a dull home, like a West coast home.
[06:31.960 --> 06:35.960]  How are you? I'm doing great. Are you doing great? My sleep is pretty good.
[06:35.960 --> 06:39.720]  I have, I have a Apple watch apps that helped me turn sleep into a video game
[06:39.720 --> 06:42.320]  and I feel pretty good. Tell me about this. Tell me about this,
[06:42.320 --> 06:45.800]  a Apple angler. Well, I mean, you know, do you really want to talk about that?
[06:45.800 --> 06:46.640]  It's just going to bore your, it's,
[06:46.760 --> 06:50.200]  it's like when Dan and I talk about markdown and I can literally hear people
[06:50.200 --> 06:54.400]  deleting the episode because we tried for a while. Cause as you know, John,
[06:54.400 --> 06:59.000]  I'm really into markdown and when you talk about it, wow. I mean,
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.200]  it's like a portion mint or, or, or millage.
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.200]  It's one of those things where people just like, ah, even people who do it for
[07:06.200 --> 07:10.560]  a living hate it. But yeah, I'd love to because the, um,
[07:10.600 --> 07:11.800]  the truth is like this, uh,
[07:11.800 --> 07:15.880]  this journey started for me awhile back cause I have a lot of anxiety and I'm
[07:15.880 --> 07:19.880]  also getting older and it became something where I kind of had to confront this
[07:20.320 --> 07:24.040]  and it's taken really year. Oh, first of all, I should have to say step zero.
[07:24.040 --> 07:28.520]  Like I said to you yesterday, I consider drugs like the right kind of drugs.
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.600]  Like there's drugs you can get like maybe, uh, maybe not Unisom cause that has,
[07:33.240 --> 07:36.920]  can really kick back at you. But yeah, I mean it's gotta be said, drugs help.
[07:37.640 --> 07:40.200]  But the, um, but the journey for me like goes all the way back to like when I
[07:40.200 --> 07:44.720]  first got a Fitbit and the Fitbit, um, not, not the one,
[07:44.920 --> 07:47.520]  it wasn't the one that has the little capsule in a sleeve.
[07:47.520 --> 07:50.240]  It was when the Fitbit got better kind of, and it,
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.000]  and it started adding not just sleep tracking,
[07:53.800 --> 07:57.880]  but something I loved that was automatic sleep tracking. And that's,
[07:57.880 --> 08:01.720]  that was at the time virtually unheard of. And believe me, I've tried them all.
[08:01.720 --> 08:04.080]  I tried an old school sleep watch in the mid,
[08:04.120 --> 08:06.120]  like in the aughts that looked like a dive watch.
[08:06.120 --> 08:08.120]  I've tried the now Apple owned bet it.
[08:08.520 --> 08:12.040]  I've tried so many of these different things and so many of them involve some
[08:12.040 --> 08:17.000]  kind of stupid contortion with a dingus and then remembering to turn it on and
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.640]  off and all that kind of junk. But that wouldn't work for me.
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.360]  Cause once I want to go to sleep, it's like, I can't, you know,
[08:25.360 --> 08:30.040]  I can't be futzing around with the thing and that we're remembering it,
[08:30.320 --> 08:33.840]  you know, when you wake up or whatever. I mean, yeah, yeah, it's gotta be,
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.160]  you need something that's going to like take care of that for you.
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.840]  Where like in a lot of this, what do they call it? Self quantization,
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.800]  whatever you want to call it.
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.800]  The like tracking of your stuff will only work really work when it is to the
[08:46.760 --> 08:49.960]  greatest extent possible, um,
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.960]  um, completely automatic where you do not even have to look at the results.
[08:55.560 --> 08:59.640]  You know, like most of us, if you try to like he eat healthier and you get
[08:59.640 --> 09:03.000]  something like, uh, like what is it like my fitness buddy or whatever.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.160]  There's pretty good apps for this and they got all the brand names,
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.240]  but you still got to remember to get the, put it in and get the portion right.
[09:08.680 --> 09:11.560]  And like my friend John Siracusa says, every time I have a reckon about life,
[09:11.560 --> 09:14.520]  he's like, well, I'd love to see what would happen if you know,
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.000]  some lady with a clipboard was actually watching you to see how that actually
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.400]  went rather than how you think it went.
[09:19.400 --> 09:22.240]  So you don't have to guess with this. So Fitbit did two things.
[09:22.560 --> 09:24.480]  One was that it did sleep tracking.
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.040]  The second one that was such a killer feature was automatic sleep tracking.
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.000]  It could sense through a variety of, you know,
[09:31.240 --> 09:34.120]  biometric cues like when you were sleeping, are you still,
[09:34.120 --> 09:35.760]  did your heartbeat go down, all that stuff.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.720]  And that's what kicked off my real interest in, in capturing this stuff.
[09:40.520 --> 09:42.000]  And now today the Apple,
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.040]  there are Apple watch apps for this that I've whittled down from about six
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.720]  different ones to two that I can really recommend.
[09:50.160 --> 09:53.840]  And it kind of turns sleep into a video game in a good way.
[09:53.880 --> 09:56.840]  It really encourages you to try and get high score and put your initials up.
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.440]  Well, what are the, what are the, what are these apps now? People are gonna,
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.160]  you can't just leave people hanging.
[10:01.800 --> 10:04.840]  People tell you about something you like people are gonna be dying.
[10:04.880 --> 10:06.200]  People are dying to know. Come on.
[10:06.800 --> 10:09.680]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, forgive me. I, I, I, uh, most of your listeners,
[10:09.680 --> 10:11.120]  there's probably never heard anything I've done,
[10:11.120 --> 10:12.560]  but it's something I've talked about a lot. There's,
[10:12.560 --> 10:15.160]  and there's two apps that I really recommend if you, okay.
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.000]  So something I learned from underscore David Smith who has a sleep tracking app
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.840]  is that like if you have an Apple watch, you would be surprised. Uh,
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.120]  if you choose to sleep with an Apple watch on, it's less difficult than you think.
[10:27.600 --> 10:31.040]  You know, especially as the batteries get better and longer on the newer ones,
[10:31.640 --> 10:34.040]  you can basically stay as you've probably discovered. You can say,
[10:34.080 --> 10:35.800]  did you wear an Apple watch right now?
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.360]  Mostly or you're like one of those fancy guys with like a fancy Marco watch.
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.360]  Yeah. You know, I, I, I, you know, I've got one on right now.
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.520]  I do have one. I have an Apple watch on right now.
[10:47.800 --> 10:49.320]  So there's two that I, that I can,
[10:49.320 --> 10:51.800]  that I like and can recommend and I think they cost money. Shut up. Bye.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.640]  It's your health. Um, one in one,
[10:53.640 --> 10:56.400]  that's the one that I can really recommend to people who just want to see if this
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.120]  is going to work for them and how this will work for them is a pretty drop dead
[11:00.120 --> 11:04.040]  easy call, easy app, uh, for Apple watch and,
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.560]  and your phone called, um, sleep watch.
[11:07.560 --> 11:10.160]  And I think I, I don't know if I dropped the link in, but I will,
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.320]  you can Google sleep watch. Sleep watch is, um, is real simple.
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.600]  It gives you a real simple return.
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.160]  You basically look at it and it tracks a bunch of stuff.
[11:18.200 --> 11:19.640]  All these apps track stuff.
[11:19.640 --> 11:22.680]  They track slightly different stuff in slightly different ways,
[11:23.080 --> 11:26.440]  but sleep watch will say like, okay, you know, you don't have to turn it on.
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.280]  You don't have to turn it off. Basically when you, you know, it's,
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.520]  it's sinking pretty much in the background. And, uh, and so the, uh,
[11:33.560 --> 11:36.000]  the sleep watch app will just basically show you like, okay,
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.240]  here's where you were in. Here's where you were awake.
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.240]  Here's where you were in light, sweet sleep. Here's where you're in deep sleep.
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.840]  But it also has really nice graphs to show you your progress over time.
[11:46.600 --> 11:50.320]  Right? So it, it will show you, um,
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.120]  like how well you did with the basic stuff. Like how long did you sleep?
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.320]  It'll show you stuff like, um, how much like quality sleep did you get?
[11:58.640 --> 12:00.760]  And then it also gets into a really important stuff.
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.240]  Like did your heart rate dip? Like for somebody like me, that's a big deal.
[12:04.240 --> 12:07.600]  And so, so a sleep watch is, is a real straight forward one for what's that mean?
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.760]  No, your heart rate dips. I don't understand. Why is that a big deal?
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.040]  Part of getting good sleep according to the apps that I use is to see it,
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.760]  basically to see a Delta between what your heart rate is when you're awake and
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.520]  what your heart rate is when you're asleep.
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.000]  And as somebody who's been using these for years now, I can tell you that, uh,
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.760]  there's a, if I got really bad sleep, like say I'd had some drinks, um,
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.800]  I can see that my heart rate did not go down very much.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.400]  And so even if you classic thing, like, you know,
[12:36.400 --> 12:37.880]  whether it's snoring or apnea or whatever,
[12:37.880 --> 12:40.600]  there's this stuff where you don't really like know you're awake,
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.800]  but maybe you were awake and you weren't aware of it. Maybe your partner,
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.960]  like mine gives you a little nudge if you're snoring.
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.280]  So over time it'll show you how that's doing. It'll show you stuff like, well,
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.800]  you know, how, how disrupted it was over time as a graphic. So, you know,
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.560]  if you just want to try this out, I would say,
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.080]  um, try, try to sleep watch is, is, is the, is the kind of like the,
[13:03.080 --> 13:05.600]  I think that's, it's very good. It's fine by itself. And,
[13:05.600 --> 13:09.040]  but I think it's the starter one for this. And then what's the other one?
[13:09.680 --> 13:12.720]  Um, it is called auto sleep. And I first heard about this,
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.280]  I want to say from, um, Federica Viticci. And I first tried it and it's,
[13:17.520 --> 13:20.320]  it's a little bit, gosh,
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.640]  it gives you results that look a little like something like a Picard would want
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.640]  to look at on a screen. And you're like, what does this mean?
[13:29.040 --> 13:31.400]  But like once you get used to their wackadoo interface,
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.200]  once you have sort of calibrated it, uh,
[13:35.240 --> 13:36.320]  I won't go on about this,
[13:36.320 --> 13:40.240]  but I keep and use both because it doesn't cost anything to keep them running.
[13:40.480 --> 13:42.480]  And I get different views into the data from it.
[13:42.480 --> 13:44.520]  And the reason I recommend it for you and your listeners,
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.760]  if you choose to is that it can really encourage, you know,
[13:48.760 --> 13:50.600]  you're a competitive guy, you know, you'll,
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.480]  you'll play a little about blackjack once in a while.
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.800]  Yeah, sure. Once in a while you're, you're, you're a computer.
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.400]  And if you're a computer, uh,
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.120]  you start competing with yourself a little bit now important provides though,
[14:00.280 --> 14:04.800]  if stuff like this causes you stress and is generating anxiety you didn't have
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.120]  before, then don't, that's probably not a good fit, but you will,
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.200]  I think over time,
[14:10.200 --> 14:13.720]  find yourself if you start noticing the benefits of getting a little bit more
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.120]  and importantly, better sleep, right?
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.480]  Like sleeping for 12 hours may not be the key to your success and health. Uh,
[14:20.480 --> 14:23.560]  and yeah, so anyway, you pop it open, you look out in the morning, uh, you know,
[14:23.560 --> 14:24.080]  you take a,
[14:24.080 --> 14:26.960]  take a gentleman's visit in the morning and you look at your, uh,
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.760]  look at your data and you go like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.360]  That's that's how I slept last night. I don't know if that's good for you,
[14:31.360 --> 14:33.600]  but it seems like you could enjoy competing with yourself. You're,
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.200]  you're a performer. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, it is something that's,
[14:37.240 --> 14:40.120]  you know, something to think about. You've got, you know,
[14:40.120 --> 14:42.680]  we got these little computers strapped to our wrists all the time.
[14:43.320 --> 14:46.200]  I think that, um, final thing on this, unless you have a lot more,
[14:46.200 --> 14:47.440]  I don't want to bore your folks,
[14:47.440 --> 14:50.960]  but final final thing on this that I think is interesting is that like, uh,
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.280]  like any kind of stuff,
[14:52.320 --> 14:55.920]  like once you become a little bit of a spreadsheet nerd or like a smart home
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.040]  nerd or even like a basic background self quantization nerd,
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.160]  you start to realize that I feel like, um,
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.000]  it's valuable to capture this data even if I'm not sure what I'm going to do
[15:08.000 --> 15:08.840]  with it right now.
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.800]  Like it's not going to hurt me to be able to run a longitudinal mini
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.520]  study on myself and see what stuff changes over time.
[15:17.720 --> 15:20.840]  And there are actually apps that will help you find those insights in very
[15:20.840 --> 15:23.960]  helpful ways. I know, for example, though, when my kid is not in school,
[15:24.480 --> 15:27.720]  my step count for the day goes through the floor because I'm not picking her up
[15:27.720 --> 15:30.520]  twice and picking her up and dropping her off every day. But, um, yeah,
[15:30.520 --> 15:32.160]  I don't know, it may not be for everybody.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.280]  And there's plenty of mostly good and sometimes terrible advice about sleep.
[15:36.280 --> 15:39.200]  You want to get a dark room, you want to try and avoid screens at bedtime.
[15:39.200 --> 15:41.240]  Don't eat too late. There's all that kind of stuff.
[15:41.240 --> 15:44.800]  You probably want your room cooler than you think you do.
[15:44.840 --> 15:46.200]  That actually helps a lot.
[15:46.680 --> 15:51.080]  Maybe don't drink a gallon of water or similar before bed. But yeah, I'd love,
[15:51.120 --> 15:53.320]  I'd love to, uh, I don't know, man, I hope you,
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.880]  I hope you find something that I'll try. I just feel like I got a bug.
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.880]  I'll be all right. You think you might be a little sick,
[15:59.880 --> 16:01.320]  low end of the weather. That's what I think.
[16:01.320 --> 16:04.440]  I think I'm a little under weather, but it's in a, in a very, uh,
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.600]  hard to put my finger on it way. Like I wouldn't like to go,
[16:07.600 --> 16:08.960]  I would not go to the doctor.
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.680]  Like I'm not going to get off this podcast with you and then go see my,
[16:12.160 --> 16:15.520]  my family physician. I wouldn't know what to tell her. You know what I mean?
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.360]  Like I just, uh, just, uh, I feel a little off, you know, what do you,
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.320]  you can't go to the doctor and say, you feel a little off.
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.840]  No, you shouldn't go to the doctor at all. They're the worst doctors are terrible.
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.960]  Well, I love all this with an app. Yeah. I think your son,
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.640]  now your son's getting a little older. Uh,
[16:30.680 --> 16:32.640]  we were actually as I prepped for this and talked to my daughter,
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.000]  we were reminiscing about when, uh, your son and my daughter hung out, you know,
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.640]  one time and she doesn't remember very well because she's, she's real little,
[16:40.840 --> 16:43.520]  but you know, he's still a carrier, John. You're, you're aware of this, right?
[16:43.560 --> 16:45.280]  Yes. Oh, of course. I mean, he's a, he's like,
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.920]  he's like a germ sponge with a PlayStation. Like he's just,
[16:48.920 --> 16:52.960]  he's just carrying illness into your house all the time. Well, that was Amy's.
[16:52.960 --> 16:55.080]  Amy's, it was giving me a, you know,
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.560]  I was trying to like drum up some sympathy and uh, and she was like, well,
[16:59.600 --> 17:02.120]  how did you get sick? You haven't left the house all week,
[17:03.280 --> 17:05.440]  but we've got the kid coming in and out. You know what I mean?
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.280]  Like it's not like we're hermetically sealed. I mean, uh, you know,
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.200]  I don't have to leave the house for, for to, to catch a bug, you know?
[17:14.240 --> 17:16.520]  No, the bug will come to you. Yeah, the bug will definitely come to me.
[17:18.360 --> 17:20.760]  Please, please follow up with me. I would love to, um,
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.320]  I would love to be your a sleep Sherpa.
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.600]  I got a question for you. Yeah. Random question. Thinking about it.
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.160]  I took a Nick out of my thumb the other day. Just a little, little,
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.760]  uh, I got like this, uh, do you, do you, uh,
[17:36.800 --> 17:41.520]  you like the Muji, the Muji store? Yeah, yeah,
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.080]  sure. Sure. That's about bargains in the Japanese style boy. Yeah.
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.440]  So Muji, if for those of you who don't know is, uh, a Japanese,
[17:49.640 --> 17:50.720]  I don't even know what you would call it.
[17:50.720 --> 17:53.400]  I was going to say a stationary store cause that's what I tend to buy there,
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.440]  but they also also sell clothing, uh, and,
[17:57.440 --> 18:00.720]  and have a sort of, uh, uh,
[18:00.720 --> 18:02.800]  I know the word minimalist is overused,
[18:02.800 --> 18:05.480]  but they have a genuine minimalist aesthetic.
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.800]  They don't even put their logo on stuff. It's, it's all very plain. Anyway,
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.400]  a couple of years ago I bought this adorable little hand crank paper
[18:14.400 --> 18:19.240]  shredder. Uh, oh wow. You just, uh, it's like a little,
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.080]  just like, like a, like a, like a pasta maker for secrets. Yeah.
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.880]  Something like that. You can, you know, and you know, I tried to put a whole,
[18:26.280 --> 18:29.680]  uh, it, I, I don't know why I did it.
[18:29.680 --> 18:33.440]  I put a whole envelope, uh, like a credit card offer, credit card offers. Yep.
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.640]  And it's not like closed. I wasn't,
[18:38.280 --> 18:42.400]  I wasn't shredding it because I felt like, Hey, if I don't shred this, there's,
[18:42.440 --> 18:44.240]  you know, something bad is going to happen.
[18:44.240 --> 18:48.080]  Somebody is going to steal my identity or take a credit card money. I just,
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.120]  I just felt like, Hey, this would be a fun thing to do is use my,
[18:52.200 --> 18:55.960]  my paper shredder, right? Like a, like a fidget spinner. You know what I mean?
[18:55.960 --> 18:56.960]  Like something to do with your hands.
[18:56.960 --> 19:00.000]  I took a Nick out of my thumb twisting this thing around.
[19:00.240 --> 19:04.640]  So now I got a bandaid on. I never really thought about it. I'm 46 years old.
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.440]  I have, I have strong feelings on bandaids. Number one,
[19:09.520 --> 19:14.120]  I do believe that the bandaid brand is the superior brand of bandaid.
[19:14.760 --> 19:18.480]  I, I feel like, you know, not, not just cause you can get C3 PO,
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.720]  the performance characteristics of the bandaid brand adhesive bandage,
[19:23.720 --> 19:26.720]  uh, far out stripped out of a CVS or a Walgreens. That's for sure.
[19:26.880 --> 19:30.080]  It definitely does. Right. Uh, and, and that's the only,
[19:30.360 --> 19:33.120]  but those are like your only choices now. Remember there was,
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.680]  what was the other brand? It was like curate or something like that.
[19:36.400 --> 19:39.720]  Like when we were kids, there was, there was, yeah, right. They were,
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.160]  they were like the, um, I was about to say Numinos bad on me. No, they,
[19:44.200 --> 19:48.600]  but they were the, um, yeah, the hydrox, the hydrox to the Oreo. Right.
[19:48.800 --> 19:52.640]  Yeah. And, and they, you know, they, they owned it, you know,
[19:52.640 --> 19:56.560]  they had like green box, you know, which doesn't really scream first aid to me.
[19:56.560 --> 20:00.880]  You know, I mean like bandaid owns that white box with the red and blue and the
[20:01.080 --> 20:04.800]  red cross. But, uh, what's your favorite kind of bandaid?
[20:05.920 --> 20:07.880]  Oh, that's a really good question. Um,
[20:08.160 --> 20:13.080]  now I'm tempted to say I like the more exotic blends because, um,
[20:13.480 --> 20:16.000]  it's one of the rare things in life where I've thought about the future and
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.280]  prepared a very, very rare, uh, which is that we, uh,
[20:19.280 --> 20:23.360]  we get the big box, uh, with all the different kinds in it. Now,
[20:23.400 --> 20:28.040]  I can see why somebody would like the B spoke fancy, uh,
[20:28.080 --> 20:32.280]  flying buttress, fingertip dingus. I know what you mean.
[20:32.640 --> 20:35.880]  I know the one that's like an H right. It's, it is,
[20:35.880 --> 20:39.680]  it's basically like a tie fighter for your finger. Right. I think, uh, yeah,
[20:39.720 --> 20:42.440]  some of somebody like a Tim Gunn would say that seems a little bit overworked.
[20:42.480 --> 20:47.280]  I like the classic, whatever that classic is, that fabric in the, that, well,
[20:47.280 --> 20:50.880]  I, we get the fabric ones. I like the fabric ones that are, uh, you know,
[20:50.880 --> 20:52.800]  just what are they? Probably a two and a half inches across,
[20:52.800 --> 20:55.720]  maybe half an inch wide. And, uh,
[20:55.760 --> 21:00.400]  I have good luck with those and I'll occasionally opt for, um, you know,
[21:00.440 --> 21:04.320]  the, the little guys, the little classic mini sized. Do you have a preference?
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.040]  I, I've always been partial to the flexible fabric. That's what they call it.
[21:09.840 --> 21:11.760]  It just feels luxurious. You know what I mean?
[21:11.760 --> 21:15.080]  Like it feels like you've really are pampering yourself with a really nice
[21:15.080 --> 21:19.000]  bandaid. I mean, you're, you're, you're, you're worth it and you're in a,
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.840]  you're having a bad time. You had an injury. Like why would you deprive yourself
[21:22.920 --> 21:25.200]  of a little bit of Lux? But I do think,
[21:25.200 --> 21:27.240]  here's the other thing I was thinking about though. I, I,
[21:27.320 --> 21:30.480]  as I've been wearing a bandaid here on my thumb for the last two days and who
[21:30.480 --> 21:32.880]  knows, maybe I've given myself tetanus. Maybe that's the whole,
[21:33.680 --> 21:37.320]  maybe that's what's going on. Tetanus. Yeah. And now I'm feeling my jaw.
[21:39.240 --> 21:41.640]  Oh, all of a sudden it does feel a little tight.
[21:41.640 --> 21:46.200]  It could be, it could be ratings. You might need shots in your stomach.
[21:46.440 --> 21:50.560]  It might have locked up Marlin. That's bad in your racket.
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.920]  It is a really bad, this is, yeah, that is, that is,
[21:55.240 --> 21:57.480]  it could be devastating. Do your shows like, uh,
[21:57.520 --> 22:00.520]  like Michael Corleone in the Italian restaurant. What I want,
[22:02.520 --> 22:05.800]  what I want, no more. I come from my father's life.
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.840]  I have to do it. Like Kanye. Kanye's first hit.
[22:10.840 --> 22:13.200]  He had his jaw wired shut. This could be a whole new thing.
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.280]  Or like a Stephen Hawking and you know, do text to speech or something.
[22:18.560 --> 22:21.440]  I don't know. That's come a long way for sure. If you get lockjaw,
[22:21.480 --> 22:23.360]  do you know anything about this now?
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.120]  I feel like I've got hypochondria is really the fundamental problem I've got.
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.680]  Yeah. Ah, like you can beat it. If you get lockjaw,
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.080]  you can beat it though, right? They just shoot you up with, uh,
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.440]  something. Yeah. Anti-inflammatories or something. Right. See, I don't know.
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.080]  I'm getting kind of confused because you know,
[22:42.120 --> 22:45.480]  there was that whole range of like,
[22:46.160 --> 22:49.240]  I don't know if you had these, uh, in the, in the Philadelphia,
[22:49.280 --> 22:52.720]  but like we had this whole rat king of like the things you're,
[22:52.840 --> 22:55.240]  you don't want to get as a kid. And we've already called,
[22:55.240 --> 22:58.200]  covered a couple of them. You know, one of them is tetanus. You know,
[22:58.200 --> 23:01.040]  don't step on a board and get the tetanus.
[23:01.240 --> 23:04.720]  You don't want to get rabies cause then you're going to have to get shots in
[23:04.720 --> 23:07.800]  your stomach ringworm ringworm. I don't remember that. See,
[23:07.800 --> 23:10.080]  I don't remember a ringworm. I'm rabies was a big one.
[23:10.080 --> 23:11.320]  They were always telling me or not, you know,
[23:11.320 --> 23:15.760]  if you ever saw a raccoon go the other way, you know? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[23:15.760 --> 23:20.240]  Yeah. No, I, I, uh, I don't know a lot about lockjaw.
[23:20.280 --> 23:23.040]  I mean, but it sounds like the kind of thing you're thinking,
[23:23.040 --> 23:26.440]  maybe you go in there and they give you some kind of a, some,
[23:26.440 --> 23:28.160]  some kind of a soldier or super serum,
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.760]  like directly into your jaw area. And that gives you local relief.
[23:32.920 --> 23:36.680]  No, no, no. I'm guessing that they just give you like a, um,
[23:36.680 --> 23:41.240]  what's it called? Like a penicillin. What's it? Antibiotic antibiotic. Yeah.
[23:41.240 --> 23:43.960]  I think you just take an antibiotic and then it cures you right up. I don't
[23:43.960 --> 23:47.480]  know. I'm not even going to Wikipedia it. I'm just, well, I normally don't,
[23:47.480 --> 23:51.400]  but I got to say sometimes it's real fun because Google will have, um,
[23:51.400 --> 23:55.000]  an image that's associated with whatever the problem is.
[23:55.800 --> 23:57.240]  So, you know, they don't have one for lockjaw.
[23:57.240 --> 23:59.960]  I wonder if they've went for a ringworm, you know, it'll be a person.
[23:59.960 --> 24:02.640]  It'll be like you go and you look up, um, you know,
[24:02.640 --> 24:05.120]  he'll get depression and it's like a person sitting on a bed with their head
[24:05.120 --> 24:09.200]  in their hands. You know, can I just tell you something? Yeah, please.
[24:09.240 --> 24:13.440]  You're cheering me up. This is, no, I'm, I'm in better spirits.
[24:13.480 --> 24:16.040]  I think you're in worse shape than you think. Well, I had an odd thing to say.
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.800]  No, I'm in good shape, but you know, I needed this. I was real mopey.
[24:20.800 --> 24:24.440]  I tell you what, before we started this show, I was a mope. I have no excuse.
[24:24.440 --> 24:27.120]  I've told you this before. It's come up with you many times before.
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.520]  My grandfather was a coal miner.
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.640]  He went to work in a coal mine at the age of 14. He had a, they, they,
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.400]  they, they, they got a late start.
[24:35.560 --> 24:39.200]  They took him out, took him out of eighth grade and said,
[24:40.560 --> 24:42.880]  John, you got to go down the coal mine. You're, you're, you know,
[24:43.240 --> 24:45.960]  consumer math for you. Right. Get in the hole.
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.800]  And he died of black lung disease. I mean, like literally, I mean,
[24:51.800 --> 24:54.960]  that it's a very well named disease. Uh,
[24:55.960 --> 24:59.400]  and I'm sitting here complaining, you know, about, uh, you know,
[24:59.640 --> 25:02.280]  having a bit of the mopes, you know, I feel terrible about it.
[25:02.280 --> 25:04.440]  Yeah. I mean, that's the thing though.
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.120]  Like if it's the thing that you can fix with a bandaid, you know, you, you know,
[25:08.120 --> 25:11.400]  there's a thing I like to tell my daughter, um, you know, and, and I,
[25:11.400 --> 25:13.640]  I think, uh, I think it might be bullshit,
[25:13.640 --> 25:16.080]  but there's a thing I like to tell my daughter when she injures herself,
[25:16.120 --> 25:18.000]  which is, you know what, honey, um,
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.480]  that's only going to hurt super duper bad for about a minute and then it'll
[25:23.480 --> 25:26.800]  start getting less bad. And like, if you, if you cut off a, a,
[25:26.800 --> 25:29.160]  a little bit of your thumb, just a tiny bit,
[25:29.160 --> 25:32.720]  just a tiny bit, like not the amount of like one of your usual hand injuries,
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.920]  right? You kind of just a little bit, just the tip,
[25:35.160 --> 25:38.400]  like you're going to be able to fix that with a bandaid brand adhesive, right?
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.000]  But then the stuff with your brain, John, how are you gonna fix your brain?
[25:41.320 --> 25:46.200]  You know what I mean? So that's ringworm, uh, of scalp and body.
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.560]  How do you get ringworm? Do you know, I mean, you're googling this right now.
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.240]  I would like to know. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like, oh,
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.320]  depression is not as good as I hoped. Um, the, um, yeah. Ringworm. No, see,
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.800]  I'm not going to look it up. I'm going to do it from what I remember.
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.360]  I think ringworm, God, look at that. It's a real red and puffy.
[26:05.760 --> 26:08.320]  They zoomed in with a call out. Where does it get you? Where did it?
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.480]  I don't even know. I've heard of it. She's got it on her arms. It looks like.
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.200]  It's a skin disease, right? I think I see it. It, it, uh,
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.280]  presents as a skin disease. I don't know. Sin. Is it sin? Maybe.
[26:21.320 --> 26:23.120]  I don't know. I don't know. What about infotigo?
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.800]  I bet they got a good picture for that. Anyway,
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.560]  I just encourage your listeners to, oh, come on. Really? Oh no.
[26:29.600 --> 26:30.560]  Oh, this poor boy.
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.360]  He's eating a tortilla chip and he's got the impotigo. That's a shame.
[26:35.400 --> 26:38.160]  There you go. Let me send that to you. Um, yeah.
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.560]  So anytime you're worried about your disease, just, you know,
[26:40.560 --> 26:43.280]  get on Google and if you search for it, um,
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.280]  you'll get to see what you would look like if you really have,
[26:45.680 --> 26:47.640]  if you're not eating a tortilla chip, you're good to go. I had to go.
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.040]  Yeah. Look at that kid. Oh man. Sores around mouth and nose.
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.040]  I don't know if we may not be able to, I may not put this in the show notes.
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.480]  No, I think it's better that you don't. Yeah. Don't.
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.680]  I'm going to recommend that people do not Google and Patigo. Oh, there's,
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.240]  there's a lot of them, but I feel, I feel good too. I'm, I'm, I'm glad we do this.
[27:06.240 --> 27:08.080]  You want, you want to wrap it up and get back to bed.
[27:09.720 --> 27:14.120]  Let's take a break and uh, thank our first sponsor. Uh, good friends at Eero,
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.160]  E E R O. These guys make wifi routers,
[27:19.800 --> 27:22.400]  right? So you put the wifi in your house.
[27:22.400 --> 27:25.080]  Now you've got internet in the air, but guess what?
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.040]  The old model of having one little box,
[27:30.160 --> 27:31.600]  a base station, whatever you want to call it,
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.360]  you hook it up to your cable modem and you try to send wifi all through the
[27:35.360 --> 27:38.840]  whole house. It doesn't work. It is always dead spots.
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.680]  If you've got like a roof deck or something like that, you got like a garage.
[27:41.680 --> 27:43.600]  Maybe you can't get, you can't get signal in there.
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.840]  What you want is a mesh network and a mesh network is way that you set up
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.280]  multiple devices. They talk to each other, the Eero things.
[27:53.480 --> 27:56.040]  You don't have to set this up. You don't do any of the work.
[27:56.360 --> 27:58.960]  You just plug these things in, you figure out how many you need,
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.480]  go to their website, they'll help you out, you know, use your, uh,
[28:02.600 --> 28:05.800]  just calculate square footage of your house or how many floors you have,
[28:05.800 --> 28:07.680]  something like that. Um,
[28:08.320 --> 28:10.800]  you get an Eero kit with a couple of these things,
[28:11.040 --> 28:12.920]  you plug them in around the house,
[28:12.920 --> 28:17.920]  they communicate with each other and they saturate your whole house with a
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.920]  nice strong wifi signal could not be easier to set up and manage.
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.440]  You never have to do anything really. Um,
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.600]  and the app is absolutely beautiful. I don't know why.
[28:30.920 --> 28:33.320]  I don't know why I do this. So good.
[28:33.400 --> 28:37.480]  I turn on notifications for new devices and like,
[28:37.720 --> 28:39.120]  like, uh,
[28:39.440 --> 28:43.760]  like Jonas will maybe have like friends over after school and then he'll,
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.440]  you know, like a gentleman that he is, let them get on the wifi.
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.440]  And I get a notification that there's a new apple device on the wifi and then I
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.720]  can put in like a, you know, his friend's name or something like that.
[28:55.720 --> 28:59.160]  And I know who it is. Why do I do that? I don't know, but I like,
[28:59.200 --> 29:01.120]  I like knowing it. I don't know why.
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.640]  I have no idea why I find it very satisfying to know when every time a new
[29:06.720 --> 29:10.200]  device is added to the network, but I do. Could it be easier?
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.920]  I open it up when I have no reason to use it. Sometimes I, it's like,
[29:13.920 --> 29:15.720]  it's like if I play video games, it would be,
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.400]  Euro would be my game where I just open up. I go, yep, did the bandwidth test.
[29:19.400 --> 29:22.880]  Everything's looking good. I'm going to send you a, an image. I, uh,
[29:22.920 --> 29:27.120]  I went in because I'm broken inside. I went in and I added,
[29:27.120 --> 29:29.080]  I named them all and gave them a emoji.
[29:30.920 --> 29:32.160]  A lot of fun. Hey,
[29:33.160 --> 29:36.400]  and you can, and it'll tell you, but have you done the thing where you,
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.840]  cause you're a gentleman and your kid's friend comes over,
[29:38.840 --> 29:41.720]  have you done the thing with the least scan a little QR code and it just gives
[29:41.720 --> 29:43.040]  them the guest password?
[29:43.040 --> 29:45.560]  Yeah. Uh, I have,
[29:45.600 --> 29:50.520]  but sometimes it seems to me now with iOS you can, it happens from the iOS,
[29:50.560 --> 29:53.640]  right? Oh, that's true. Yeah. Right. But so you're right though.
[29:53.640 --> 29:56.840]  It's such a good app. You and me, we came up at a time.
[29:57.240 --> 29:59.600]  Let's go back in the day. You buy yourself a mouse,
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.400]  you buy yourself some kind of fancy, uh, you know, SCSI device, whatever it is.
[30:03.400 --> 30:06.720]  And it comes with a compact disc that has something called a driver on it.
[30:07.080 --> 30:10.480]  And of course it's a horrible port. Like it just works like garbage.
[30:10.480 --> 30:14.600]  It's just nonsense. And it's, it's literally excruciating pain to have to use
[30:14.600 --> 30:18.960]  that. Oh, your monitor doesn't understand your cord anymore. Like you,
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.880]  you lose and like, it was not like that. The app is the thing,
[30:23.040 --> 30:26.880]  the app is smart and the app will let you improve your life.
[30:26.880 --> 30:29.480]  If you've got that hero plus you can do all kinds of good stuff.
[30:29.560 --> 30:32.960]  They do the thing now where they got the band. Um, I don't know what's called,
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.680]  I forget what it's called, but they got the thing where like, Hey,
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.000]  if you can do five gigahertz, we'll remember you can do five gigahertz in the
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.640]  right place. It'll even like soften the blow of moving between devices.
[30:43.640 --> 30:46.360]  So you don't get like, if you're running something 4k on your device,
[30:46.360 --> 30:49.720]  it won't mess you up. It's a, it's a really good change to our game.
[30:49.800 --> 30:53.120]  I was going to tell you about this hero plus zero plus is their add on service.
[30:53.120 --> 30:56.120]  It's like a subscription thing. What do you get? You get a,
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.120]  they want me to tell you that you get advanced security.
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.160]  You can block ads right at the router level if that's what you want to do. Uh,
[31:03.760 --> 31:06.000]  but all sorts of security stuff, uh,
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.040]  VPN protection from encrypt dot me.
[31:09.280 --> 31:12.520]  That's included when you sign up for Euro plus, uh,
[31:12.560 --> 31:16.120]  they include password management from the great people at one password,
[31:16.200 --> 31:20.400]  which everybody acknowledges is like the cream of the cream of the crop for
[31:20.400 --> 31:23.200]  password management, cross-platform, uh,
[31:23.680 --> 31:27.680]  all sorts of great stuff when you sign up for Euro plus. Uh, so here's,
[31:27.720 --> 31:31.400]  here's what they want me to tell you to do. What you want to do.
[31:31.400 --> 31:36.400]  Go to ero.com you get a hundred dollars off the Euro base unit and two beacons
[31:38.720 --> 31:43.720]  package with one year of Euro plus by visiting ero.com slash the talk show.
[31:46.280 --> 31:48.920]  They include the, the ero, right? They got it right.
[31:48.920 --> 31:53.920]  You wrote.com slash the talk show and then at checkout you just enter that same
[31:54.280 --> 31:56.400]  code. The talk show,
[31:56.400 --> 32:01.200]  you'll save a hundred bucks and two beacons and a base station is a good, uh,
[32:01.360 --> 32:03.920]  that's a good setup kit. The beacons are the little, uh,
[32:03.960 --> 32:08.920]  nightlight type things. Love them. Good company. Anyway,
[32:08.960 --> 32:12.720]  my thanks to Euro. Ah, here's a, here's the,
[32:12.720 --> 32:17.040]  here's the image of the last thing. Here's the image for, um, obsessive compulsive
[32:17.040 --> 32:17.880]  disorder
[32:17.880 --> 32:23.800]  and that's a very organized blonde. Um,
[32:26.440 --> 32:30.280]  it's a lady, it's a lady lining stuff up. She's,
[32:30.480 --> 32:33.040]  she's got that beautiful big screen. Uh huh.
[32:34.040 --> 32:38.520]  She's living in some kind of like a Sims world. I think I don't be over there.
[32:38.520 --> 32:40.760]  Trilling to forums with her big monitor, but she's not,
[32:40.760 --> 32:42.960]  she's lining up paint cause a paint chips or swatches.
[32:43.080 --> 32:45.080]  She's got all of her medicine or the pathics.
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.040]  I don't think she's really there. I think that's, she's like photoshopped in.
[32:49.520 --> 32:53.120]  Oh man. Do you know what the, you know, the world is changing Marlon. Um,
[32:53.240 --> 32:56.880]  and I think for the better and you know, it sounds like an odd thing to say.
[32:56.960 --> 33:00.080]  I mean you and I did a show a couple of years ago. Uh,
[33:00.120 --> 33:04.880]  do you remember there was the election, the, uh, election election,
[33:04.880 --> 33:09.240]  like the local thing, the presidential thing where, oh, that old thing.
[33:09.680 --> 33:11.880]  I think we agreed everything's going to be fine. Didn't we? Yeah.
[33:11.880 --> 33:15.320]  Yeah. That was the takeaway.
[33:15.560 --> 33:18.240]  It is funny in light of all of that, the,
[33:18.240 --> 33:21.880]  the continuing saga of that, uh, the whole thing.
[33:22.720 --> 33:26.680]  It's an odd thing to say, but the world is still, it, you know,
[33:26.760 --> 33:29.480]  it's getting to be a better place. I feel like we,
[33:29.480 --> 33:33.720]  as a society are conscious of things that, uh,
[33:34.160 --> 33:37.160]  when we were kids, like in the seventies, you just didn't, you did,
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.480]  you just weren't conscious of it. You know, it just,
[33:39.480 --> 33:42.640]  it's utterly, it's unrecognizable.
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.720]  A week before last, last week, my kids, uh, at their school,
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.320]  they had their annual LGBTQ pride parade and all the classes dress as a
[33:51.320 --> 33:54.440]  different color of the rainbow and they have a parade. Oh, that's beautiful.
[33:54.640 --> 33:57.400]  And I'm taking pictures cause I'm like, this is, this doesn't seem real to me.
[33:57.520 --> 34:01.080]  But can you even imagine, like, I mean, what is this?
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.960]  Was she in like eighth grade, seventh grade? No, she's a, she's about to,
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.760]  uh, she did a post post-grad year, no fifth grade, fifth grade. All right.
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.280]  Can you imagine that being in fifth grade and having, uh, uh, uh,
[34:15.320 --> 34:17.920]  LGB Q, uh,
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.200]  just even acknowledging that that was a thing. It just wouldn't, wouldn't happen.
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.720]  John, they have posters and stuff like it's an official thing. Uh, my,
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.000]  my son's school, the club is called, uh, glow.
[34:30.120 --> 34:34.800]  I love it. It's, I feel it's a better acronym. It's gay, lesbian or whatever.
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.320]  Oh, you know what? I'm just, geez, here we go. We had this conversation already.
[34:38.320 --> 34:41.840]  Dang it. Did we? Yes. Yes. But it's just, it's true for lots of things.
[34:41.880 --> 34:45.160]  Even if not everything, the Overton window is moving, thank God.
[34:45.160 --> 34:47.920]  And there's just a bunch of stuff where something that seemed not even possible.
[34:47.960 --> 34:51.840]  This is, it's bad, John. No, it's bad. This is bad. What about bananas?
[34:51.840 --> 34:52.680]  You ever notice how you get,
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.320]  you ever notice how you get banana and like you have like a window for like a,
[34:56.360 --> 34:58.120]  it's really small for eating it. You ever think about that?
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.720]  Hey, she canceled this show.
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.920]  Do you buy, do you buy bananas that are ready to eat or you buy them,
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.760]  you buy them green and uh, let them, let them ripen at home. What do you do?
[35:11.800 --> 35:15.680]  My wife is in charge of bananas and uh,
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.800]  cause I don't eat most things that have, you know, uh, non mammals.
[35:20.840 --> 35:25.360]  I don't eat a, you know, a fruit that doesn't cast a shadow. So she's, she's,
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.760]  she's, she's vice president in charge of bananas. And um, so it's really,
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.480]  it's really up to her, but I'll tell you what she does do,
[35:32.480 --> 35:35.200]  which is awesome is that the, the ones that have gone brown,
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.760]  she keeps on a very fragrant pantry for the notion of
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.480]  future banana bread. So that's, that's a refreshing smell. What do you, well,
[35:44.480 --> 35:46.080]  give me an update. What do you, what do you like?
[35:46.240 --> 35:49.280]  I like, I like to buy them as ready to eat as possible.
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.520]  I don't have a lot of patients.
[35:53.720 --> 35:57.440]  So like if I'm at the store and in the mood hits me that, Hey,
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.640]  you know what would be good. And you know what? I enjoy eating. I like bananas.
[36:01.640 --> 36:04.840]  They're good. Right. And it's, it's a, it's a great kid,
[36:04.840 --> 36:07.680]  but a banana can be a delicious treat. It's a delicious treat.
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.120]  It's a great way to start the day. It's a good breakfast. It's, you know,
[36:11.760 --> 36:13.920]  but then I immediately think, well,
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.800]  I would like to start eating them as soon as I possibly can.
[36:16.840 --> 36:19.720]  So these green ones are no good. Where give me, you know,
[36:19.720 --> 36:23.800]  give me something that's closer to being edible. Yeah.
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.960]  Well, I think you're also being, um, I was going to say realistic.
[36:27.960 --> 36:29.520]  I don't know if that's the right word, but I think,
[36:29.520 --> 36:32.160]  I think one of the problems they would say, you know, don't go shopping when
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.240]  you're hungry. Well, I think that actually makes a ton of sense in some ways.
[36:35.280 --> 36:38.200]  Like, especially if you're a monster like me and you want food that you enjoy.
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.320]  I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to have a bunch of like, I don't know what millet.
[36:42.360 --> 36:45.240]  That's like saying, don't go to sleep when you're tired. You know what I mean?
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.560]  Exactly. It's exactly like that. It's exactly like that. So, so yeah, I mean like,
[36:49.600 --> 36:51.480]  but I mean, there's something realistic about saying, Oh,
[36:51.480 --> 36:54.920]  I'll enjoy these bananas in the future. Oh, you know, we, I'm so sorry.
[36:54.920 --> 36:58.040]  We've talked about this also peaches. They still, this is years ago.
[36:58.040 --> 37:00.640]  We had the banana episode and they still haven't fixed peaches.
[37:00.680 --> 37:04.680]  I'm not a culture with the bananas. Not a fan of the peach. You like a plum.
[37:04.920 --> 37:06.200]  Yeah, I love a plum. Yeah.
[37:06.320 --> 37:09.640]  She just insert that entire one hour segment right here.
[37:09.800 --> 37:12.080]  And would you save everybody a lot of time? I do love a plum,
[37:12.080 --> 37:15.440]  but I'll tell you what though. A plum has gotta be ripe, you know,
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.400]  like a good plum though. That's, that's, that's eaten,
[37:21.840 --> 37:24.520]  but the world's getting better. You say? Yeah, I think so.
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.080]  Yeah. I think that cause the kids, I think the kids have it. I saw it today.
[37:29.080 --> 37:33.960]  I woke up today and uh, one of the, uh, it's,
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.240]  I get, you know, like I told you, I'm not feeling that well.
[37:36.960 --> 37:40.680]  There should be a way to tell your phone. I'm not, I'm not feeling well.
[37:40.680 --> 37:43.720]  Don't show me news. You know what I mean? Like, I don't want to see the news.
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.760]  Yes. Like, I feel like I need my constitution to be able to, to keep,
[37:47.800 --> 37:50.760]  keep up with this. But I tell your phone, you say, Hey, dingus,
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.240]  I need a sick day from the news. I need a sick day from the news. Just don't,
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.960]  just don't tell me any news because I saw this story and uh, you know,
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.960]  I, it's Trump. What are we going to do? But I saw this thing where he, he,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.240]  he wants to put Bible classes into public schools. Do you see this?
[38:10.520 --> 38:11.360]  No.
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.680]  He wants to put Bible study classes. He's practically a monk. So,
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.720]  but isn't that the Trumpiest thing? I don't want to, you know,
[38:20.720 --> 38:23.320]  we're not going to go off on a whole political rant here. This is no, no, no,
[38:23.320 --> 38:26.640]  but the Trumpiest thing is that golf article, which you should definitely read.
[38:26.840 --> 38:30.200]  Oh, the one where each about him had cheap. He's basically are at gold finger.
[38:30.360 --> 38:34.160]  Yeah, he's totally golfing. And that's exactly what I kept waiting for them to
[38:34.160 --> 38:35.000]  say.
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.520]  This is the president's ball. No one's in the water.
[38:42.120 --> 38:43.520]  It falls out of his pants.
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.360]  Well, the funny thing is Amy told me about the story about him cheating at golf
[38:47.400 --> 38:49.920]  and I've got the book. I haven't, I haven't really read the book.
[38:49.920 --> 38:52.080]  I read the article, but I have the book. Uh,
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.640]  what's it called commander and cheat. It's a, you know, Rick Riley is the writer.
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.640]  Yeah. I guess I should put it in the show notes, but you ever played golf.
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.640]  You ever played, you probably never played golf.
[39:01.520 --> 39:02.520]  In junior high.
[39:02.520 --> 39:06.480]  I had the unhappy accident of moving to Florida with my God forsaken stepfather
[39:06.480 --> 39:08.840]  and he was running a restaurant at a country club.
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.560]  So I had occasion to play an actual game of according to oil golf
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.720]  once, but I do like, I like a driving range now. No, no, it seemed,
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.600]  it's the definition of like frustrating to me. I'm not trying to be that guy,
[39:21.600 --> 39:25.240]  but like it just, the amount of, uh, like a control,
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.440]  I don't have power. I don't have impatience. I don't have, um,
[39:29.480 --> 39:33.120]  makes it exactly not my copy. Well, anyway, that's Amy's telling me the story.
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.400]  And I, I just trying to get engaged. I know, I know most of the,
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.480]  most of the rules and stuff, and I know it's a very courtly game. He's playing,
[39:40.520 --> 39:43.240]  he's playing golf with somebody and the guy is, uh, his,
[39:43.360 --> 39:48.040]  his playing partner is like 220 yards away from the green. That's, that's long,
[39:48.040 --> 39:51.520]  right? That's what I'm trying to get at here is to get a sense of how,
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.080]  how far 220 yards is. I know, I know from, from we, we golf that that's,
[39:56.080 --> 39:58.400]  that that's a long way. And that's probably, you're going to use, well,
[39:58.400 --> 40:01.200]  you use like a three on that probably. Yeah. Like a three wood or something,
[40:01.560 --> 40:04.040]  you know, it's practically like, uh, you know, got to hit a drive.
[40:04.040 --> 40:08.440]  This guy hits the shot of his life uphill. It's a par five.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  So he's on the green and two, he's going to be putting for Eagle uphill.
[40:13.720 --> 40:15.200]  Guy gets up there and his,
[40:15.360 --> 40:18.920]  his ball is nowhere to be found and he's looking around and he's looking around
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.840]  and then there it is over in the bunker off to this left of the green.
[40:24.480 --> 40:26.880]  And he was like, son of a bitch. I was, that ball was,
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.280]  it was the greatest shot I ever hit in my life. It was right at the flag uphill.
[40:31.280 --> 40:33.280]  It had, how, how could this happen? And he, you know,
[40:33.280 --> 40:35.840]  finishes the round and then at the end of the round,
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.240]  Trump's caddy actually comes over to him and says, look, I almost know I never do
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.640]  this, but I got to tell you, uh,
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.720]  he got up there and threw your ball in the bunker and it's a hell of a story.
[40:46.720 --> 40:49.160]  Like he'd literally Trump got up there on the green first,
[40:49.200 --> 40:52.960]  picked up the guy's ball and threw it in the bunker. Uh,
[40:53.440 --> 40:57.160]  but here's the thing that Amy didn't convey to me. She told me this story.
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.240]  I was like, I got to read this story. I got to read this book.
[40:59.240 --> 41:03.080]  This is going to be great. The guy who had happened to was Mike Torico,
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.800]  the ESPN, uh, he's a commentator on ESPN.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.720]  Like he's real famous. He's like a famous ESPN guy.
[41:11.040 --> 41:12.920]  Trump threw his ball and right in the bunker.
[41:12.920 --> 41:16.240]  A bunker. And like, just thinking like he,
[41:16.360 --> 41:19.040]  we wouldn't notice or he wouldn't say anything.
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.480]  I, I think, I think the brilliance of this, the,
[41:23.480 --> 41:25.480]  the way that this idea that you can,
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.760]  everything you need to know about the guy is that he cheats at golf. It, it, it,
[41:29.960 --> 41:33.840]  it all plays out from there. That the basic story is that, yeah,
[41:33.840 --> 41:37.280]  he just expects people not to, this is not something people do.
[41:37.360 --> 41:41.240]  People don't just pick up golf balls. You know, if you're first on the green,
[41:41.240 --> 41:44.960]  you don't kick the guy's ball into the bunker or something. It just isn't done.
[41:45.440 --> 41:49.200]  But why, why isn't it done? Because that's just not,
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.360]  yeah, like it's like mutual mutual respect for the game. I'm not a,
[41:52.600 --> 41:55.360]  obviously I'm not a golfer, but, um, people,
[41:55.400 --> 41:58.680]  but people have that respect for the game. Something, um, uh,
[41:58.720 --> 42:00.520]  my friend that I do a show with, uh, Dubai Friday,
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.520]  my friend max tempkin said something probably two years ago and I was like,
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.280]  wow, max, you and your observations. But you know, he pointed out,
[42:07.280 --> 42:10.640]  I think it was maybe when the Manafort stuff was heating up, but he said, the,
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.320]  the, the reason it's so hard to get a bead, one re one of the reasons,
[42:13.320 --> 42:16.840]  one of the myriad reasons, it's hard to get a bead on this stuff. Um,
[42:16.880 --> 42:20.040]  is because it's, it's, it's so shocks the imagination.
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.640]  How many of the people in this administration are obsessed with impossibly
[42:24.640 --> 42:28.400]  small and petty griffs. And like when you put the petty griffs together,
[42:28.400 --> 42:29.480]  it looks like a big thing.
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.080]  But when you actually sort of analyze it and break it down,
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.160]  it's like ostrich suits and, uh, and golf cheating all the way down.
[42:37.160 --> 42:40.120]  So it's all, that's the smallest, like, like any,
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.320]  any grown person would not grift at the level they're grifting, right?
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.480]  Certainly because they just think it's maybe not the right thing to do,
[42:47.640 --> 42:50.840]  but also you're just like, wow, you just, you just,
[42:50.840 --> 42:52.640]  you just want to mop up every nickel. I mean,
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.960]  there was a Chris Hayes had a story about when his band Chris Hayes from MSNBC,
[42:56.160 --> 42:57.600]  if I get this right, you ever hear this?
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.640]  His band had a CD in like a, uh, uh,
[43:01.680 --> 43:05.480]  like a music store in a Trump building and they were trying to negotiate a cut
[43:05.480 --> 43:08.760]  of every, like aside from the retail part,
[43:08.760 --> 43:11.320]  they wanted a cut of every CD that was sold there.
[43:12.240 --> 43:16.400]  Just impossibly, pointlessly. And of course you got to go back to the spy thing
[43:16.400 --> 43:17.480]  and the 13 cent check,
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.160]  but like there's no grift too small and that's what beggars the imagination.
[43:23.760 --> 43:26.640]  He's got, he's, he's the, he's the good golf boy. He's,
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.480]  you can go and find all the plaques or just, you know,
[43:30.480 --> 43:34.760]  he's always salesman of the month. He's the champion for, for, for all the things.
[43:34.760 --> 43:37.400]  Yeah. That's the other thing from the book. Um,
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.680]  one of the other stories is how many of his clubs he's the club champion at,
[43:43.440 --> 43:47.600]  like how many, how many club championships he's won. And it includes,
[43:47.960 --> 43:50.240]  it includes one of his golf courses. Uh,
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.200]  he's listed as like the 1991 club champion and the course didn't even open till
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.240]  1992. And then, so they looked into it,
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.160]  they looked into it and right. And they actually,
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.160]  it's the rare instance of the whole thing being explained honestly and openly,
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.480]  which was that a spokesperson said that, uh, Trump played a,
[44:12.920 --> 44:15.320]  uh, like a practice around before the course was open.
[44:15.320 --> 44:18.600]  What would you call it? A like a test ground. Yeah. Like, you know,
[44:18.640 --> 44:21.800]  let's, let's see how this courses to test out the new course. Right.
[44:21.800 --> 44:23.240]  So what the club wasn't open yet,
[44:24.080 --> 44:28.320]  clubs playing with three of his buddies to foursome months before the club even
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.600]  opens. And then afterwards he declared that that was the club championship,
[44:32.600 --> 44:36.400]  because he had a, he had a good round, a good round of golf.
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.000]  Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You hear those stories about that?
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.240]  I don't know if it's apocryphal, but the story about, um, dollar sign, uh,
[44:45.280 --> 44:46.920]  Eastern European dictator,
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.320]  I think it was Chuchescu and how he had anticipated a drive down a long,
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.400]  beautiful Boulevard full of, um,
[44:52.840 --> 44:57.240]  trees that were full of fruit and at least in the story and the telling, uh,
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.000]  a lot of the, uh, the locals, the peasants and the collectives were charged with,
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.520]  basically like taping fruit into the tree where he could see it.
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.000]  Like it's some serious Adam Curtis level stuff. Right.
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.640]  But yeah, you want it to be, you want it to be something bigger.
[45:17.160 --> 45:18.920]  Like, you know, this is a weird part of you.
[45:18.920 --> 45:21.080]  The acceleration is part of this is like, oh yeah,
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.960]  let's like figure out what the big thing is. And it's like, no, it's just,
[45:23.960 --> 45:26.480]  it's just like, you know, he, uh, you know,
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.360]  he goes to Chili's two at the airport and wants extra napkins and then sues
[45:31.360 --> 45:34.440]  them for $10 billion because they owe him napkins.
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.440]  Don't get me started on the Deutsche bank thing. It's killing me.
[45:38.960 --> 45:41.720]  But the world's getting better for sure. You ever been to a Chili's two?
[45:42.720 --> 45:44.520]  You know, I've, uh, I've, I, you know what?
[45:44.520 --> 45:49.320]  I've not gone by design to a Chili's two because I don't like Chili's prime
[45:49.320 --> 45:50.640]  Chili's actual. Right.
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.960]  And then I feel like I'm not sure I want the less good version of the thing I
[45:53.960 --> 45:57.720]  don't like, but am I being, is that, is that racist of me? Should I try it?
[45:58.600 --> 46:01.280]  Uh, I don't know. Is there such a Chili's two?
[46:01.280 --> 46:03.280]  You get microwave fries or what? Like, I don't know.
[46:03.280 --> 46:06.400]  I haven't been to one in a long time, but I always enjoy the name.
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.080]  Every time I see a Chili's two and, and inevitably it is in an airport, right?
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.680]  I, I, I think that's a grab and go, right?
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.000]  If you're not up for a $9 Wolfgang puck triangle of sandwich,
[46:16.000 --> 46:17.880]  you could go to Chili's two. Yeah.
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.480]  Um, Chili's was the, uh, when I was at Drexel university back in the nineties,
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.800]  was the, uh, the, the nicest restaurant, uh,
[46:25.960 --> 46:29.800]  in university city and over there. Yeah. That would be,
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.600]  I would like if you really wanted to take your, uh, like your special friend out,
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.200]  you know, like, uh, like, uh, uh, you know,
[46:37.200 --> 46:39.120]  somebody really want to impress you, take them to Chili's.
[46:39.840 --> 46:41.800]  Was that in the era of the baby back ribs?
[46:42.160 --> 46:45.680]  I believe it was. I believe it was. And fajitas. I'm always used to get the,
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.280]  uh, I was, they're smart. Yeah. The fajitas. Yeah. Yeah. Half chicken,
[46:50.280 --> 46:54.120]  half steak, half chicken. They'll just do that for you. Yeah.
[46:54.160 --> 46:56.360]  They'll just do that for you. That's sizzle. You're selling the sizzle,
[46:56.360 --> 46:59.320]  not the steak. You know what I mean? They say, I've heard it.
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.000]  I've heard it said on some turns out podcast, but that was the whole idea.
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.800]  It's the sizzling. People hear that.
[47:04.920 --> 47:06.680]  Apparently the whole might've been in this American life.
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.440]  Whole place lights up, lights up people. It's uncontrollable.
[47:10.680 --> 47:11.920]  It's like some kind of a,
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.080]  like a brain virus hits everybody when they hear like sizzling meat and then
[47:16.440 --> 47:16.960]  they're, they're like,
[47:16.960 --> 47:20.400]  they're already making the orders cause they know how much now I don't know.
[47:20.400 --> 47:21.960]  See now here's where you get into the science.
[47:22.160 --> 47:25.040]  I don't know if that's because that's the nature of people who could at Chili's
[47:25.960 --> 47:28.480]  that, you know, they get the Pavlovian chicken effect.
[47:29.200 --> 47:31.840]  I don't think that I bet at the Chili's too, at the airport,
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.280]  you don't really get that hot sizzle. There's no way microwave don't sizzle.
[47:35.360 --> 47:38.360]  Yeah. Microwave doesn't sizzle. You know, and when you think about it,
[47:38.360 --> 47:40.640]  when you really do think about that, that fajita plate,
[47:40.640 --> 47:45.440]  that it seems like something a lawyer should look into, you know,
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.400]  like should they really be delivering a 500 degree plate, right?
[47:50.680 --> 47:53.840]  I never thought of that. You're absolutely, I mean, they already give you a knife.
[47:54.080 --> 47:57.840]  Yeah. Doesn't that? Yeah. Now they're going to give you, they're going to give you,
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.120]  it's, it's basically, it's a, it's a, it's a lawsuit with meat.
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.520]  That's just, you're just waiting for that. And then they say, what did they say?
[48:03.600 --> 48:06.000]  They say the thing everybody always says, there's two parts to this.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.400]  They always say don't touch the plate. It's extremely hot.
[48:10.400 --> 48:13.600]  And so what do you do? I always touch the plate. I always,
[48:13.600 --> 48:16.600]  I always touch the mandates. I should bring band-aids when I go to Chili's.
[48:17.200 --> 48:19.680]  Right. I'll use like my left pinky finger. You know what I mean?
[48:19.680 --> 48:23.160]  Cause if I get a burn on the left pinky finger, it's, I'll be all right.
[48:24.800 --> 48:26.800]  Yeah. You're going to take your Z's more slowly.
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.720]  You got to play hurt. That's the thing. When you're racking, man,
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.280]  you got to play hurt. Got to play. You know what I mean? You're tired.
[48:35.400 --> 48:37.600]  You're tired. You got a Chili's burn. You got to,
[48:37.600 --> 48:42.080]  you got to play through the pain, man. Doesn't a Chili's or what are they famous
[48:42.080 --> 48:44.560]  for it? A margaritas today? Margaritas.
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.840]  Is it a Mexican place? What is the theme of Chili's? Now I'm thinking about this.
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.360]  Now that I'm thinking about it, I've been to Chili's many times, but not,
[48:54.440 --> 48:58.520]  not in decades. Right? Like I'm talking 20,
[48:58.640 --> 49:01.120]  25 years ago. I thought easy, easy. Like a,
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.400]  like a sit down in the parking lot of the mall, Chili's,
[49:05.400 --> 49:07.880]  you went in, you know,
[49:07.920 --> 49:10.040]  usually cause you have to cause you're with a group that wants to go to
[49:10.040 --> 49:12.880]  Chili's. You go in there, I'm, I'm with you.
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.760]  I feel like it's one of those restaurants that has 1400 items on the
[49:17.760 --> 49:18.400]  menu,
[49:18.400 --> 49:22.840]  but they're all some like slight variation on like appetizers for the table.
[49:23.080 --> 49:25.400]  But I could be wrong. Do they, I mean, what do they call it?
[49:25.400 --> 49:27.640]  Did I call it Tex-Mex? Is that what they call it?
[49:28.200 --> 49:33.360]  I don't know if they could do that for, for like legal reasons. I think of that.
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.800]  And I mean like, you know, uh, but you're right. I mean,
[49:35.800 --> 49:38.320]  this is the thing and you see this when you travel and I'm not gonna say this in
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.040]  a nasty way, but like when you travel like, like you and I live in places where
[49:41.040 --> 49:42.880]  like you can go and get stuff, you can go and get you a hoagie.
[49:43.120 --> 49:44.960]  Like that's probably going to be real good with the,
[49:44.960 --> 49:47.480]  with the oil and everything. And it smells like an eighth grader,
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.120]  which is how you know it's a good hoagie. It should smell,
[49:50.120 --> 49:51.640]  it should smell like, like an, like a,
[49:52.040 --> 49:54.640]  like an eighth grader that hasn't gotten the talk yet. That's what,
[49:55.120 --> 49:57.720]  if your hoagie doesn't smell like that, it's a sub and I don't want any.
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.480]  I can go out. I go two blocks from here. Don't be creepy. I go get me a burrito.
[50:01.480 --> 50:04.840]  I get me, I get me a big ass burrito. But then when I travel, I'm just like,
[50:05.520 --> 50:06.320]  like, well, what is,
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.360]  what is the thing nearest by that will give me comfort so I can just sit in a
[50:10.360 --> 50:13.200]  bathtub and watch a Bob's burgers in the mirror. Like I just need,
[50:13.360 --> 50:15.720]  I just need something, something, anything.
[50:15.800 --> 50:18.160]  And that's when I feel like I'm stuck in those situations.
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.640]  And then I over order a bunch of food that I don't want. You know what I mean?
[50:22.640 --> 50:26.240]  Maybe I've not seen like an Outback. I can, I can fuck with an Outback.
[50:27.320 --> 50:29.000]  I don't hate, I don't hate Outback.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.360]  I have not been to an Outback in a number of years, but I, I would, in a pinch,
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.800]  I would go to an Outback in a second.
[50:34.320 --> 50:39.160]  I think people like, I think people like, this goes back to what,
[50:39.200 --> 50:42.640]  I feel like there's this thing, and I don't know if you had these where you were,
[50:42.680 --> 50:46.120]  but there was that trend in, I'm going to say the seventies.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.240]  I'm gonna talk on my ass for a minute.
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.800]  Like I feel like there's this trend of like places that probably like used to be
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.840]  a pickup bar and they got the brass railings and they're playing Steely Dan's
[50:54.840 --> 50:59.840]  Asia and you go in there and instead of finding fast handy,
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.480]  it's going to be like happy hours and specialty drinks and you know what I'm
[51:04.480 --> 51:07.680]  saying? And like those kinds of places. Then that led to like, what?
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.640]  Bennigan's that led to that,
[51:09.680 --> 51:14.080]  all these different chains of like the brass railing restaurants with the
[51:14.080 --> 51:18.120]  ferns and stuff like that. And then I, I kind of see what you're saying.
[51:18.120 --> 51:22.200]  What you're saying is that the originals were legit establishments where there
[51:22.200 --> 51:26.160]  was an actual restaurant tour. Somebody who cares. I think so. Somebody cared.
[51:26.760 --> 51:29.720]  And Oh, absolutely. And then, yeah.
[51:29.760 --> 51:34.080]  And they just wanted you to be comfortable. They wanted, they wanted you know,
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.960]  like a dark wood atmosphere, put some dark wood and just get in on that sweet,
[51:37.960 --> 51:41.760]  sweet seventies horny market. Like, like be able to get in there and like,
[51:41.880 --> 51:44.640]  you know, happy hours used to be a huge thing even into the eighties.
[51:44.680 --> 51:48.640]  Do you remember happy hours? Oh yeah. I mean you still say happy hour and it's
[51:48.640 --> 51:51.400]  like whatever. Two for one beers. But back then it was big.
[51:51.400 --> 51:56.400]  They would have like a buffet. You could go, you could go, you know, I absolutely,
[51:56.400 --> 51:59.280]  you're absolutely right. I mean, I don't know how that spawns a chain of like,
[51:59.280 --> 52:02.840]  you know, 800 restaurants or whatever, but that's the problem. And this is,
[52:02.840 --> 52:06.640]  this is where I don't want to sound like a jerk, but like a San Francisco where I
[52:06.640 --> 52:10.800]  live actually has laws about this. They have, I forget the name of it.
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.400]  I heard a planet money about this and like dealing with the blight of dollar
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.080]  stores and the horrible tangled mess of like nothing, no shade, no lemonade,
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.360]  but dollar stores have kind of taken over. They've pushed out,
[52:23.400 --> 52:28.000]  it's kind of like how Walmart was 20 years ago where like it's very difficult to
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.640]  start start and especially sustain a grocery store in a lot of, you know,
[52:32.640 --> 52:35.800]  urban and suburban areas. Right. And so, yeah,
[52:35.800 --> 52:39.120]  now there's places that are getting these San Francisco style laws that are
[52:39.120 --> 52:39.320]  like,
[52:39.320 --> 52:44.320]  here's a hard limit on the number of locations for this kind of store or
[52:45.840 --> 52:49.360]  restaurant that, that you can have. But a lot of places,
[52:49.360 --> 52:53.440]  that's what there is. Like it's, it's going to be Applebee's or it's, you know,
[52:53.440 --> 52:55.840]  it's going to be a, I say Jardin to leave,
[52:56.040 --> 52:58.840]  but you're going to have an olive garden, you know what I'm saying?
[52:58.880 --> 53:02.400]  Those kinds of things. And that's, that's like where you can go.
[53:02.400 --> 53:04.280]  And then subway so many subways.
[53:06.040 --> 53:10.640]  Isn't subway a number one franchise in the world? Like they, they remember it
[53:10.640 --> 53:14.640]  was like a, uh, it was like a thing when they got close to McDonald's,
[53:14.640 --> 53:17.680]  but then they just soared right past McDonald's cause they'll put a subway
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.600]  anywhere. Yeah.
[53:19.600 --> 53:23.920]  They fit into a lot of places and then they tend to stay there. Yeah. Uh, yeah.
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.400]  If you've got a weird retail spot, I mean like a really weird, you're talking,
[53:28.400 --> 53:30.760]  I'm talking like a triangle shaped building, right?
[53:31.240 --> 53:34.040]  Like really weird square footage. And you think, well,
[53:34.040 --> 53:36.360]  what could you possibly do here? You can make a subway.
[53:37.400 --> 53:40.880]  Oh, sweet Maui onion.
[53:41.040 --> 53:43.920]  I'm looking at a letter article here in the, uh,
[53:43.960 --> 53:46.160]  it's just the first thing I found on Google. Um,
[53:46.160 --> 53:50.000]  um, top, uh, franchise businesses.
[53:50.480 --> 53:54.240]  And they're telling me subways. Number one. Yeah, I think it's number one.
[53:55.400 --> 53:57.560]  Remember the Boston market used to be, it used to be kind of a treat.
[53:57.600 --> 53:59.600]  It was one of those things for me, like this is going to sound monkey balls,
[53:59.640 --> 54:04.760]  but like, do you remember like a time when KFC was a treat? Like Taco Bell was,
[54:04.760 --> 54:07.200]  uh, was a treat and subway was, it was a treat.
[54:07.520 --> 54:09.480]  My friends and I used to drive to like,
[54:09.480 --> 54:12.280]  when we go buy our records in Tampa like 45 miles away,
[54:12.520 --> 54:15.440]  like we would always stop at Taco Bell. Like it was a big deal.
[54:15.440 --> 54:17.600]  They had nachos and cheese, man. They just give it to you.
[54:18.360 --> 54:22.480]  We had, we had a weird restaurant growing up and, uh, reading Pennsylvania,
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.360]  it was called Geno's G I N O S fast food.
[54:27.240 --> 54:29.880]  And it was, uh, I haven't Googled this. I should,
[54:29.920 --> 54:34.840]  maybe I should look it up and see if I'm completely misremembering, but, uh,
[54:34.960 --> 54:39.800]  it was somehow affiliated with Kentucky fried chicken because you could go into
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.760]  Geno's and you could get Kentucky fried chicken and it would,
[54:43.760 --> 54:48.600]  it would say KFC. It had a picture of the kernel on it. Tasted good.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.600]  But you could also at Geno's, you could get like a hamburger.
[54:53.480 --> 54:56.680]  So it was like, God, yeah. Did you ever hear of this?
[54:56.920 --> 55:01.320]  I'm looking at it right now. It's a thing. Yeah. He had Geno's burgers and chicken,
[55:01.800 --> 55:05.800]  and they had some kind of a arch affiliation with KFC.
[55:05.800 --> 55:09.160]  That's so weird. And that was like when you were like, well,
[55:09.160 --> 55:12.080]  like a teen that that happened, I was probably about six years old.
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.000]  This is, we're talking late seventies. Okay. Right around, you know,
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.720]  right around like a Reagan getting into office. Okay. All right. Yeah.
[55:19.720 --> 55:21.640]  And we did, that would be a, like you said,
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.640]  a treat that we'd go there like once a week or something like that.
[55:25.720 --> 55:28.840]  And now listen, don't, don't spoil the joke by guessing too high, but give me your,
[55:28.840 --> 55:32.400]  give me your reckon on how many subways there are
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.200]  worldwide. Is it, is it, yes.
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.200]  Uh, I'm going to say 8,000. Okay. That's a really good guess.
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.120]  Well, um, they're in 112 countries. There are 42,431 subways,
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.560]  42,42, 42, 42,000. I bet some are better than others.
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.040]  I bet some are cleaner than others, but, but they all have that cheese.
[55:56.040 --> 55:59.080]  There's like a child's color form game from, from the seventies.
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.960]  You want cheese on that? They can hear, you can hear the air quotes on it.
[56:01.960 --> 56:06.760]  Yeah. Oh my God. This talk has been a bomb to my soul.
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.520]  Really? Yeah, really. It really is. We have technology.
[56:11.680 --> 56:13.960]  Do I feel, do I sound like I'm lightheaded?
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.480]  Do you sound like you're light ahead? Cause I feel like John, John,
[56:19.480 --> 56:22.240]  I could use the time. I've heard you being a lot more lightheaded.
[56:22.240 --> 56:25.320]  I think you're doing great. I just feel like I can maybe take a nap.
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.440]  Why don't you give yourself that gift? You know what I'm saying?
[56:30.440 --> 56:33.040]  You've earned it. You know how hard it is to podcast. You know how much,
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.840]  how difficult it is to pay attention to another white man for up to seven hours
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.040]  for one of your shows. That's a lot of work. You got to write things down.
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.440]  You gotta, you gotta Google subway. Yeah. I had this Eric, look,
[56:44.440 --> 56:49.000]  I'm catching up here. I've got the, uh, I keep making notes cause you keep,
[56:49.040 --> 56:51.240]  you know, it's hard to keep up with you. I will say this.
[56:52.240 --> 56:55.560]  You always put me on my a game. No, no. But you think, see,
[56:55.840 --> 56:57.360]  now you sound a little lightheaded. Yeah.
[56:57.360 --> 57:00.400]  But one of the big differences between me and you is, uh,
[57:00.480 --> 57:04.640]  you think fast and talk fast and I think slow and talk slow famously. I mean,
[57:05.680 --> 57:08.200]  I can't tell you how many times I get emails from people who say,
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.960]  thank God for overcast with the smart speed speech feature because I would
[57:12.960 --> 57:16.960]  never be able to listen to your show because I'm a slow talker. I just am.
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.080]  But you're a deep thinker. Well, all I wanted to say, I'm like a,
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.960]  I'm like a puddle the size of the Atlantic ocean. Uh, I wanted to go back.
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.000]  You can just stomp around in me until you're done. Did you know that, uh,
[57:29.040 --> 57:32.080]  happy hour, we were talking about happy hour. Yeah. Uh,
[57:32.360 --> 57:35.400]  do you know that it is illegal in Massachusetts?
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.480]  Happy hour is illegal in Massachusetts. It's a state law. Yeah, I believe.
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.640]  And now this, it, it, the, it could have changed since, since I was there,
[57:44.640 --> 57:48.080]  but I believe it has not. Uh, but the idea is that you, uh,
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.040]  you're not allowed to sell drinks at a discount,
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.280]  like whatever your standard price is for like a beer. Whoa. All day long,
[57:54.280 --> 57:57.820]  you got to offer it at the same price because they don't want you, uh, enticing.
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.740]  They felt like, uh, uh, you know, if you, if you offer a discount beer,
[58:02.740 --> 58:05.340]  let's say between four and six, what do you think is,
[58:05.380 --> 58:09.140]  when's the standard happy hour? I think happy hour is, um,
[58:09.220 --> 58:13.840]  starts at four and it might go to seven is just my record. Four to six,
[58:13.840 --> 58:16.940]  four to seven, something around there. Right. Yes. Uh, but they don't,
[58:16.940 --> 58:21.660]  what they don't want is to states, John, eight States have made happy hour illegal.
[58:21.660 --> 58:26.340]  Yeah. Because it, uh, they, they think it promotes a binge drinking because you
[58:26.340 --> 58:30.340]  might stay early. Well, and, and, you know, let's say, uh, you know,
[58:30.420 --> 58:34.980]  it gets around to six 30, you look down at your watch at six 30, uh,
[58:35.060 --> 58:38.580]  you might want one or two more, but you feel like you gotta, you know,
[58:38.620 --> 58:42.540]  gotta get them quick because if you wait too long, you'll be paying full price.
[58:42.860 --> 58:47.660]  The price, the price doubles. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I guess Utah.
[58:47.660 --> 58:52.060]  I mean the Utah, I mean, is anybody drinking in Utah, Alaska? That seems weird.
[58:52.060 --> 58:57.140]  So, and it's to curb the, uh, the binge drinking and alcoholism.
[58:57.940 --> 59:01.940]  There's a lot of, there's a lot of squirrely. I've, I've encountered personally,
[59:01.940 --> 59:05.940]  a lot of squirrely laws about this stuff. It's, it's just, it's also strange.
[59:05.940 --> 59:07.820]  Like where my lady's from in Rhode Island,
[59:08.260 --> 59:10.660]  like it's dotted with places that are dry.
[59:11.860 --> 59:15.940]  And so you got to drive as much as it's Rhode Island. It's a toy state.
[59:15.940 --> 59:20.500]  You just want to drive as much as a quarter mile to get to a place over here.
[59:20.660 --> 59:23.380]  And then some of the places you've been to South Carolina where they got the big
[59:23.380 --> 59:26.100]  red dot outside. Yeah, I've been to South Carolina.
[59:26.300 --> 59:28.060]  I think it's South Carolina or like, you know,
[59:28.060 --> 59:30.900]  or just the whole like sort of package door thing or package store thing where
[59:30.900 --> 59:35.460]  it's like there's this living, uh, I don't know why, but like over here,
[59:35.460 --> 59:39.420]  we sell the alcohol and over there, like we sell the like, you know, uh,
[59:39.460 --> 59:43.700]  mr and mrs T blood and bloody Mary mix cause we can't sell them together. Right.
[59:43.700 --> 59:46.740]  Right. Like, but they got, they just got two doors on the place. It's so odd.
[59:49.140 --> 59:51.260]  Florida. You couldn't get a alcohol before.
[59:51.260 --> 59:55.980]  I want to say noon or one on Sundays cause of Jesus.
[59:56.020 --> 59:57.860]  They wouldn't let you do that. Oh, Pennsylvania.
[59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.740]  We had blue laws until very recently. Um,
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.260]  you couldn't buy any booze on Sunday. That's crazy. But then New York city,
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.460]  you can go to a bar till like four. Yeah. And there's no closing time.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.460]  Um, and nothing happens. I feel like, you know,
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.660]  I guess you adapt. I mean, you know, we, the, the, uh,
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.020]  the city started giving us a smaller trashcan a few months ago. Oh yeah.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.940]  I was really surprised. Oh yeah. Cause you know, it's San Francisco,
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.740]  but like we have a giant, giant, giant, uh,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.580]  this will actually be covered on the next episode of reconcilable differences.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.580]  I'm sorry to say, but they give us this giant,
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.780]  like 32 gallon thing for recycling. Right. And that's cool.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.580]  But then we get this like 16 gallon,
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.100]  which is smaller than you think for trash. And I thought, Oh,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.900]  there's no way we'll ever adapt to this. And then somehow we did,
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.260]  I guess you just get used to stuff. Yeah.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.980]  Uh, I'm not a fan of the recycling. Are you?
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.900]  Oh boy. You sure you want to go there? You sure you want to do this? You're gonna,
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:59.580]  you're gonna get so much email. I have, I have, I have,
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.660]  I have con if I'm being honest, John, I have concerns.
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.900]  I've heard things, I've heard things about recycling.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.780]  Have you heard things about recycling? Uh, Philadelphia, uh,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.380]  half of our recycling, uh,
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.340]  gets incinerated and they announced this is good news.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.820]  I like that they're going to stop, start incinerating.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.780]  Less is the less than is the dump path is the dump half empty or half full.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.100]  Uh,
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.100]  but the part that makes me so mad is that we have gotten at least three tickets
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.500]  from, uh, since we, we moved about two years ago.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:44.620]  And since we've lived in this place, we, we have new garbage man, I guess, uh,
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.660]  different part of town and we've three times gotten like a $50 fine for,
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.140]  um, uh, something. Yeah. Like, uh, like the one time they,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.500]  they claimed that we had recycling stuff in our non recycling trash,
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.860]  like some, you know, like a piece of cardboard. We had like cardboard box.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.260]  It wasn't even that you put a styrofoam block in the recycling.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.620]  It's that you miss something and there was like a aluminum can and you're,
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:14.380]  that's wild. Oh my God. And they enforce that. Well,
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.020]  very seemingly very randomly.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.180]  Isn't that like a running red lights level of cash?
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.500]  It makes me so mad though because they were just burning it up anyway.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.500]  Oh my God. I just put something in notes for you.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:31.740]  Um, episode of the excellent podcast, um,
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.180]  99% invisible and it's called national sword. And uh, yeah,
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.060]  kind of lays a pair. What a terrible racket this is.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.220]  San Francisco put huge resources into years ago, like some,
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.740]  some years ago, like fairly recently,
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:49.860]  but huge resources into this incredible technology. That's just like,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.820]  can you use a coin star? Yes. Coin star, like coin star.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.900]  Like that seems stupid. Like, Oh God, why can't I just dump all my coins?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.340]  I think that was the result of like an MIT project for like,
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.260]  here's this problem we haven't been able to solve,
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.620]  which is like effectively sorting coins, kicking out the bad ones.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.780]  Apparently in engineering you would know better than me.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.860]  It's a much more difficult problem than people had realized.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:17.220]  And so imagine taking coin star and applying that to recycling and trash.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:21.140]  So it's real good at like running down this like, you know,
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.340]  Lucille ball style conveyor and like picking out this kind of thing,
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.100]  that kind of thing. Here's where that goes. Here's this goes.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.700]  And all this money went into this.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.060]  And then something happened here, uh, since your, since 2001,
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.700]  China was one of the biggest, but you know the story.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.460]  Have you heard this story? Nope. Okay. So this is, this is where,
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.300]  and you're going to get an email about this. Um,
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.420]  since 2001 China was one of the biggest buyers of American recycling.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.060]  That is until last year when China pulled a move that no one saw coming,
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.980]  they stopped buying.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.300]  So we've been putting a bunch of it on on chips to hand over there.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.020]  But China is like, you know what? We don't need your stinky ass recycling.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.740]  It's all dirty. We can't do anything with it. I got nothing for you.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:05.140]  Like floating around the Pacific ocean with on, on a barge or something.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:09.260]  Yeah. It's like it's out there making a freedom reefs, you know? Yeah.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.380]  And so they had this thing called get ready. Now America,
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.540]  you really need to up your game and how you name stuff.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.740]  They had something called operation national sword.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.940]  Okay. So I'm just reading from, uh, this is, uh, Avery Truffleman,
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.060]  whom I love, uh, is, uh, is the producer on this, uh,
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.540]  national sword was China's ban on foreign recyclables.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.980]  It banned four categories and 24 types of imports starting in 2018,
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:40.300]  uh, steadily expanded. So, so we'll cut to the chase. Okay. Well,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.900]  where are we with that now? Like we,
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:47.820]  I get to feel good about putting all my, uh, my stuff in the big blue can,
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.060]  but like, Oh, the market ain't what it used to be. There was a time when the,
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:57.900]  I think in particular, the aluminum and to some extent the bottles, you know,
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.260]  like somebody's got to sort it. Somebody's got to figure it out.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.140]  Somebody's got to get the styrofoam out of there. And then like,
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:08.180]  did you know it went on a ship to China? No, I didn't know that.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:12.460]  It's never made any sense to me because does that run on like good feelings and
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.020]  Sarah McLachlan CDs? No,
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:19.020]  it's like pumping out tons of fuel to like get your garbage to China and then
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:24.300]  they stopped. Like if I put three things in my recycling, let's say I have a, uh,
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.860]  a can of beer, uh, a bottle, a glass bottle,
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.340]  or love four things, right? Glass bottle, uh,
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.980]  a plastic bottle and a piece of cardboard. Like, you know,
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.340]  let's just face it from Amazon, right? I put those four things.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.980]  They all go in the blue container, but they're those, you,
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.780]  they're all very different things. Absolutely. It makes no sense.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:51.700]  When we first started recycling at my college in 1986 it was an effort where we
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.860]  were like, okay, we want to do this thing. And here's,
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.700]  here's what cycling recycling required in 1986 was that we, after the party,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.660]  we come out there the next morning with those big gray Husky cans, you know,
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.020]  those big trash cans and we would collect all the cans and all of the bottles
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.220]  and the cans were pretty straightforward.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:12.020]  You empty them out and you put them in the can one, but like you put your, uh,
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.860]  what you put your Budweiser's in the, um, brown bottle.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.420]  One you put your rolling rocks in the green one, you put your Miller, uh,
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.340]  genuine drafts into the clear one. If memory serves like where you had to go and
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:31.140]  break all of that stuff down and then you had to drive it somewhere where they
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.980]  took the recycling. And now today, you know, I could, I, I could,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.780]  I could throw in some,
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.660]  some Haagen-Dazs containers and urinate on it and I'll just assume that someone
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.940]  takes care of that. I get to recycling in the blue thing.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.460]  I don't know. I don't want you to get a lot of email about it.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.780]  I don't want to get him out. If anybody's a bit, you're fine.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.540]  We're all fighting operation national sword. Let's be honest. Yeah.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.820]  All right. Let's uh, president G wrote me a beautiful letter.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:02.380]  Yeah. All right. Let's take a break and thank our next sponsor.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.340]  It's our good friends at fracture. You were just talking about Florida.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.140]  You ever been to Gainesville? That's where they're at.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.700]  My band played there one time.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.980]  They got a college there and a lot of food places and uh,
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:18.100]  I've never been to the refact. I've never been through the refractory.
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.340]  I haven't either.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:23.460]  Do you have several of their units hanging in my house right now?
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.580]  Look, Sam, they, you, you guys know fracture. I,
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.540]  they sponsor the show all the time. Come on. You take your pictures,
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.860]  you got them on your phone, you send them to fracture,
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.220]  they print them out directly on glass. You can get them real big.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.580]  One of the, I, I,
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.980]  one of the most shocking things to me is you really think about it. It's like,
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.340]  I still think of the cell phone as a sort of being a baby camera, right? Like it,
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.660]  it's not my real camera, quote unquote, real camera. Uh, you know what?
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.580]  A cell phone, you can take a picture, you take pictures with your cell phone,
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.860]  you can print them huge, like 32 inches, 24 inches, big,
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.780]  big prints and they look fantastic.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:05.700]  Like the resolution on a modern cell phone camera is amazing fracture.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.580]  I mean, you don't appreciate it if you, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you don't,
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.900]  you don't appreciate it. If even if you got like, like me,
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:15.100]  I got a fancy boy iPhone 10, you don't appreciate it on screen.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.980]  You appreciate it when you get back to your base camp and look at it in my case
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.420]  on this five K I'm acting, Oh my God, the detail that you just,
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.180]  it just pops and like, so what are you going to do? It's mother's day.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.060]  You're going to send your phone to your mom. Tell her, I said, hi, no,
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.220]  don't do that. It's probably a little late for mother's day.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.940]  You have to send her your literal phone. The thought is there.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.940]  Father's day is coming up. You could do it for father's day. Mother's day.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.300]  We're probably going to be a tight fit here. Um, but look,
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.060]  it's a great company with great products. Everybody I know.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.180]  Yeah. And I know, you know, look, they're paying me to say this,
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.260]  they're sponsoring the show, but I'm telling you,
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.860]  these things are fantastic and people do mention it.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.060]  Like people notice like these look different than just getting a regular picture
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.020]  printed out. Like when you buy them for people,
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.340]  they're like amazed because they go edge to edge. They don't need a frame.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.820]  Everything is great about them. And they say, where did you get this? You know,
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.580]  like people actually noticed that these are remarkable prints of your photos.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:20.220]  Yeah. Send them to your family. They're the greatest gift in the world.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.540]  And like I always say,
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.580]  I'm a terrible gift buyer because I never know what to get anybody.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:28.660]  The great thing about fracture is that you can just keep going back to the well
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.300]  and just like every year get your,
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:36.340]  get your mom some fracture prints of the dog or the kids or the family,
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.300]  you know, whoever, whoever's still going in, look at your favorites.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.340]  I mean like one thing we do is like we share stuff with the family through a,
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.420]  because we're, you know, cucks for Apple.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.380]  We do a shared iCloud photo album,
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.220]  but like even if you just do something as simple as like,
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.300]  like don't wait until December 20th to do this. Go,
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.140]  go and look at your favorites.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.700]  Like maybe even hop back a few months and look at the one we go, Oh my God,
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.060]  I forgot how well that turned out. Right.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.180]  And then like you have no idea how happy you're going to make somebody.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.060]  It's going to arrive.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.940]  It pops and it has this the stuff you need right there if you want to hang it
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.020]  up. I mean it really, they really are beautiful. Uh, so where do you go?
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.860]  Go to fracture dot me.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.860]  That's the website fracture dot me for a special discount.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.980]  They don't have a code or anything like that. Just go there. Uh,
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.620]  your first fracture order will include a special discount and then
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.060]  they have a one question survey at the end of the process. You go there,
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.620]  you buy your prints, you get them ordered, and then they'll ask you one question,
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:41.540]  which is where did you hear of fracture? And then, uh, just tell them that was
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.860]  the, uh, the talk show.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.500]  You always do such a good job. I,
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:51.060]  one of my favorite little things about having you on the show is that you always
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.460]  jump in. You know, a lot of these shows, you like that. Oh, I love it.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.180]  I think it's the best nuisance challenge. No, it's the best. Well, you know,
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.540]  one thing I do differently,
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.180]  we want to talk a little bit here about the art of podcasting. Uh, okay.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.900]  Okay. I do the show. I do these ad reads.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.340]  I just interrupt our conversation and I,
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.380]  you're sitting there listening to me do that.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:19.700]  Most shows that are maybe a little bit more polished will do the sponsor reads,
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.060]  you know, separately from the recording of the,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.740]  the interview talk portion of the show,
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.380]  and then they'll put them in through the magic of audio editing.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.580]  They insert them in there and then play a little bit of electronic music as the
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.020]  music bed. Uh,
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.980]  I don't do it that way. Uh, I don't know why,
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.940]  but I will tell you one of the weird things about doing a podcast every once in
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:48.460]  a while, I will have to do one in post. Uh,
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.300]  because let's say that the, uh, I don't have the information from the sponsor.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:56.140]  Like I know that a company X is going to be sponsoring the show,
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:00.540]  but I don't have it yet. I don't have the read, but I've already scheduled my,
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.980]  uh, my interview, you know, with you or, or Moltz or whoever's on the show this week.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.300]  You know, so I'll do that. And then in post I will,
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.060]  I will record the show or the, uh, the podcast read. I,
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.020]  I can never get them out. I mean, like my,
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:20.780]  my audio recording folder on my Mac is filled with like, every time it happens,
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.580]  it takes me like eight, it takes eight takes.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.940]  You almost make it to the end and eat the booger. Yeah.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.900]  That's the worst part. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.860]  And there's some that are like 14 more about,
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.780]  and then there's some that are only like 14 kilobytes and with like screaming
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.140]  for expletives right before I hit the stop button.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.540]  But there is something to doing it, uh,
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.340]  extemporaneously live. Like I feel like I've got to have a little bit of an edge.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:53.500]  I gotta, I gotta keep you or whoever my guest is on a particular week.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.860]  I want to keep you entertained. And I feel like if I'm doing that, uh,
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.340]  that that would mean that the,
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:04.580]  the thousands of people out there listening to the show are perhaps entertained
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.140]  by, by what's actually an advertisement. Uh, I need that edge,
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.740]  but like when I do it in post and I don't really have to keep somebody's
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.540]  interest, I, I cannot get it out.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:18.460]  Yeah. It's hard. I ended up talking to myself inside the ad read,
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.740]  like a crazy person. And like, I'm like, Hey man,
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.420]  what do you think of that? Pretty good. Like I just,
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.100]  I sound like an insane person and like,
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.580]  I think people are pretty forgiving of an in the show. Read, you know,
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.980]  um, and it's not, I don't know. See, I don't want to be partisan about this,
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:37.300]  but like I, I like that kind of read. I understand why people don't, you know,
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.860]  uh, you get your, like your monkey balls,
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:43.060]  dynamic ad insertion system that's going to go and like make sure it's something
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.020]  relevant. But like, I also think it's valuable.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.580]  Like if you genuinely like what the thing is and you can say why and like,
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.420]  I think that doesn't hurt.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.620]  No, it's definitely, you know,
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:58.980]  one of the nicer things about being in this podcast racket is that the sponsors
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:02.340]  really are good companies. You know, fracture is a great company.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.220]  We haven't reached the level where they start to really suck. Right.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.180]  You know what I mean? Like you want to stay right where you are, buddy.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.580]  You don't want to get too much bigger or you're going to be doing like refi's
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.420]  and like we buy houses and stuff like that.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.060]  You guys know one 800 we buy houses. Okay.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.940]  That's no good.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.700]  Did you listen to, uh, I think I was talking with molts a couple of weeks ago.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.220]  Uh, we were talking about baseball stadium names, you know, the, uh,
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.860]  the worst, what used to be Comiskey park in Chicago where the White Sox play is
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:39.860]  now a guaranteed rate field.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.820]  That's I, I feel like I responded to maybe your, uh, okay.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.660]  What is the,
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:50.220]  what is the deal with the stadiums being named for loan companies?
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:54.460]  I guess that's where all the money is with like a loan in the name. I don't,
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.580]  I don't get it. But then somebody on Twitter, I forget who it was. Um,
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.060]  I thank you for it, but they sent me the, they were like, the,
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.420]  the name isn't the worst part.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.980]  The logo is the worst part because the guaranteed rate logo is a down pointing
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:09.580]  arrow. Like what? Well,
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:14.220]  it lets you know that your rate will be down, I guess. I don't know. I guess so.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.980]  Oh my God. No, that's, that's, that's, that's no good.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.180]  No good. I'm trying to see names here. So what do we got? Uh,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:24.380]  maybe some of these are all right. So is Fenway park still Fenway park? I guess.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:27.860]  So yeah, that's still family. They can't change them. Bush stadium.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.060]  I could live with Bush stadiums. See the Bush,
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:35.500]  Bush stadium is an interesting one because the Bush family owned the Cardinals.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.780]  So they kind of, you know, and then they had, you know, they,
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.820]  they put their name on their own brand of beer. So they,
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.100]  just by naming it with their family name, they were,
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.900]  they were simultaneously advertising for their, uh, you know,
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.540]  for their fine selection of American lagers.
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.780]  For core data for Coors field. But John really is a great example.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.260]  Globe life park in Arlington. That's, that's four nouns.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:05.300]  That's not a name like a globe life part. I mean like what is, what is that?
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.820]  Guaranteed rate field, guaranteed rate field,
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.300]  Oracle park Petco park.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.700]  It's kind of nice when it reflects a local business though.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.300]  I mean, so Wrigley is the shooting gum people. Yeah, that's a chewing gum.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:20.980]  That's cool. That's kind of cool.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.020]  I wonder if they sell gum at the, at the ballpark. I bet they don't. Yeah.
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.340]  Because you know, it's, somebody's got to scrape that up.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.140]  Somebody's got to scrape that up and, but they are Wrigley. So maybe they,
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:34.940]  maybe they have to. Oh, that's a good question. I don't know.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:35.580]  I don't know how that works.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.540]  Don't they stop selling beer like after the seventh inning stretch? Yeah.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.420]  I think that, I don't know if that's like a,
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.420]  like a major league bylaw or it just all the stadiums just sort of have come to
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.700]  the, uh, to the same, you know, agreement. But I believe, yeah,
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:52.860]  I believe the seventh inning was the last time you can buy a beer at most
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.100]  ballparks. I guess that's probably a good idea. Well,
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.660]  what stinks though is if you get into an extra inning game, uh,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.860]  friend of the show, you know, Paul Kefasis, right? Oh yeah. We were, uh,
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.500]  uh, went to the Yankee stadium and we,
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.460]  I think we were watching the Red Sox. Yankees game. Yeah, it was a Red Sox.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.860]  Yankee loves the Yankees. Uh,
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.620]  and I believe the game went into the 16th inning.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:22.060]  My might've been the 17th. I don't know, but it's, I'll tell you what, once,
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.580]  you know, it, you could use a beer, like sometime around the 13th inning,
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.940]  you could use a beer. Oh yeah. Can't get one. They don't restart it though.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.500]  There's no way to restart. Okay.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.220]  They don't have like an in oregano where you take a little break and drink some
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:39.700]  water and then they, yeah. All right. Hmm. Probably send the people home and stuff.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.860]  Geez. Yeah. I don't know.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.540]  What's your thoughts on this, uh, with this luminary and,
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:52.020]  and the paid subscription model for podcasts?
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.140]  Um, I mean,
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:58.220]  I guess my take comes from a few different angles,
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:02.980]  all of which should have some kind of like asterisk or disclaimer,
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.620]  but I mean, you know,
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:09.660]  a big part of these companies who come in and want to disrupt a market.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:13.420]  I mean, a lot of cases, a lot of companies, you know, from our area,
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.660]  let's say, um, you know, what, what they mean is like, we've,
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.820]  we've found a way around the rules for now.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.700]  And like as long as we can keep the money coming in, you know,
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.700]  we're going to be able to, you know, at least let's just say skirt conventions.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.660]  And, but then in other cases, boy,
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:37.460]  I'm trying not to sound unkind and you get carpetbaggers and you get people who
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.140]  are coming in and look at like, you know, idiots like you and me,
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.220]  probably me more to an extent than you is like,
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:47.900]  I am an OG fan of podcasting as an
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.020]  independent medium. Like it is,
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:54.500]  you don't have podcasting without independence and not to get all, you know,
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.020]  Marco here, but I'm, I agree. I really agree that if you,
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:02.900]  if your show is not part of a, you know, an RSS feed,
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.500]  that anybody can get in pretty much any app, it's, that's not really a podcast.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.700]  I mean, we do a Patreon for the dude by Friday show, but like,
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.660]  I don't think people would be at all attracted to that show, um,
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.980]  to, to supporting what we did on the other show.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.740]  We don't have ads in that case, you know, unless we had that, the,
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.100]  the free stuff and it, you know, that doesn't go away.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.820]  It's not going to be some kind of like a, I don't want to name names,
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.300]  but like, it's not going to be one of those.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.340]  Eventually this goes private like as long as we are around and can afford the
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.660]  hosting, like it'll be there for you. So I don't know. I mean,
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:36.620]  I don't have anything very unique to say about this,
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.180]  but there is the idea. It does kind of put me off my beer a little bit.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.940]  When folks come in, they're like, like, uh, what's his name? Um,
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:48.900]  the guy in, um, the music man, is it Henry Hill or is Henry Hill?
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.940]  The one from good. No, Henry Hills is good fellows. Anyway,
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:56.620]  the character, the Robert Preston plays, um, please email John, you know,
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:00.900]  or the, you know, the monorail salesman comes into town. I was like, Oh,
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.780]  are you the second being a sucker and dealing with all that advertising?
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.980]  And it's like, you know, uh, we got trouble right here in podcast city. And, um,
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.500]  so, um,
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.500]  when those folks come along and are vending their solution to people,
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.980]  sometimes it really feels like they're vending a solution to a non-existent
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:23.940]  problem. And I don't want to see, I don't want to go on about it,
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.620]  but like in the case of luminary, of course I downloaded the app and like, Oh God,
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:29.420]  of course, instantly I need to have an account for this.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.220]  And I just closed it up and you know,
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.140]  people who have used the app say it's like not the worst app in the world,
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.140]  but it's not a great app. And, um,
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:37.620]  it is,
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:42.620]  it's really weird that you can't just paste in the RSS feed for a podcast.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.660]  Like, so the only way I, so I, I, you download the loom,
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.820]  I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a great app,
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:55.380]  but I w you know, for professional diligence, I import like OPML. Nope.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.820]  Oh man. That's not who it's for though. Right. Right. I guess. Well,
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.220]  and I think part of it is like the whole thing with it.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:09.260]  It is just so it's weird to me like that.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:14.460]  So the New York times has this podcast that is apparently just a genuine
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.980]  sensation. The daily huge,
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:19.980]  it is maybe like the biggest podcast in the world.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.900]  I worked up there. Right. And they, it's,
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.460]  it's just a, you know, there's a URL,
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.460]  20 minutes, half hour every morning.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:32.740]  Michael Barbaro talks to somebody from the New York times about a story and it
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.820]  became like improbably popular. I listened to it.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.980]  I listened to it most days. It's a good show, but like it spawned, you know,
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.620]  a lot of imitators, the post does one and that's good. And there's all of those.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.820]  But like, yeah, yeah. Then there are, they're always,
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.860]  I believe I don't follow this stuff anymore,
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:52.460]  but I feel like I've heard some pretty bananas numbers on how they do and they,
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.780]  I think they are often at the top, if not consistently at the top on iTunes.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:01.380]  It's, but it, it, they deserve it. It's great. Uh, that's super cool.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.820]  It's great to see some, you know,
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.500]  an old institution like the New York times thriving in the new medium.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:09.100]  But what they've done with luminary is they've just said,
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.060]  we don't want our podcast in your app. And, but it's,
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.740]  it's just a regular old fashioned podcast where if you know the URL and you
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.980]  go to that URL,
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:22.820]  you get an RSS feed and XML format.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:26.820]  And if your software can parse the RSS,
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:30.820]  then you can see here's all the episodes and here's the URLs for the episodes.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:34.700]  And they're all just out there on the public internet.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:38.340]  And they just said, we don't want our podcast in your app,
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:41.820]  which is a very weird thing and sort of antithetical to like,
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.780]  imagine like if I said to, uh, Google, I was like,
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:50.300]  I don't want daring fireball to be in Chrome. Like I'm,
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.860]  Oh, it's not, you're not even talking robots.txt. You're saying like,
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:57.100]  I don't want, like, I'm, I'm, it's not robot. It's not really opposed to opera.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.820]  This is all just through handshakes. The New York times, it's just like,
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:03.260]  we don't want to be in there. And the luminary is like,
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.060]  we don't want any trouble. We don't want any lawsuits. So, okay.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.260]  But that's why I think that they can't just let you paste a U R U R L in
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.660]  because then you could paste the URL for the daily. And that's why
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.940]  I guess, I don't know. I, I, uh, geez, I don't know.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.260]  I think I would suspect that,
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:27.060]  or maybe the word to drive you to the directory and get you clicking on stuff
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:30.940]  that's being featured and stuff like that. But like, so is there, I mean,
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.020]  how many, I don't fully understand what their deal is, but like, so it's,
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.660]  the idea is that you can get all the podcasts you already love asterisk. Um,
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.180]  so you're already like a big podcast fan when you,
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:46.620]  so you've heard serial and there's that. And then, um, cause you know, that's,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:50.620]  they invented podcasts a couple of years back. And, um,
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:55.860]  the idea is you're going to really want this Trevor Noah
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.940]  show that's unavailable anywhere else.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.740]  And then how much do you pay a month for that service?
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.220]  Uh, I think they're charging like eight bucks a month, eight,
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.660]  eight or 10 bucks a month. Okay. All right. I don't know. I don't get it.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:13.180]  But, but, and the other thing too, that annoys me and I wrote a piece about it,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.340]  and maybe I,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:19.220]  maybe I'm a bit pedantic about it in terms of should they be calling these
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.900]  shows, quote, podcasts. And I,
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.420]  you know, I, I don't regret it,
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.220]  but I feel like I was a little strident, you know,
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.820]  and there's a part of me that rolls my eyes at my own argument that podcasts
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.780]  should be something that you can listen to in any podcast app.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:40.420]  And a little bit is that me saying what the way I think things
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.780]  should be as opposed to the way they are or the way they had been. Right.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.420]  I mean, is it a podcast? Is Trevor Noah's show a podcast?
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.820]  If it's only available in the app, maybe you,
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.700]  if I could say in that instance, you, or in fact, many of us, um,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:01.500]  are taking any number of pieces of bait here, if I could say.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.580]  So like in that case, the, the, um, so the bait,
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.740]  the bait here is like, man, like, you know, you say, Oh,
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.740]  that's not really a podcast. And it's like, well, okay. Is it a podcast?
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:15.660]  Is it not a podcast? I could think of an example or a counter example of almost
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.460]  any kind of audio people listen to that. I mean, look at Amazon.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.900]  Amazon has tried this with like, you buy into this service to get these shows.
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:26.260]  Um, certainly there are people like us who have a Patreon with a nominally
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.060]  private feed for these things,
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.460]  Mark Marin or whomever, or back in the day, Ricky Gervais,
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.420]  like he would just cut off after a certain number of episodes and you had to buy
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.700]  them on iTunes, I think was his model. So I mean,
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.260]  the problem is that like we take the bait on that. So now we're arguing,
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.860]  now we sound like old men who were like arguing about like,
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.460]  like who the best shortstop was or something. And like, no, you know, that's,
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.500]  that's not, that's, that's one of the, that's maybe the first,
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.020]  I don't know if it's the second piece of bait.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.020]  The other big piece of bait is that they,
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.100]  they seem to have like so many of these folks,
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:58.860]  they seem to have presented it, I want to be careful here.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.820]  They seem to have presented it as like, you know,
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:05.820]  this grift where all these dailing podcasters want to make you listen to ads
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.940]  for stuff you don't want is killing you, isn't it? Like,
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.740]  isn't it terrible and et cetera, et cetera. And so what happens now?
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.100]  We take the bait on that. We, not me personally,
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.140]  but some people take the bait on that and they're like, hey,
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.580]  some people might just be honest to them and say like, no,
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.300]  you're taking food out of my mouth. And other people you know,
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.340]  everybody's got their reasons,
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:32.020]  but all of that detracts from the kind of the big picture thing,
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:35.180]  which is like anybody who enters a market like this,
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.620]  somebody who enters a market this mature at this point is probably not here.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.620]  They're here because they like the idea of that market and the future market.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.380]  They're not here because they love the stuff. Right. Right.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.820]  Maybe that, maybe that shouldn't matter. And maybe I'm being,
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.820]  I'm being a real, I'm being very silly about that. But like,
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:59.780]  but like why do you get an influx of whatever,
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:04.380]  however many like, you know millions or tens of millions of dollars. Well,
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:08.020]  cause they think somebody thinks and they're smart people. Right.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.900]  But somebody on sand Hill road thinks throwing this big bag of money over
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:17.540]  time is going to let you capture a market in a way that's going to be difficult
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.980]  to compete with. That's, that's the point. You don't,
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.980]  you don't get $20 million in VC money right now to be the fourth best anything.
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.660]  You're getting that because you're going,
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.100]  everybody looks at Amazon and says, Oh my gosh,
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.780]  they've turned the whole world upside down because they are not profitable.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:39.380]  They had for years, they were not profitable in the usual way.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.020]  They found ways to pivot, dah, dah, dah, dah. And like,
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.780]  I don't know if that's the best example,
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.660]  but I think that's why folks come into this. And like what, what we,
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.820]  I think what we kind of need to be interrogating is like, okay, well like, um,
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:54.740]  like who is this great for is maybe one way to put it.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.260]  Who is this really great for?
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.660]  Cause like let's even take the podcasters out of it cause who cares? But like,
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.220]  is this,
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:05.220]  is this a particularly good thing for existing or new listeners?
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.860]  I, I don't know. It kind of doesn't seem like it.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.180]  And I,
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:17.420]  so the old man part of me does believe that this medium would not be where it is
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.420]  today and as quote unquote successful as it is today if it did not have this
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.640]  legacy of being independent and free as in all the definitions of free and just
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.600]  and so simple. It is very simple. Right. And thank,
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.120]  thank you to Apple for, for helping us with that. Right. And thank God they
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.720]  haven't screwed the pooch on that yet. But yeah, that's, that's,
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.040]  that's the big rant is like, okay, so like they say in a Glengarry Glen Ross,
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:46.240]  what is this in service of? So if you, if your company succeeds really well,
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.640]  like so they're going to have some kind of press release about blah, blah, blah,
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.920]  so many new consumers and downloads and all this stuff.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.760]  But like even with Spotify, I'm a huge fan of the Spotify music stuff.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.040]  I think as it is right now, their podcast experience is just hot garbage. Um,
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.120]  but at least with Spotify you have to like Spotify and Google.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.040]  I think you have to like ask to be in there.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.360]  I don't think they're scraping everybody's feeds. Scraping is a strong word,
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.320]  but you know what I mean? But, but in this case they're going to gather,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.760]  they're going to gather up all of this stuff, which is admittedly,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.320]  freely available. HTTP feeds of stuff,
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:24.560]  not that different from a website, but they're putting all that into their thing.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.040]  Go look, look at this wonderful stuff that we've put together.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.560]  I just don't know how in five years,
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.560]  I'm not sure how this works out great for almost anybody,
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.040]  but the folks who are looking for a 10 X on their investment, that's cynical,
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:35.940]  but that's how I feel.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:42.960]  I did a couple people made the same point and I think it's kind of obvious, so I,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.400]  I don't know who to give credit to, but it's not my idea.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.520]  I saw it several people make this when this whole luminary thing broke a week
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.200]  and a half, two weeks ago. But like the, the thought and it,
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.080]  but I think it's true and I think it's really kind of interesting to think
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:02.000]  about is that podcasting is really the only part of the internet left that
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.120]  works the way the internet is supposed to work.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:08.160]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.880]  And lots of people have a, you know, just to again,
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.000]  credit lots of anonymous people who said the same thing, but like, you know,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.760]  we've all seen those ridiculous terms of terms and conditions on a site that say
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.560]  you have to ask permission before you link to us and stuff like that.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.160]  And the core doctors of the world have like roundly understandably criticized
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.840]  that and say, that's crazy. That's what the web is. No, I,
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.640]  I totally agree with you in a free, when I say free, you know,
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.400]  the freezing beer freezing speech, but I also mean like free as an independent,
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.600]  free at free as in like, um, you know,
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.080]  to kind of take it back in some ways to that talk we did at South by Southwest
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.600]  that we always find a way to bring up. Like it's, I, you know,
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.200]  there are many like it, but this is mine. Like this is my thing. And like it's,
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.120]  it's, it's when,
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.760]  when places have like scraped my feet in the true sense of the word in the past,
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.400]  it wasn't that I was mad they were taking away ad dollars.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.400]  It was mad that they were trying to like put my stuff somewhere that I didn't
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.840]  want it to be in a bad neighborhood. And that I'm not implying,
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.780]  I don't mean to imply specifically here that luminary is a bad neighborhood,
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.860]  but I do feel like the ability,
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.820]  part of independence is that ability for better or worse to be able to control
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.660]  what it is that you, that you make up to a certain point. Right. So I mean like,
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:17.860]  and this is why I never,
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:21.660]  I very rarely intentionally use the word pirating to talk about illegal
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:24.620]  downloading and maybe it's a distinction without a difference,
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:28.140]  but I think of pirating as somebody who like burns a DVD and sell it,
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.620]  sells it at the swap meet, you know, um,
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.980]  maybe that's not the greatest thing in the world, but you know, it's,
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.980]  it's something we're like, you know what, take all my stuff you want.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.420]  I can always make more stuff, but like don't,
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:44.500]  don't make me a flower bed in your walled garden and act like that benefits me.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:47.260]  I don't think that's, I don't think that's cool.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:51.460]  It's that part of that freedom is that like I get to make this thing and I get
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.340]  to have somebody to say,
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.460]  if somebody decides to sort of claim that as part of their ages and their value
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:00.340]  proposition, I think I should have a say in that anyway. Yeah.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.900]  Isn't it remarkable? I mean,
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:06.780]  just to maybe get somewhat on brand for the show, but talk about Apple,
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:11.940]  but isn't Apple's role in podcasting remarkable?
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:16.980]  Like I would say unique. It, it, it seems crazy in hindsight,
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.900]  you know, it's crazy.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.180]  It's crazy that you're able to pull it off and it's 10 X more insane that they
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:28.180]  haven't capitalized monetized on it in any way that we've seen yet.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:32.100]  Right. They've never really tried to monetize it at all. They don't,
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.540]  they don't do ads. They just,
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.060]  it's like they built the most to your Trump example.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.620]  It's like they built the most beautiful golf golf course in the world and then
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:42.540]  like just didn't charge people for it. You know,
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.180]  they don't even really play there. They just wanted to make this thing.
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.900]  And it's like, you know, the, the big loser in that one,
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.180]  obviously back in the day was Odeo. But like it's,
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.700]  I think about it all the time, John, I think it's like,
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.740]  like Matt Howie used to say back in the blog days,
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.980]  we're all one Firefox extension away from not having a job anymore. And like on,
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:02.340]  on the, on the day when, if and when Apple decides to get weird with podcasts,
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.260]  that's cause they also, as Marco said on ATP,
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.940]  they also make the directory that like everybody relies upon which directory,
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.540]  let's point out, luminary doesn't use. So you can't even like,
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:17.260]  do they not? I think it wasn't luminary or was it Spotify?
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.860]  But there's some of these services that have their own version of that.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:23.580]  There's not like a ID that can be used easily.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:27.940]  But I think that they sort of started by copying the iTunes database, like,
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:32.540]  well, with the same, like, like grippable URLs. Yeah. I don't know.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.420]  I'm not quite sure. I guess it doesn't matter, but effectively, yeah,
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.660]  it's amazing. They haven't screwed it up. It's just crazy.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.020]  I still wonder, I,
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:46.580]  and I've been talking about this ever since the word was invented and, you know,
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.900]  uh, back when this show started, however,
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:54.660]  forever, forever ago. Um, but would Apple,
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.820]  w was what caught their eye, what caught Steve jobs is I,
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.140]  the fact that they were using the board pod, you know,
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.620]  that the name of it, we call them podcasts,
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:10.380]  but nobody even uses iPods anymore. Right. The iPod is, you know,
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.540]  like a relic, uh, like the,
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.100]  who would have thought the word podcast would outlive the iPod and would Apple
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:21.900]  have gotten interested in the space if they had been called something
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.660]  else that didn't have the word pod in it?
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.340]  Like would have caught, would have caught public attention,
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:31.820]  let alone like gotten Steve's. I, you know, it's, it's,
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.900]  it's difficult to know cause I I'm like, I have to be honest,
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.740]  like I have no trouble at all imagining Steve, um,
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.020]  not just like approving so many aspects of how Macintosh got made.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.380]  I have no problem at all. I'm matching him, mentioning him like using, you know,
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.580]  a Macintosh, like really, really,
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.380]  really using a Macintosh or really really using an iPhone.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.580]  I mean you can imagine the first time he saw like that rubber banding and was
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:00.900]  just like, Oh my God, like this is, this is wild. Like this is, this is the thing,
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:05.740]  this is it. Um, so like, and I can even relate to the, uh,
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:10.580]  to the like, okay, I tried to, what was the anecdote about TV?
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.780]  It's probably a gene monster thing,
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:16.300]  but we're like he called up somebody at like a was it like Comcast or somewhere
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.140]  is like, you're, this, this is terrible. It's a terrible service. It's garbage.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:23.220]  But even in that case, I don't think he probably watched a lot of TV,
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.900]  but I'll bet when he did, he really wanted it to work. I don't,
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.420]  this is completely off topic in some ways,
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:34.380]  but I don't imagine Steve listening to a lot of podcasts
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:38.020]  personally. Yeah, me neither. I can't, but who knows? I don't know.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:42.900]  Maybe he didn't just, it just doesn't seem like he had the time, but yeah.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:45.620]  Yeah. So I mean like, what is it about it that would be so appealing to,
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.100]  and again, we're falling into this hash geography that like he's the,
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.860]  he's the person who hits a big button and makes everything happen in Apple. But,
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.020]  um, but, but it caught somebody's attention.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:57.660]  It could be because of the pod part. It could just be because that was the big,
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:02.340]  the little baby steps of their interest in becoming,
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:06.180]  um, the media place, like starting with the,
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:09.780]  with the songs that you could buy. It's audio, it's more audio.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.620]  It's good for iPods. Maybe that could be one. Yeah, I don't know.
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.180]  It's crazy when you think about it though. And we just sorta,
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:20.300]  it's just sort of like in the air, you know, it's like just the oxygen we breathe.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:25.300]  Is that iTunes podcast database has 10 million podcasts and if you're not in
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.580]  there, you're effectively delisted. I mean, it's,
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.900]  it's not utterly equivalent, but it's almost like,
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.740]  even though I'm a library of Congress man, myself,
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:36.020]  it's a little bit like Dewey Decimal.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:40.460]  Like it's something that everybody can use to understand and organize a very
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:44.420]  large collection of data. And it's like, if not a standard, it's,
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.180]  it's close enough for now that, um, that that always there. So, I mean,
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:49.100]  I don't know, I don't know.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:54.100]  It's such a weird time and there still is so much weird money coming into these
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:58.500]  ideas that don't always make sense to me apart from the sort of obvious way that
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.620]  it makes sense. But like, I mean, I don't, I don't like hate luminary,
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.980]  but like I don't think, okay,
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:11.180]  so I just to restate this in a slightly different way. Um,
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.660]  I was a really big podcast fan before I became a podcast as occupation guy in
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.300]  some way. And I know not everybody is,
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.460]  not everybody listens to anywhere near as many podcasts.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.740]  And the truth is that in the years after that, I got way, way more into it.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.380]  The medium started making more sense to me and all of its different varieties.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.020]  Um, but like I have to be honest, like, yeah,
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:37.540]  this is like a big part of like what I do for work and I hope that doesn't get
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.100]  screwed up. But I, I'm,
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:43.980]  I promise I'm not being cynical when I say I would just also really hate the
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:48.180]  idea that this screws up the shows that I enjoy the medium that I enjoy.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.300]  And the fact that like there are so many shows,
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.780]  I could suggest to you like six shows I've discovered like in the last couple
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:57.780]  months even that like you've just come along weird little independent shows that
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:59.860]  come along and it's always such a joy to me.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:01.620]  And I go back and my binge all their stuff.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.260]  And I'm not saying that's impossible with something like luminary,
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.580]  but I'll for damn sure tell you,
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.980]  I hope there's not 10 different companies trying to compete on this.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:11.580]  And I hope that their vision for what success looks like in the future takes
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:15.180]  into account some of the things that have made it special and made it good and
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.180]  have that that freedom in all its different ways has been so instrumental in how
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:25.180]  we got to where we are and made it interesting to the people who think they can
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:26.740]  make a different buck from it.
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.540]  Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I, I can't help but think, you know,
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:36.660]  and everybody keeps saying they want to be the Netflix of podcasts.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.620]  I just don't think there's a role for the Netflix of podcasts. Like I,
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:43.820]  I think it's a bad idea. Like I can't tell how much I it's because I'm,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.820]  there's already a Netflix for podcasts. It's podcasts. Yeah. It's, I mean,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.060]  in some ways, right. You know,
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:52.260]  it's like when MC when MC hammer announced he was going to make the YouTube of
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.420]  dance videos and somebody finally said, you know,
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.700]  there's already a YouTube of dance videos and it's called YouTube. Right.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.020]  I kind of feel, so what does he mean by that? Netflix?
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:05.980]  It means that like we're going to find a way to like bring in all most of the
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:09.300]  things, some of the things like make it a little bit more confusing. Like I,
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.940]  yeah, no, you're right that that is what they say. They,
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.460]  I think they mean that in terms of the market leader, the script,
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.900]  started out scrappy, became the market leader.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.820]  And now as somehow in Netflix's case,
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:23.460]  they've slid into be what the last one of the streaming services you would
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.980]  cancel. Probably for me, that's Hulu. But for a lot of people,
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:29.220]  that's absolutely Netflix. Like look at Facebook. I mean,
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.060]  how much money they make. I mean,
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.300]  Apple's a little easier to understand cause they sell devices, right? It's,
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:39.580]  it's a little bit easier to comprehend. Like this is a thousand dollar phone.
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:43.180]  This is a $2,000 laptop. You give us the money, we give you the device.
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.980]  Like Facebook doesn't make any, Google doesn't make anything.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:51.540]  It's all just ones and zeros flying around. And they, they make so,
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:54.300]  maybe a little under simplified, a little simplified, but yeah,
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:58.020]  I think the point manufacturer or anything. Well, but they just had,
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:02.660]  there's just a staggering amount of money to be made in doing what they do.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:05.500]  And I feel like the,
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.060]  they're just looking at podcasts and they're like, well, nobody is, you know,
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.540]  there's all sorts of people who are making a living on podcasts. I mean, I,
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:15.740]  I make half, half of my income from the show.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:19.260]  You are make a living from doing podcasts. Right.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.980]  And that is the scale that I tend to think of it as like,
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:27.340]  I would like to make enough money doing the show to have like a salary and,
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.540]  and, you know, support my family.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:33.820]  Whereas I feel like with luminary,
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:37.700]  somebody is coming in and saying, let's make a billion dollars on podcasts.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.500]  It almost feels like this is really bad and you can cut this out,
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:46.740]  but it's almost like somebody showed up in a in a dirt parking lot and like
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:50.380]  started painting lines and putting up parking meters like where there had been
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.980]  no charge before. And you're like, we're improving your parking experience.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.740]  Like now we've like normalized the width of all the spaces and like made it this
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.900]  way. And I realized that's a silly, silly example,
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:04.140]  but it feels like they're coming in and trying to put a meter on something that
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.300]  didn't have a meter before.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.620]  If you are the kind of show that like wants to have a Patreon feed or similar,
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.260]  or you're the kind of person like wants to move,
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.780]  like with the independence of that media, I hate making this about the money,
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:15.460]  but I guess that's what it kind of comes down to.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.060]  Like it would be nice to retain, if not the income,
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:22.100]  at least the control over what you do. You know, you can't control,
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:25.580]  it's the internet, you can control what people do with your stuff,
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.580]  but it's really hard to feel great about a VC funded way to like put parking
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.260]  meters, you know, in a dirt lot.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.900]  Speaking of parking meters in a dirt lot, uh,
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:39.100]  I'd like to take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show.
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:44.020]  Do you have a guess who it is? I think it's a square space.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.460]  It is square space. Oh, got it in one, one.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:50.540]  Can you believe it that you're good? Yeah.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:55.260]  Square space is the all in one platform for making a website.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.860]  Hey, what we're talking about here on this with the open internet,
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:02.820]  having your own control over your own presence online.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:07.060]  That's what square space can do for you. Your own website, your domain name,
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:11.140]  everything you need to do. Register a domain name, design the site,
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:15.220]  pick from a template to start with, customize it, add features,
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:20.220]  like a store if you need a store or add a catalog or a portfolio.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.380]  If you're a designer,
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:24.940]  it's almost like you don't want to say Legos cause that's a trademark, a Lego,
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:25.900]  Lego, sorry, Lego.
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.500]  But it's almost like that you snap together a website that easily and it's
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.180]  actually just, it's just gorgeous. Whatever it is you want to make,
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.420]  like whether that's going to be,
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:37.060]  whether it's a store or whether that's going to be a portfolio or any of that
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:40.340]  stuff, you're just dragging stuff around and suddenly you have a professional
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:44.060]  website. You can go just do your work like an adult and it's yours.
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:47.700]  You own yours. It's your place, all yours. Customize it the way you want.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.540]  Couldn't be easier when you need a website. Just remember,
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.660]  square space, go there.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.020]  You probably don't need one today as you're listening to the show,
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:00.380]  but keep it in the back of your head. And I always say this,
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.540]  I think it's very true.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:06.420]  I think the sort of person who listens to the talk show is the sort of person
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.820]  that the people in your life,
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:12.620]  people in your life, you, they come to you and they say, Hey, you're a nerd.
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.500]  I need a website. What should I do?
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:16.260]  Send them a square.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:20.100]  Time was you would get asked that and you'd end up being the webmaster.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.620]  Now you're the webmaster.
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.940]  Now you're a webmaster at whatever their domain is.com.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.620]  Remember that was the thing you'd have the web.
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:32.540]  I think that it was like a law, right? Or like the unofficial rule,
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:35.540]  part of some distro, but it seems like you could webmaster anybody.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.380]  You had to go somewhere. Every domain had to have a webmaster at domain,
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.380]  just like a,
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:46.420]  like a wizard with like a big pointy hat with moons on it and a book about
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.260]  pearls.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.700]  Do you remember having wildcards on your domains for you? Any, any email address,
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:57.420]  any email address you wanted to at your domain.com would go to your inbox.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.020]  I used, I used to do that.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.780]  And then I thought better of it when spam got to be a problem. But heck yeah,
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:04.540]  that asterisk was powerful. Anyway,
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.300]  you also sell the dough. You know, they sell the domain names.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:07.140]  Do you know about that?
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:13.260]  Everything soup to nuts. Squarespace has you covered. Here's where you go.

[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.140]  It's squarespace. Yeah. All right. Hey, what else do you want to talk about?
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.900]  I just want to know if you're feeling better. I'm feeling better.
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.660]  I'm feeling that you've cheered me up. I feel a little bit. I feel like I got my,
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.140]  uh, my legs back under me.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.140]  Do you think you think you might want to try and take a nap today?
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.620]  Oh yeah, definitely. Gonna take a nap. I think a nap is a, it's a sure thing.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:06.220]  But then on the other hand, see now we're right back at the beginning of the
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:08.660]  show. Now if I take a nap, will it screw up my sleep tonight?
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.300]  Right. Helps take a shorty helps tick. I mean,
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:17.500]  everybody's got their own zone for a good nap. Like for me, a three hour nap,
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.620]  not a great nap. No,
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:21.860]  that's terrible to wake up and there's a Chuck Norris on the movie on TBS and
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:26.020]  everything's dark. You slept too long, too long.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:31.020]  Um, but of course when you have a child that rarely happens because you know,
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.380]  my, uh, my daughter is a proud to say is fighting Gannon in Zelda right now.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:40.060]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. She got all the memories. She's good to go. And uh,
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.100]  she's fighting and she started last night. She's doing it today.
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:45.260]  She said this is literally the most important day of the year that she's had.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:48.300]  And uh, yeah, she's throwing it down. She's got beasts and stuff. I,
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.260]  I'm saying all of this phonetically.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:55.380]  I might as well be like reading off a menu in French, but, but it's Gannon,
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.100]  uh, and it's a big deal. It's a big deal. But yeah,
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.180]  sometimes they will come in and show you a memory or something or it could be a
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:03.820]  vine where someone falls down. But, uh, that,
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:07.580]  that has kept me from super long naps and I consider it a blessing,
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.620]  but you owe it to yourself. You've earned it. Yeah.
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:16.380]  By being down here in the podcast, coal mine. Uh,
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.100]  anything else? Are you excited about anything from WWDC that's coming up?
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.220]  A lot of rumors have already leaked.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.780]  Oh, dueling rumors. So much going on. What am I excited about? Uh,
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.580]  I hope you guys all have a great time. I hope it's fun for everybody.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:34.460]  It seems like that is like a huge piece of it is that it's really fun. Um,
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.980]  at a personal level, it is, it, we,
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:42.940]  I feel like we're settling into this San Jose era of WWDC is,
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.460]  but one of the things is I have friends such as you who live in the city of San
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:52.260]  Francisco and I, I don't really get to, I haven't seen you in a while.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.420]  Yeah. Because I don't really go to, I don't go to San Francisco anymore,
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.780]  but like, it sounds like it's been good. Like, uh, and I, I mean,
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.060]  I don't really go places anymore. Um, by and large,
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.060]  I wouldn't recommend coming down to San Jose.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:06.940]  Do you know how sick I would get if I left, if I left the house?
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:10.020]  Do you have any sense of that? It's just that there's just,
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.540]  there's so much out there. There's like,
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:16.420]  there's this children and animals and railings. There's so many railings.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:19.140]  I mean, those are just chock a block, which I haven't left the house in Maryland.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.740]  Isn't that? And that's, that's, that's amazing.
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:24.940]  You should maybe air filtration system. I don't know. Um,
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.540]  I'm excited for whatever comes next. I always enjoy the, um,
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.180]  seeing what the updates are, especially with the various OSS. Uh,
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.580]  I guess maybe in my case, I don't know, and I haven't followed this too closely,
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.540]  but like, um, I'm,
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:40.380]  I'm very intrigued to see what happens with iPad because that continues to
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:45.380]  be a thing that I, that I really love and enjoy seeing other people use.
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.820]  And I hope that continues to attract people, uh, to the Apple world. My,
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.580]  my watch does everything I need it to do. I like my Mac fine. Um, yeah, I don't,
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:58.820]  I don't know. I don't have anything huge, but like, I do follow it, you know,
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:04.020]  my Apple TV, I watch the stuff when it's happening and it's an exciting time.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:07.380]  I'm yeah, I'm still, I'm still, I'm still there for Apple.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:12.740]  Yeah. I feel like above and beyond any specific rumors of a specific feature or
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:16.980]  a specific new app or something like that, just the basic story of,
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.500]  Hey, this is the year where Apple's getting serious about making real
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:25.580]  improvements to the iPad so that it's more of a computer and less of a
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:30.860]  big phone. Uh, I, there's gotta be some, I, um,
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:35.260]  I got a, my bridge shipped yesterday. So I'm looking forward to,
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.020]  that's the, uh, the,
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:43.020]  the keyboard that looks like a Mac book pro keyboard and you can put your iPad
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.260]  in it.
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:47.540]  Wow. Uh, and I got, I forgot it for the big boy. Um,
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:50.300]  so I'm looking forward to playing with that. But yeah, yeah, like you were,
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.540]  you know, it's funny cause like of course people like to like to rib folks like
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:54.220]  you and me about this,
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:58.620]  but like when you said that thing the other day on Twitter about every time you
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:02.860]  go to do command space on iPad keyboard, like, um,
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:04.100]  you always like start,
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:07.580]  you start typing and it always misses the first letters. I mean,
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:11.100]  so glass half full glass half empty the glass half empties. Oh my God,
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.940]  that's so frustrating. That always, always, always seems to happen.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:18.540]  Is it latency? Am I typing just too aggressively? But glass half full,
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:19.980]  man, if there's,
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:25.180]  that just shows you how much you've stopped thinking about it in some ways as a
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.460]  thing that you manipulate with your meaty little fingers.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.620]  Like the fact that we were both disappointed that that doesn't happen faster.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.500]  They can fix that. They can absolutely fix that.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.500]  What they've done though is get me out of the idea is that this is,
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:39.660]  this is a thing that I'm going to stream project runway on like alone.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.900]  There's other stuff that you can like seriously.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:46.380]  So for anybody who didn't see my tweet and it's one of those things where
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.460]  I don't know if I should have turned it into a full article.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:53.780]  I don't know if it's worth it. Is it, is it just a tweet link thought? It,
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:54.740]  it seems bad,
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:59.700]  but there's the spotlight feature and you hit command space and which is the key
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.660]  to the kingdom, right? Command space.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:04.260]  That's the thing is cause you do get an app switcher, which is great.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:05.180]  Sorry to interrupt. I did it again.
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:09.100]  But like the app, which is great. But the thing is you are just a tick,
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:12.940]  tick, tick away from opening any app. You don't have to go hit the screen.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.300]  You don't have to go find it.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.540]  You're using typing to find whatever it is, typing,
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:20.220]  little typing with a keyboard to find anything.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:24.260]  And that becomes the key that unlocks all the doors for turning this thing into
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.340]  such a great machine.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:29.060]  And I, you know, for example, I might just want to, I don't know where I am.
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.380]  Maybe I'm in a Twitter app, maybe I'm in the email app,
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:35.700]  but I just want to jump over to safari and I type command space and I type S a
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:40.180]  F and it all happens very fast. And what happens on the iPad with,
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:43.580]  with, uh, with a physical keyboard connected,
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:47.340]  like a Bluetooth keyboard, what happens every single time is that,
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:51.180]  that the S gets eaten because it's,
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:55.140]  it doesn't listen for keyboard input until the animation is done.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:59.340]  So that's what it is. Yeah. It's the, it, it's not listening to,
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:03.660]  it's not taking input while, while it's animating the spotlight interface.
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:05.660]  And so I'll tell you,
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:09.900]  but I can't help it because I use the Mac all the time and on the Mac there is
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:10.980]  no, there's no lag.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:13.660]  So lunch bar or like just lights light up.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:18.100]  I can't, but then every, but then it's like whatever AF is like a couple of
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:21.500]  people use safari as the example. And then, you know, like if you have like,
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.100]  I forget what comes up for me with AF it's, it's, uh, something random.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.460]  Something random. But if you have like affinity designer or something like that,
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.580]  it just launches. Yeah. Well, if you spell something almost right,
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.380]  it'll find it. Like if you misspell Twitter, it will still find it pretty easily.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:40.860]  But I think it keys very heavily on those first letters. Yeah. And it just,
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.580]  anyway, but I have very good news though for you. Very good news. I,
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:49.740]  since tweeting that I heard from a trusted little birdie that this will be,
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.140]  that, that,
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:55.860]  that bug will be fixed in a forthcoming update to iOS.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.900]  Wow. You're like, you're like Varis. You just,
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.540]  you come and you bring all the secrets from all the kingdoms. That's so good.
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:03.340]  See, I would have guessed, I'm guessing in that case,
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:06.420]  like reduce motions not going to make a difference because it's kind of an
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:11.220]  necessary, no, it's just not listening to input when it does it. I don't,
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.660]  some people, and then it's funny cause you,
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:16.340]  you can't do anything on the internet without getting yelled at.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:19.340]  But then people are, people are telling me it was that it's,
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.100]  I'm a dummy cause it's Bluetooth lag. They're like,
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:25.860]  you're using a Bluetooth keyboard. That's why what is wrong with you? Well,
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:29.900]  and why are you so stupid? But I, it really does, you know,
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.700]  like it really makes me wonder,
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.780]  it makes me question everything in my life where people are telling me that
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:41.100]  it's Bluetooth lag when I know it's not Bluetooth lag and then they're telling
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:45.260]  me that's why Apple makes the smart keyboard cover so that there's a keyboard
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:49.340]  with no Bluetooth lag and that that's what I should use instead.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.740]  Uh, what do you, what do you use? Like what is it? What is a PS four controller?
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:59.140]  Bluetooth. Honestly, I'm asking it's, I feel like it might be Bluetooth.
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.740]  Yeah, it's Bluetooth. There is, there's not lag.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.980]  Pretty responsive to moving around. Well, no,
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:08.620]  here's the thing that is so confounding to me about this argument is that the
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:13.820]  only way you get into the situation where you're typing a spotlight search is
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:17.420]  that you've already hit something on your key. Mm hmm.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:21.940]  You've hit the command space. So it's obviously listening to your keyboard already,
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:26.620]  right? It can't be latency. Yes. Right. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, no, no. Yeah,
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:31.220]  you're right. Otherwise, so if that were the case, theoretically,
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:36.540]  you would hit command space and the pause, right? It would be a different,
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:41.140]  it would be a different pause, right? Yeah. It might, it's a very,
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:44.460]  it's just a bug. It is a bug. There's no, you know,
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:49.460]  but sometimes you get into these people who want to see like Apple does no
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:54.860]  wrong. Uh, you know, and it,
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:57.900]  once you go down that rabbit hole, it is,
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:01.980]  it really makes you want to reach out and strangle somebody. Oh,
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:04.700]  you're, because you're being disloyal, right? You're a hate.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:08.620]  Are you a hater at that point? And that's a hater. I guess. I don't know.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:12.540]  But anyway, they're going to fix it. I'm excited. I'll be around.
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:16.740]  I'll be checking it out. Have a, have a, have a, have a wonderful time. And listen,
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:18.180]  when you come here, drink a lot of water,
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:21.180]  wash your hands and try to get a lot of sleep. Really?
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:23.740]  We're going to really wash them more than you think. Like sing a song.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.060]  Like it could be a Tom Petty song. It could be a Weezer song,
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.660]  whatever you want to sing, but like sing,
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:31.460]  slowly sing the bridge from a song. You know what I'm saying?
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:35.380]  Really get in there. Nails too. I get the nail beds, those little bugs.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.900]  I'll tell you, Marilyn, it's, it really did cheer me up talking to you.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.460]  You're a good friend. I don't feel like we do this enough.
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:42.940]  Maybe I ask you to, I don't know.
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:46.100]  Maybe I ask you too many times to do my show. I don't know. But I, it, it.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.380]  That's like eating a bowl of sugar. You know, it's fun for a minute,
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:55:12.380]  but you wouldn't want to do it all year.
