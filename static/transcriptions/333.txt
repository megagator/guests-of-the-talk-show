[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  I guess it's a tradition. I don't know how many years now we've been doing the year in review together
[00:05.040 --> 00:07.440]  Forever apple. It's just been forever forever forever
[00:08.160 --> 00:12.960]  It well, it feels everything feels like forever now, right? It's like we're at the end of covid season two
[00:13.760 --> 00:17.280]  Yeah, 2020 junior or is it 2020 resurrected? I forget what they went with
[00:17.680 --> 00:21.600]  There's a very strong sense of deja vu with everything going to hell
[00:22.400 --> 00:28.880]  Uh, yeah, and i'm just hoping that css's big announcement isn't uh the omega variant if they decide not to unveil that
[00:28.880 --> 00:31.280]  I'll be very happy this year. It's just uh
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.320]  Speaking with uh deeter bone and I was like you guys aren't going are you and he's like, oh no
[00:36.320 --> 00:38.320]  We canceled first like they were like
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.640]  But like they didn't announce it early because they wanted to you know, tell all their partners and and stuff
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.440]  but you know, they saw this coming a while ago, but it is kind of sad because I feel like
[00:50.240 --> 00:51.840]  six months ago
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.800]  Ces was looking like hey this, you know, this all might work out. I don't blame them for trying
[00:56.800 --> 01:00.080]  I wouldn't want to be the one to pull the trigger and tell everybody to
[01:00.560 --> 01:03.600]  Cancel, but boy they should it feels like they should cancel
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.200]  I mean if you just want to sit in your room at aria and eat steak for a week
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.200]  You can get the best deal in the world
[01:12.800 --> 01:14.560]  I do I
[01:14.560 --> 01:15.680]  it just
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.420]  You know and I am not a a particularly
[01:19.200 --> 01:25.200]  Covid phobic person at this point fully vaxed my family vaxed everybody boosted
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.800]  but
[01:26.800 --> 01:28.880]  You don't have to be particularly
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.840]  Worried or fearful of it to put your finger in the air see which way the wind is blowing and say hey
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.640]  Maybe we should not have a major conference with people from all over the world
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.520]  Yeah, and it's not just that I mean like we we did not get our booster shot shit together at all
[01:46.080 --> 01:47.760]  So we're locked down again
[01:47.760 --> 01:48.560]  Which is what it is
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.720]  But there's just so many people who are out and so many resources that are stretched thin
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.480]  That there's no buffer for anything like there's just nothing else that can go wrong for any of these events and their emergency staff
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.960]  And like having that many people there it's going to go wrong. So it just seems smart to
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.400]  Air on the side of caution. Yeah, I don't want to do a whole covid segment here
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.920]  But I I feel very strongly that counting cases is no longer the way to go
[02:11.920 --> 02:15.200]  It's it's a it's an interesting number. It should be one of the statistics but
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.440]  People are so much more willing to get tested and testing
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.040]  Yes, even though home test kits are extremely I don't know about up there
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.200]  But here there it's you can't get them which sucks and and it's a huge
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.320]  Own goal, you know that that we sort of put all of our
[02:34.320 --> 02:41.440]  All of our chips on vaccines, you know, the testing should have been up there but home tests don't count towards the test numbers
[02:41.440 --> 02:45.840]  Anyway, right like so in other words when local governments or whatever governments report
[02:45.840 --> 02:53.040]  You know case numbers that doesn't include home tests anyway, but cases isn't what to test or isn't what to look at
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.320]  It's hospitalizations and deaths, of course and and you look at the hospitals and around here
[02:58.320 --> 03:05.040]  It is really getting worrisomely full and there's other places where it's stuff to the gills and and to me that's that's you know
[03:05.040 --> 03:07.440]  I mean, it's just common sense if the hospitals are full
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.720]  We don't have room for more people to get sick. So take it and any kind of sick. That's the thing
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.320]  It's like it's like don't go out and get hit by a car either because like it's gonna be real hard to get a bed
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.000]  Right again. I don't want to do a whole covid segment, but it's super super frustrating for people who are vaccinated have done everything
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.520]  Right and and have some other any other kind of illness or accident, you know
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.800]  You you slip and fall and and and need emergency room care for your ankle or something like that
[03:33.440 --> 03:40.560]  And the whole goddamn place is full of people who are unvaccinated full of covid and to tie it in like I just watched apple store closings
[03:40.560 --> 03:43.680]  If the apple store in my area closes, I stay home. Yeah, that's what I do
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.440]  I think it was josh centers from tidbits who pegged this, you know year ago, you know
[03:49.440 --> 03:52.320]  sometime at 20 in that great blur of 2020 that
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.040]  Apple store closings were a reasonable metric for for what's going on because
[03:57.600 --> 04:03.840]  Apple is you know, I don't know if you've heard this but you know, they're a very successful company at making money
[04:04.400 --> 04:06.400]  And they're logistically apt right?
[04:06.400 --> 04:13.920]  Right. So apple store closures have been a pretty good barometer for what's going on because they want to have the stores open
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.680]  Because they yes, they want to make money. They want to make money and they want to sell things to people but they're also
[04:20.320 --> 04:23.120]  I think you know, and I know that there's a lot of complaints
[04:24.640 --> 04:26.640]  About the overall
[04:27.200 --> 04:28.400]  Retail
[04:28.400 --> 04:33.840]  Employment satisfaction in apple retail, but overall there I think they've done a pretty good job at
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.320]  Not trying to keep stores open when they shouldn't be open for covid throughout this whole thing
[04:39.040 --> 04:45.440]  And yeah, there's an awful lot of store closures. So good luck to everybody. Stay safe. Have your new year's inside
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.160]  Alone listening to this show. I mean, yeah
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.360]  What could be better for new year's eve
[04:51.600 --> 04:58.960]  Anyway, what we do every year renee and I we go through the year look back at the apple year in review
[04:58.960 --> 05:03.220]  So let's get started, right? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, january
[05:03.680 --> 05:09.120]  Here's what we've got. John turnis became senior vice president of hardware. Dan regio. Yeah
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.960]  Took over vr and ar I guess hardware right because mike rockwell, of course still leads the the software effort there
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.960]  Yeah, I think apple has a sort of policy where every major product has to have a senior vice president level
[05:22.960 --> 05:29.840]  Owner like, you know, like jeff williams famously owns the apple watch even though kevin lynch makes the software and there's hardware leads and all those
[05:29.840 --> 05:34.640]  but there has to be someone on the executive team that owns it and
[05:35.600 --> 05:40.080]  It was dan regio was one of the owner like he owns a ton of stuff because just he's good at it
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.820]  And he ships iphones every year on the year, which is one of the biggest achievements in consumer electronics
[05:45.040 --> 05:48.720]  But they wanted him to focus on this. So john turnis who's also terrific
[05:48.720 --> 05:54.800]  And has been taken over the iphone and he's been announcing you've seen him on stage now for the ipad pro for the m1 max
[05:55.120 --> 05:59.760]  He's now doing the big hardware job and dan is focusing on vr
[05:59.760 --> 06:03.600]  Which to me is just one of those signposts on the way to it becoming a real product
[06:04.160 --> 06:06.160]  Yeah, it seems well it seems like
[06:06.800 --> 06:13.040]  To clarify what you just said which I agree with but it seems like what apple really does is for new products
[06:13.280 --> 06:16.160]  They put some of the products that they're going to be able to use
[06:16.160 --> 06:22.980]  For new products they put somebody in charge of so turnis is in charge of quote unquote hardware
[06:23.520 --> 06:29.440]  But that more or less means like existing hardware platforms that have sort of stabilized, right?
[06:29.920 --> 06:33.040]  You know, you know mac ipad iphone
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.360]  those sort of things
[06:35.360 --> 06:39.380]  And you know in the same way that when watch was a new initiative
[06:40.160 --> 06:43.360]  jeff williams was in charge of it and now it uh
[06:43.360 --> 06:49.360]  Riccio is in charge. Do we know that though? I mean that he's in charge of ar vr. Did they say that?
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.800]  I don't think apple said that I think that's just been widely reported because he didn't leave apple. It's sort of like when um,
[06:55.680 --> 07:00.880]  When they like john g and andrea now, uh, he's taken over titan, you know
[07:00.880 --> 07:05.760]  It was previously mansfield had come back for it famously and those are just sort of the comings and goings that people
[07:06.400 --> 07:08.800]  People read the criminology behind that right?
[07:08.800 --> 07:14.080]  but it's and he and as far as we know and you know, german is our our
[07:14.640 --> 07:19.520]  Our peephole into apple's internal structures riccio has not gone to project titan
[07:20.160 --> 07:26.240]  And therefore it's sort of like whatever's left must be it and we know that's the ar vr
[07:26.800 --> 07:31.520]  Efforts. Yeah. Yeah, and it's it does feel like we're getting we're getting closer to that this year
[07:31.520 --> 07:34.080]  Like when you look at competing products, they're more
[07:34.080 --> 07:38.320]  Uh, they're more reaching that part where apple doesn't really like the early adopter phase
[07:38.720 --> 07:42.560]  They like when they start just becoming bridging over to mainstream adoption
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.600]  And that seems when you look at what's selling over this year
[07:46.160 --> 07:52.960]  Especially things like facebook's quest 2 how popular those things are becoming that it's it's getting to the point where apple usually enters a market
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.120]  Yeah, I saw today
[07:55.120 --> 08:02.000]  Which I know is not 11 months ago. But today somebody, you know, I think it was cnbc said that the number one
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.080]  App in apple's app store the day after christmas was the oculus app, you know implying
[08:08.720 --> 08:13.360]  That enough people got uh with what's now called the quest 2, right?
[08:13.920 --> 08:21.440]  Yeah, is that right the quest 2 is what used to be called the oculus enough people got it for christmas that downloads of the ios
[08:21.520 --> 08:24.000]  App to whatever with it
[08:24.720 --> 08:27.680]  Promoted the app to number one. I don't think it's a big number though
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.400]  It is there's something to be said for the fact that it is the end of 2021 and you still cannot go into a store
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.480]  And find a playstation 5 or a gpu or an xbox series x and facebook is just flooding the market with
[08:38.640 --> 08:44.960]  I think pretty much at cost quests. So it's a huge distortion field but but people are starting to look at them as like mainstream products
[08:45.840 --> 08:48.800]  jonas got a ps5 for christmas and
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.440]  He's been very very happy with it ever since he's he's up there playing it now
[08:53.440 --> 09:00.480]  He's up there playing it now, but my wife took care of procuring it. She's much better at such things than me because
[09:01.280 --> 09:06.480]  Well, she's she really is good at finding things that are hard to get and she's not a procrastinator like me
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.880]  But I asked her I was like, how did you you know what you have to pay? How'd you get this? She's like don't ask
[09:11.360 --> 09:12.720]  Yes
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.640]  I was like, all right, fine
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.120]  You have to either invest a lot of money or a lot of time into getting a playstation 5 at this point still same with
[09:19.120 --> 09:25.120]  A gpu. Have you seen one? Have you played with a ps5? I have not I have not i've seen the xbox
[09:25.280 --> 09:26.000]  um
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.960]  And i've managed to get I managed to get a gpu and actually get one of the new nvidia cards by buying a whole entire
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.120]  Pre-built computer the only way I could get one without paying exorbitant prices for it
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.120]  Yeah, jonas and I have been talking about that and looking at it and uh, yeah
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.160]  He said the same thing that you got it. You kind of got to get a whole computer and it might be worth it
[09:44.560 --> 09:47.520]  Then the neatest thing I am not a gamer. It's
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.640]  It's it's I don't anticipate really playing ps5 much, but I am fascinated by it
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.220]  I like I like the design it is a sort of a big box, but the thing that fascinates me are the controllers
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.800]  They're effectively they're standalone devices and with comp, you know, they they're standalone computers, right? It is
[10:07.520 --> 10:09.360]  sort of
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.000]  The overall arc of everything has been going towards everything is becoming its own computer, right?
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.720]  And in the same way that like your air pods are each standalone computers
[10:19.120 --> 10:25.280]  Yeah, the and maybe this was true for ps4 controllers to some degree. I don't think so though, but there's like
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.860]  They have they clearly have their own accelerometers
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.440]  Yeah, and the very neatest thing that they do is the trigger buttons
[10:34.080 --> 10:40.260]  Have a lot of pull there's a lot of uh distance that you can pull them in and when they're connected
[10:41.120 --> 10:43.120]  the software can give them
[10:43.120 --> 10:45.120]  Dynamic resistance
[10:45.360 --> 10:53.040]  So like you can press them and it's like pressing a gas pedal where you get more resistance the more you press or it could be
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.800]  Something like at a certain point you get some resistance and then when you push past it
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.800]  It's like a burst, you know, you feel like this tremendous haptic feedback. It's long story short. It is
[11:05.440 --> 11:08.720]  The the most interesting haptic device I have ever
[11:08.720 --> 11:15.040]  Ever experienced it. Yeah, it's interesting because like when when apple announced 3d touch, uh, nintendo announced the
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.040]  They had those demos where they were showing the wiimotes. Uh, maybe it wasn't the wiimotes
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.320]  Maybe it was already the switch controllers pouring like making it feel like you were pouring ice into a glass
[11:24.480 --> 11:31.440]  And there was this whole optimism around tactile interfaces that sort of just disappeared until so he started demonstrating these controllers
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.720]  Yeah, yeah, jonas has the new spider-man game and said it's awesome for the web shooters because it's
[11:36.720 --> 11:39.280]  It once you get used to it. He said it's really really cool
[11:39.280 --> 11:46.560]  Well, a tiny pole is a short web and a long pole is long web, but you get this haptic feedback that makes it feel
[11:47.280 --> 11:50.800]  Like you don't have to think about it. It feels very natural
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.320]  So anyway, that's pretty cool and I don't know if you saw it and I have so many things I can say about tim epic
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.600]  Uh that I won't go into right now, but that demo for the unreal engine 5. Oh, yeah matrix demo they made
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.800]  Yeah, that starts to make me interested in that next generation of gameplay
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.520]  Oh, absolutely, but I also think that that demo uh gets to
[12:12.320 --> 12:17.600]  Sort of my takeaway with unity's purchase of weta digital
[12:18.240 --> 12:20.240]  which is the
[12:20.460 --> 12:26.000]  Confluence of real-time graphics and and scenery being produced by game engines
[12:26.800 --> 12:28.400]  and
[12:28.400 --> 12:35.040]  Movie special effects which are obviously take a long time and I I know you know, it's not exactly the same thing
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.240]  And that movies are always going to press the limit and because they can
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.640]  Do things not in real time, but you could obviously
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.000]  uh
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.800]  Do the final render and take you know, as however long you want to render every frame
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.360]  But it's getting to the point where you could do
[12:51.360 --> 12:58.720]  Well, let's just fill this in for now in real time and do incredibly dynamic stuff. It's it's really impressive
[12:58.880 --> 13:01.680]  It's really like famously, uh, ilm is the volume
[13:01.680 --> 13:07.360]  I think they use for the mandalorian and other shows where it's all these walls full of lcd's that are run by unreal engine
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.840]  And I think the small one I forget what the small one's called walnut or something where you can just do it around somebody's head
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.720]  And that that mixes real time with classical special effects and that just seems to be the future
[13:16.720 --> 13:23.280]  Yeah, it's really you know, and it just think about like, you know, uh, the way photography has evolved, right?
[13:23.280 --> 13:27.840]  Like just you know in the film era you'd take pictures hope they were exposed properly
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.080]  then you know just take them into a dark room and develop them and
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.000]  See what they looked like and hope they were the best and now, you know in the digital era everybody
[13:38.480 --> 13:40.640]  Can see their photos as you go
[13:41.280 --> 13:43.280]  It's the same sort of thing with
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.040]  Vfx and this sort of thing where you you know, if you can do anything in real time as you do it you just get
[13:49.600 --> 13:54.880]  It's like you're you can play with it live and say oh, why don't we you know change the focal length on this?
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.520]  why don't we instead of swooping the camera and why don't we do something more subtle and just
[14:00.320 --> 14:02.880]  Place the camera here. You could do all sorts of stuff as you go
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.960]  yeah, even apples, you know apple because of their silicon can do so much real time in the camera that nobody else can do and
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.400]  That nobody else can do and now that we have basically effectively pro res on those camera systems
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.920]  You can fix almost any problem and cinematic mode lets you change the focal point
[14:20.560 --> 14:22.560]  While you're doing it after you're doing it
[14:22.960 --> 14:28.160]  It's an unbelievable shift in technology that I think we don't appreciate always because it happens
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.160]  So step by step we went from like portrait mode to cinematic mode and it's going to get better
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.440]  But it's a huge shift from what you said like just shooting on film. Yeah. Yeah, and that is a good example
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.520]  You know apple's insistence the camera team's insistence that whatever they do they do live
[14:42.160 --> 14:43.760]  in the viewfinder
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.480]  It sort of speaks to the mentality of being able to render vfx live and in real time
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.280]  Yeah, well like the what I forget the app i'm blanking on the app of that the the app they publish separately
[14:55.280 --> 14:57.280]  That lets you swap out backgrounds
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.080]  It is unbelievable what you can do in that app now you can replace whole backgrounds with interactive dynamic settings and augmented reality
[15:04.720 --> 15:06.080]  and
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.220]  It looks like you're in a mini hollywood studio. It's just beyond fantastic
[15:10.080 --> 15:12.240]  So let's uh, let's move on february
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.200]  Ios 14.5. This is my there wasn't much in february, but this to me
[15:18.160 --> 15:25.120]  Is has been and going back to our previous statement that we're now, you know in the midst of another covid surge
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.600]  It's worth the effort. It wasn't like hey
[15:27.600 --> 15:35.680]  A little too late. Everything's coming up sunny. So it's why even bother shipping but ios 14.5 in february shipped with
[15:36.560 --> 15:44.480]  What has become quite literally I mean this sincerely my very favorite apple watch feature which is that you can unlock your phone
[15:45.280 --> 15:46.560]  your iphone
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.000]  While wearing an apple watch while you're wearing a face mask
[15:50.560 --> 15:53.840]  Yeah, and it's more complicated than it appears because and a lot of people just said well
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.360]  Why can't you do this to begin with but they originally set it up so that the iphone unlocks the apple watch?
[15:59.520 --> 16:02.320]  Because they figured entering your passcode on a watch would be annoying
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.640]  And so making it do both is a huge security problem because there are so many intrusions that could happen
[16:08.880 --> 16:12.500]  When you don't have this known state of one unlocks the other suddenly they go bi-directionally
[16:13.120 --> 16:17.060]  And they were smart because they made it incredibly dependent on very specific conditions
[16:17.360 --> 16:22.800]  And they also did things like if if it unlocks but then it moves far enough away as though someone's trying to steal it
[16:22.800 --> 16:27.120]  It'll just automatically relock. So there was a huge amount of things they had to think through but like you
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.200]  It's almost transparent to me at this point
[16:29.600 --> 16:31.600]  it it really is and
[16:32.320 --> 16:33.600]  You know
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.880]  Now that we're back. I mean for months now. I mean we had like a brief brief respite
[16:39.520 --> 16:41.520]  during july
[16:41.600 --> 16:44.240]  You know mid june to the last or so
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.560]  We're you know, our philadelphia lifted our citywide mask mandate and it was so nice especially in the hot weather. I mean
[16:50.560 --> 16:52.400]  And but we never lost ours
[16:52.400 --> 16:53.840]  We've had ours for almost now
[16:53.840 --> 17:00.720]  We had we had no masks for a while and the covid rate was ridiculously low and it all seemed well advised and now we're back
[17:00.800 --> 17:02.000]  to masks
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.040]  and
[17:03.040 --> 17:05.040]  I actually went out
[17:05.040 --> 17:07.840]  Just the other day because I didn't think I was going to run any errands
[17:07.840 --> 17:14.340]  I was wearing one of my mechanical watches and forgot to put my apple watch on before I left to get some groceries
[17:15.280 --> 17:17.200]  and
[17:17.200 --> 17:22.080]  I didn't need to use my phone much. I was listening to podcasts. So it you know, you can do all of that from uh,
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.280]  From the lock screen, but I I wanted to do something and I was like, oh my god
[17:27.280 --> 17:29.760]  I forgot what a huge pain in the ass. This was
[17:30.320 --> 17:32.320]  For like an entire year
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.720]  And and I mean it it is my single very favorite feature of apple watch and it's kind of a sign
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.520]  It's always a good sign for a platform as it is such a broad
[17:43.520 --> 17:48.640]  Stroke that i'm about to say but it to me. It's always good when there's good new features
[17:49.360 --> 17:56.400]  For a platform that were never envisioned when the platform was created, right? Like the mac was not created
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.960]  with entirely
[17:59.360 --> 18:03.200]  Revolutionizing the publishing and desktop publishing industries
[18:03.760 --> 18:09.280]  But the fact that it did was a sign of the strength of the platform like apple watch was not created with hey
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.400]  In case there's ever a pandemic and everybody has to wear a face mask whenever they're out in public indoors
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.760]  It would be cool if you could use the watch as an authentication source to unlock the phone
[18:20.960 --> 18:27.280]  Yeah was not envisioned but yeah because the whole security works off having three point like it needs both eyes and the nose to get
[18:27.280 --> 18:33.440]  sufficient facial geometry to actually authenticate you it'd be like only getting of the top part of your fingerprint
[18:33.440 --> 18:36.720]  It just doesn't have enough information to securely understand that it's you
[18:36.720 --> 18:41.200]  So now when you're attempting to face id it sees it can't get the other part of the geometry
[18:41.360 --> 18:44.960]  So it throws it over to the watch and if the watch is there it verifies and comes back
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.520]  So it maintains a good level of security while giving you back a good amount of convenience
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.120]  Which is always that huge war between the two overall it still is
[18:53.760 --> 19:00.720]  Poorly timed for the face id era that two two years of the face id era have been
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.360]  During the covid and the face masking, right? So we had the iphone 10 year
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.120]  the 10s year
[19:10.320 --> 19:11.760]  the
[19:11.760 --> 19:13.200]  iphone
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.180]  beginning of the 11 11 that was late 2019
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.640]  12
[19:18.640 --> 19:24.880]  So four years about two of the four years have been face mascara and it also sucks to say
[19:24.960 --> 19:32.240]  Well, the answer is to buy a 400 digital watch right on top of your this or an iphone se instead of an iphone
[19:32.480 --> 19:34.480]  right, you know, but it's
[19:34.480 --> 19:35.760]  uh
[19:35.760 --> 19:42.960]  You know, it's unfortunate and it's but it's it really has made a tremendous tremendous difference in just daily hassle
[19:42.960 --> 19:45.040]  It really makes it as invisible as face id
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.160]  I think apple doesn't parts been there like a lot of companies parts been their phones like they just put it together over what?
[19:50.160 --> 19:53.200]  They have at hand and they ship it as a new model and apple doesn't do that
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.720]  Every phone they make is two or three years of effort
[19:56.960 --> 20:01.040]  So the phones that they've been putting out these last two years they were completely planned before
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.520]  This whole like I know rumors make it sound like apple's still making up their mind about everything the day before it ships
[20:05.600 --> 20:09.760]  But it doesn't work that way at all. They were committed to all of these products years ago
[20:09.920 --> 20:16.640]  And we're not going to see the the post-covid apple for another year or so. Yeah, and you know, let's it's fingers crossed knock on wood
[20:16.720 --> 20:19.920]  It's hope that uh, covid really does sort of fade away
[20:19.920 --> 20:24.320]  I don't think it's going to disappear. But let's say it fades away and becomes sort of a background part of our lives
[20:24.880 --> 20:27.280]  This is a good feature going forward anyway
[20:27.280 --> 20:34.240]  Because I have at least one regular df reader who is I believe he's a surgeon but he definitely works in a hospital
[20:34.720 --> 20:40.960]  And he you know has been a thoughtful emailer to me over the years and when the iphone 10 first came out
[20:41.200 --> 20:45.840]  Wrote me a really nice email and said this really sucks for me because I spend an awful lot of my day with
[20:46.160 --> 20:49.280]  A surgical mask on and I cannot unlock my phone
[20:49.760 --> 20:52.720]  I'm, pretty sure he can wear a watch probably can't wear a watch while he's in surgery
[20:52.720 --> 20:57.360]  but there's a lot of the day where he can, you know, there are a lot of medical professionals who even when
[20:58.080 --> 21:05.680]  Before covid and let's say after covid fades into the background have to wear a mask during the day and this feature will keep working
[21:06.240 --> 21:12.340]  Yeah, well, you know my dream is that they just get their crap together and they have enough from voice identification facial geometry
[21:12.640 --> 21:16.880]  Touch identification gate analysis that they can just keep our phone unlocked if they're fairly certain
[21:16.880 --> 21:21.120]  It's us and then only challenge us if they really i'm tired of being forced to activate my own phone. John
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.120]  That should be the phone's job. I'm too late
[21:24.480 --> 21:28.080]  I wonder too if the face id team has you know
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.400]  over the last two years been working on just letting face id work while you wear a mask right because
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.960]  yeah as a
[21:36.960 --> 21:37.920]  just
[21:37.920 --> 21:43.120]  Without getting I have no idea how face id actually works other than the very very basics, right?
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.920]  Like I certainly don't understand the engineering of it at all. I'm sure it's quite complicated, you know
[21:48.160 --> 21:50.240]  And it's been out for five years. We we
[21:50.240 --> 21:52.240]  Everybody seems to still treat it as
[21:52.880 --> 21:54.960]  Probably more secure than touch id
[21:55.840 --> 21:57.840]  so they've done a good job, but
[21:58.400 --> 22:00.400]  it just
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.400]  as a reasonable
[22:03.040 --> 22:10.160]  Ballpark idea if a human being can recognize another human being while they're wearing a mask like if I can tell
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.280]  Hey, that's my wife amy while she's wearing a mask
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.240]  In theory a computer could do it too, right?
[22:16.240 --> 22:20.420]  It's it's they're not lowest laying though. They you put on a pair of glasses and suddenly they can't tell you're superman
[22:21.040 --> 22:24.880]  So in theory face id could just work on its own with a mask
[22:24.960 --> 22:28.960]  It's just that the implementations and and I think right down to the sensors
[22:29.040 --> 22:33.600]  I think it's not just software but down to hardware are based on seeing
[22:34.240 --> 22:40.320]  Everything from your eyes to the mouth, you know, yeah, if not the chin and the shape of your chin and stuff like that
[22:40.960 --> 22:42.560]  so it would take a
[22:42.560 --> 22:48.880]  A rejiggering but it's probably not at this point. I don't think it would be a wasted effort. I really don't no
[22:48.960 --> 22:52.240]  It's just it's getting enough data. Like it's it's having enough points of a fingerprint
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.240]  It's getting enough points of facial geometry
[22:54.320 --> 22:59.120]  That the adversarial because the whole thing is you don't want to let people in who aren't you but you don't want to stop you
[22:59.120 --> 23:06.260]  From getting in and the way adversarial neural networks work is you basically have like a batman network that is in charge of protecting
[23:06.260 --> 23:12.100]  Uh the device and you have a joker network that's in charge of penetrating the device and that trains the batman
[23:12.740 --> 23:15.060]  algorithm to better and better defend it and
[23:15.700 --> 23:20.900]  Your face can change and it allows for a large amount of change and it it keeps updating the data points over time
[23:21.060 --> 23:24.900]  But once you start covering a large portion of your head, there's just not enough data
[23:24.900 --> 23:26.900]  It's like having half a fingerprint
[23:26.900 --> 23:30.820]  So they'd have to sort of figure out another way to get enough data that it'd be secure enough to keep
[23:31.220 --> 23:33.220]  People out otherwise the same people would be like, okay
[23:33.220 --> 23:36.820]  Now it's fraternal twins as well as identical twins. They can get into it and then it's all a problem, right?
[23:36.900 --> 23:39.620]  But they did, you know, and then when they first announced it they said things like hey
[23:39.700 --> 23:44.580]  Sometimes you wear glasses. Sometimes you don't you might have a beard. You might shave your beard. You might grow a beard
[23:45.220 --> 23:50.820]  Etc and so forth and they anticipated those things. It'd be interesting if they if face masks are on that list
[23:50.820 --> 23:52.980]  It works on dow rempel. It should work on face masks. Yeah
[23:53.540 --> 24:00.740]  Because I also think again even in the optimistic scenario where covid fades into the background one thing I think has permanently changed
[24:00.740 --> 24:04.820]  Here in the west is the sort of stigma
[24:05.540 --> 24:12.260]  Not even sort of the actual stigma that we have had against public face mask wearing pre-covid. I think that's forever gone
[24:12.340 --> 24:19.060]  I think even if in the ideal situation where covid literally just fades away over the next two three years
[24:19.620 --> 24:26.020]  I think we've forever broken that stigma and that when cold and flu season hits people will go out and
[24:26.020 --> 24:30.500]  Whether it's to protect themselves or because they feel like they have a sniffle or something like that
[24:30.820 --> 24:38.020]  That will be more like japan and other parts of asia where that's it's just perfectly natural to see people wearing face masks
[24:38.100 --> 24:42.900]  You know medical face masks in public. So it's whatever apple can do in that regard
[24:43.460 --> 24:48.020]  I don't think would be wasted even in the optimistic scenario where where covid fades away
[24:48.500 --> 24:52.580]  Well, I mean like you like everyone who goes to events gets sick the week afterwards. That's like a known thing
[24:52.580 --> 24:57.380]  It wasn't covid, but it was something you know knock on wood that has never happened to me
[24:57.620 --> 25:02.500]  In in all the years i've been doing it. I never once came home from like a mac world expo or
[25:03.140 --> 25:05.140]  WWDC and caught something and
[25:05.460 --> 25:09.860]  It's not that i'm i never get sick or never get a cold. I I don't know what it is
[25:09.860 --> 25:11.860]  I don't know if it's it could just be dumb luck
[25:11.860 --> 25:16.740]  I don't know but I I know a lot of people that happens to a lot of people. I know it's almost uh,
[25:17.700 --> 25:20.500]  Like a tradition. Yeah, like a tradition for some people but
[25:20.500 --> 25:24.980]  I don't know. It's never happened to me. But again knock on wood that yeah, you know won't happen in the future
[25:24.980 --> 25:31.620]  All right on to march the home pod was cancelled. Yeah, and boy I i'm still bummed about this me too
[25:31.940 --> 25:38.900]  So they cancelled the full-size home pod and said we're gonna focus on the home pod mini the home pod mini does seem to be
[25:38.900 --> 25:45.940]  Selling well, I saw some sales estimates last week from somebody that it's you know among the best-selling home speaker
[25:45.940 --> 25:49.940]  Talked to the dingus devices and and it is a good device
[25:49.940 --> 25:52.660]  It's a good device for the price and it sounds good for the price
[25:53.140 --> 26:00.580]  but it sounds nothing like a pair of home pods and yeah, especially the base and just like how well they filled the room yeah, and
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.540]  Curiously, you know, there are major significant features that only are supported on home pod
[26:07.540 --> 26:11.140]  Like you cannot, you know, I have a pair of home. I have
[26:11.140 --> 26:17.220]  More full-size home pods than you know a surprising number of them. I think I think we have six
[26:17.220 --> 26:21.300]  I have two in my office two in the kitchen and two on our TV and I mean I
[26:21.860 --> 26:26.340]  Really like the way our TV sounds. I mean, yes, we really really like it
[26:27.620 --> 26:31.860]  And you know, I'm sure there are audio files who who might have complaints
[26:31.860 --> 26:33.860]  It's not you know, you could certainly do a lot better
[26:33.860 --> 26:38.500]  But for us and for how loud we can get it without having to worry about it
[26:38.500 --> 26:43.220]  For us and for how loud we can get it without disturbing other people in the house
[26:44.740 --> 26:51.540]  We never get you know, never need to go past around 70 volume and things sound loud action movies sound boomy
[26:52.820 --> 26:56.340]  I really love audio files a psychological not a not a scientific diagnosis
[26:56.420 --> 26:59.540]  Well, but I mean I know what it's like to actually have like trucer
[26:59.780 --> 27:04.900]  I've been in rooms with true surround sound and stuff like that and you can spend a million bucks on a sound system easily
[27:05.060 --> 27:08.180]  There's no limit to what you can spend on one, but I really like it
[27:08.180 --> 27:14.180]  But you can't do that with the ipad or home pod minis and even if you could like so the feature isn't even supported
[27:14.740 --> 27:19.220]  And even if you could I believe it's still not supported but it's even if you get stereo
[27:19.620 --> 27:24.740]  You get like two channel stereo audio from it. Yeah, but that's you know, that's not good enough. That's yeah, you don't want that
[27:25.300 --> 27:32.100]  So that's really weird that they have this great support for set using a pair of home pods as apple tv output
[27:32.100 --> 27:39.780]  And have even added features that let you use them as the audio output for your tv even when you're using another source
[27:40.180 --> 27:47.860]  Like an hdmi source so like you could be playing your switch and use your home pods as the tv output, which is awesome
[27:48.580 --> 27:52.820]  Yeah, but you you know now they're cancelled. You can't get them. I mean
[27:54.100 --> 27:58.740]  What a weird failure on apple's part and and I put in my notes that to me
[27:58.740 --> 28:04.040]  It's more expensive. It's a more expensive product than you even think as a 350 or 399
[28:04.820 --> 28:09.300]  And you you know while they were on sale you could sometimes find them on sale for like 300 bucks
[28:09.860 --> 28:13.860]  But to me one home pod was never the product the real product
[28:13.860 --> 28:18.500]  Yes has always been a pair and that's why I have pairs of them in every room where I have them
[28:18.500 --> 28:23.540]  And that it's sort of like a single home pod is really a half of a set of home pods. Yeah
[28:24.020 --> 28:26.820]  It's like having a single speaker. It doesn't really like it's fine
[28:26.820 --> 28:32.580]  But it's it's nowhere nearly as good as having two the failure of this product is so curious to me because I really think
[28:32.580 --> 28:35.060]  It's a terrific product and usually
[28:35.700 --> 28:43.540]  For any company but apple in particular because they usually don't fail through lack of marketing effort or advertising
[28:44.100 --> 28:45.460]  panache
[28:45.460 --> 28:51.700]  It's usually a you know, an apple product that does not succeed is because there's something you know, it's actually not that great a product
[28:52.260 --> 28:54.260]  Whereas this to me was
[28:54.260 --> 29:00.420]  There's this weird middle ground though where like like with the ipod hi-fi where there are people who will spend again millions of dollars
[29:00.580 --> 29:04.980]  On audio equipment, but there's also people who think that any amount of money is too much for audio equipment
[29:05.300 --> 29:09.380]  And apple spent so long like I believe it was five years developing the home pod way before
[29:09.940 --> 29:14.740]  The amazon, you know smart speakers and the google smart speakers came on the market and they just wanted this
[29:15.300 --> 29:18.580]  They just wanted to solve this problem. They make all these audio products. They have ipods
[29:18.580 --> 29:22.500]  They have itunes apple music all these things and most people don't have a smartphone
[29:22.500 --> 29:26.740]  These things and most people don't have good sound in most of the rooms in their house
[29:26.980 --> 29:30.740]  And they wanted you to literally be able to just drop a box anywhere in the room and it would sound great
[29:30.980 --> 29:35.060]  Throughout the entire room no matter where you were standing in the room and because it didn't have a screen
[29:35.060 --> 29:39.700]  They just thought okay. We'll just have siri be the control and while they were getting all that together
[29:40.100 --> 29:43.860]  All these smart speakers came out and the entire market shifted to a commodity
[29:44.260 --> 29:48.980]  Mostly assistant based thing which this wasn't but was suddenly being classified and pitted against
[29:48.980 --> 29:52.980]  Uh, and at that price point it it's it wasn't like high enough to really attract
[29:53.460 --> 29:59.700]  Uh, you know like mac pro level customer interest and it wasn't low enough to attract like the ipod level interest and it kind of
[30:00.100 --> 30:06.420]  I'm, just surprised they cancelled it so quickly because usually they're happy letting like a 2013 mac pro stay on the market forever, right?
[30:06.820 --> 30:12.980]  I guess that's what i'm most surprised by that. They cancelled it. Why not? Just keep selling it and I guess that
[30:12.980 --> 30:19.460]  I guess that we we don't know but it seems like there was a story at some point during the year that
[30:19.700 --> 30:25.320]  Somebody figured out that even when you were after they were cancelled and people were buying like the last ones available
[30:25.780 --> 30:27.380]  You could do some
[30:27.380 --> 30:30.900]  I don't know if it was serial number tracking or just copyright date on the box
[30:31.220 --> 30:36.260]  But that they were all effectively from the initial batch that they you know manufactured a batch
[30:37.220 --> 30:39.220]  And sold them until they were out
[30:39.220 --> 30:46.660]  but they weren't still making them maybe that they had made them all in an initial run or something like, you know close to that and
[30:47.540 --> 30:51.700]  When they were done selling them they were done selling them. So hopefully fingers crossed they have some sort of
[30:52.400 --> 30:54.180]  replacement in the works
[30:54.180 --> 30:56.420]  Yeah, and the other weird thing about apple audio in general
[30:56.420 --> 30:59.300]  I think you pointed this out for the original air pods is that apple
[30:59.780 --> 31:04.660]  Doesn't sell them for an exorbitant amount of margin and but people look at them and say they don't sound
[31:04.660 --> 31:09.540]  the value of the price like they don't sound as good as a hundred and fifty dollar wired headphones or a
[31:10.100 --> 31:16.340]  Five hundred dollar wired speaker, but that's because like the there's apple chipsets in there. There's there are
[31:17.140 --> 31:23.300]  Sensors in there. There's a whole bunch of computational stuff that you're paying for that has nothing to do with the audio really but does
[31:23.620 --> 31:29.220]  Inflate the bill of goods. So even apple selling them at cost is still way more than if they had no smart stuff in them
[31:29.220 --> 31:31.860]  At all. Yeah, I don't know. So here's if I don't know
[31:31.860 --> 31:36.900]  I don't know what they could be replacing them with they don't tend to change product names
[31:37.060 --> 31:41.380]  I mean, it's not like after they discontinued it. They were going to rename the home pod mini
[31:42.020 --> 31:46.260]  Home pod and say that's the new home pod what we used to call the home pod mini
[31:46.660 --> 31:50.980]  But it is weird. It still is weird that they have a home pod mini and there's no home pod regular
[31:51.460 --> 31:53.460]  I mean which I hope you know
[31:53.540 --> 32:00.820]  And maybe it's just wishful thinking means that something else is coming and that they feel like they've figured out, you know
[32:00.820 --> 32:08.660]  I guess it's price. I don't know, you know that if they can like can they make something that's home pod quality sound and features for
[32:09.540 --> 32:10.660]  200
[32:10.660 --> 32:12.420]  Speaker, I don't know
[32:12.420 --> 32:16.740]  Yeah, there's like there's like three rumors. I think one is a home pod 2.0. That's exactly that
[32:17.140 --> 32:20.180]  The other is a home pod with like a screen that would do
[32:20.820 --> 32:24.980]  That center stage technology so that you could have calls on it very easily for the kitchen
[32:24.980 --> 32:30.420]  And then a home pod apple tv hybrid that would be basically like a big sound bar that you could have a whole home theater
[32:30.420 --> 32:32.260]  Set up on and I want all of these things john
[32:34.180 --> 32:40.660]  Well, let's see it's we've got a whole year ahead of us there was a in march still there was the intel goes long
[32:42.580 --> 32:48.980]  Which is where intel hired a former apple spokesperson justin long who was the i'm a mac
[32:48.980 --> 32:55.380]  I'm a mac to to do some cringy. I I think that's I think that's being generous even
[32:56.020 --> 32:58.020]  Yes. Yeah
[32:58.660 --> 33:03.380]  And a point my point to put this on the list isn't so much to make fun of the ads but as where where
[33:03.460 --> 33:05.460]  Else to speak about the general
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.140]  transition from intel to to apple silicon
[33:09.860 --> 33:11.300]  It almost feels like they're so bad
[33:11.300 --> 33:17.620]  There had to be like an executive at intel that was really angry and they were only made to make that executive feel better
[33:17.620 --> 33:19.860]  That's the only way I can explain these ads
[33:20.740 --> 33:23.300]  Yeah, I think so or or as somebody said
[33:24.020 --> 33:30.580]  At the time when I was writing about them that the target for the ad wasn't consumers the target for those ads were
[33:31.280 --> 33:36.020]  oems who make pcs, you know that it was like intel's sort of
[33:36.500 --> 33:37.620]  Given that's the thing
[33:37.620 --> 33:42.660]  so these were like such like just from a pure marketing point of view these were incredibly bad ads because
[33:42.660 --> 33:47.080]  In order to compete with apple, they basically went to hardware differentiation
[33:47.700 --> 33:52.900]  Which is intel not only saying we're pepsi now no longer coke like they were completely seeding
[33:53.300 --> 33:55.300]  Top of the market mind share to apple
[33:55.540 --> 34:01.540]  But they were also saying that they were a commodity whose only value came from the benefits that oems gave to them
[34:01.860 --> 34:08.100]  And that they were basically interchangeable with AMD because those same companies sold the same computers with AMD processors as well
[34:08.100 --> 34:12.660]  It was like the worst self-own i've ever seen in a in an intel marketing campaign
[34:13.380 --> 34:16.820]  it it has been interesting watching the
[34:17.380 --> 34:24.660]  Sort of sentiment sink in over the year, right? We're a little bit over a year into the m1 era. Yeah
[34:26.580 --> 34:33.540]  And that before they came out there was a widespread well there it can't be that great because they're just cell phone processors
[34:33.540 --> 34:38.340]  Yes, right and then they came out and everybody who actually tested it
[34:38.980 --> 34:42.580]  with their eyes open was like these blow away the state-of-the-art in
[34:43.440 --> 34:46.340]  Comparable, you know laptop pcs. Yeah
[34:47.060 --> 34:48.660]  and watching
[34:48.660 --> 34:55.060]  The rest of the you know, the sort of pc half of the media industry sort of come to grips with this has been
[34:55.060 --> 35:01.320]  Satisfying yeah, and to say the least. Yeah, it's like it was like watching android get get sort of
[35:01.480 --> 35:07.240]  Understand that what was happening with qualcomm over the last few years because one of the things i've always felt, you know
[35:07.240 --> 35:13.720]  and literally always I mean going back to the 90s even when the mac and apple were in trouble that
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.240]  Design-wise macos was always the superior operating system to windows
[35:19.240 --> 35:26.120]  But obviously that's subjective and a point of taste whereas the actual performance of these chips
[35:26.360 --> 35:31.740]  And certainly their performance per watt is objective and it is objectively
[35:32.440 --> 35:38.840]  You know years ahead of of where the x86 platform is and likely will be
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.640]  And
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.800]  So it doesn't it's not subjective. There's no there's no account
[35:45.800 --> 35:51.000]  There's no taste to be accounted for if what you want to do is have a windows pc
[35:52.200 --> 35:56.280]  You can't have this and that's unprecedented in the industry
[35:57.240 --> 36:02.280]  That's yeah, it's never been the case that they you know that there's been a chip platform for
[36:03.160 --> 36:10.360]  Personal computers or workstations that's purport. Well, I shouldn't say never right you'd have to go back to like the sun
[36:10.360 --> 36:18.600]  Sparkstation days right where if you wanted, you know sun's performance you had to buy sun hardware or silicon graphics or companies like that
[36:18.840 --> 36:20.840]  but those were
[36:21.220 --> 36:25.160]  15 20 000
[36:25.160 --> 36:28.360]  Unix workstations in 1990 something dollars, right it it in terms of the consumers
[36:28.680 --> 36:31.880]  There's never really been anything like there's never been a situation like this
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.800]  No, it's only analogous to smartphones where if you wanted the performance of apple silicon you had to get the whole package
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.840]  And now if you want the performance from apple silicon on laptop and desktop, you have to get the whole package again
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.040]  All right. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at
[36:48.920 --> 36:54.440]  Linode oh boy, do I love linode linode is where I host daring fireball
[36:54.920 --> 37:00.120]  I would host there whether they if they called me up and said we are never going to sponsor you again
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.440]  Thank you, but that's it. We're done. I'm i'm not moving daring fireball anywhere

[38:39.180 --> 38:43.660]  We got to keep going the year kept going april now april is where where apple got busy
[38:43.660 --> 38:48.780]  They had the spring-loaded event
[38:48.780 --> 38:54.880]  Where they announced, uh, let's see air tags. They add new features for apple podcasts
[38:55.900 --> 39:00.300]  we might as well put the hardware in may because that's where we actually got to review it, but uh,
[39:01.020 --> 39:03.020]  We could talk about yeah, we got a purple iPhone
[39:05.420 --> 39:10.140]  Yeah, we got a purple iPhone, uh, which then disappeared right so it was only uh,
[39:10.140 --> 39:14.940]  Like purple was not among the colors in this in the fall. So it was sort of a six-month thing
[39:16.220 --> 39:20.860]  Air tags, I guess it's here's as fine a place as any to talk about right where
[39:21.820 --> 39:24.700]  there's a bit of a pushback now where the sort of
[39:25.340 --> 39:30.860]  Fud is coming out that they're being used to track people and it's reasonable right like I don't say that
[39:31.420 --> 39:34.220]  With too big of a pair of dick quotes around it. Uh,
[39:35.100 --> 39:38.780]  It is reasonable for people to say hey, can this be used to track people?
[39:38.780 --> 39:40.780]  Say hey, can this be used for?
[39:41.340 --> 39:43.420]  Bad purposes maliciously. Yeah
[39:44.060 --> 39:49.180]  My understanding because this was a product that had been rumored for quite a while before it came out
[39:49.900 --> 39:55.260]  And I don't think i'm alone in thinking this that it the product was finished before
[39:55.660 --> 40:01.420]  Hardware wise before apple was ready to announce it and I think part of it was that they were still
[40:02.380 --> 40:04.380]  working through all of the
[40:04.380 --> 40:09.180]  As you said before like threat scenarios, right like in sort of imagining
[40:09.260 --> 40:14.300]  How could this be abused and what can we do to prevent that sort of thinking?
[40:15.020 --> 40:19.900]  But there's some stories now about people using them to track cars. They intend to steal
[40:20.780 --> 40:25.900]  I think there was a story last week about somebody who bought like a used car and then
[40:26.780 --> 40:29.020]  Found a tracker in the wheel well
[40:29.020 --> 40:35.980]  Which somebody was speculating. I think it was benedict evans that maybe the idea is that the car dealers put them in and
[40:37.580 --> 40:41.660]  For whatever reason and forgot to take it out, you know, but it seems
[40:42.460 --> 40:46.300]  Like just a handful. It doesn't really seem like anything has actually gone wrong with them
[40:46.940 --> 40:51.980]  You know other than a few anecdotes, but it doesn't seem like there's any sort of widespread
[40:52.860 --> 40:57.420]  Reason to be fearful of the existence of air tags on the market
[40:57.420 --> 41:03.660]  Yeah, it's interesting because whenever apple enters a new market people suddenly find all these problems with the market and that's because apple attracts
[41:03.660 --> 41:10.460]  So much attention to that market. I mean there were tiles for years samsung announced their tracker before apple did
[41:11.020 --> 41:16.220]  And none of those have anything as far as I can tell anything at all that will help you with stalker or tracking
[41:16.700 --> 41:19.660]  Prevention, you know, there's just none of that you just buy them and use them
[41:20.380 --> 41:25.180]  But nobody notices because those products don't make a lot of noise, but apple is always big big headlines
[41:25.180 --> 41:28.220]  And I think that's great. I think apple should be subject to tons of scrutiny
[41:28.220 --> 41:34.220]  I do wish that everyone would hold all these companies that can potentially cause as much harm to the same level of scrutiny
[41:34.220 --> 41:36.220]  But it is it is what it is
[41:36.220 --> 41:41.660]  And this again is nothing that people who are in surveillance are are care about it all because they've been able to get 50
[41:42.780 --> 41:47.660]  Real gps trackers off amazon and previously off radio fact in places for years
[41:47.820 --> 41:52.860]  But what this does is it attracts a whole bunch of people who've never thought of it before and they're like, oh, I guess previously
[41:52.860 --> 41:58.700]  I would have dropped a gps tracker or I would have thrown a cheap iphone se into somebody's bag or car and
[41:58.940 --> 42:02.700]  Track them that way but now I can get a four-pack for 100 bucks and I can just do it
[42:02.860 --> 42:09.980]  And I wouldn't have encouraged them before so there's a level of the worst like the dumbest possible criminal element getting involved in it
[42:10.460 --> 42:14.860]  But they've got all these things like it's like anytime I get in my car it chirps like it audibly chirps
[42:14.860 --> 42:20.860]  Every single time I get in my car it's annoying but like i'm like that's great because somebody else may not know there's a tracker
[42:20.860 --> 42:24.860]  In there, so I think we always have to balance that these things are tools
[42:25.580 --> 42:28.860]  Tools can help us do wonderful things. They can also be horribly misused
[42:29.500 --> 42:35.100]  How much value is there to these tools and what can we do to sort of mitigate the the malicious intent as much as possible?
[42:35.900 --> 42:40.860]  And there's a sort of inevitability right like, you know, there was just go back to cameras
[42:40.860 --> 42:47.900]  There was certainly and still is you know, I think uh, joanna and I talked about this on my show last week that the growing number of
[42:47.900 --> 42:51.420]  Cameras everywhere is certainly reason to be
[42:52.460 --> 42:56.540]  Concerned but not or worried, you know or skeptical, you know
[42:56.620 --> 43:00.940]  And and and to think about it and to know where they are, but it it's not like there's anything
[43:00.940 --> 43:03.980]  We're not putting this genie back in the bottle, right?
[43:03.980 --> 43:08.780]  Well, there were there were articles about camera phones in changing rooms for a long time when they first came out
[43:09.980 --> 43:13.660]  You know, I thought about it last week too and I don't think I mentioned it with joanna
[43:13.660 --> 43:19.260]  But I thought about it with you know, having a teenage son. There's so many things that me and my friends did in high school. Yes
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.900]  that
[43:21.900 --> 43:27.180]  I don't you know, you'd have to be nobody will ever know about unless yeah unless you were there no one will ever know about
[43:27.820 --> 43:33.900]  And you'd have to be a complete moron to do any of them today because there it would be caught on camera
[43:34.540 --> 43:37.980]  Why are you limping away from the science lab half on fire? No reason?
[43:40.060 --> 43:41.100]  You know nothing
[43:41.100 --> 43:45.660]  right, uh, you know, nothing nothing that I think I would have gone to
[43:46.220 --> 43:50.780]  Prison for but you know things that but who knows? Yeah, who knows maybe?
[43:52.380 --> 43:55.580]  Maybe you're there but for the grace of god john either of us could have been the lightsaber kid
[43:56.140 --> 43:59.260]  I have you found a good use for air pot air tags
[43:59.900 --> 44:03.340]  I I have a couple and you know, I have them but
[44:03.980 --> 44:10.780]  It's part of the whole covid second season that we just haven't I don't go many places, you know
[44:10.780 --> 44:17.820]  And so I I don't know yet, you know, I have one in my briefcase slash laptop over the shoulder laptop bag
[44:18.220 --> 44:24.380]  We took two trips over the summer while things were looking up. And so I I had a night, you know an air tag in my bag
[44:25.180 --> 44:28.940]  But you know two vacations where it's like I took the bag
[44:29.260 --> 44:35.980]  to the airport put it on a plane and you know as usual never really left my sight and then took it to a hotel and
[44:35.980 --> 44:43.420]  Then took it home and that's it. And otherwise my my laptop bag hasn't left my house since march of 2020
[44:43.500 --> 44:45.500]  You know two times
[44:45.660 --> 44:49.980]  So it's i'm glad there's an air tag in there, but it hasn't really you know
[44:51.020 --> 44:55.980]  I think that was part of the reason that apple didn't rush to get them out because they knew they were releasing them under conditions
[44:55.980 --> 45:00.540]  That were less than ideal to show their value right like like you I didn't use cellular data for months
[45:00.540 --> 45:07.340]  I didn't I forgot what my credit card pin was and I I didn't I had no idea where my gear bag was for a whole year
[45:07.420 --> 45:11.980]  I I had to end up actually using an air tag recently to find the damn thing in my own house
[45:12.060 --> 45:14.060]  Because it was it was in a closet i'd forgotten about
[45:15.420 --> 45:21.580]  Right and it's like I can't you know, the things I still lose aren't really practical for air tags
[45:21.660 --> 45:26.780]  I have a pair I had a pair of shoes. We went out to a nice dinner here on christmas eve
[45:26.780 --> 45:32.400]  And I wanted to wear a pair of shoes that i'm not sure if i've worn since march of 2020
[45:32.780 --> 45:37.900]  Yes, like and they weren't in my closet and i'm like, I know I put these somewhere dumb. Where the hell did I put them?
[45:38.140 --> 45:41.340]  Well, I don't I didn't have air tags in them. You can't put air tags and shoes
[45:41.820 --> 45:47.260]  So I had to hunt around and I figured out they were in the coat closet by the front door for some crazy reason
[45:47.340 --> 45:48.300]  But yeah
[45:48.300 --> 45:52.860]  yeah, I feel like air tags are one of those things that we kind of have to really wait for covid to
[45:52.860 --> 45:56.940]  Subside whenever that's going to be to really find out how useful they are without what have you
[45:57.020 --> 46:00.940]  I am the person who'd like get up from the restaurant at ces and walk away and forget about my bag
[46:00.940 --> 46:04.060]  Then I have to go running back and hope that it's still there and I was looking really
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.300]  I was looking really forward to actually having not have to worry about that anymore. But like you said I haven't
[46:08.940 --> 46:14.860]  Well, I'm 20 feet right or now you'd get the war the warning separation, right? Yeah
[46:15.660 --> 46:18.140]  Yeah, I did play with my cars in the garage like that
[46:18.140 --> 46:23.340]  Like I go upstairs from the garage and my car's like you're the electric car by like I know anything else
[46:23.340 --> 46:25.340]  Do you have anything else that you have air tags in?
[46:25.740 --> 46:28.780]  I have in my wallet. Well, i'm gonna tell everybody now now they're gonna know how to pull them out
[46:28.780 --> 46:32.300]  But I don't care they're in my car my wallet my gear bag
[46:32.860 --> 46:38.860]  Extra set of keys and I forget where the last one is probably on something dumb like duct tape to my apple tv remote
[46:39.500 --> 46:40.460]  Yeah
[46:40.460 --> 46:44.220]  Do you really have one duct tape to your apple tv, but I should because I still lose the damn thing
[46:44.220 --> 46:51.500]  What else there was the uh, also, uh announced that this event was the changes to apple podcasts or new features to apple podcast
[46:51.580 --> 46:54.780]  the the subscriptions for subscriber only
[46:55.580 --> 46:57.580]  uh podcasts
[46:57.580 --> 46:59.500]  uh, I forget what other changes were there but
[47:00.140 --> 47:03.820]  As far as I can tell the subscribing to
[47:04.460 --> 47:09.580]  Podcasts through apple podcasts. It does not seem to be a big thing yet
[47:09.580 --> 47:14.540]  If it ever will be but maybe i'm missing some segment of the market where it is a thing
[47:15.820 --> 47:19.840]  I think it's just fundamentally different like when because podcasts are so distributed
[47:20.380 --> 47:25.020]  For good and for bad like the podcast discovery is really hard because they're not all on the same platform
[47:25.340 --> 47:30.460]  But it means that you can use you know, your podcast client of choice and people have to wrestle with you know
[47:30.460 --> 47:34.620]  I want to listen to horace de dia's podcast, but I don't like using apple podcast
[47:34.620 --> 47:38.620]  So what am I going to do or maybe like you and ben, you know, they want to listen to you
[47:38.620 --> 47:42.220]  And then is there a version on apple podcast? Can we get it that way?
[47:42.380 --> 47:44.620]  What if I have an android phone as well? Then what do I like?
[47:44.860 --> 47:49.260]  I think it creates it's it's creator economy through complexity, which I don't think is the best solution
[47:50.620 --> 47:52.620]  Yeah, and it it
[47:52.620 --> 47:57.500]  It's like the app store works because if you really want to have an app and you want to monetize it
[47:57.500 --> 48:03.920]  It's the only way yeah, and if you want to have a podcast that is monetized through subscriptions
[48:04.940 --> 48:06.940]  It's not the only way
[48:06.940 --> 48:08.540]  and
[48:08.540 --> 48:10.540]  What if you use another way?
[48:12.620 --> 48:16.460]  Spoiler upcoming upcoming sponsor read
[48:17.340 --> 48:18.860]  memberful
[48:18.860 --> 48:21.420]  but if you use memberful or something like that or
[48:21.820 --> 48:27.180]  You know like ben has I was gonna say ben and I but I I haven't done any part of it
[48:27.180 --> 48:32.780]  But ben has built this system for stertech re-called passport. Yeah, which we also use for dithering and
[48:32.780 --> 48:38.220]  You just do it all through the web. All we do is pay stripe, uh, you know, like
[48:38.940 --> 48:45.980]  three or just under three percent and there's a you sign in to our website and if you want to subscribe
[48:46.620 --> 48:54.300]  In any podcast player including apple podcasts, it's one link away once you're signed in as a paid subscriber
[48:55.020 --> 48:59.820]  There's there's really no reason for us to use the apple podcast thing
[48:59.820 --> 49:05.420]  Yeah, if they owned podcasts the way that youtube owns video they it would be a no-brainer but they don't and it is where I have
[49:05.420 --> 49:12.140]  A ton I I I do look at my analytics through libsyn for the show and by far and away the the two
[49:12.460 --> 49:16.300]  Clients that really matter the most for this show are apple podcasts
[49:16.780 --> 49:21.740]  But apple podcast is in second place for me. It's overcast is number one. Yeah, I forget
[49:21.740 --> 49:24.700]  It might be like 60 40 or something like that. I
[49:24.700 --> 49:30.220]  Or among those two 60 40 because there's spotify now and and other good clients
[49:30.220 --> 49:35.820]  But you can you can listen to it in any client and so it just seems like a weird thing to
[49:36.140 --> 49:39.980]  want to lock into it's you know, I don't blame apple for trying but it's
[49:41.180 --> 49:48.620]  It just seems like there's a lot of yada yada yada in the middle of the conception of why why is this an appealing?
[49:48.940 --> 49:50.380]  platform for
[49:50.380 --> 49:57.100]  A subscription-based podcast to use right? There's yeah, you got it. There's there's some dot dot dot in the middle that apple
[49:57.420 --> 49:59.260]  Hasn't filled in
[49:59.260 --> 50:06.380]  And maybe for some categories their their share is so phenomenal. Maybe it's 90 percent of home improvement podcasts. I have no idea
[50:06.380 --> 50:08.460]  Yeah, I don't know and then maybe it might make more sense
[50:08.460 --> 50:13.500]  But for tech it is so distributed and then you have like pocket casts on for people who use android primarily, right?
[50:14.140 --> 50:16.460]  Just it's it's extra work. It ends up being at least as far as like
[50:16.460 --> 50:22.700]  I can tell yeah, then you know for us with dithering it just doesn't seem like there's any reason to use it
[50:22.700 --> 50:28.940]  It would just complicate things unnecessarily because people who use apple podcasts can subscribe as is
[50:29.660 --> 50:33.580]  Pretty easily maybe not quite as easily as doing it in the app
[50:33.580 --> 50:39.180]  But you know pretty close to it if if if you know how to use a web browser, which you know
[50:39.180 --> 50:41.180]  It doesn't seem like a big ask
[50:41.420 --> 50:45.900]  Yeah, no and you're like you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're
[50:45.900 --> 50:49.340]  I know and your audience is tech savvy. It's almost opted into a tech savvy audience
[50:49.500 --> 50:53.420]  Well, and that's true. I mean, I think that overcast numbers speak to that, right?
[50:53.660 --> 50:58.940]  You know that it's it's not that overcast is hard to use but the fact that you even know what overcast is
[50:59.260 --> 51:02.300]  Yeah, it implies a certain level of tech savviness, you know
[51:03.420 --> 51:10.220]  Uh, all right on to may may was another big month. Uh, we could start I guess with the hardware that was announced in april
[51:10.780 --> 51:11.820]  uh
[51:11.820 --> 51:13.820]  24 inch m1 imax
[51:13.820 --> 51:15.820]  Yeah
[51:15.820 --> 51:20.960]  Yeah, I thought the most interesting thing about those is that they sort of redefined the way people thought about m1 because previously
[51:21.420 --> 51:24.300]  They were only looking at its efficiency in terms of battery life
[51:24.620 --> 51:30.480]  And I don't think people realize that that efficiency also taught also defines the design that you can make for the enclosure
[51:30.860 --> 51:35.740]  Apple had to literally have these bulbous behinds on the back of imax for years
[51:36.060 --> 51:39.600]  And I still don't think right now like if you took alderlake it would even fit properly
[51:39.600 --> 51:45.760]  In the standard imac enclosure. I know dave 2d's video. He couldn't get the thing without water cooling into a mini tower
[51:46.160 --> 51:50.560]  so just the prospect that apple would have with that next generation of intel chips that were like
[51:50.960 --> 51:53.540]  Using excessive voltage to try to catch up with amd
[51:54.080 --> 52:00.320]  It wouldn't fit in there and because they're using apple chips. They could make this entirely new really flat flat imac design
[52:00.640 --> 52:03.200]  Yeah, I I still think and you know
[52:04.080 --> 52:07.440]  Because at the time that the m that the and this is the first
[52:07.440 --> 52:09.440]  designed around the m1 mac
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.240]  Right, which is kind of a neat thing, right? It's because the the m1
[52:14.880 --> 52:18.560]  MacBook air and macbook pros that shipped in november
[52:19.520 --> 52:24.720]  Last year were all literally the same enclosures as the intel ones
[52:24.720 --> 52:30.400]  Which was a strategic thing apple did to sort of keep the project as secret as possible
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.880]  I mean everybody including intel kind of knew that apple was moving towards
[52:34.880 --> 52:37.920]  Moving the mac to its own silicon, but
[52:38.960 --> 52:45.680]  For whatever reason strategically the fact that it this was 2020 was the year where they were going to pull the trigger and do
[52:45.680 --> 52:48.320]  it they wanted to keep it secret as long as possible and
[52:49.280 --> 52:52.160]  They therefore kept the hardware
[52:53.840 --> 52:58.000]  Right down to the camera the keyboard everything exactly the same
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.680]  So the first what can we design around the m1 that we could not do with intel?
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.520]  The 24-inch imac was the first example of that. I mean in the 24-inch imac is so crazy thin and perfect perfectly
[53:12.060 --> 53:16.480]  rectilinear with no bulb. No, not even like a pimple on the back
[53:16.720 --> 53:24.240]  There's no way that intel has anything that would even vaguely fit in there and not the core y from the old macbook air
[53:24.240 --> 53:30.560]  But I don't think it would even power the display at that right, right and and and both fit in there without
[53:31.520 --> 53:36.640]  Melting it and yeah satisfy just merely satisfy as opposed to
[53:37.680 --> 53:43.760]  Completely, please them make them ecstatic over the moon with the performance. Just just satisfy them with the performance
[53:43.760 --> 53:46.800]  There's there is nothing literally nothing couldn't be done
[53:47.440 --> 53:52.240]  No, I mean that chipset took the macbook air from something that barely functioned to something that was
[53:52.240 --> 53:57.760]  Industry leading and it's the same thing with the imac. I also think apple's bandwidth to push out complete new
[53:57.760 --> 54:03.520]  Imac, sorry new mac redesigns is limited like we got two last we got two this year
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.280]  And I think that'll be sort of their pace and they'll they'll stagger using the same containers with creating new designs
[54:09.600 --> 54:14.000]  Every couple years from now on just because it seems to take them a long time to get those things done
[54:14.880 --> 54:19.280]  It's it it's as good a point to speculate about the future as possible
[54:19.280 --> 54:24.080]  I mean, it does seem like they're on a weird cadence right where?
[54:24.880 --> 54:32.880]  The easiest product to understand cadence wise is the iphone it is completely annual and the one year where it wasn't annual
[54:33.280 --> 54:34.720]  was the
[54:34.720 --> 54:36.960]  4s where they switched from
[54:38.000 --> 54:38.720]  a
[54:38.720 --> 54:40.720]  june release around
[54:41.260 --> 54:44.960]  wwdc or weeks afterwards to a fall release
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.720]  which
[54:46.720 --> 54:50.240]  As far as I know was completely strategic and planned
[54:52.240 --> 54:54.240]  October was for singleton. Yeah
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.600]  Sadly coincided with steve jobs's death, you know and sort of put a paul paul over literally a
[55:02.240 --> 55:04.240]  a literal paul over the event
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.760]  But it's you know once a year every year come september there will be an event or october
[55:11.760 --> 55:18.640]  You know, if it something happens and it gets delayed, you know mid-september early october every single year. There's a new
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.400]  Line of iphones with a new line of silicon
[55:24.240 --> 55:30.160]  And that's the way it goes the mac schedule let's see how it works out in the long run but as you know
[55:30.160 --> 55:37.360]  For example at this point everything clearly is not annual because we did not get updates to the macbook air or the low-end macbook
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.840]  Pro or the mac mini all the stuff that came out in november of last year is still
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.980]  Unchanged on you know, it is what it is still using the m1
[55:50.000 --> 55:50.960]  I
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.440]  I sort of guess I mean, I know the rumor mill about m2 products and I know you've been all over it
[55:55.440 --> 55:58.080]  You know with your on your youtube channel. Um
[55:58.800 --> 56:00.960]  It seems like it may not be you know, even
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.680]  The same calendar. I don't know that we're going to have to wait till november to do that
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.360]  We're going to have to wait till november to get new products. It seems like
[56:10.080 --> 56:12.560]  It could be like a spring thing this year. Yeah
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.760]  well, the the extended versions of the apples like the original a series like what they they did
[56:18.560 --> 56:24.720]  It was very strange like they had a 5x a 6x. No a 7x a 8x a 9x a 10x
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.960]  No, a 11x a 12x a 12z. No a 13x and then a 14x ended up being m1. So
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.200]  That stuff was like on an 18 month, I think sort of a or
[56:36.160 --> 56:42.240]  Average pace so we might get the same thing here where they're still going to have a new a series chip every year every iphone
[56:42.480 --> 56:45.520]  But then when they choose to make the new m series chips might vary
[56:46.080 --> 56:51.920]  Uh slightly longer right and for various reasons that I don't feel like going into because I don't
[56:52.640 --> 56:56.800]  fully understand but the way things work and and this this is a very
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.520]  It's just the way silicon development works. It's the reason that xeons come out after
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.920]  The consumer level chips based on the same generation. It just takes longer and it
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.280]  It you you come out with the regular m1
[57:12.800 --> 57:16.880]  And then the m1 pro and m1 max which are
[57:17.760 --> 57:23.280]  In very very high level lay person's terms a couple of m1s put together
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.640]  Um, yeah it take, you know, obviously you can't if you you can't do a couple of them put together
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.120]  Simultaneous with the original release, you know, it obviously takes longer and they're those pro level
[57:35.600 --> 57:41.760]  Versions of the same generation are going to always come out later. So my guess is this spring
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.720]  You know pretty much when we saw the 24 inch iMac last year
[57:46.720 --> 57:54.400]  We'll see the pro level whether they call it iMac pro or or i i'm guessing they will that they'll just say iMac
[57:54.800 --> 58:01.380]  Is a 24 inch product with the regular m1 and then the next one will have the regular m2
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  and the iMac pro
[58:03.760 --> 58:11.920]  Will be something with like the m1 pro and m1 max that we just got last month or two months ago with the um,
[58:11.920 --> 58:16.080]  You know with the new 14 inch and 16 inch macbook pros
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.880]  And the really cool thing is because the the thermals are so good
[58:18.880 --> 58:24.800]  They could put dual m1 maxes in the highest end model and it would still be drawing less power than the intel chip
[58:24.800 --> 58:31.360]  Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they do like so so with the regular 24 inch iMac
[58:31.360 --> 58:36.880]  They they just put the exact same chip in like I mean, I don't know if there's some I forget look, you know
[58:36.880 --> 58:44.480]  But effectively it's pretty much just the same chip that's in the other the original m1 macbooks of and mac mini
[58:45.040 --> 58:48.560]  I wouldn't be surprised if that's not quite the same with the
[58:49.200 --> 58:55.200]  27 inch which I get i'm guessing 27 inch at this point even though I thought maybe they'd go to 30 inch
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.200]  But let's just say 27 inch based on some rumors that are coming out of the supply chain
[58:59.200 --> 59:07.760]  Rumors that are coming out of the supply chain. Um, I wouldn't be surprised if it's not the exact same and limited to exactly
[59:07.840 --> 59:11.520]  What's in the 16 and 14 inch but that they actually can do?
[59:12.080 --> 59:17.520]  Multiple maxes. I don't know the max plus I mean they're running out of adjectives. They stick at the end of these names
[59:17.600 --> 59:23.440]  I think it's just dual dual dual m1 max and the iMac and quad m1 max and the mac pro and then it's just so much
[59:23.440 --> 59:26.800]  More efficient and economical for their processes. Yeah, and you know
[59:26.800 --> 59:30.880]  Somebody had a thing the other day where every product I think it was a youtube
[59:30.960 --> 59:37.280]  I don't know what it was but every single product in the world now either has pro plus or max in its name
[59:38.320 --> 59:42.240]  And it is I get it, you know, and it's sort of a trend and maybe you know
[59:42.240 --> 59:47.300]  Maybe apple is sort of spearheading the trend. They've certainly been on top of the word pro for decades
[59:48.000 --> 59:49.440]  but
[59:49.440 --> 59:55.040]  the word max max is so part as a podcaster is so
[59:55.040 --> 59:56.220]  so
[59:56.220 --> 59:59.820]  Problematic when you're talking about the Macintosh platform
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.820]  The mac max can an m1 max max of an m1 max could max max. It just doesn't make any sense
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:12.060]  It's it's a mouthful and it's it's it's not a problem at all in writing
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:19.180]  I suppose it's a bit of a as much of a problem on youtube. Although on youtube you can always put titles up, right?
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:25.500]  You you know the whole thing is just ungainly. It's like a macbook pro with an m1 pro or m1
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:31.200]  Like they're both words are doubled up no matter what you do and it's just inelegant right and you know, i'm not endorsing
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.580]  Going to the uh, you know, 68 0 40 x chip, you know, something like that
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:43.580]  I'm convinced sony product names come from one passwords password generator. Oh, yeah, that's all they do. They just pseudo random blob
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.660]  That's the password. That's the product name
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.500]  um
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.660]  Yeah, so that's my guess. Is that pretty much?
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:56.300]  Uh around the time we saw the 24 inch regular iMacs last year this year. We'll see the 27 inch iMac pros
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.540]  Uh, I look forward to that
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.740]  Uh, what else came out last year the m1?
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.820]  And we also got our hands on these in may after being announced in april the m1 ipad pros
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.940]  I don't really people got so angry about why why why do you think they got angry?
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:20.380]  because I think they're I think partly apple marketing but also expectational debt is they saw tim cook take a chip from
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.300]  A mac and put it in an ipad and there's this contingent of ipad owners
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.900]  Who have always loved the hardware but wanted it to be a mac and they thought when that chip was moving over
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.020]  They were getting mac os essentially on an ipad and it was never going to be that but for a minute
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.340]  They were like just so excited and then they realized it's still an ipad, of course
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.660]  Yeah, i'm not quite sure what it is that they were hoping for. I don't have a lot to say about these
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:49.500]  I mean, they're great. I mean, I don't own one. I I didn't I I don't use my ipad enough to have purchased one
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.420]  to replace my
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.020]  2018
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.860]  whatever chip I
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.140]  ipad pro
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.580]  Uh, yeah, but they're great and if your ipad first it it certainly is a great product. Um
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:07.660]  But there's not much to add. I love it for the screen like I have my macbook pro now and it has a mini led
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.900]  Hdr display and I use the ipad pro inside car and I can edit videos
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.100]  Like I I don't release videos in hdr yet, but I love to play around with it and I have like full display hdr
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.540]  On one panel i'm editing next to the panel and it's the best thing in the world
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.380]  It would have cost me tens of thousands of dollars in the past. Yeah, it's a beautiful display
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.060]  Center stage is a really neat feature. Yeah, it's
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.860]  Probably the biggest. Hmm. I wonder why they didn't do that with the
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.700]  new
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.700]  m1 pro and max
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.380]  macbook pros
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:45.820]  But I believe it's simply that the there's no room for the camera that can be so super wide angle in the really thin
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.980]  macbook lids I really think it comes down to camera hardware not
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.020]  Some kind of marketing spite that you have to buy an ipad just to get center stage
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.460]  And i'm sure we'll get there like a lot of the stuff apple starts off with a couple tests and then they move it as quickly
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.700]  Or as easily as they can across the product line
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.620]  But it is it's one of those features that sounds too good to be true and in practice
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.100]  It's even better in my opinion than they promise it to be the biggest problem with it
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.660]  Is that usually when we've used it?
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.740]  The ipad is in a magic keyboard case and is therefore in
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:27.500]  Landscape and therefore the camera is not at the top center. It's in the middle of the display to the left, you know
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.060]  And I don't know what the answer to that is, you know, I don't know that apple is really ready to say
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:39.260]  That the canonical orientation for an ipad is no longer up and down but left and right but
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.660]  I kind of feel like they should
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.020]  And they kind of screwed themselves too because they they put the smart connector now on the bottom
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.540]  Like if you're holding it in landscape the smart connector now is on the bottom
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.060]  The apple pencil charges on the top and both of those take up the physical space you'd need to put the camera there, right?
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.900]  so
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:03.420]  It's it's tough but it should I mean if 2020 and 2020 junior taught us anything. It's that that's the way people are using them
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.460]  Yeah
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:09.260]  So I don't know what the answer is, but uh, hopefully, you know, they're aware of it as anybody else
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340]  It is a great like zoom device
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.860]  uh, we've used it, you know all of our school meeting I mean jonas is in school this year, but all the
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.900]  parent stuff is all via zoom and we just use ipads for that and
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.940]  It's you know, it's nice to actually look good
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.420]  In the in the footage supposed to using an old mac from the intel era
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.140]  It is funny too. I just we were just watching
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.060]  the news
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.980]  Uh yesterday we don't watch a lot of tv news
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:40.540]  But something was up and we were watching something and I had an interview with a local hospital official
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:46.540]  And I was like, oh I I know he's using an old macbook. I can tell I could just tell by the bluish tint
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.740]  Everything about it. I was like, I know it's not just a cheap webcam
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:55.580]  It was like that is absolutely the telltale look of a intel era macbook of some sort
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.380]  No, absolutely
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.780]  It's like there used to be a time when you could not get on tv looking like that, you know
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.860]  With camera quality like that. They would just send a crew to your house and actually have a real camera
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:13.760]  Yeah, they view defined everything but the the ios I sorry the iphone and the ipad cameras are really good now except for the orientation
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:18.380]  And the macbook pro cameras are and the imac cameras are really really good. Yeah
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.500]  Especially because of the orientation. So I think we're we're beginning to solve that problem
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.220]  Uh, we got a new apple tv 4k
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.660]  And uh a new oh god, you know
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:35.660]  You know angels singing a new remote control, which I still love. Uh, i'm still very very happy with
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.620]  I don't have much to say about it
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.540]  I mean are you used to the new place of the siri or do you are you still like me pressing play pause?
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.740]  Every once in a while to activate siri. No, i've totally gotten used to siri. Okay, my problem is
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:53.020]  My problem is the power button and I I mentioned this on the show
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.500]  I think when ben thompson was on a few weeks ago where
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:03.340]  My long-standing and occasionally mentioned gripe that I could use the apple tv power to power everything off by holding power
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.820]  But could not turn it on
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.760]  Was solved with a setting on my lg
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:15.260]  TV go into settings on the lg and you go in and there's something something and you can turn on
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.780]  Whatever the name of the feature is. I don't know why it wasn't on the by default
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:23.340]  It's nuts to me, but there's something you had I had to turn on on the lg tv
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:29.100]  And now I can use the power button on the siri remote to turn everything on
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:34.300]  And even if the hdmi was set to the switch or to our tivo
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.060]  It'll switch the hdmi to the apple tv too. It is wonderful
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.060]  Uh, I love it mine works like 19 out of 20 times
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.500]  So the other time it won't turn on the tv where it won't turn off the tv the other time
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:45.980]  It works
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.900]  We have the same thing and every single like the five percent of times when it doesn't work
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.700]  It's always amy never me which I wish were the other I wish we're the other way around. Yes
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.740]  Same because i'd rather have the problem than hear about it
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.180]  Um, yes
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:06:59.580]  No
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:05.420]  My problem with the remote is that once i've turned it on when I first turn it on and I use that
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.900]  Sort of hidden button and not hidden
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.340]  But it's it's sort of meant to be disguised and out of the way that power button on the upper, right?
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.500]  I suddenly my brain thinks that's the upper right button
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:23.900]  And then I use that button as the home button instead of the the the you know
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:30.780]  The actual home button on the siri remote like to just leave whatever app i'm in to go back to the apple tv home screen
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.620]  I hit the power button
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.780]  And it says oh you have to press this to turn everything off and i'm like I don't want to turn everything off
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.460]  I do. Oh and i'm like, oh i've it's like something in my brain
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.740]  Just and then I have to reap, you know
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:50.780]  Think about it actually think about it. No once i've turned everything on the top right button is down here in the middle
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.900]  I don't know. I solved that by using the play pause button to turn things on now
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.460]  I don't almost never use the the power button
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:02.220]  But only that button works to turn it on like you can't just press any button to turn it on
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.340]  It's it's only that one in the middle and if you forget that and press another one like which is weird to me as well
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.540]  Yeah, but overall I could not be happier with the remote. I love it. I even love it just as a little
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.020]  Thing to hold in my hand it feels cool. It has a nice weight
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:22.780]  It is it is just feel substantial. It is a very nice object in hand could not be happier with it
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.900]  Um, I still feel like they could have done a better job
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:32.860]  With the spin thing on the circle, you know, and I know that this was something that was a source of confusion
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:38.380]  Because it works in some places and then in other places it doesn't but it does register the touch
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.380]  So if you run your finger
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.860]  In a circle instead of going like down down down down down down down down in the list
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:49.340]  It goes like down down down up up up down down down up up up down down, you know
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.340]  You know, I mean like one of the problems with the apple tv
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:57.180]  One of the problems with the apple tv like in my belief is that apple is not stringent enough about how things are implemented
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:03.660]  And so you have a range of behaviors across apps not even including those really shitty lazy open gl apps that amazon and others
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.260]  insist on using but like some of them you'll press menu and you're
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.660]  Thrown right out of the I would say the word you did but then i'll get yelled at by your entire audience
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:14.620]  You get thrown right out of the app others you press the menu and you get like
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:18.460]  Given this little thing saying do you want to see more episodes? Do you want to continue this episode?
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:21.740]  Here's information on the episode others like in youtube
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.060]  Sometimes pressing that button will clear whatever pop-up is on the screen in other apps
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.000]  Even if there is a pop-up on the screen throws you out the app again, and there's zero consistency
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.940]  Yeah, we were uh watching movies as a family
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.620]  before before and after christmas a bunch of christmas movies and we were
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.820]  Looking and one night we we didn't have anything to watch
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:45.100]  We we didn't know what to watch and we were surfing around and I said so we look at amazon prime and amy
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.220]  Not even jonas, but amy said I I hate amazon prime and I said why and she says it just looks so junky
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.860]  And I was like, you know what? There's a reason we got married
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.500]  Like she's not usually one to complain about stuff like that
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.540]  But even she thinks their interface just looks like, you know, it's hot garbage
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.300]  It's it doesn't look like you're in a walmart. It looks like you're in like the the warehouse behind the walmart
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.140]  It's it's like netflix and netflix has a whole team making their app
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:15.580]  There's no excuse for amazon to just keep porting that nonsense over. It's it's really so junky looking
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:21.500]  I mean, they've got some good stuff that is exclusive and you know, I watch some stuff there but man the app is always like
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:27.260]  Jesus, nothing is animated. Everything's ugly. It's even a bad font. It's really bad
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.980]  So did you leave it on 60 frames per second?
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.740]  Because that's one of the big deals about the new apple tv is that you could put it on 60 frames per second
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.500]  Or did you revert it back down to like 30 or 24? I haven't touched anything
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.220]  What I don't I don't think anything plays at 60 frames per second
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.060]  Or at least if I if I you know
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.620]  If i've watched it, I I would notice if it was I don't think i've seen it. I don't have to turn it off like
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.460]  It looks motion smooth to me
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.820]  It's like I would go to the disney plus app
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.740]  But i'd watch some of the marvel movies and I know like I know people are saying that it's not but to me
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.580]  It still looks motion smooth, so I couldn't leave it on
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.940]  Oh, maybe I did turn it off then because I don't notice I would notice something that yeah motion smoothie. Um
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.660]  Yeah, it's just too clean
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.500]  May we're still in may
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500]  Apple went to court with epic
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.420]  Yes
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:16.300]  Big versus tim apple. I mean, this was obviously a year-long saga. There there was stuff before the court room
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:23.660]  There was obviously decisions have come afterwards, but we might as well talk about it in may because that's when they actually went to court
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.940]  Yeah
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.100]  It it
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.220]  Doesn't seem like anything surprising came out of the whole thing
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.940]  uh, and it seems like everybody's sort of
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:42.140]  Anybody with any sort of informed opinion during the courtroom was sort of like looks like apples and good grounds here, but yeah
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.980]  It was sort of a bad uninformed opinions got published though. John. It was a bad look for apple though
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:55.420]  You know, and I I still say that tim cook's testimony in particular came across pretty poorly in my opinion
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.660]  um not terribly but just sort of
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.660]  Just sort of uh
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300]  Just a little unseemly, you know
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.620]  Yeah, I can see that like what's weird though
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:13.340]  Is that he plainly he plainly said during his testimony that if if the court decided that there could be transactions outside the app store
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:20.540]  It would be onerous for apple to collect their percentage of those transactions outside the app store and then flash forward a few months
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.260]  People are shocked to discover that google and apple
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.260]  Are going to do this even though they said plainly that that was their intent the whole time
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.660]  Yeah, I think the coverage was one of my problems was the coverage was completely subpar in most cases
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.100]  Some people did a really good job
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:39.900]  But also to me at the very beginning I was interested because it looked like epic was going to try to make a case for
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.420]  You know actually for the users and for developers and things that could be better
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.940]  but the minute they sued google as well and then when they put out their filing
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.900]  And you you paged all the way down and saw what they really wanted was their own app store so that they could be the ones
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:58.060]  Collecting this commission regardless of the amount it it ended up becoming like oh you're opening a new casino
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.100]  And you're haggling with with the city of las vegas over who gets what cut
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:08.700]  Well, it's not just that they wanted their own app store. It's that they wanted their own friction-free app store. I mean, yes meaning
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.540]  You are a joe or jane customer and you've purchased a new
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.860]  phone
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:24.940]  And you've gone right down the line with all the defaults and epic wanted you and still I guess wants you to
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:30.620]  Somehow be able to install the entire epic app store as easily as like a browser ballot
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.300]  As easily as you install any other app right now
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.700]  as opposed to
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.660]  And I have an android phone, you know, I have a pixel
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.660]  four
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.940]  Yeah, uh, you know and I did it I installed the epic app store, you know when this was new
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.460]  uh
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:53.340]  I I honestly think for people who want to be able to side load and want
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.420]  That sort of thing to be possible if you choose to use it
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.300]  That the user experience
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.340]  Google has designed for it
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:09.260]  is extremely reasonable and appropriate and the things they warn you about and the
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:15.820]  The way they phrase their warning are completely appropriate. They're not that they're not overly scary
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.420]  They're they're epic hates it. They're true and they well they hate it because in practice people don't use it
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.940]  Yeah, people don't do it practice. People don't do stuff like that the whole we talked about this before but
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.940]  It seemed to boil down to this argument about what like what choice really means
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:36.080]  Does choice mean that every platform has to offer you a choice between a managed experience?
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.540]  And a completely free form experience or can one platform offer you a managed experience?
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.280]  And another platform offer you the option for a free form experience and people have very different opinions on this
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:55.040]  And very different privileges when it comes to this, but I think that's that's still like console model versus open compute model
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:02.320]  And whether that has to be per platform or whether it can be across platforms. Yeah, I think that that what the epic apple
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.640]  My look back at it in a way. I think i'll view it in hindsight as as it becomes old news as years go on
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.660]  And and I think back to 2021
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.200]  Is less about the actual legal case because apple pretty much won
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.240]  Almost everything and it looks like they're going to win the last remaining thing on appeal
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.520]  And the other thing the thing about letting users
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.640]  You know collecting their email address
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:34.160]  If they choose to give it to you is something they should have given in any way and apple's response to it is sure fine
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.720]  Right, like we we'll just concede that point that we're not even going to fight it but the last remaining point is on this in-app
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.280]  payment thing
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.960]  uh, and what exactly it means and it certainly looks like based on the what we've seen so far that that
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.680]  Judge uh, gonzales rogers
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.560]  Overreached by trying to apply california law to something that it wasn't
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  um
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.380]  It but if there's a downside for apple in it, it's that it exposed
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.240]  The sort of raw nerves of resentment that have grown up
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.320]  In the developer that's a great way to put it, right? It's
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.680]  It's and that resentment was there
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:23.520]  It it wasn't because if if epic hadn't had you know in the alternate universe where the only difference is that epic?
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.840]  Never never chose to make this fight and fortnite is just in the app store like it was a year ago
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.640]  or two years ago, um
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.920]  The resentment would still be there. It's that this the the the this case and people's reactions to it
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:47.680]  Exposed it it it picked up the stone and and we can see the the ugly worms of resentment that are there
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.080]  Built around the app store
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.000]  Built around the app store. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's two sides to that
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.640]  I think because like you see some developers push back on that
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.580]  Um as well, like they're never a uni-mind and it's not just a monoculture
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.120]  So you see some people saying side loading would be great others saying it's going to increase piracy
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.880]  You say some people saying some people saying 30 is ridiculous others say well, yes
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.920]  But I used to pay for all of this and all the different tax filings around the world
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.960]  And so there is I don't think I think by and large the negative sentiment gets over reported
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.760]  The positive sentiment gets underreported, but I do think the biggest thing might take away from this
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:27.440]  Is that apple has not done a very good job in being proactive about this and in the past that suited them
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.920]  Well, because it's been very slow, uh regulation. Um
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.520]  The stuff that the eu does things that the department of justice does it's all been very slow
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.000]  but it seems like it's coming to a head and now we've got correct cases in korea and japan and
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.920]  I forget which other country it was one of one of the eastern european countries
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.920]  Uh the us now as well
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:55.920]  And these they are not tech savvy. You only have to look at the cookie regulations the privacy gdpr regulations
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.120]  They are onerous to the point of being destructive to the people that they're pretending to protect
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.960]  And I think it would be it would be sad if apple wasn't proactive enough in terms of getting ahead of these issues
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200]  that they left it up to being
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.640]  Like again, I go back to the browser ballot. They forced microsoft to protect
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:18.560]  Uh browsers, they forced microsoft to put this ballot up so that fenris and slepnir wouldn't be overwhelmed by the market
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.200]  And the result is everything is chromium now, right? So
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.600]  I I just I don't want to leave it to these people. So I wish apple would be more proactive about it
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.720]  I agree. Let's take a break here and let's thank the sponsor who I spoiled
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.120]  A couple minutes ago memberful great company though. Sorry for spoiling the fact that they're our second sponsor

[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.280]  WWDC
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.040]  What do we talk about for?
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.920]  WWDC I I guess we talked about the virtual stuff was better this year
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:52.640]  Like I thought they did a better job in emulating the lab experience and providing a much better connection point for developers
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.800]  Yeah, it's starting to make me it's I'm starting to get down though because I'm starting to think maybe maybe it's not gonna happen again
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.800]  this year, I mean who knows it's
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.200]  Very hard to predict but you know, they're obviously gonna have to make a decision
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.880]  long before June
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.760]  Yeah, especially because it's not on campus. You have to actually get facilities for it. Yeah, and I do think I
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320]  Don't think it is a
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:25.200]  The fact that you and I are Apple centric in our coverage of the industry. I
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:32.120]  I almost think it's objective not subjective that Apple has done a better job with these
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.000]  virtual only
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.880]  product announcement events than anybody else and
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:45.120]  You know the recent Facebook one where they changed the name to meta was certainly higher level than just about anything else
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.680]  I've seen outside of Apple. Yes, but there was sort animatronic Mark Zuckerberg was almost lifelike
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:58.760]  Well, even in the real world. Well, and they obviously spent a lot on like some kind of I presume like green-screen sort of
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.080]  environments that he was walking around in
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.400]  it was so odd though because the big joke is that he's data from Star Trek and the first thing I just walk into like
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.720]  I know pale blue lighting where he looked completely robotic. I
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240]  Know which must have been self-referential?
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.680]  It was a good show, you know, it's apples very good at this
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:23.760]  I've always thought that this you can tell it most clearly to me with like a daily comic strip
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.400]  It's always so interesting to me has been since I was a little kid and the one I remember
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.320]  Was finding out my elementary school library had I don't know if it was the complete peanuts library, but they had
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.720]  dozens and dozens of Charles Schultz's peanuts books
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:47.440]  Dating back to the early days in like the late I think the late 1950s
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.400]  Yeah, and I always loved that
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.280]  It was one of my favorite comic strips and I remember when I read the early ones
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:59.480]  It was like my my you know, little emoji head, you know, a little poof a smoke came off my head
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:04.000]  I was like, whoa, all the characters look different. This looks so weird. Yes, and
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.140]  Every single comic strip starts like that even you know
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:13.480]  I think what most people would consider the best comic strip of all time Calvin and Hobbes
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:20.120]  The very early ones look slightly different doing County and Garfield to Bloom County Garfield
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.800]  Doonesbury the early Doonesbury's look so different and the way it goes is they you know
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.240]  The artist sort of is working out their personal style and the characters
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:36.920]  look and then they sort of then they hone in on this is it and then
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:43.800]  yeah, like for peanuts find their illustrative voice right and peanuts and Doonesbury are good examples that ran have run for
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.520]  decades and
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:52.480]  Like, you know, like late 80s Doonesbury doesn't really look much different than Doonesbury today
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.080]  Yes, but 70s Doonesbury looks crazy
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:02.800]  TV shows are like that too, but the first season of Seinfeld is very very weird in hindsight
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.880]  And where I'm going with this is that Apple sort of?
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.560]  Carved out there. This is what our
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.000]  remote shows virtual shows are going to look and feel like
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.420]  Very early and they've stuck to it
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:23.080]  I think they've gotten better at it, but yes, there's not like I think if you went back
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.240]  I guess the first one would be last their 2020s
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:34.080]  WWDC. Yeah, I think if you rewatched it and I you know it you and I I know you probably more than me because you're
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.080]  always fishing for
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.080]  For b-roll b-roll, right? Yeah, right. So you've probably actually
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.600]  You've probably watched it more than me. They watched it today, but they kind of defined a style
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  and a look and
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.160]  And right from the get-go really really distinctive has a voice has a character
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.880]  It really is a show
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.480]  The only thing they've done is added like continue to add more and more locations including now all of California, right?
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.940]  Right, but it's the same like drone shots. All right crane moves
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.640]  zips and what's funny is you looked at the early other companies trying to figure this out and
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.960]  They mostly they tried to just film the stage
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.040]  They did a stage show with no audience and filmed it or they had people reading off teleprompters very awkwardly
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.680]  But then about a year in they just Oh Apple taught us how to do this
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:28.800]  Yeah, well and one of the things there's you know, you don't have to notice you don't have to know this but it's like
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.880]  Regular iPhones are bright and
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:38.120]  Well lit if not outdoors like cayenne drants on stage. Yeah
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.720]  yeah, Jeff Williams going for a hike and
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.000]  Pro is in the dark, you know like so 2020 Jaws
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.400]  He wasn't outdoors
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:57.200]  but he was in a dark room with a spotlight talking about the iPhone 12 Pro and then this year he was
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.080]  outside
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.820]  Apple Park at night though, you know
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:06.920]  Like I think inside really canny observation because pro apps always had the dark interface is to yeah
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.400]  Pro is Pro is dark or night and
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.800]  And I think even last year when Jaws was inside on some sort of soundstage to do the announcement
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:23.000]  They did when they did the transition where they show, you know, they they do some kind of drone whether it's
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.480]  Actual drone footage. I think usually it is or some kind of 3d
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.640]  Visual effect it is nighttime though
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:38.200]  They established that it is nighttime at Apple Park and now here's Jaws to talk about the iPhone whatever. Yeah
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.160]  Yeah, Pro is dark regular is bright and sunny
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.320]  I love that attention to detail because it permeates everything from the hardware to the software to the event. Yeah
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320]  Yeah, was this the year where?
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:56.200]  Federighi was in the red convertible. Yes. Yeah, what do you see? Yeah, that was a good that was a good gag. Yeah
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.080]  Yeah, I don't really have much to add
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.320]  I think you're right and from what I've heard that they did a better job with preparation with for the labs
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.120]  And yes, say what you want about Apple's developer relations, and we mentioned the the consternation over the App Store, etc
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.880]  They really do want to knock it out of the park with the labs during WWDC
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.840]  I mean it's you know from the top down
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:23.120]  Including right down to the people responsible for the frameworks who actually run these labs and you get to ask questions
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.000]  it is something they want to do a good job of and
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.320]  Really needed to be invented compared to in-person
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.560]  WWDC and their evangelist
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.360]  I mean other companies similar to Apple have hundreds of
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.000]  Evangelists Apple still has a very tiny evangelist team and they do amazing
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.400]  Amazing work every WWDC. Yeah. Yeah, they really do and
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.880]  Serenity a choice of hats on the YouTube videos this year, which I thought was nice
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.920]  He was on the talk show and now she's on Apple's YouTube channel John that's my journey. I know I
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:04.680]  I I hear her narrating those daily updates for WWDC and I'm like
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.300]  Yeah, am I miss having her on the show? I know the same same
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.640]  Because she was very good too and no offense to you
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.180]  But she was very very good because she speaks faster than I do. She was very good at keep keeping me to
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.280]  Up my pace, you know, yes. Yeah, Microsoft stole Christina Apple stole
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.000]  No fast talkers left. I guess now
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.280]  In June July, there wasn't really any news in July
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:35.620]  Might as well just let's just use up July to talk about the great 2021 Safari tab saga. Yes
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.880]  Yeah, I feel like we've talked about this the entire way through all's well that ends well
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.380]  Maybe but I process concerns me like the fact that it happened concerns me
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:50.160]  Yeah, the fact that they fixed it makes me feel good. Yeah
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:54.440]  You know, the the best thing to do is not to make a mistake
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.560]  But the second best thing to do is recognize mistakes and correct them. Even if it means backing completely out
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.160]  The Safari tabs thing it is alarming because I'd still don't really get how anybody thought
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.020]  It should have did the designs that were unveiled at
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:15.800]  WWDC should have shipped either on either platform and the platform that the the the UI
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:22.080]  Critiques at which I wrote about at length on daring fireball. I know you talked about I did a couple of videos on it
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.200]  It was great. We did videos about it
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:30.120]  So we don't have to rehash what the problems with those designs were specifically to me
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:36.180]  It's worrisome that they shipped and I don't want to blame it on remote work and kovat and that you know
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.920]  If they had been in person
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:44.160]  That this would have been more successfully the the right side of the argument would have won out in person
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.600]  I don't know that that's true. It's possible. I don't know, you know, it's it it could just be purely coincidental
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400]  that this bad design
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880]  Was announced in a year?
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:03.720]  And after a year of no in-person collaboration, I don't know but whoever it was whatever people were pushing for that design
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:09.720]  It's it's very questionable whether they should be in the positions where they are in my opinion
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:15.560]  Well, it it's it's a it's a fake simplicity. It's it's a scarcity in place of actual simplicity
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:21.920]  It's making complexity just to have fewer things which is like an inverse of the of the principle
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:28.280]  But the weirdest thing to me was watching it go public and the public never even got the worst versions of those that was saved
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.040]  For the for the betas but watching it go public and seeing celebrities
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:37.420]  Interact about it on Twitter like seeing a celebrity go what the fuck happened to my to my safari bar
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.080]  Where is it? And then another celebrity going? Oh, they moved it to the bottom and then a bunch of people saying no
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.340]  No, you could move it back and then like this whole discussion around what the hell did Apple just do to their browser
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:53.440]  They it was one of the first things that's another one where I'll drag my wife into it where when she first turned on her
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:58.640]  iPhone 13 Pro and hadn't you know hadn't been following along and
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.100]  You know completed the upgrade and there it is now
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:07.400]  Here's all your stuff and she just turned to me goes with Safari and she was like what the hell is going on
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:13.640]  With Safari and I was and I hadn't said to her. Hey, wait until you get a load of Safari it it
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:20.560]  Very strange in my opinion. Did you revert to the top? Did you use the setting to produce? Oh, sorry search bar back
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.640]  Yeah, I haven't I've kept it at the bottom and I it it still feels weird to me
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:30.380]  Even though it's like half a year later that see but that's and I saw some people I think I wrote about this
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:34.520]  I hope I did I saw some people mentioned that it's weird and on you know
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.960]  It shows that maybe Apple is losing its touch because they don't offer options like that
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.560]  Apple just says here's the way it is and so offering you the option to have it at the top or bottom is on Apple like
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:49.400]  And I would say the opposite I would say where the putting at the top or bottom
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.760]  Offers you the same functionality in the same set of buttons
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:59.060]  It's just you wanted at the top or bottom is very Apple like right and and it really goes back to to
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.600]  Mac OS 10
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.760]  10.0 in
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.600]  2002
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.800]  2001 when the hell was that 2002 whenever it was or even going back earlier to
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.960]  Next step before Mac OS 10 or Mac OS 9 had lots of options to move some things around you can move the control strip
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:24.400]  To wherever the hell you wanted it some of those, you know in a way that in in app kit Mac apps. There's
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:31.920]  Any true Mac style Mac app has the ability to completely customize the toolbar, right?
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.360]  And put whatever, you know all sorts of options, you know and the more rich the app the more configurable
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360]  It is that you can do this
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.240]  configuration options for stuff like that is very Apple like it's
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.880]  it it was the
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200]  two totally different
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.620]  Theories of what a tab is that was on Apple like right? Yes
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.400]  It's not just you want them at the top or bottom it is, you know
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:01.880]  Is it is it something where the window chrome actually takes on the background of the page and you?
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.080]  cram all this stuff into one bar
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.600]  Even though there's plenty of room for it and you have these tabs that don't look like tabs and it's all unfamiliar
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:16.480]  It hurts usability right and nobody was complaining about tabs, you know, it really felt like like a soft problem, right?
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.920]  It really felt like something that Apple has long said repeatedly in many times, you know
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.500]  They don't really, you know talk too much in detail about what they're thinking but they do
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:31.080]  It comes across as anodyne when you're familiar with them and their statements, you know, like the recent
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.740]  wallpaper feature of
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:37.700]  Evans Hanke and Alan Dye's design team, you know
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:43.260]  You could read that and if you're in tune to Apple like we are and like lots of people who listen to this show are
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:47.940]  You could read that and say well, I didn't really learn anything everything they said in there. I sort of already knew
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:49.820]  You know
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:56.780]  I certainly thought that personally and I was way more interested in the photographs because that was unprecedented and really kind of neat
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:01.780]  I really I mentioned on daring fireball how neat it was to see the actual personal
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:08.340]  iPhones of the people on the design team a dozen of them who were in a meeting and how many of them used cases
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:14.780]  How many of them had the wallet attachment which was really surprising to me and I actually spoke to someone who's familiar
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:17.380]  You know familiar with the situation and said yeah
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:22.820]  Actually the the wallet really is pretty popular with that team that's actually you know, and and somebody who verified
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:27.660]  Yeah, that that was actually their real notebooks and personal iPhones. That wasn't staged
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:32.940]  I mean, they were obviously aware a photographer was in the room, but I thought that was pretty neat. Yeah, absolutely, but
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.540]  The Safari thing. I don't know. It's it's and there is something I
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.060]  get
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:47.780]  Wanting the the having the itch for new right and and that new it excites a certain part of your new
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:49.780]  and changed and different
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:52.020]  Releases
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:57.380]  endorphins from a certain part of your brain and I know that when I was younger
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:03.100]  That part of my brain was way more active than it is now that I'm older and that's why
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:07.460]  Like in the 90s. I was totally all-in on
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:14.660]  Utilities for the classic Mac OS that led you completely reskin the whole OS, you know, there was the iron extension
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:17.620]  There was one that from the same Greg Landweber
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:21.460]  That made it look like the B OS where you had those yellow
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:26.260]  folder tab style windows and then there was forget the ethic
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.180]  Forget what it was called that where you had all you know
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:33.460]  Just an unlimited number of themes you could download and just completely reskin the whole OS
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:40.420]  Oh, I was into that and I customized my icons and yeah customize everything that you could customize and thought it was cool
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.980]  And people, you know younger people I think especially are doing that now on
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:50.900]  iOS with the the weird not weird but sort of convoluted compared to how easy
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:55.220]  It could be in theory if you could just install like an icon pack
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.420]  But yeah, you know using shortcuts to open apps and then you can put a custom icon on the shortcut
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:05.120]  So therefore effectively it's like giving the app a custom icon. I totally get it
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:10.340]  and I think that the where I'm going is is that I think the people who
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:17.180]  Claimed to like the new Safari designs exactly as Apple showed them in June and I you know
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:23.340]  I got certainly given how much it's time. I spent writing about Safari on both iOS and Mac. I heard from them
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.660]  But same and I honestly, you know tried to give it as open-minded as I could
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:33.700]  but all I could really hear when I really thought about it is I like this because it's new and novel and
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:39.100]  Yeah, or aesthetic like there were some people who just like that looked clean, right? It didn't matter how it worked
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:45.060]  But it looked clean. It looked clean. It was sort of a I like this and it is sort of a design is how it looks
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:48.780]  Mentality. Yes, but I think it's really really telling
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:56.660]  Now that they actually more or less reverted Safari's tabs on both platforms to exactly how they were before
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.020]  That they're not complaining
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:06.780]  Right and you can get the condensed look on the Mac if you really want it. It's in there and preferences
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:09.220]  You just don't hear anybody talking about it though
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:15.880]  The people who defended it defended it in my opinion and in hindsight it shows in a very shallow way
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.880]  Whereas those of us who really criticized it were criticizing in a very deep way
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.640]  And see I don't mind if Apple experiments because like I always go back to the 2015 Mac book
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.640]  It gave us both the force touch trackpad and the butterfly keyboard
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:36.680]  Butterfly keyboard was bad first touch trackpad was terrific Apple tried both. It's the speed of recovery
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:43.600]  Right, and I do think that part of that delay in that era was that Apple was sort of
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.640]  Internally on the Mac and I think you know, the Mac is the one that suffered the longest on a couple of products
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:52.080]  you know bad keyboards on all the MacBooks and
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.760]  Non retina MacBook Air for way too long
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:04.120]  I I really think that they were caught between knowing that they were going to move away from Intel but not really being sure
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:11.600]  What when the trigger could be pulled? Yeah and wanting to save good stuff for the post
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.080]  Apple silicon era
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:20.080]  Yeah, anyway, all's well that ends well Safari tabs sanity did prevail. Thankfully. Yes
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.880]  It is was very strange and it felt like way too close of a call
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.700]  That because I really don't know if they would have shipped it as as they intended early in the summer
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:34.240]  I really think I would switch to another browser and I don't know what what browser that would be
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.720]  Yeah, same
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.440]  Because I like and I gave it a shot. I used it as was for
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.840]  The entire beta period and I was still making mistakes every day and I shouldn't even have to think about how my browser works
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.320]  Yeah, it's they and they've done it
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:55.440]  It's just so it must be so frustrating for some people inside Apple because they've done such a good job, especially on the phone of
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.400]  designing
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.400]  one of the best
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.080]  iOS apps
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.400]  on the platform period Safari and
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.960]  It and again not even getting into any of the political arguments about Apple's refusal to allow alternate
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.600]  Rendering engines, which is a web platform thing. We won't get into but just as a user interface
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.520]  It's just really really good and useful
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.800]  And it's an amazing team like the Webkin Safari team is one of the best teams in the world
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.160]  It's not even at Apple, but one of the best teams in the world, right in two different ways
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:34.560]  right, like the team making you know, the actual underlying rendering engine and JavaScript engine and doing it in a secure way and and
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:42.080]  Is doing great work and the user interface no matter what the engine was is rendering the actual content
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.920]  you know does a great job and
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:51.480]  It was all just sort of thrown away for something that somebody thought looked cool and cleaner some and certainly looked cleaner and more minimal
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:59.480]  Yeah, very strange. All right, moving on. We've got August. The only thing I have for August was that that that's when Apple announced
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  their child safety initiatives
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.000]  Yeah
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Which you know, it's interesting to me because like this this shows the dichotomy of Apple sometimes because this and I'm blanking on what the other
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.480]  One was but there's there are several times where Apple puts together
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.240]  what is
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.840]  objectively in like a completely
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:23.600]  Solid engineering solution like if you're gonna design something that has to achieve these goals
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.800]  This is the best way to engineer it
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:33.360]  But there is a complete disconnect from how emotionally people are gonna react to it because we're not entirely rational engineering people, right?
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  and
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.400]  They got I think they could you know
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:44.480]  It's safe to say they got more pushback than they were probably expecting and a lot of it most of it
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:50.000]  oh, you know some of it is philosophical and I get it which is hey, this is my device and
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.800]  Nothing should be going on on my device on device
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:00.000]  That is going to wind up reporting me to the authorities, you know
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.440]  Yeah, I get nothing should be exfiltrated without my permission. Yes, I get that I do
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.280]  except that they
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.720]  were only
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:16.800]  Wanting to do this that the CSAM fingerprinting against the known database from the National Child Safety
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.680]  Whatever the organization is
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:26.240]  If you're using iCloud photos for sync, so yeah, I get it that it's on device
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.520]  I'm sympathetic to that argument
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:34.280]  But it wasn't like everybody who uses iOS 15 is going to have this happen whether you use it or not
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.600]  It's just sort of like the agreement of using our
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:44.040]  Photo sync service and a cloud-based storage is that you're going your image
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:50.200]  the images are going to be Matt the fingerprints of those images are going to be matched against this known database and if if you
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.360]  Are uncomfortable with that or don't like it then you know, you should opt out of iCloud photos
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.600]  I think the difference was because like everybody does this and that's that's a horrible thing
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.040]  But everybody does do this but like Google and Facebook and they all do it on the cloud
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.520]  So if you turn them off
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.280]  It's completely gone where when you turn apples off the code is still there
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.200]  It's inert, but the code is still there and I think on a philosophical level
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:15.640]  It was a privacy solution, but it offended people on a sanctity level, right?
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.920]  That's a good way to put it right and if you close your eyes and didn't know which where the matching
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.640]  Against the fingerprints was going on. You wouldn't be able to tell whether I
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:33.440]  Cloud, you know Apple's solution is doing the fingerprinting matching on device and Google and Facebook and others
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.440]  Are doing it on the server side
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  The end result should be the same
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  You know, I get the philosophical
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.240]  My hope and like I don't know if they'll do it
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.800]  But my hope is just to satisfy both take like that private relay
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:54.700]  Implementation have the stuff put on to a separate private server have a check there and then move to Apple that way
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:43:00.160]  It's not happening on your device that way Apple still has zero knowledge and then hopefully everyone can go back to living in peace and harmony
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.840]  Yeah, I don't think that's gonna I don't think it's gonna work though
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.080]  Cuz I really and again I have no inside knowledge of this and of I probably
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:13.760]  Among all the teams at Apple it the security team is almost certainly one of the tightest lift, you know
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.440]  so it's not gonna leak even through a little birdie, but just
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:25.640]  Looking at what Apple wants to happen in the direction of things going. I just I still think that this whole thing is sort of being
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520]  motivated by a desire to move
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:36.040]  Eventually all of iCloud to end-to-end encryption and in that case some sort of middleman server
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:41.880]  Would it wouldn't be possible to have the fingerprinting done there the most awful you would layer with the whole technical thing
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:46.320]  But I think you would layer that you would layer levels of encryption the same way they do for private relay. Yeah
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:54.280]  Yeah, I think you're right like when you look at the legacy contacts the retrieval cut because some of the problems the problem Apple faced
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.520]  initially with iCloud was that
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:03.800]  Most people losing data is way more common than having data stolen and people were locking themselves out of all this early two-factor
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.640]  authentication stuff
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.320]  It was one of Apple's biggest support problems people would just lose their keys and Apple couldn't help you recover
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.160]  Right, and that is not a good enough answer
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.240]  So they had to make it so that your backups were fail-safe instead of fail-secure
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.480]  But that means that they're subject to subpoena. So now Apple is setting up
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.240]  Like you said these things where they don't have to worry about
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.120]  Actionable material you can get like you can assign a contact so that if you lose
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.840]  Access to an Apple can still send something to somebody else doesn't have to write them who has access to it
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.000]  And then they can start locking down the rest of the backups, right?
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.880]  I and I really do think that that's where they're going and I really I know you and I have talked about this
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:42.840]  you know, but it really you and I both have
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.440]  Sources who work in Apple retail who very you know
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.920]  It's non-stop over the years that is a constant problem of people who forget their password can't get their stuff
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:57.360]  Yes their phone, you know, they left it in a cab and now it's gone and that's where all their photos were
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.200]  But they don't know there. I thought a dummy thing
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.560]  I locked myself at a Dropbox when they first set up to FA it's
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:10.360]  And being able to say I trust this other person or these two people completely. I trust them
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.480]  That's how much I trust them
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:18.220]  You know like a spouse type situation or it for an older person like my parents that they trust me
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:23.620]  They could list both me and my sister, you know as as trusted people who could help them do this
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:29.540]  And then it ties in with the legacy contact thing too for you know when they die
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:37.620]  But I do think that that's where Apple's going and I kind of feel like what they regret is not having had the foresight
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:43.100]  Way back when to engineer I clay if they could do it all over again
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:50.140]  I'm I'm quite sure of it that they would engineer iCloud to do everything other than email and end-to-end
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:56.020]  Encrypted all along and email being the exception because it's the nature of the I map and SMTP
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.260]  Protocols is that it can't be end-to-end encrypted
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.100]  And PGP is onerous on a user. Yeah
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:05.700]  Well, that's and it's still it the protocol isn't end-to-end encrypted, right?
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:10.580]  Like you can use something like PGP to get strong encryption for your email
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:15.380]  But stuff like the email headers even with PGP the email headers aren't you know?
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:19.620]  The subject line is still out there in the open. The recipients are still out there in the open
[01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:23.140]  It's just the nature of email. So, you know, this is not even get into it
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.940]  This is put an asterisk next to email
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:31.100]  But I I know this for a fact having spoken to multiple people who were involved with it that I message that was part
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:36.860]  Of the you know, like day one, let's build our own messaging thing to sort of replace SMS
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.220]  Day one on the whiteboard end-to-end encryption for everything
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:47.380]  Let's let's engineer this in a way so that if law enforcement says we would like to have this we can't get it
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:50.860]  We can't we we can just say we can't give it to you right now
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:56.620]  And that is true for iMessage that the big escape hatch right now is iCloud backup
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:00.420]  Because iCloud backup is not end-to-end encrypted
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:06.540]  And so like when the FBI goes to Apple with a warrant and says we would like so-and-so's, you know
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:13.060]  I messages for this warrant and here are the reasons and Apple looks at the warrant and says, okay, that's good
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:20.380]  they they give them they can give them and have to now because of the warrant their iCloud backup and the iCloud backup contains
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:24.940]  Their iMessages, so it's not that the FBI has access to iMessage
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:29.320]  They can't it's end-to-end encrypted but iCloud backup which contains iMessage
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.700]  Content isn't I think they would like it to be and I think can turn it off
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:38.980]  But again for most people they care more about losing their messages than they do about getting them subpoenaed, right?
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:43.260]  And this is one of those things that Apple is so good at having their eye on the long game
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:49.140]  You know an Apple pay is a perfect example of this where yeah, there is no way Apple pay was going to be an overnight success
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:53.820]  It's just it's just not the way things work, right? But it's a slow steady
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:48:01.100]  Incremental more and more places accept it more and more people will get comfortable using it there. It's a long game the
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:07.900]  moving all of iCloud to end in encryption if that's really their plan and I really hope it is is like a 10-year thing because
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.220]  You've got to wait
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:14.680]  You know it. All right. I'm an early adopter. Let's say they do it for iOS 16 next year
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.780]  I don't know. That's to say optimistically and I upgrade to iOS 16 right away
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:25.300]  Well anybody who I'm sending iMessages to who's still on iOS 15 and is still backing up their stuff
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:28.860]  That way is still using the iOS 15 iCloud backups
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.300]  You've got to wait for everybody to get to the new thing
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.100]  so that everybody including the people you're sending stuff to I
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:42.220]  Think that's where they're going. There's an optimistic scenario where if let's say you're you're not really
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:47.340]  You don't like this fingerprinting see Sam thing. You don't want Apple to do it
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:54.720]  There's an optimistic scenario where maybe right now because I think it's mostly political and I know people hate politics
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:58.660]  But I think it's about political cover where they can say
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:06.460]  Let's say they they move iCloud photos to end-to-end encryption and law enforcement and politicians say well
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:08.460]  this is going to be a haven for
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.020]  child pornography and people who spread it and
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:17.340]  It this study, you know, it's insidious. It's more widespread. You know, it's a it is a serious problem
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.660]  It's a serious problem around the world that in terrorism or whatever
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:24.860]  Everyone brings up all the time right but but the C stamps and Apple could say with the fingerprinting thing
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:28.900]  Well, here's what we're doing about it. We're checking all these things before we do it
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:36.420]  If it had gone without any protests at all, and they hadn't delayed it whatever that's I think that's why they're they're doing is for
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.420]  political cover to allow
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:45.800]  end-to-end encryption for the overwhelming majority of users who are have no involvement with C Sam material at all
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.640]  The current state though is maybe you know, not so bad where where they're you know
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.120]  And I know that they updated their child safety web page last week or the week before
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:04.360]  To remove mention of that of the fingerprinting stuff and only talk about the stuff that's actually shipping now in iOS
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.160]  15.2 or 0.1. Where are we up to? I forget. I don't even know the fifteen point three
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:19.500]  Oh, yeah, I'm on the beta. Well, whatever my head but the other features the one like for opt-in feature for kids in an
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:26.960]  iCloud family account to have the parents turn on a thing to let the kid get warned if they are sending or receiving
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.680]  messages that machine learning identifies as being sexually inappropriate
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:38.920]  They adapted that to complaints very in a very good way where they took off the feature that would autumn
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:44.760]  You know that would optionally allow parents to be notified whenever it happens instead. It's all about the kids
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.440]  For their safety because they might be in a dangerous situation
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.480]  At home, it's opt-in
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.780]  Nobody gets to it gets it turned on by default for their kids
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:58.080]  But if you're worried about it and you want the feature you can turn it on for your kids
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.120]  I think it's a good feature
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:06.240]  They the other feature that they updated and released and I think was completely on controversial was updating
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:10.880]  Siri's ability to help you if you're having some you know
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.280]  different types of
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:20.120]  crises like if you're yeah feel like you're being abused and need help and that sort of thing and give you
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.460]  Contact in from you know, don't don't try to get your help from Siri, but Siri will tell you here contact
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:28.120]  This organization and they'll get you help
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.480]  Uncontroversial that ship and that's what I'm just spitballing. Well, that's what that's the wet
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:36.760]  It's a very Apple like thing to do to update the page to talk about
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:40.160]  Here's what shipping and not talk about what might still be coming
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:46.280]  but when the press people in the media asked they did not say we've abandoned that it's just
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.080]  in limbo
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.660]  No, and they're very like again
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:56.520]  They're a very focused company and they their their job is to solve these problems and I'm just spitballing here because you have
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.440]  Anything that you can think of on a podcast or a YouTube video apples had the money and time to prototype
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:04.000]  But there could also be like just to a sway
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.040]  I'm trying to think about what people's complaints are and to assuage them
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:12.440]  It could be that there's a regular version of photos and an online version of photos and if you opt into iCloud photos
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:18.160]  It downloads the online version if you opt out it downloads the regular version and then you don't have that code on your if having
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:22.640]  That code on your device is a problem for you and you worry about it being abused or any of a number of things
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:29.000]  You have like the inert version or you have the active version and then there's nothing really to complain about because you're having the choice
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.760]  There yeah
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:37.400]  Anyway, my hope is that maybe by running this see Sam fingerprinting up the flagpole having it
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:45.360]  Shot down by some advocates for various reasons and saying okay well back to that
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:48.240]  We're going back to the drawing board with it, but we've thought about it
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:55.400]  It might give them cover because it's neither canceled nor shipping. Yes, and it's floating earth feature, right?
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:01.080]  It's a Schrodinger feature and it could stay there for a while, you know until people it just you know
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.080]  maybe end-to-end encryption for photos ships and
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.800]  You know anybody who says hey, but what about?
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:13.280]  See Sam material Apple can say, you know, we've told you, you know, what's on the drawing board, but we're still working on it
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.720]  We're soliciting feedback. Yeah, we're still listening feedback and maybe they just solicit feedback
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:23.000]  Indefinitely, right but that they tried right and and they could say look there, you know
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  I op-eds even in the New York Times from esteemed people whose feedback we value and we're still considering it and maybe
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.720]  You know because it's neither canceled nor shipping
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.400]  it can sort of stay in that state forever and serve their needs politically while
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.960]  also not
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.960]  triggering anything that actual
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:49.340]  Privacy advocates and people concerned about the feature being abused or being buggy or whatever their concerns are
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.940]  Yeah, you know placate them as well. So, let's see. I don't want to derail us
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:56.540]  But Apple is also navigating a climate where you have a lot of countries not just China
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:01.280]  Demanding data repatriation not wanting their citizens data stored on US or other servers
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.540]  You have a bunch of countries including Australia trying to propose laws against encryption
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:09.640]  Just trying to make everything open and so Apple has to navigate all those things at the same time. Yeah
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.260]  Yeah, well and it's the the pull it it it probably will never stop
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:19.500]  But the politicians wish is for a magical form of encryption that yes, it doesn't exist
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:23.020]  That has a key for good guys that won't work for bad guys
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.700]  It'll burn the hands of bad guys. I try to touch it
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.940]  All right on to September and Apple is back at it big month
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:35.240]  They're their big annual event went off and they announced all of the iPhones 13
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.620]  the new iPad mini
[01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:40.260]  iOS 15 and watch OS 8 shipped and
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:43.720]  And Kevin Lynch takes over Titan OS
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:45.960]  Yeah
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:49.200]  Let's start with the Lynch thing. The Lynch thing is interesting
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.120]  because
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:57.380]  And I've mentioned this a couple times in recent weeks, but there's a big difference, you know, Apple's supposed
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.340]  to
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:06.000]  Upcoming new platforms are well, maybe three but there's AR and VR which aren't very different things
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.400]  if you really think about you know, if VR where it's goggles that
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.720]  ob
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  Struck your view if they're off
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.720]  You know and there's rumors that they're gonna have cameras so you could see through but that's that's not the same as actually seeing as
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:22.400]  Opposed to mixed reality. Yeah, right as opposed to plans to make actual
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:29.240]  Regular eyeglasses that you see through with you know, possibly corrective lenses if you need them that would project
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:33.120]  You know or some sort of user interface in your field of vision
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.960]  But let's just say this way I can describe it like for people who aren't sure what all it means
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:44.200]  It's like think of the Apple VR headset as a personal Apple TV where it's really immersive and you have the same like Apple fitness
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:46.380]  TV shows video games
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:52.840]  Like all that kind of content music concerts and then think of the glasses like an Apple watch that's on your face instead of your
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.480]  Wrist and it's all about convenient notifications layered on top of reality, right?
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.480]  It's a good way to put it, but let's say that's one product AR VR and then there's Titan OS the autonomous
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.280]  Car slash whatever else might be autonomous
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:11.180]  And Titan has been through has been tumultuous and that's just what we know on the outside
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:16.900]  Lord only knows what people on the inside have seen but just knowing what we've known from the outside, you know
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:23.300]  We've you know, so-and-so is running it. We've they're gone. Let's bring Bob Mansfield back and
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:25.980]  You know, which you know, it's a man's fear
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:33.380]  And on the software side now, Kevin Lynch is in charge as of September and
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.340]  I
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:39.300]  Think that there's there's a couple of aspects of this number one
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:43.920]  He's done a terrific job with watch OS watch OS has been regular
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:50.140]  It has been improved steadily, but I also think it's a sign of you know
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:53.500]  Watch OS is mature, right? I'm not saying that it's done
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:57:01.420]  You know in the same way that the Mac which started in 1984 is not done and is still having new releases and there's new features
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:05.180]  but it's it is cemented as
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:10.060]  What it is, right and it's incremental here henceforth, right?
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:13.940]  and if Kevin Lynch has proven himself to be a
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:15.740]  successful
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:18.140]  manager and executive of a
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:25.320]  nascent platform that is completely liquid and isn't cemented yet and really needs to be
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:28.100]  bootstrapped from
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:33.380]  Nothing to a shipping project. It seems like that's this is the time for him to move because
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.220]  It's so interesting too because like I don't know if it's a one-to-one thing
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:41.280]  but the previous big hire at Titan was Dan Dodge who was CEO of
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:46.220]  QNX which was like a real-time operating system and that seemed very like
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:54.180]  foundational to what this had to be where Kevin's got this amazing talent for taking incredibly complicated things like health technologies fitness technologies
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:59.000]  communication technologies and making them incredibly easy to understand and glance at in
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:05.240]  Like a watch in very small amounts of time and that seems like a much higher level much more human part of the software
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:10.840]  Experience. Yeah, and it's a you know, it's a famous Steve Jobs axiom, but real artists ship
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:18.040]  Yeah, and Kevin Lynch during his stint at Apple so far has proven himself to be a real artist in that regard. Yes and
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:23.480]  And Titan seemingly could use a little bit of that. Yeah
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.680]  So I I tend to think that it is
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.240]  You know, and I know that ostensibly
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.200]  WatchOS is still under Lynch's in the hierarchy, too
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:39.680]  But I can't help but think that it's not a 50-50 thing for his attention, you know that well
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.280]  Evan doll took over the health component. He has a little bit less on his plate, but they're all over over, right?
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:49.440]  Their plates are all very full right way, which is not a minor part of the watch software efforts, right?
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:51.440]  It's a major major part
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:58.680]  So I think that's interesting iPhones 13 iPad mini iPad mini design. I don't have much to say it's nice
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:05.760]  I'm glad it's still there. It's a fascinating product going back to what we were talking about with the Mac, you know the timeline for
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:13.760]  iPad mini updates has always been multi-year. It has never been even close to an annual product. It's like no, it's yeah
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:16.920]  Yeah, even less than the iPad air. That's saying something right? It's like, you know
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:23.240]  Even if it's perfectly on time and didn't miss is shipped right on schedule. It's like an every three or four year thing
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:29.120]  It was April 20 2019 and then September 2021. Yeah. Well, that's like two plus years
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:35.040]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if this one lasts more than two years. Honestly, what more do you want? It's great
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:40.480]  The only controversial thing was that they moved the display drivers to the side and that made it when you looked in portrait orientation
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:44.200]  You could see the yeah refresh rate scrolling more than you could on previous versions
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:44.520]  Yeah
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:50.360]  but people seem to have piped down about that I defer to my son whose eyes are both young and
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.640]  excellent in
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:58.240]  and he's very very picky about frame rates and stuff like that and even he was like
[01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.480]  See it. Yeah, but it's alright, you know, and and you kind of have to do it on purpose
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:11.240]  it is interesting and it is true and it speaks to Apple's high standards for displays and scrolling and stuff that none of their other
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.680]  product or
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.040]  very few of their products have anything even close to that sort of
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:21.000]  Well, if you put them under a high-speed camera, they all do it. That's that's the thing. That's how displays work
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:24.480]  It's just this one people could catch on faster, right or and it was
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:30.680]  Perceptible to the naked to say at least some people's naked eyes, but not mine the iPhones 13
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:35.840]  I don't have a lot to say in this battery life tremendous, but I will say that I forgot to charge mine
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:38.640]  And it's fun to like I was like, why is my iPhone at 30%?
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:45.040]  I realized I hadn't charged it in two days. It really is true, you know, and it's interesting there was I'll tie in a
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  What are we up to the a15?
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:52.800]  there was I don't want to throw the guy under the bus and I forget his name, but somebody who's
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:01:01.120]  a purported chip expert right after the keynote had a very widely circulated medium post saying that Apple's run out of steam on
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.240]  silicon and
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:11.120]  The brain drain from employees who've left to other companies, you know, it's obviously I mean no surprise that
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:17.320]  Apple silicon engineers are in demand given the tremendous success that they've had
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.280]  But that now this is the year where it's caught up to them
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:23.200]  And now you know, they've got flat performance year-over-year
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:30.520]  Because they're not bright based on the the proof being that they didn't brag about year-over-year performance improvements and only
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.880]  Bragged during the keynote about performance against their unnamed
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:42.800]  Competitors on the Android side, but turns out a15 is pretty much in line performance wise with the increases
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:48.320]  We've seen in previous years, but even with that when a man tech gets their hands on it and does an actual right?
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:55.560]  But even with that even with the fact that the CPU and the GPU and the neural engine of all improved year-over-year
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.200]  at an impressive
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:00.680]  clip
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.640]  Clearly the main thrust of the a15 was battery life improvement
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.280]  I mean, it's it's the most dramatic difference, right and and
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.000]  To me just say this and we can even move on is the fact that the iPhone
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:22.120]  13 mini yes gets better battery life than the iPhone 12 regular
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:23.680]  There you go
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:28.160]  I think I'd like the only thing I'd like to add is like there was two things that bothered me one was the glee in
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.260]  Which people jumped on to that and you know narrative like even people in the Apple community were like, haha
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.920]  This is the end of the road for Apple, which was really a weird look for me
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.920]  But also like when you actually look at the industry Qualcomm just announced famously
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:47.680]  They have these junkets every year where they fly everybody to Hawaii and announce their processors for the next year
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.960]  Those processors still aren't great IP like compared to what Apple is doing
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.460]  They're still two years behind but and that's with the people from Nuvia that they say like there was no brain drain from Apple
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:03.080]  That's a complete narrative fabrication some people left, but that's an incredibly deep bench on Apple Silicon team
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:06.200]  That didn't help Qualcomm and they're still saying well
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.420]  Maybe they need to do more of it like inject more of that
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:14.460]  Like there's not provable either way and that just makes the entire story that much more galling to me to begin with
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:17.180]  Yeah, it's always you know, be careful
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:23.360]  Be careful whenever you read an article that is telling you what you want to hear, right?
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.940]  Oh, you should always second, you know, you know, take a step back and or look at the numbers, right?
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:33.380]  Like I think what part of the bigger problem is that it's really hard. Like I call it benchmark LARP
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:36.620]  But people are pretending to do benchmarks. It's really hard
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:41.340]  like it takes the best experts at a Nantec a lot of incredible hand coding to get even the
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:47.140]  surface level stuff that they admit that they get and most people don't know what's hitting an efficiency core versus a
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:53.980]  Performance core like the efficiency cores are 30% faster this year and the performance cores are way more efficient. The graphics cores are
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.660]  phenomenally faster
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:58.060]  but people don't know when they're hitting a graphics core or a
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:04.180]  rendering engine and they just throw up these numbers as if they mean something and then everyone writes a bunch of articles and it's
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.460]  It's it's suboptimal
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:11.780]  Another good year another good year for the camera team and I moved I spent
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:19.420]  2020 with my for the first time ever did not buy a top-of-the-line iPhone. I bought the iPhone 12 regular and
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:22.260]  Because you know and I was correct
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:28.260]  I probably wouldn't really need the camera much and that what I was missing was of course the 2x camera that the iPhone 12 Pro
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:32.440]  Had yeah, and I bought it mainly for how the device felt and you know again
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.380]  It's that privilege of having them all to review and spend time with and not just talk
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:43.540]  You know feel for five minutes while it's tethered to a table in an Apple store this year though
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:47.380]  The camera stuff was overwhelming and I bought the 13 Pro. I
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:53.160]  Will say this several months in now of dated daily iPhone 13 in my pocket
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:59.020]  My opinion on the hand feel of these devices remains unchanged. I really don't like it
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:04.060]  I don't like the feel of the stainless steel band. I think that the buttons feel too sharp
[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:06.660]  I feel the steel band overall is
[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:13.940]  Little slippy and I do not like the frosted matte back because it is slippery
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:21.020]  It is as no grip no tack at all. I would pay extra to get an iPhone 13 Pro
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:25.100]  with the camera with the aluminum body and
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:30.620]  Glossy glass back of the regular iPhone 13, which which isn't sticky
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:37.500]  But has the tackiness like I've often said of like a clean basketball court and that you know your fingers
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:43.620]  You know grip it the way that sneakers clean sneakers on a clean basketball court make the squeak, you know
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.620]  And you get you get traction. I
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:50.180]  Find it. So this is the first time in all the years of iPhone where I
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:57.420]  I use a case on a daily basis simply because I really and and I just tried it last week at like Christmas
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:06:03.700]  Like let me try to go in caseless again, which I would like to do. I'm not even going many places with the kovat stuff
[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:09.860]  I'm not like locked in but I'm not going many places. I don't need to protect it. I just find it unpleasant in my hand
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:12.820]  I really do. It's my biggest disappointment with it
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:18.860]  And my biggest hope for next year is that the pros go to you know, there's rumors
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:22.460]  They might go to titanium. That would be great. I love the feel of titanium
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.780]  But also that sandwich again like the iPhone 4 which would be nicer
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:30.100]  Yeah, I find it looks better but feels worse like it like if I just look at it
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:34.100]  It looks phenomenal the design against one of those retro designs, but it doesn't feel great
[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:36.260]  And the other issue I have is I love that
[02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:43.340]  They have this this new ceramic shield glass because I drop it all the time and it's never once broken a crack on me
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.620]  Like I drop it all the time
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:50.420]  But the reason I drop it all the time is because it's so slippery it falls off everything like it's not pixel six
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:57.660]  Slippery that falls off flat tables. I don't know how it does it right does this stills falls off almost everything and the way that
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:02.220]  the that chemically treated glass and ceramics work is the better the
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:07.060]  Shatter resistance the worse the scratch resistance because one is hardness and one is toughness, right?
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:08.300]  It's like I'm gonna get this wrong
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:10.620]  But it's like you like a you can scratch a hammer with a diamond
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:15.060]  But you can smash a diamond with a hammer and I would love if Apple would make a way tackier
[02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:18.620]  Phone that didn't fall as much because then they wouldn't need as much
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.780]  Shatter present resistance and they can increase the scratch resistance again because I also scratch them all the time
[02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:28.180]  Yeah, so that's my big wish for 14 is yes, I would like to go caseless
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:35.060]  I would like to be pleasant pleasant in my hand which includes both not feeling too sharp or glossy and
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.820]  Having a back that you know, my hands
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:44.540]  Have some tack on to as opposed to this crazy matte finish, which does look nice
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:46.900]  But is for a flat surface
[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:53.500]  Just not good in my opinion. I have one other beef and I know everyone's gonna yell USB-C
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:55.200]  I don't care USB-C is just a plug
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.620]  I'm happy with lightning as a plug but it's still USB to speeds like the letters are the plug shape
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:07.240]  The numbers are the data transfer rate and we have ProRes video on which is 6 gigs a minute and I shoot ProRes video
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:14.220]  and I've got to use USB to speeds in 2021 to pull that off and I can't believe Apple made a chip that is so
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:20.420]  Good at recording every frame of ProRes video a storage controller that can record it all but not an iOS system
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:26.260]  That will let me transfer it off even over like lightning 2.0 or whatever at USB 3 speeds or faster
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:33.160]  Yeah, I never shoot ProRes, but I add the same price mentioned this before but I do shoot 4k and shoot the end
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.200]  But you know, who knows if it'll be remote this year, but two years in a row my you know
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:44.040]  remote interview with Apple executives and we want to get get it in editing as soon as possible and getting
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.740]  You know the 90 minutes of 4k footage off the phone is yes
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:52.920]  Really really bad. So again it let's talk not
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:59.340]  It's not the technology, you know USB-C. Yeah and stick it on the phone. It's let's solve the problem
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:03.800]  The problem is you've made these cameras that shoot incredibly great video
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:10.360]  But that video is humongous including ProRes, which is super humongous and it's gigabytes a minute, right?
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:13.900]  You've you've you've made this thing, which is amazing
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:18.760]  Truly it's amazing that you could shoot ProRes video on these things and it looks good
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:24.640]  It's like a Mac Pro from 2019 in my hands right 2021, but you've got to you know, there's
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:31.700]  Anybody who's shooting ProRes for a good reason as opposed to just stumbled into wonders what the preference is
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:34.800]  But if you're shooting it for a good reason you want to get it off the phone
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:37.160]  Yes. Yes
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.460]  All right, that's got to be high on the list. They have to know this they have to know this hopefully
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:47.600]  Well, there's that rumored like 80 minute 80 gigabit per second wireless transfer speed but have that land the same year as promise
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:51.600]  I just appreciate what else that's it for the hardware. Let's see
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:58.060]  Should we talk I guess iOS 15 and watch OS 8. I mean we might as well they shipped in September, right?
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:01.500]  Yeah, live text was the big highlight for me. Yeah, absolutely
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:05.180]  It's it's really and and I see every once in a while
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:09.040]  I run into a spot in a certain app or something where it doesn't work and I'm like
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:12.980]  Yeah, what the hell app name, you know, let's get with the program
[02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:17.960]  But that video of the kids using their iPhone to steal the kids notes in front of them at school. Oh, yeah. Oh my god
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:22.820]  It's really terrific. I don't really have much to say about iOS 15. It's a solid release
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:30.980]  I think I know Joanna had in her newsletter not her column recently had a thing commenting about Apple's dot
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.420]  releases and
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:33.980]  She wasn't complaining about it
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:40.140]  But just observing that then you know in recent years the new way of being an iPhone user is that throughout the year?
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:44.980]  You get software updates and some of them introduce new features so that you know
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:51.180]  It's not just a once a year thing where you figure out if you really want to stay on top and you've got to figure out
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:54.380]  Where and how to use new features throughout the year?
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:01.780]  I think that Apple has found its footing and its pace on this and it is a very sustainable
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:10.180]  Both a schedule and a strategy and that they've sort of they it not that they've given up
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:14.180]  I ideally they'd like to have as many tentpole features that get announced at
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:20.400]  WWDC ship in September in the dot O of the new big release is possible
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.760]  But that they're just completely
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.360]  Rational about looking at the state of where these features are and
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:32.920]  Letting them ship when they are and you know
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:39.960]  it's it's certainly an art form to look at those features in May while they're planning WWDC and
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  figure out
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:48.520]  Well, this definitely won't be available in September, but we should be able to ship this in you know
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:54.560]  Let's say February and being right about it, you know, like they you know, I don't think they've missed anything
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:12:02.040]  I don't think they've had like X is coming announced at a WWDC and gone a whole calendar year without it
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:09.620]  No, like like usually well a couple quick things one is this has always happened like but previously it was easier to digest
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:15.120]  because Steve would come out and announce the new iPod touch and there'd be a couple updates associated with that which would go into the
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:21.080]  0.1 and then he'd announce the iPad and there'd be a couple updates associated with that that would go into the dot 2 or dot 3
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:25.320]  So just they never spoke about them until they were ready to go into those point releases
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:31.220]  but some really big things have gone into the point releases all along and the other thing is I think it's just
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:33.640]  How Apple has been managing this?
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:38.960]  like the they used to have bigger lists because there was so much more to do now the lists are a little bit slower and
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:43.320]  You get to the point where you have things like universal control, which isn't gonna ship
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.680]  And I think we ran into this with a home pod too is that there are fundamental problems with core technologies
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.200]  That are just old like the original airplay and core audio turned out
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.520]  They couldn't handle the home pod
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:58.000]  So Apple had to go back and rewrite make airplay to redo a bunch of core technologies
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:03.560]  Just to support the home pod and I think a lot of the stuff now is they're going back and repaying technical debt
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  And it's making shipping those features take longer than they originally anticipated it would I
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.880]  Agree with that. I think that I think they're on a really good
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.560]  They're they're in a good place annual schedule wise on these features. I really do think so
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.760]  October I'm ready to move on October. We actually got our hands on hardware Apple watch series 7
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.280]  I don't have a lot to add
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:28.600]  I'll put links in the show notes to my review and your review on your YouTube channel
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:33.640]  The weirdest thing was that flat edge design that leaked that's probably like next year's
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:38.440]  I think you said SE someone else said that's gonna be the the rest not the rustic model the
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:44.760]  The the expedition model the action model right the the action model. Yeah extreme model
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:51.280]  Yeah, and they just leaked a year early. No, I think I stand by my prediction. It's and again, no little birdies whatsoever
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:57.600]  I think that that's the new SE because I think Apple wants the SE to look
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:03.760]  Different than the flagship model and I think it is easier to communicate to customers
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.440]  that
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:12.640]  This is the entry priced model or the lower tier
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.680]  If it looks distinct like that
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:21.120]  I don't think it would look bad if that flat thing ships, but it does not look as good, you know
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:25.580]  And there are no there's there's just no way they're going to abandon this and I know and again
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:31.320]  there's that the people who wanted it to ship and were disappointed that it shipped and really latched on to the
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.520]  people who were saying that the the actual
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:37.840]  Series 7 that we have was like a last-minute
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:41.080]  Scrap, you know that doesn't happen
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:41.400]  No
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:49.000]  Well, and it doesn't make any sense that that the that they couldn't make an aluminum chassis with flat sides and had to abandon it
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.880]  but they could make the screen bigger and go closer to the edges and reduce the bezels and that and the impact resistance right and
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  Impact the resistance like that's the hard thing. They could put it in whatever shape case they wanted to you know
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.520]  I just think it's a branding thing or a product marketing thing
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.360]  Whatever you want to call it and that they by making the SE look different
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:13.400]  It would establish the SE as its own thing at a lower price
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.640]  you know sort of exactly the way that the
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.800]  Non-pro iPhones look different. They aluminum looks does not look shiny
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:30.840]  It looks matte and you know the back was a 249 iPad like it. Yeah, it's visually distinct visually distinct in a way that
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:38.000]  The current iPhone SE is not even though it doesn't have the big display like the series 7
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:43.360]  I will say this I again this is almost the curse of being a product reviewer
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:49.800]  I owned a series 5 which I really really I jumped on because I really wanted the always-on-display
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:56.700]  Skipped series 6 because yeah the real the main thing I saw on the series 6 was that the always-on part was brighter
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:03.480]  And I didn't care about paying for that and I planned on skipping this year's too, but living with the review unit for two weeks
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:09.880]  I really got used to the bigger display and the battery life again the other thing with this watch
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.600]  It's very much in in in line with the iPhones 13 the bat the battery life is much larger
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.440]  You can forget to charge my Apple watch so on a day and wear it to bed and it still gets through the next day
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:25.440]  And the always-on is much brighter. I find I use that a lot
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:27.600]  Like I'm looking at it right now and I can see it just by glancing down
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:31.640]  Yeah, I couldn't if I did too and I took off after like two weeks with the review unit
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:35.760]  I went back to my series 5 and I was like this thing is the batteries dying all the time
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:38.960]  It's just dead exactly the same thing and it's not bad
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:44.900]  Yeah, and the Siri and my series 5 didn't have like a depleted battery. It's it's the same battery, you know
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.240]  Maybe it's like at 95 percent or 93 percent or something like that
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:50.640]  But it's effectively the same day-to-day battery life
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.000]  I was getting up until I started reviewing the series 7 but once I got a taste of the series 7 as I up now
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.080]  I got a place in order for a series 7. So I got a series 7 very happy with it the same exactly
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:08.520]  What was the other one? What else do we have the MacBook Pros? Oh, I forgot. How could I forget the MacBook Pros?
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:14.880]  Holy hell do I love my my m1 max MacBook Pro? Oh my same
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:20.700]  Yeah, I don't again there's three things about it that really like sold it for me
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:23.400]  One is that it's just fast like I press render on a video
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:27.900]  I go to get coffee and it's done so fast that I sometimes think I forgot to press render
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:30.620]  Which is like it is so much faster
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:36.320]  The other thing though the two things that surprised me one is like an iPad is just instant previously
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:42.320]  I would like drag a special effect it would it would snowball it would beach ball and I'd have to do that every time now
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.640]  I live a life almost entirely without beach ball. So it doesn't just save me minutes
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.840]  It saves me seconds within every minute and the last thing that surprised me was
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:54.960]  Because it's got separate rendering engines on my old Intel MacBook
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.640]  I would press render and then I could barely use Safari because everything was being done on the CPU
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:02.620]  Like much less Photoshop now I press render
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:08.160]  It's all offloaded to those engines and I have like another whole Mac that I can use to do anything else with at the same
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:12.680]  Time and that's just completely revolutionized my workflow and the fans don't come on
[02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:18.040]  Yeah, it's cold in Canada. Now John. I used to use my MacBook as a heat blanket as a space heater
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:25.240]  It's a really phenomenal. I swear I know it's the placebo effect. I know it. Well, I don't know I could be wrong, but I'm
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.080]  98% sure it is the placebo effect
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:35.920]  But I swear to God the keyboard feels better because the well is black and it looks better. It looks
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.920]  It looks better. I
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:43.480]  I do wish I wish that they would just anodize the whole thing black like that
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:48.680]  I would love to have a black MacBook Pro just black as black as the well of that keyboard
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:52.680]  But we don't have black all the things. Yeah, Matt black all the things
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:57.640]  But man, I do I do love typing on that thing I do
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:02.520]  Love the display the notch total non-issue. I was done with that notch
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:08.560]  I I think I said this recently too on another episode, but I was way I think maybe with Joanna
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:14.200]  but I took me way longer to get used to the notch on the iPhone 10 than the notch on the the
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.120]  MacBook yeah
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:20.860]  Honestly, and I really thought and I know that that was like a late-breaking rumor
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:25.240]  I think it like leaked the night before or two nights before it was
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:29.600]  One of those things that leaked really really late that they're you know
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.880]  There was going to be a notch and I thought no way that's the dumbest thing
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.840]  I ever heard that would be stupid on the Mac and it's like yeah
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:40.380]  You know what the menu bar is actually kind of a good spot and as long as the software has some sort of
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:45.120]  Intelligence to move if if something is going to run into it move it to the other side
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:49.020]  It the Mac interface with that
[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:50.820]  iconic
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:52.820]  Literally, I'm not literally
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:58.020]  Is it literal I don't I'm gonna say it's literally iconic because there are some icons up there in the menu bar
[02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:00.500]  But yeah, but the menu bar is has been
[02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:07.020]  At least a figuratively iconic part of the Mac interface right from
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:15.100]  1984 onwards yeah, it is very different from windows where there is no menu bar at the top of the screen their menus are in
[02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:16.700]  the windows
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:22.980]  It's an it's a good place to do something like that in the same way that the top of the iPhone screen is sort of
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:24.440]  A good place to put something like that
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:27.920]  You know like where the iPhone really suffers with the notch is when you go
[02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:34.060]  To landscape to watch a video or something like that or play a game or something like that. It seems weird
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:38.600]  It's but in both cases like I think people forget that it's extra screen real estate
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:41.140]  Like if it was still a forehead we wouldn't have that right, right?
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:43.500]  So it's just extra space that they can shove status into
[02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:47.740]  Yeah, it seems you know a couple months in
[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:52.140]  There's no surprises that have come up with these new MacBook pros
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:57.180]  They are every bit as good as we thought they were when we reviewed them one weekend
[02:20:57.420 --> 02:21:00.920]  It is it's sort of thrilling to see
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:04.380]  Apple putting the pedal to the metal on
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:07.700]  literally applying
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:10.180]  Their
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:16.380]  Absolute best and brightest effort to the Mac and the Mac hardware, you know
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:22.020]  It's it, you know for all the doom and gloom over. Hey, I don't know guys
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:24.380]  I think Apple's I think Apple's abandoning the Mac
[02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:28.180]  I think they're just gonna stick iOS on everything from five or six years ago
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.740]  Boy that you don't hear that anymore. You really don't
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:39.700]  well, I know like you did your annual interview with jaws and Craig and I got to talk to Tim Millett the vice president of
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:42.580]  silicon and the head of Mac product marketing
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:47.060]  later after these shipped and Tom Boger, sorry and
[02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:53.740]  the the amount of love that was just seeping out of every pore of their being for the Mac and you could see how happy
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:59.600]  They were with like both the silicon engines that they built but also with the resurgence of the Mac product line
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:03.220]  They were literally beaming which like you used to see that it at
[02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:09.940]  WWDC sometimes depending what they're going to announce but their level of happiness was so high and that to me is always a good indicator
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:15.880]  Yeah, very much. So and Bogart is great. I've known him for a few years and his yes, he's a lifer
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:20.660]  Yeah, he really is but it and he really you know, who knows, you know, he's you know
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:24.540]  anybody could could get promoted elsewhere or move somewhere else, but his
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:31.180]  his passion for the Mac is is palpable, you know, and you know it whether it's
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:37.740]  Officially and on the record or unofficially and off the record behind the scenes. It's it's serious. I
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:43.520]  Remember, yeah, he was the guy I asked him. I asked him at WWDC the year before if
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:47.780]  If I could ride around on one of the Mac pros with wheels
[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:50.420]  Yes
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:54.620]  And he seemed tempted to let me he said I think you know, it could it could hold your weight
[02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:56.880]  He goes, I don't I don't know that we should do it here though
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:02.220]  No, that's the pro. The pro workflows team gets all the cool Mac Pro slits
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:10.900]  All right down to home stretch because there's not much more Apple did this year the Mac OS 12 Monterey shipped I would say
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:17.620]  Pretty successful a lot like iOS 15. It's not that they just not that they didn't do anything
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:23.500]  It's not like there's not some new features that are cool, but it's sort of steady as she goes, right?
[02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:28.220]  It's you know, it's just universal control. We're waiting for it, which was the right bang demo, right? That's the whiz bang
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:33.980]  Yeah, that's obviously a next, you know early next year thing. Hopefully hopefully but otherwise, you know
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:37.300]  for me upgrading to Mac OS 12 was
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:41.080]  Other than taking longer because when you cross that
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:48.800]  integer or boundary of OS updates you have it's like a serious update that turns the screen black for a while and
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:55.600]  Gives you a minutes long thing that you don't get when going from 12 1 to 12 2 or something like that
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:01.260]  But the end result for me day to day as a user
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:08.520]  Felt much more like going to eleven point seven or something like that. It doesn't there's nothing nothing got broken
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:16.320]  Either software wise or habit wise right it fixed a lot of annoying bugs for me, which is always a plus
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:18.200]  Yeah, that's a good sign and you know
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:23.600]  And it's I know that that doesn't sell stuff and I know that those of us who really clamor
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:26.040]  You know, they're famously like, you know
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:32.060]  It's old enough old enough now that it was Bertrand Cerlet who announced it but the ten point six
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:37.840]  Mountain Lion where they even chose a name going from lion to mountain lion that you know
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:44.720]  And and no new features and meanwhile, there were major new features like grandson. Yeah grand central dispatch snow leopard
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.720]  Yeah, or snow leopard snow leopard not not mountain lion. That's right. Yeah that line as well
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.080]  That was the grand tradition right but less snow leopard night. It was snow leopard was ten six, right?
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:57.720]  I know the number I confused the names but ten six was the one
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.000]  where they even had a slide that just like dropped with a cloud of dust no new features and
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.680]  Cool, because Steve was upset that there weren't a lot of new features to announce. He's like we're just gonna do no features
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:13.880]  That's even better, but it was like raucous applause from the WWDC audience that I know the
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:22.400]  WWDC in-person audience is obviously different from them the very the mainstream, you know people, you know
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:25.180]  developers who are willing to spend
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  $5,000 for a week to
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.800]  Yeah, you know to be there it is a different crowd, but it was raucous applause because
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:40.200]  And I know that that's not you know, you can't make commercials like that. Yeah, you know, maybe there's no way to put a
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:48.200]  Commercial during football games on Sunday afternoon that says, you know Mac OS 12 no new features lots of bug fictions
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.640]  You know that the commercial that commercial doesn't write itself
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:57.880]  Quite the opposite but you know, it's what we want, right, you know, if it ain't broke don't fix it
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:04.480]  I will say I still haven't turned it off the one feature that annoys me on the Mac is quick note
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:09.480]  Because for whatever reason I've got stuff in my lower right corner. I go down there and then
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.080]  every I've never once wanted to make a quick note on my Mac and
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:17.200]  That stupid little window keeps popping up
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.800]  Yeah, I see I don't do it on the Mac at all
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:21.880]  I do it on the iPad all the time never use it on the Mac
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:26.180]  The thing for me is like the notifications are still way too persistent like they come in
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:29.320]  They stay around way too long. They don't like a guest that won't leave
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:32.800]  Yeah enough and then the whole thing comes over again every time yeah
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:37.040]  And I if there's anything that was surprising to me that didn't get I got a real UI
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:42.720]  Hey back to the drawing board. It was the Big Sur Mac OS 11 notifications
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.640]  There's there's all sorts of wonky stuff in the UI
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:50.200]  We're like the the regions that you can click on to click on things
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.360]  Don't correspond to the actual things you see on screen
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.200]  you know some of the I think some of them are smaller and some of them are bigger and
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.600]  Things that just should not happen seem like on their own time delays. Yeah, it's just weird and does not it
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.440]  Feels unfinished, but shipped and then in Mac OS 12. They didn't really seem to address it
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.640]  So hopefully that's on the list for Mac OS 13. I
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  Don't have much more to say about that though
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:21.200]  Shortcut shipped that's that's a big deal for those of us who are enthusiasts
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:28.080]  well speaking of bad UI I really thought from well, I'm not surprised and
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.380]  But but what they showed in June and the first beta
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:38.400]  There just as simple things like when you tell a shortcut to just show an alert with some text
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:42.940]  the alert is not a Mac alert and you can complain about the
[02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:49.120]  Big Sur style alerts and say they the actual proper alerts in Big Sur
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:53.960]  Look too much like iOS and it's not appropriate for the Mac and I don't like the design
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:59.400]  But that's not even what you get with shortcuts. You get this weird little shortcut thing that really really
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:05.140]  If you just showed it to somebody and didn't tell them what it was. They would guess that it was like
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:07.980]  some sort of
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:09.660]  Linux to Mac
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.360]  trans
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:12.640]  programming
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.640]  platform thing and
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:21.520]  Yeah, some kind of cross-platform thing and that whoever decided what it would look like for the Mac wasn't even a Mac user and just you
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.800]  Know there's a button, you know, there's an OK button in the bottom right that says ok
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:32.120]  But nothing about the layout of this actually looks Mac like and I think you know
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:35.560]  I I know, you know, I'm far from an expert on shortcuts
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.440]  although I've gotten more into them than I had before, you know, I'm no Federico, but
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  Yeah, or Rosemary Orchard
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:49.440]  You know and they but they've said this at length too. Like I think long story short. The problem is
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  shortcuts was the
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:57.780]  Whether they volunteered or not. They were the the let's dog food Swift UI
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:00.120]  yeah group and
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.040]  Swift UI is not still not up to the to the task of
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:12.960]  Being what they wanted to be but they've gone too far and they'd rewrote everything in Swift UI and that's what we've got
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:20.680]  But that's why that like the I think that's why like the alerts don't look standard because these standard alerts aren't in Swift
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:23.600]  UI they're in app kit or UI kit and
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:30.440]  They like made their own and Swift UI and did not did not do a great job of it
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:34.000]  So there's lots of lots of room for improvement there with shortcuts
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:40.240]  But it was announced in a good way where they said this will be a transition from automator to
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:47.320]  Shortcuts and automator is you know still there so, you know, it's you know, let's see where they go in a year
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:49.480]  Hopefully, you know make some improvements
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:55.120]  I would still like to see them do something where you could do automator steps with a language, you know
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:57.800]  and that language could be some sort of
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:03.700]  Cut down version of Swift could just be JavaScript obviously
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.640]  But something because there are some things that it just man
[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:11.200]  It would be so much easier to just write a few lines of actual code
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:17.640]  if you can write code and that to me is the one thing automator got right that's shortcuts doesn't is that
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:23.840]  automator fundamentally is the same sort of idea where you drag and drop these sort of
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.180]  pre-made steps and do the
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:29.160]  programming
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:34.040]  Visually by connecting these things in a visual way without writing code
[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:40.120]  but if there's ever a time when you need to use code, you can always just add an automator step that calls any
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:43.840]  scripting language that Mac OS X supports Apple script or
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:49.640]  Yeah bash or pearl or Python or Ruby, I think
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:56.620]  Anything that comes with Mac OS X it comes with a plethora of Unix style scripting languages plus good old-fashioned Apple script
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:02.160]  Shortcuts could use something like that long. So I just want little editors. They just want a little editor
[02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:04.160]  You can pack anything into it
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:09.000]  And then the only thing else I have there was nothing in December
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:13.800]  I don't think Apple really had any news in December other than some of the epic stuff that we talked about before
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:18.600]  but in November Craig Federighi went to Lisbon Portugal and
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:25.420]  Spoke at the web summit against sideloading. I thought that was interesting and we talked about sideloading earlier
[02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:28.440]  We don't have to get into the argument. I do think he makes a
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.720]  compelling argument
[02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:36.680]  about having a choice between you know, if if legislators around the world say
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:45.000]  Legally, all platforms must allow sideloading then somebody who does not want to even use a platform where it's an option
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:51.820]  loses the ability to have that choice, you know, and and it's like you said Jonas has a ps5 if you wanted a
[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:57.520]  Gaming PC you could have that but you shouldn't force the ps5 to be a gaming. Well, you got the gaming PC two years ago
[02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:00.640]  Yeah, but get both. I mean, that's that's the whole thing you get to choose
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:04.400]  But it is the people like us just get a knife on it
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:08.080]  But the pia but I'll tell you what even he said the ps5 is so much easier to set up
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:12.080]  Yeah, that's that's that's the benefit. There are bent pros and cons to both
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:16.680]  I think a lot of times nerds think that there's only cons to the other approach and there's not because they're I
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:22.760]  Recently asked what people wanted to see an iOS 16 on Twitter and 95% of the answers
[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:28.760]  I got were for features that only apply to 5% of the market and that's the distortion lens of tech Twitter or tech YouTube
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.880]  Is that it we really are outliers?
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:35.320]  We're minorities who think that we're the majority and we are not and it I do that and I think
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:40.720]  Federighi's argument and I know Apple released a white paper on the same thing back in June and his talk
[02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:43.340]  In November was largely on the same points
[02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:48.280]  but I feel like they've really honed it down and I think as a talk with
[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:52.160]  Federighi as the person delivering it it really came across even better
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:58.760]  But it really is true that the nerd argument is hey, if you don't want it don't turn it on right
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:04.880]  Which is how the Mac works right the Mac by default ships a fresh Mac with factory settings
[02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:09.560]  Doesn't allow you to install apps from outside the App Store. You have to authenticate as an
[02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:13.240]  Admin user and then check a checkbox in the security
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:16.140]  System prefs panel and then you can install them
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:17.680]  You know
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:24.160]  Whatever apps you want and that's great for the Mac because that's the way the Mac was designed and but that's exactly what so many
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.840]  people want for iPad OS and iOS and
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:34.600]  The just leave it checked if that's what you want argument the hole in that argument. Is that people some
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:37.960]  Organizations and needs will require you to disable
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:38.480]  Yes
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.000]  You know and and one of the examples that I like to go to are these
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.920]  These school proctoring software things where he gets taking tests room and it's all come up over the last two years
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:57.800]  Because the kids who were taking school remotely because of kovat it's awful software. It's truly awful software. It's and it does
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:04.320]  Terrible things like try to follow the kids eyes where they're looking and yeah, what do you do though?
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:10.520]  if you know if if if I've iPhone if iOS were forced to allow sideloading and
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:12.200]  And
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:18.680]  Your employer required you to install something that turned off the protections. What do you do?
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:21.560]  You know, it's or government like the same privacy
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:27.360]  Advocates who are so against any of the CSAM scanning governments are gonna force people to put they already try to do that on the DNS
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:32.120]  Low, right and eat up kids who are going to want game emulators. They're good like Nintendo's they're not gonna care
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:33.000]  There's one thing
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.700]  you know and look at what Facebook tried to do with the current rules in place where they tried to
[02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:42.200]  You know overuse the enterprise certificate to get
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:44.900]  teenagers to install a
[02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:47.740]  VPN software
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:49.500]  Yeah, that's anova
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:50.020]  Yeah
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.820]  that the entire point of which
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:59.560]  Was to allow Facebook to track every single thing they did over the network on their phones to see what what's useful, you know
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:04.740]  Which is famously how they figured out that whatsapp was so much more popular than it
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:10.420]  It seemingly was valued at and you know, you know, they were like we should we should definitely buy this
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:16.140]  This is not overpriced. This is look at the data we have from tracking what people actually do on their phones
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.140]  It's incredibly popular and growing
[02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:23.780]  that's what they did before sideloading was allowed, you know, and that if if this like sort of
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:29.980]  Easy sideloading with no friction and just check a box thing. We're available
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:36.820]  You know what happens when Facebook starts telling all of their users? Hey, if you switch from this
[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:40.660]  You're using the App Store version of Facebook if you switch to
[02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:47.780]  Facebook's version of Facebook will give you X Y & Z, you know and people who don't know any better do it and
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:51.380]  You know next thing, you know your phones only free metaverse credits
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:56.700]  Michael sigh on his great web blog had a link. I haven't linked to it on during fireball yet
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:36:01.660]  But I've been meaning to had a link the other day. I think it was I a writer or no
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:06.040]  It wasn't I a writer somebody was talking about it, but somebody had a support thing about it
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:09.580]  But you've heard of Grammarly Grammarly is much popular
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:13.940]  I say if you install this is true if you install Grammarly on your Mac
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:20.580]  They write a preference setting that disables the systems spell checking
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:26.940]  a system wide not just for like the Grammarly app, but any app because Grammarly is somehow supposed to work
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:27.540]  I don't know
[02:36:27.540 --> 02:36:33.460]  I I've never used the damn thing but you know supposed to work in any app and then you say I don't like
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:36.940]  Grammarly and then you drag it to the trash and you think you're done with it
[02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:43.380]  But the preference setting is still there and now you don't have the system spelling checking in any app. Well, that's that is
[02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:49.060]  So patently offensive it's ridiculous, but it's possible on the Mac, right?
[02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:50.860]  It's impossible
[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:58.220]  Grammarly for iOS if there is a version of Grammarly for iOS can't do that because of the sandboxing it's Rome and their Keystone installer
[02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:00.500]  That yeah causing me a lot of problem in long ritual
[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:05.020]  Right, right, and we did I said we never really got to the bottom of that, right?
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:07.860]  That was still sort of a it's still sort of a you know
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:14.180]  There's a lot of smoke, but we still never found the fire of how come people were having this bizarre
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:20.260]  You know 30% CPU usage just in the background with Chrome even quit and then you
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:26.340]  Uninstall Chrome completely and the problem goes away yet. Nobody's figured out what the hell was going on
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:29.340]  It's just kind of weird because there were some big brains on the problem
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:35.140]  But again, but you can't have a Keystone installer, right? You cannot do it. There's no way to do it
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:39.740]  You can't be asked to check a box so that you can allow it. It's just not there
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:46.980]  That's a feature and on the Mac the fact that you can is a feature. That is why they are different platforms
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:52.620]  You know and there's so few like the thing is like I understand like there's big nerd love for all of these platforms
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:54.940]  But there's so few really mainstream friendly platforms
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:58.760]  There's basically iOS and Chrome and yet we covet them
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:01.220]  So we want to take them away and make them all nerdy platforms
[02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:05.780]  But that really does a disservice to the 90% of the market that really just want something that's simple and easy to use
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:08.420]  Yeah, and they've we've got everything else. We've got Windows
[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:11.780]  We've got Android we got Mac OS. We've got Linux. We've already got all this stuff
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:18.900]  Anything else Renee, it feels like the only big thing that I like at the end of the year was Apple suing NSO group
[02:38:19.060 --> 02:38:26.080]  Yeah, that's Facebook also famously tried to use to get it. Yeah. Yeah, that's that is sort of a nice cherry on the top
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:28.240]  Of the new year, let's hope wish them success
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:35.180]  Yes, and boy the more we learn about the NSO group the the worst they look number one the fact that
[02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:39.980]  that that story that came out a week or two ago that Netanyahu was using it as a
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:43.980]  calling card in countries like Uganda and
[02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:48.620]  Yeah, like the worst countries on on the planet boy
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:55.260]  That's just awful and then the details of how their Pegasus exploit actually worked which are
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:00.900]  Yeah bananas, you know that it was yeah you linked to that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:07.980]  A PDF with a dot gif file extension and the PDF x contains some sort of
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:16.140]  obscure late 90s image format that was originally designed for fax machines, but that has a
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:20.820]  Single pass parser just reading from the beginning to the end of the file
[02:39:20.820 --> 02:39:25.660]  But the nature of the file format allowed an entire touring complete
[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:28.260]  computer
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:35.740]  Emulated computer system to be built inside of it is so crazy complicated and as an edit
[02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:43.380]  forgetting how they used it out in the world just the fact that they pulled it off is sort of a
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.480]  You know
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:50.420]  Hats off to you clap clap clap. This is a magnificent accomplishment
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:55.260]  But also, you know completely used for the some of the worst purposes
[02:39:56.140 --> 02:39:57.340]  imaginable
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:01.900]  Yeah, so here's hoping you know, and it's it does seem bad. I mean and Apple
[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:09.780]  Apple's lawsuit is not like perfunctory, you know, like sometimes they say, you know, like, you know, you got a file
[02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:14.660]  You know protect a trade to defend your car got it for to fend your copyright and you file like a perfunctory
[02:40:14.660 --> 02:40:19.960]  You know cease and desist or what do they call on YouTube the like with the music?
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:27.760]  The DMC. Yeah DMCA files and this is not like perfunctory and like somebody lowdown and Apple legal like
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:32.920]  Oh, I guess you know, I you know just to you know, yeah just to tie things off for the Friday
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:37.160]  I'll just busy work. I'll just file this lawsuit against NSO group. No, they are
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:44.280]  Mad, I mean, they are really mad and Apple you just not used to seeing Apple
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:46.080]  Be mad
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:51.760]  Right. They're just this is not their brand, but they are fear. They are furious about this and
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:59.560]  I really do think they intend to their lawsuit is to sue NSO group out of existence. Yep. Good riddance
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:05.120]  Yeah, good. Let's wish him luck. And this is what this is what also one of those cases to where?
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:07.880]  Apple obviously has
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:14.840]  Detractors people who disagree with their philosophies people who you know, it's just don't like their style. They don't like the control
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:18.320]  I haven't seen anybody who's like rooting against Apple in this case. Yes
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:21.680]  Everyone's like go go go
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:27.080]  So yeah, that was a nice thing to end the year on it was it was very nice and I feel like they're on good
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:29.920]  Ground. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, you know what what the
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.520]  I
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.680]  Don't know how it's gonna turn out I won't predict it as an Israeli company. What what does that mean?
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:42.480]  What kind of liability do they have but they can make the company toxic, right?
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:44.760]  Just like through the lawsuit they can make the company absolutely right
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:48.320]  Well, and the other thing too that really I don't know that it helps the lawsuit
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:52.000]  But the other thing too is that the US federal government is also
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.720]  Really really pissed like, you know, like the State Department, you know
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.240]  And the fact that actual state the US State Department employees had this deployed against them
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:08.720]  You know and at one level if it was like I don't know the Chinese or the Russians or somebody who we have an adversarial
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:12.280]  Relationship with internationally it would be one thing they'd still be mad
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:15.840]  but the fact that the software originates with one of our
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:23.960]  Closest ostensible allies Israel is I think the thing that takes this to a different level of pissed off
