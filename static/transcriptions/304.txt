[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  We don't have much to talk about just the whole year in review.
[00:03.440 --> 00:04.400]  Short show like usual.
[00:04.400 --> 00:09.200]  Yeah, I predict it'll be shorter than usual because we're focused.
[00:10.160 --> 00:12.000]  Lean, mean, we have an outline.
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.440]  We have a focus, but I forget.
[00:15.440 --> 00:17.760]  Is this the third year in a row, fourth year in a row?
[00:17.760 --> 00:18.800]  Something like that, yeah.
[00:18.800 --> 00:20.640]  It's a tradition at this point, that's for sure.
[00:21.680 --> 00:22.720]  But let's look back.
[00:22.720 --> 00:25.200]  Apple's 2020 year in review.
[00:25.200 --> 00:32.240]  Before we do, let's talk about some current events just to get them out of the way.
[00:32.240 --> 00:35.280]  We can't do the show without mentioning this Apple car thing.
[00:38.560 --> 00:39.600]  Maybe some other stuff.
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.640]  But anyway, what, two days ago, yesterday?
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.800]  I have seriously, like one thing I have not anticipated post-election
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.160]  is that the weird sense of time is going to get worse.
[00:50.160 --> 00:56.240]  Yeah, yes, it's like that movie, that Christopher Nolan movie
[00:56.240 --> 00:58.560]  where time gets slower and faster at the same time.
[00:59.760 --> 01:00.960]  Not Inception, the other one.
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.960]  And not Tenet either.
[01:02.960 --> 01:04.560]  Interstellar, Interstellar.
[01:04.560 --> 01:05.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07.040 --> 01:08.320]  Have you seen Tenet, by the way?
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.240]  I tried.
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.080]  I have this thing with Christopher Nolan movies where I love like the first 80%
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.160]  and then he just never lands it for me.
[01:16.160 --> 01:19.600]  So my favorite one is Memento because he does the ending at the beginning.
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.640]  Ah, yeah, but what about The Prestige?
[01:22.640 --> 01:23.760]  Everybody loves The Prestige.
[01:23.760 --> 01:26.880]  Yes, yeah, The Prestige is more classical for him, I think.
[01:26.880 --> 01:30.000]  He doesn't try to do the weird ending thing.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.040]  Yeah, I enjoyed it.
[01:31.040 --> 01:32.960]  My son and I watched it two nights ago.
[01:33.600 --> 01:34.560]  It is interesting.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.440]  It is so interesting.
[01:35.440 --> 01:39.120]  I do this thing with movies and I've gotten really good at it
[01:39.120 --> 01:40.640]  and maybe it's just a good luck.
[01:40.640 --> 01:43.920]  I don't know, but I've really tried to stay spoiler-free.
[01:43.920 --> 01:47.280]  I've largely stopped watching trailers, period,
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.080]  because it's like the movie industry has gotten,
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.080]  even for like good movies, they spoil the whole movie in the trailer.
[01:55.920 --> 01:57.360]  It's the worst trend.
[01:57.360 --> 02:01.040]  I mean, they must have some kind of metrics that show that it gets people to
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.000]  rent the movies or whatever, but trailers spoil everything, in my opinion.
[02:06.000 --> 02:06.480]  So I try to avoid it.
[02:06.480 --> 02:08.240]  There's this huge Zemeckis thing where he said,
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.160]  I believe it was Zemeckis, where he believed that he should show everything in the trailer
[02:12.160 --> 02:14.160]  because people like eating McDonald's.
[02:14.160 --> 02:15.680]  They want to know what they're getting.
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.760]  And I just find that totally opposite of what I want in a movie.
[02:22.560 --> 02:23.920]  Some people must like it.
[02:23.920 --> 02:24.640]  I hate it.
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.400]  I'm like, oh, why would they show that?
[02:26.400 --> 02:27.520]  Oh, terrible.
[02:27.520 --> 02:29.120]  And it's worse for me because I'm a dummy.
[02:29.120 --> 02:31.280]  So I can watch a trailer and I don't realize things,
[02:31.280 --> 02:33.680]  but I watch it with my podcast partner, Georgia,
[02:33.680 --> 02:36.560]  and she has one of those Sherlock Holmes Mind Palace things where she's like,
[02:36.560 --> 02:38.640]  oh, they're wearing this different outfit in this part of the trailer.
[02:38.640 --> 02:40.240]  So this person lived, this person died,
[02:40.240 --> 02:42.720]  and they obviously committed this crime and then she can't watch the movie.
[02:42.720 --> 02:43.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:43.840 --> 02:44.400]  Exactly.
[02:44.400 --> 02:46.560]  Oh, anyway, the neat things.
[02:46.560 --> 02:47.600]  But so I bookmark.
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.520]  I'm like, oh, I run into somebody who says,
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.000]  here's a review of this movie I know I don't want to watch.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.640]  And so I bookmark it for the future.
[02:54.640 --> 02:58.400]  And then after I watch the movie, I may not even remember that I did,
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.400]  but I'll go to PitBoard and see if I, hey, did I have any bookmarks for Tenet?
[03:02.400 --> 03:03.200]  Oh, here I did.
[03:03.200 --> 03:03.440]  Yeah.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.800]  And I read a couple of reviews.
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.080]  And it was funny because multiple reviews of Tenet,
[03:08.080 --> 03:14.560]  which originally came out back in August in a very poorly considered manner in theaters,
[03:16.960 --> 03:19.360]  multiple reviewers said the same thing,
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.160]  which was that this movie can't really be spoiled by talking about the plot.
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.720]  And I know that sounds crazy, but if you've seen the movie, you'll agree.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.480]  And multiple reviewers said that.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.000]  So I'm not even that worried about spoiling anything here talking about Tenet.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  It is, and it is sort of a fascinating idea that you can make a plotted movie with a plot,
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.640]  and it really can't be spoiled.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.920]  I'm glad I watched it.
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.520]  I'm glad Christopher Nolan is out there making movies.
[03:47.520 --> 03:48.240]  Same.
[03:48.240 --> 03:50.560]  It is frustrating.
[03:50.560 --> 04:00.240]  And it is like, my analogy to my son is that it's sort of like a very talented move,
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.080]  extremely talented movie maker who's so good at the art of cinema
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.680]  that he's made a movie about one plus one equals three.
[04:07.680 --> 04:11.040]  And it's very convincing because he's so good at it.
[04:11.040 --> 04:12.400]  But you know it's not right.
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.800]  And it's like, but you can sit there.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.880]  If you'd sit there and try to tie yourself up
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.880]  and not thinking about the time travel aspect of Tenet,
[04:20.880 --> 04:25.520]  it's never going to, you're never, he's so good that you think like,
[04:25.520 --> 04:27.520]  oh, if I think about this hard enough,
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.800]  or maybe if I get out of some pen and paper and start drawing this, it'll add up.
[04:33.520 --> 04:36.720]  And it's like, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't hurt your brain.
[04:36.720 --> 04:39.440]  Do you ever watch Pitch Meeting on Screen Rant?
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.240]  Yes, yes.
[04:40.240 --> 04:40.880]  That's a great.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.040]  Yeah, the Pitch Meeting for Tenet was fantastic.
[04:43.040 --> 04:44.640]  I like it when he makes fun of movies I don't like,
[04:44.640 --> 04:46.800]  but I like it even more when he makes fun of movies I do like.
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.120]  All right.
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.640]  I got to write this down for the show notes.
[04:48.640 --> 04:49.520]  Pitch Meeting Tenet.
[04:49.520 --> 04:51.600]  I'll bet that he did a great job.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.000]  Yeah.
[04:52.000 --> 04:52.560]  Yeah.
[04:52.560 --> 04:52.720]  Yeah.
[04:52.720 --> 04:55.280]  I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's terrific.
[04:55.280 --> 04:56.640]  But I'm still glad I watched it.
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.280]  That's the thing.
[04:57.280 --> 04:59.920]  And I get it why some people, you know, I don't know that,
[04:59.920 --> 05:03.200]  I haven't seen anybody say this is my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.080]  I haven't seen that.
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.480]  Maybe there's somebody who thinks it.
[05:06.480 --> 05:08.800]  I've seen some people who I think are sort of,
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.560]  they're a little angry about the pretension of it.
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.600]  And it's like, I'm okay with it because it's the pretension.
[05:17.200 --> 05:22.640]  He's not like submitting it to the Nobel committee in physics to try to act like it does add up.
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.280]  He's not saying one plus one actually equals three.
[05:25.280 --> 05:29.040]  He's just made this movie like, what if it one plus one did equal three?
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.400]  And it's kind of a neat movie.
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.320]  So anyway, my thing with Nolan is that he violates one of my favorite rules of storytelling,
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.360]  which is if you put a gun on the mantle in act two, you know, you got to shoot somebody
[05:37.920 --> 05:39.440]  before act four starts.
[05:39.440 --> 05:42.400]  And movies like Inception, they're folding cities in half.
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.760]  And someone says, don't do that.
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.120]  You'll attract negative attention.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.880]  And so I think they're setting this up almost like when they tell Neo, you know,
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.680]  you don't have to worry about dodging bullets in the future.
[05:51.680 --> 05:54.160]  And then you get to the end and they're being attacked and nobody ever fold.
[05:54.160 --> 05:57.520]  And I've been waiting the whole movie for them to start folding cities, which is like
[05:57.520 --> 05:58.400]  the matrix at the end.
[05:58.400 --> 06:02.240]  If Neo doesn't start catching bullets, I just feel what happened at the end of the movie.
[06:06.240 --> 06:07.920]  It's like you didn't give me what I wanted.
[06:07.920 --> 06:08.160]  Yeah.
[06:08.880 --> 06:09.840]  Yeah, maybe.
[06:09.840 --> 06:10.080]  Yeah.
[06:11.360 --> 06:12.000]  It's hard to say.
[06:12.000 --> 06:15.440]  I'm glad he's out there, but, you know, unsatisfying.
[06:16.880 --> 06:23.280]  What I did afterwards is after watching as a palate cleanser for Tenet, I watched Ocean's
[06:23.280 --> 06:31.360]  Eleven for like the 30th time because it's in some ways that was the exact palate cleanser
[06:31.360 --> 06:36.480]  I needed where it's like, just give me something where there's like some kind of complicated
[06:36.480 --> 06:37.280]  plot.
[06:37.280 --> 06:43.120]  And it might be cockamamie and completely unrealistic, but it does add up.
[06:43.120 --> 06:43.360]  Right?
[06:43.360 --> 06:43.760]  Yes.
[06:43.760 --> 06:47.040]  You know, I watched the McTiernan movies afterwards.
[06:47.040 --> 06:53.200]  I watched Hunt for October and Die Hard and Predator, I think, because they're all those
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.720]  are all very like, this is what's happening.
[06:54.720 --> 06:56.480]  I'm setting this up and I'm delivering it to you.
[06:57.120 --> 06:57.360]  Yeah.
[06:57.360 --> 06:58.000]  McTiernan.
[06:58.000 --> 06:58.480]  Oh, man.
[06:58.880 --> 07:00.640]  You know how I feel about Die Hard.
[07:00.640 --> 07:02.000]  But way too simple for today.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.440]  Like, I think today they confuse sophistication with complexity, which is a problem.
[07:05.440 --> 07:08.000]  But they're very simple movies, but they really pay off.
[07:08.000 --> 07:08.400]  Yeah.
[07:08.400 --> 07:08.720]  Yeah.
[07:08.720 --> 07:10.720]  And, you know, again, I'm going to spoil it.
[07:10.720 --> 07:13.360]  If you haven't watched Die Hard, then you shouldn't be listening to the podcast.
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.080]  No.
[07:14.080 --> 07:21.120]  But like one of the great Chekhov's guns of movie history, which is the whole, that's
[07:21.120 --> 07:27.920]  the whole principle, if you see the gun on the mantle, it has to go off, is the movie
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.240]  opens with John as a nervous flyer and the guy says, ah, here's what you do.
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.040]  As soon as you get out, as soon as you get to where you're going, take your shoes off
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.400]  and let your toes feel the carpet.
[07:40.400 --> 07:42.160]  Yeah, which doesn't even make sense.
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.040]  I've never heard that.
[07:43.040 --> 07:46.320]  I don't think that would help because it's not like you're on the airplane.
[07:46.320 --> 07:48.720]  It's just an excuse to get him to take his shoes off.
[07:48.720 --> 07:52.960]  But then it pays off.
[07:52.960 --> 07:57.840]  It's like, wouldn't it be great if the, if, if the, the, the, the protagonist of the
[07:57.840 --> 07:59.760]  movie had to do the whole thing barefoot?
[07:59.760 --> 08:00.480]  It'd be like, yeah.
[08:00.480 --> 08:04.080]  And even like the watch, they set up the watch, they set up every, every payoff they
[08:04.080 --> 08:05.680]  set up carefully during the movie.
[08:05.680 --> 08:08.800]  You know, the watch there's, there's a deleted scene for that.
[08:08.800 --> 08:09.600]  Have you ever heard that?
[08:10.240 --> 08:10.800]  I think so.
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.360]  Yeah.
[08:11.360 --> 08:11.680]  Yeah.
[08:11.680 --> 08:17.520]  There's, so there's a scene that they deleted where the crew first, the Gruber crew
[08:17.520 --> 08:22.720]  actually, uh, first gets in there and they're down in the basement and they all have the
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.600]  same watch and they're synchronizing their watches.
[08:26.240 --> 08:33.680]  And they took it out because it was shot in the parking lot underneath.
[08:33.680 --> 08:39.040]  And when they shot it, they hadn't yet figured out that the limo driver was going to stay
[08:39.040 --> 08:39.520]  down there.
[08:40.240 --> 08:44.560]  And so it was like, it introduced a minor continuity error because later on they were
[08:44.560 --> 08:46.640]  like, here, here's what we could do with the limo driver.
[08:46.640 --> 08:49.680]  We can have the limo driver be underneath in the parking lot all along.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.640]  And McTiernan was like, ah, that's brilliant.
[08:52.640 --> 08:55.760]  But then he's like, ah, but what about that scene we shot down there where there is no
[08:55.760 --> 08:56.560]  limo?
[08:56.560 --> 08:57.200]  And they're like, ah.
[08:57.200 --> 09:00.240]  And they're like, well, we could just, it's just synchronizing watches.
[09:00.240 --> 09:01.120]  We could take it out.
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.200]  And then the only thing that doesn't really add up afterwards is the, hey, all these guys
[09:05.200 --> 09:09.280]  have the same watch, but that would have had more of a payoff if you've seen the deleted
[09:09.280 --> 09:09.600]  scene.
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.240]  Yeah.
[09:10.240 --> 09:10.960]  Yeah.
[09:10.960 --> 09:11.760]  Oh yeah.
[09:11.760 --> 09:12.400]  Well, there we go.
[09:12.400 --> 09:16.960]  There's, there's 15 minutes.
[09:16.960 --> 09:17.600]  We're going great.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.600]  We're doing fantastic.
[09:20.160 --> 09:20.800]  Apple car.
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.760]  So out of nowhere, Reuters yesterday.
[09:25.760 --> 09:26.720]  Well, it was before then.
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.400]  So it was a couple of days ago that I was Economic Daily or something.
[09:30.960 --> 09:36.320]  One of the Asian newspapers said that the Apple car was going to come out in 2021 and
[09:36.320 --> 09:37.760]  nobody believed it.
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.680]  And then Reuters followed up two days later saying, it's 2024-ish.
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.680]  20, I didn't see that there was one for 2021.
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.560]  But yeah, I, so things that I know, and I could say we collectively know, we know that
[09:52.560 --> 09:55.120]  Project Titan is still a thing.
[09:55.120 --> 09:58.240]  I don't even, I think that it's actually still called Project Titan.
[09:58.240 --> 10:00.240]  We know some of the people involved.
[10:01.840 --> 10:04.320]  We know that Apple has a lot of people working on it.
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.880]  We know it has something to do with cars and might just be autonomous driving systems,
[10:10.880 --> 10:11.360]  period.
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.280]  And maybe they would work with a company, like maybe they would work with BMW or Toyota
[10:17.280 --> 10:21.600]  or Honda or multiple, who knows, maybe they'll build their own car.
[10:21.600 --> 10:25.760]  Maybe they're just building, you know, smarter Roombas that will autonomously.
[10:25.760 --> 10:29.680]  I think the first version, like I think it's well known now that that Johnny Ive and the
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.280]  ID department made actual car designs for the very first version, unknown.
[10:33.280 --> 10:40.720]  Very first version under, I'm blanking on his name, before, before, Doug Field, no,
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.480]  before Doug Field, Apple's vice-senior vice president of hardware that I, for some reason,
[10:44.480 --> 10:48.560]  embarrassingly, the one that took over from Bob Mansfield when Bob first left, and I'm
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.880]  embarrassingly blanking on his name at the moment, but he was running it and they had
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.360]  car designs and they had a whole team ramp up and they took over a lot of guys from the
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.520]  iPhone team and a lot of old iPhone engineers came back to it.
[11:01.520 --> 11:06.080]  And then it moved over to Bob Mansfield and they sort of started redoing everything.
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.640]  And it sounded more abstract, like it was doing a lot of computer vision and environmental
[11:10.640 --> 11:13.440]  ingestion and AR and AI.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.560]  And now just before this report, the story was that it got moved over to John Jean Andreas
[11:19.200 --> 11:22.080]  machine learning and artificial intelligence organization.
[11:22.080 --> 11:24.720]  And Mansfield was retired, retired again.
[11:24.720 --> 11:32.720]  Yeah, well, we don't, you know, I feel like now you're going into things we kind of know,
[11:32.720 --> 11:32.960]  right?
[11:32.960 --> 11:33.280]  Yeah.
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.680]  We kind of know that there were prototypes and how far along they were and there are
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.160]  rumors that, and Dan Riccio, sorry, Dan Riccio.
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.880]  How much of it was going to be just a car and how much was going to be self-driving
[11:48.880 --> 11:51.600]  and what level and when did they expect to ship?
[11:51.600 --> 11:58.480]  And even if everything had gone exceedingly according to plan, which obviously it didn't,
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.840]  you know, it doesn't seem like it's possible at this point, like that, let's say an initiative
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.960]  that was going strong in 2015 or 2016 and maybe could have shipped a car by today, by
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.080]  the end of 2020, that those cars would drive themselves.
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.520]  That's, you know, on my honest estimation.
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.600]  And I know this is one of those, like 640 kilobytes of memory ought to be enough for
[12:23.600 --> 12:24.080]  everybody.
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.400]  I don't think that you and I, and most of the people listening to this are ever going
[12:28.400 --> 12:31.520]  to live to see fully self-driving cars on the road.
[12:31.520 --> 12:32.160]  Yeah.
[12:32.160 --> 12:32.560]  Yeah.
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.560]  I mean, the definition keeps seems to keep moving for what that is anyway.
[12:36.560 --> 12:36.880]  Right.
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.200]  I mean, like, you know, I'm talking full Knight Rider, talk to your Apple Watch car,
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.000]  come get me.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.320]  And the car just drives from wherever it is and to wherever you are.
[12:48.320 --> 12:49.760]  And the Hopsing Laundry mat.
[12:49.760 --> 12:50.160]  Right.
[12:50.160 --> 12:51.280]  You make home after.
[12:51.280 --> 12:51.780]  Right.
[12:52.480 --> 12:55.120]  I mean, it's, you know, I don't think we're going to have it.
[12:55.120 --> 12:56.240]  I'd love to see it happen.
[12:56.960 --> 12:57.920]  I don't think it will.
[12:57.920 --> 13:00.640]  But anyway, it obviously wasn't going to happen by now.
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.680]  But anyway, the Reuters report says Apple's full steam ahead that they're hoping to
[13:05.680 --> 13:08.560]  ship cars by 2024.
[13:09.280 --> 13:11.760]  Maybe it'll be delayed till 2025.
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.840]  And at this point, five, four, five years out, it's like, yeah, no shit.
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.640]  It might be delayed to 2025.
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.000]  Like if you if you have something that is like a thousand person, I don't know if there's
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.640]  a thousand people working on Project Titan, but maybe there are.
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.400]  I know there's hundreds, you know, but if, you know, you have hundreds of top engineers
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.320]  and A.I. talent and, you know, mechanical engineers making the actual car, working on
[13:36.320 --> 13:40.320]  something that optimistically you think are still is still four years out.
[13:40.320 --> 13:42.240]  Yeah, it might be five years out.
[13:42.240 --> 13:45.920]  I doubt that that line in the report just made me laugh.
[13:45.920 --> 13:47.120]  And what's like the 1.0 anyway?
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.200]  Like what are the features that that qualify the minimum delightful feat, like the delightful
[13:51.200 --> 13:52.400]  product that you're going to ship?
[13:52.400 --> 13:52.640]  All right.
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.760]  But man, oh, man, did that make people's ears perk up, you know, because it's like, yes,
[13:58.400 --> 14:00.480]  like an Apple stock up, Tesla stock down.
[14:00.480 --> 14:01.680]  I mean, that's how it works.
[14:01.680 --> 14:03.200]  Is that did it did that really happen?
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.000]  I didn't even.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.560]  Yeah, but see, that's just crazy.
[14:06.560 --> 14:07.520]  And it really is.
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.720]  You know, I've been on the CNBC a couple of times.
[14:12.720 --> 14:14.080]  Yeah, last couple of months.
[14:14.080 --> 14:16.800]  They asked if I would be on today to talk about the car.
[14:16.800 --> 14:21.840]  And I had to politely decline because what the hell am I going to say?
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.680]  I'm like, I love I wouldn't say I love it, but I mean, I enjoy stretching myself on these
[14:27.680 --> 14:34.960]  CNBC appearances to talk about things Apple has announced and are out and to give my thoughts
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.440]  and help people think about them the way I think they should.
[14:38.080 --> 14:43.120]  I don't mind coming on a podcast and like this and spouting off about this car I know
[14:43.120 --> 14:43.600]  nothing about.
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.440]  But there is no way in hell that I want to go on TV and talk about a car that I don't
[14:49.440 --> 14:52.640]  know anything about because of exactly what you just had.
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.960]  I don't want to play any role in Apple stock going up or Tesla stock going down or any
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.000]  of that nonsense.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.880]  I want to stay as far away from that as possible because nobody knows.
[15:04.880 --> 15:07.600]  I feel like who knows?
[15:09.040 --> 15:11.120]  Why would this report come out now?
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.640]  I have no idea, but it was so strange to me timing wise.
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.240]  Yeah, especially Reuters because that's not one of the usual rumor or leak channels.
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.960]  It's not even one of the business publications.
[15:22.960 --> 15:24.240]  Like it wasn't a Bloomberg story.
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.560]  It wasn't a Wall Street Journal story.
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.400]  Reuters seems very specific.
[15:28.400 --> 15:33.200]  Yeah, and then you right before it's a good thing we delayed recording until now, but
[15:33.200 --> 15:35.040]  it looks like three hours ago.
[15:35.040 --> 15:42.000]  Elon Musk tantalizing tweet says during the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.360]  out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla for one tenth of
[15:47.360 --> 15:48.560]  our current value.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.160]  He refused to take the meeting.
[15:50.800 --> 15:53.120]  Yeah, and that's the whole that's the whole tweet.
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.400]  It was a response so that the person who's responding to posted some pictures from the
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.160]  Reuters article and the Reuters article was playing up some revolutionary battery technology
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.000]  from Apple that I think if anybody took two minutes to research it would show that it
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  wasn't revolutionary battery technology at least not as described and that seemed to
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.520]  trigger Elon Musk a little bit because he's saying we've been using these batteries for
[16:11.520 --> 16:12.800]  years on our mid-range cars.
[16:14.560 --> 16:21.840]  But it's another one of those like I mean Twitter is exceedingly good at like a Fermat's
[16:21.840 --> 16:30.480]  Last Theorem type yeah tweet like like that tweet demands like so much more attention
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.800]  really like did you really get in contact with Tim Cook did he really not take the meeting
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.360]  and I forget who pointed it out it might have been Neil Seibart that said that this this
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.960]  would have been last year or 2018 or 2019 when you know Project Titan was well underway
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.360]  already and Tesla doesn't seem to have any problems that Apple would have been able to
[16:49.360 --> 16:59.680]  fix it's one of those somewhere in the 999 no's for every yes right is that Apple is
[16:59.680 --> 17:08.240]  not a Berkshire Hathaway style conglomerate that just owns like it in some sense you can
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.840]  say well clearly this was a mistake if it's all true right and again that's a big if with
[17:13.840 --> 17:21.200]  Elon Musk as the let's say unreliable narrator not that he's a liar just that you can't
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.320]  necessarily take it as there's there's a lot of ways to be an unreliable narrator that
[17:26.320 --> 17:31.120]  don't involve lying you don't know what his agenda is with a tweet right and how sharp
[17:31.120 --> 17:37.760]  his memory is yeah and it's also it's his it's his opinion of what happened but if you
[17:37.760 --> 17:42.080]  just took that as the if you said okay if you looked into it and it was all verifiably
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.480]  true you could say well then that's clearly a mistake Apple should have acquired Tesla
[17:46.480 --> 17:51.360]  for one tenth the price and held it until now and now they could if they wanted to spin
[17:51.360 --> 17:57.760]  it off and make you know 10 10 times but that's the GM but that's not Apple's business right
[17:58.480 --> 18:06.160]  and and you know it you know and there was you know a lot of people threw that out as
[18:06.160 --> 18:14.400]  a like what was I guess it was 2013 was sort of the the low point of the post Steve Jobs
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.640]  hey this is Tim Cook isn't cutting it they need a product person they should acquire
[18:18.640 --> 18:26.080]  Tesla and let Elon Musk take over the company you know and in very broad strokes you can
[18:26.080 --> 18:30.720]  see the thinking you know that Elon Musk and Steve Jobs are similar you know they're
[18:30.720 --> 18:37.920]  they're founder slash visionary yeah people and you could say well Apple needs that sort
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.880]  of person but it's very different when you're not the founder of the company right you know
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.880]  like you you know Thomas Edison was one of those people I don't know that if you could
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.160]  reanimate Thomas Edison from the grave that he would be a great CEO of Apple right and
[18:52.160 --> 18:58.160]  also Steve Jobs you know he was maniacally focused where Elon Musk has Elon Musk is focused
[18:58.160 --> 19:03.200]  on Mars but that constitutes 10 different companies for him right he Elon but my point
[19:03.200 --> 19:12.400]  with these founders these unique visionaries is that they all are the inherently the the
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.960]  chiefs of the companies they were meant to be the chiefs of because that's why they created
[19:16.960 --> 19:23.280]  them right yeah like a culture around them right Jeff Bezos is obviously tremendously
[19:23.280 --> 19:30.640]  successful and Amazon is it for all of it the things you complain about you know there's
[19:30.640 --> 19:34.880]  certainly many things you can take issue with or even Zuckerberg right we're a company that
[19:34.880 --> 19:39.680]  we can all agree there are a lot of things we can complain about with Facebook neither
[19:39.680 --> 19:44.880]  one of them would be good at all as being the CEO of Apple and I think or of the other
[19:44.880 --> 19:48.320]  company right you wouldn't want both of them have tried to make phones with disastrous
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.360]  results over the years right like you know I don't think any of these CEOs would be
[19:53.360 --> 20:00.240]  good at taking over the others company except maybe for Cook who is not a founder right
[20:00.240 --> 20:04.880]  like Cook would be the one who you could say well if he wanted to be the CEO of Amazon
[20:04.880 --> 20:09.120]  he'd probably be a lot better at being the CEO of Amazon than Bezos would be as the CEO
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.080]  of Apple but they're just you know the companies are formed in the creator's image and Elon
[20:14.080 --> 20:19.680]  Musk is the CEO of the companies he was meant to be in charge of you know SpaceX is very
[20:19.680 --> 20:26.240]  Elon Muskie yeah and the boring company and Tesla and just Starlink is just so many that
[20:26.240 --> 20:30.720]  but they all have that uniform goal and also whenever I see this I also wonder what it
[20:30.720 --> 20:36.080]  would have been what it would have been like if Steve Jobs had a Twitter account oh I don't
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.400]  think he ever would have been in I don't know it's an interesting it is an interesting
[20:40.400 --> 20:45.760]  like could he have gone like midnight emailing Steve Jobs had a Twitter account
[20:45.760 --> 20:53.760]  all right I don't know I mean I mean and Twitter was out by you know in 2006 2007 it just wasn't
[20:53.760 --> 20:59.520]  as much of a thing yeah uh I don't know I don't see him ever getting into tweeting
[21:00.560 --> 21:06.160]  yeah I would see it more like sort of like the way Schiller and Cook tweet you know and
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.960]  it's like when there's something new there's a tweet from the account and he might be interested
[21:10.960 --> 21:16.320]  enough to single you know be the one who actually writes the tweet but it's not like I wouldn't be
[21:16.320 --> 21:21.040]  like Elon Musk making trouble in tweets because back when I was on the other side of the fence
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.040]  like when I worked in marketing and we hired PR people the one of our most stressful periods was
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.920]  whenever a CEO got on a open mic that was just the potential for disaster and I remember like the
[21:30.560 --> 21:34.960]  Eric Schmidt would do that and the C the co-CEOs of rim would do that and he would just see the
[21:34.960 --> 21:41.040]  the the the ghosting of the PR people as they would try to stop it every time and it would
[21:41.040 --> 21:46.000]  go terribly every time and I don't know what happens at like Tesla or Facebook when they let
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.760]  you know Elon remark on an open mic but Apple's got a much better apparatus for that yeah they're
[21:51.760 --> 21:57.040]  much more disciplined that's very true uh here let me take a break and before we go on with
[21:57.040 --> 22:02.240]  the year in review and thank our first sponsor let me uh what a great company I love this app
[22:02.240 --> 22:11.680]  things t-h-i-n-g-s things the to-do task manager app that's been around now it's one of those apps
[22:11.680 --> 22:17.040]  that it's like I still think of it as a new app and it shows how old I'm getting maybe because
[22:17.040 --> 22:25.040]  it's not it's been around for a while great great app for all of Apple's platforms the Mac for iOS
[22:25.040 --> 22:31.040]  the phone and iPad the idea behind things when you want to achieve a goal you got to have a plan
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.680]  and it is a great way to organize the idea is very simple they have projects you create projects for
[22:37.680 --> 22:44.960]  your goals you add steps in a project to help you reach your goal and you can schedule those tasks
[22:44.960 --> 22:49.440]  for when you want to work on them or when you need to work on them and then every morning when you
[22:49.440 --> 22:55.760]  wake up things already has a list of to-dos for the day you can just look right at today
[22:55.760 --> 23:01.760]  it tells you based on everything you've already put into things what you need to do today you can
[23:01.760 --> 23:07.120]  just spend a few minutes reviewing that list you can drag those to-dos in the order you want to
[23:07.120 --> 23:14.560]  do them which to me is like oh that is like the one thing I need in any to-do type organization
[23:14.560 --> 23:21.680]  app that I want to even try to use if I can't like just drag them to reorder them I'm already like
[23:21.680 --> 23:26.640]  I'm out because that's how I think things let you do that and then you just get on with your day and
[23:26.640 --> 23:32.240]  it doesn't matter what device you're on everything sinks through the cloud so whether you are on your
[23:32.240 --> 23:39.040]  Mac whether you're on your phone you're on an iPad it's all there and things is beautiful and
[23:39.040 --> 23:46.720]  they have always integrated with the system in a very cohesive way so like when stuff like
[23:46.720 --> 23:54.320]  notification center and widgets and stuff like that it's like they're always right on top of it
[23:54.320 --> 24:01.280]  as as dedicated focused like the apple platform isn't just one of the targets for the thing system
[24:01.280 --> 24:06.320]  they are apple developers true and true that's the only place where things exist and so they
[24:06.320 --> 24:12.320]  embrace all that stuff when it's new it is just a great app so what do you do to get things to
[24:12.320 --> 24:20.480]  try it download a free trial for your mac fully native on the apple m1 max of course because like
[24:20.480 --> 24:28.080]  I said they stay up to date with all of the latest apple technology at culturedcode.com things just
[24:28.080 --> 24:34.880]  download it to your mac totally free to try great place to start or go to the app store and just
[24:34.880 --> 24:43.440]  search for things could not be easier t-h-i-n-g-s on the app store and you will find things there
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.520]  you go my thanks to culturedcode for sponsoring the show to promote things their terrific app
[24:51.440 --> 24:58.400]  all right before before we go to the year in review the other thing we should probably talk
[24:58.400 --> 25:07.840]  about uh over the last week is the uh is chrome bad yeah our friend the great lauren brichter
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.360]  uh yep surfaced and now lauren brichter everybody has to introduce him as you know creator of
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.280]  tweety uh letterpress the great app you wrote the gl stack for the original iphone as far as
[25:19.280 --> 25:26.800]  i can recall yeah the literal truly invented pull to refresh as a mechanism which is one of
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.520]  those things now that is so part of the oxygen of touch based systems that it's hard to believe
[25:31.520 --> 25:37.840]  it had to be invented and it wasn't there from the beginning he wrote ui kit for the mac before
[25:37.840 --> 25:42.960]  apple did and i believe he's probably written ui kit for open gl sorry for web gl already knowing
[25:42.960 --> 25:50.000]  him well he wrote a website called chrome is bad dot com and it got a lot of attention and it was
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.040]  funny because i wouldn't think that lauren's accomplishments are from that long ago that
[25:55.040 --> 25:58.560]  people wouldn't remember but like when it hit hacker news people are like who is this guy
[25:59.120 --> 26:03.360]  yeah it's like when tweety came out and people like who could write an app like this who is this
[26:04.800 --> 26:11.200]  uh but the gist of it was that lauren had seen a couple of macs like his wife's macbook pro
[26:11.200 --> 26:15.920]  and some other mac in their household that had been having very strange performance problems
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.600]  where everything was slow scrolling was slow typing was slow and nothing out of the ordinary
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.600]  was listed as consuming resources inactivity monitor it's just that like one of the ways it
[26:27.600 --> 26:34.080]  would manifest was that uh the windows server which is part of the system would be taking up
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.960]  excessive cpu but there wasn't like some app that you could say oh and you know it's this part of
[26:40.960 --> 26:47.200]  chrome because you know long story short it he deleted chrome deleting all traces of chrome
[26:47.200 --> 26:54.800]  restarted and this fixed both of his machines he made this website said i don't know what it's
[26:54.800 --> 27:00.000]  doing something that chrome installs in the background uh is doing something i don't know
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.920]  what it is um but it doesn't show up in activity monitor and when if you do these steps to delete
[27:06.480 --> 27:13.280]  all the traces of chrome and use a different browser uh the problems go away yeah and an
[27:13.280 --> 27:22.960]  awful lot of people are like holy crap this fixed my mac yes including you right yeah yeah me ben
[27:22.960 --> 27:28.080]  thompson uh you're part on dithering yeah uh several people who are super smart and the thing
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.880]  was that lauren suggested google has this thing called keystone which is their updater that
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.520]  originally came out with google earth and like 11 years ago wired saw it and called it evil
[27:37.520 --> 27:41.680]  and they just they won't use the system updater they won't use sparkle they just have to do their
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.240]  own thing because they want to continuously update chrome in the background and lauren's theory was
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.920]  that keystone would try to start up have a problem the process would never spawn an activity monitor
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.960]  but it would just churn windows server it would just thrash it until everything else stopped and
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.960]  then if you'd go in and not just delete chrome but go through all your your library files and
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.080]  delete anything with keystone in it this would stop happening and to their credit the chrome
[28:06.080 --> 28:09.440]  team and the chromium team jumped on this immediately they said they'd never heard of it
[28:09.440 --> 28:13.360]  but they're going to look in into it and they have a bug filed now and they're asking people
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.800]  for for help and for documentation and for use like for test cases and all that stuff but it
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.360]  fixed my problem i work on embargo is the same way you do and i would have this problem windows
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.480]  server would ramp up and i wouldn't be able to get final cut to let me finish editing my videos
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.760]  and it was incredibly stressful i wanted to throw my computer and i i have not had that problem since
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.200]  even uploading my videos like i know this is a complete post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy but
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.520]  i used to have like failure three or four times after uploading videos and i haven't had a single
[28:43.520 --> 28:49.440]  one yet so it's just it really is night and day i don't want to go full john sir accused of rant
[28:49.440 --> 28:56.000]  here um he but he did it so beautifully on atp recently but it's like this whole thing but yet
[28:56.000 --> 29:03.120]  it's so unsatisfying because we can't we don't know we don't have a oh here's what's going on
[29:03.120 --> 29:11.280]  right yeah and we should i i'm i'm kind of shocked and i i haven't really written about it
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.200]  on daring fireball because my first thought when the when the thing broke
[29:16.160 --> 29:22.560]  was well this isn't right and like lauren has since adjusted the text of the chrome is bad web
[29:22.560 --> 29:28.000]  page too he was super angry when he wrote he was and he had a thing that alleged that the
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.600]  keystone was hiding itself from activity monitor which clearly called it malware
[29:34.720 --> 29:40.560]  well there it's a little bit more of a judgment call but the hiding itself from activity monitor
[29:40.560 --> 29:49.840]  is a serious allegation because it would require deliberate malfeasance on the chrome team's part
[29:50.400 --> 29:56.480]  to hide it and it would it implicitly alleges that there's a gaping security hole
[29:56.480 --> 30:05.840]  in in mac os that allows for a background utility to hide itself yeah right well i understand because
[30:05.840 --> 30:09.840]  it would never surf like it was thrashing window service so badly it never showed up
[30:09.840 --> 30:12.480]  if that wasn't a problem it would have shown up and he would have seen it but he never
[30:12.480 --> 30:17.520]  saw it because of the problem yeah i don't think he lied i don't think he it maybe it was a little
[30:18.080 --> 30:24.320]  sloppy yes but he didn't lie it's that he was trying to what he was trying to say is what we've
[30:24.320 --> 30:29.920]  just said on this show me and you is that it's not that it hid itself in that malware sense
[30:29.920 --> 30:37.360]  it's it it doesn't show up in activity monitor so hide was the wrong verb to be sure but what's
[30:37.360 --> 30:45.760]  weird about this is that we clearly something is going on it there is some something is going on
[30:45.760 --> 30:53.040]  here there's way too many people who have just erased all traces of chrome and had very similar
[30:53.040 --> 31:01.120]  very similar problems vanish yes you know like ben thompson it really he spent months where he
[31:01.120 --> 31:06.160]  was dying because he just was like i should just but he really would have bought a new computer but
[31:06.160 --> 31:11.680]  didn't only because he knew the m1 max were coming out and so it wasn't a good time to buy a computer
[31:11.680 --> 31:17.440]  and he chalked it up to catalina but here we are weeks later and still nobody has put a finger on
[31:17.440 --> 31:25.120]  what it is and it's but it seems like too many people have had uh it's so unsatisfying and i'm
[31:25.120 --> 31:32.560]  very surprised with the number of uh it seems prevalent and clearly this is the thing that
[31:32.560 --> 31:38.320]  that didn't affect everybody right and i think that's you know that should go without saying if
[31:38.320 --> 31:43.680]  if every single person with chrome on their mac had this problem that the chrome team itself would
[31:43.680 --> 31:48.640]  have it and they'd fix it yes well that's the thing about like modern software is so complicated and
[31:48.640 --> 31:52.800]  depends so much on initial conditions settings other programs you have installed like this
[31:52.800 --> 31:57.200]  could be a pure chromium issue chrome issue keystone issue it could involve certain versions
[31:57.200 --> 32:02.880]  of mac os certain other utilities or systems that you have or sorry or a task that you have running
[32:02.880 --> 32:07.680]  it could be a big complicated mess and just removing chrome removes a little one part of
[32:07.680 --> 32:12.800]  that enough that everything starts moving again and that's really hard to fix but to lauren's one
[32:12.800 --> 32:17.600]  of lauren's original points is that chrome doesn't have to update this way google chooses to have it
[32:17.600 --> 32:23.520]  update this way but they could be using a standard updater that allows you to consent to updates
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.440]  because this doesn't even ask your permission to update chrome it just does it in the background
[32:27.440 --> 32:34.000]  which is a service to some people but is anathema to other people that to me is that's the me my as
[32:34.000 --> 32:42.000]  yet unwritten take on during fireball is that the problem here isn't well i would love to know what
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.400]  the actual technical problem is and hopefully there is one and we'll get to the bottom of it
[32:46.400 --> 32:53.760]  um well there obviously is a problem and whether it's actually chrome's fault or whether it could
[32:53.760 --> 32:58.960]  be that chrome is only doing things that they technically shouldn't cause this problem and the
[32:58.960 --> 33:05.760]  bug is in windows server itself yeah getting tickled in a certain way that triggers this bug
[33:05.760 --> 33:11.440]  it could be that the bug is apples and it is in windows server and hopefully we'll figure out what
[33:11.440 --> 33:15.840]  that is somebody's got to figure it out this is maddening even though i'm personally not affected
[33:15.840 --> 33:20.800]  by it i'm like huh i've got chrome you know and i'm sure most people have chrome haven't seen it
[33:20.800 --> 33:24.480]  and i want to use chrome to be clear there's so many websites that work best with chrome i would
[33:24.480 --> 33:31.520]  it would be better for me if i could use it but it this wouldn't be an issue if there is fault
[33:31.520 --> 33:37.120]  there's i there is with certainty fault on chrome's part and that's that their their software update
[33:37.120 --> 33:45.520]  system is in my opinion by design disrespectful it it's not the way things work on the mac
[33:45.520 --> 33:51.360]  even apple's own software like and as much as people want to some people want to say that apple
[33:51.360 --> 33:56.960]  is sort of like authoritarian that they yeah that they they dictate to people you know that they
[33:56.960 --> 34:02.000]  you know that they people are resistant to get into the apple ecosystem because apple tells you
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.960]  how to do everything and they want you to update everything and blah blah blah it's like apple is
[34:06.960 --> 34:15.280]  actually extremely respectful of your computer being yours and almost nothing that they do
[34:15.920 --> 34:24.160]  is mandatory i mean there's there might be some very rarely invoked i mean like maybe once ever
[34:24.160 --> 34:30.480]  security things that they they can do remotely you know like if they detect malware they can push
[34:30.480 --> 34:39.760]  certain things to stop a malware in fact infection from spreading further but they almost never do
[34:39.760 --> 34:47.360]  that like os updates you have control over them and they do steer you when you set up a new device
[34:47.360 --> 34:53.920]  through a process that encourages you to turn on automatic updates and they do have automatic
[34:53.920 --> 35:01.600]  updates for ios and for watch os and even mac os that if you do allow it to happen and they do
[35:01.600 --> 35:07.680]  encourage you to turn it on tries to do things in an intelligent way where like your phone will say
[35:07.680 --> 35:16.000]  okay ios 14.1 is out and apple has pushed it and you've got automatic updates on it'll down
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.320]  load it while it's on wi-fi during the day and will install itself and restart overnight at like
[35:22.320 --> 35:26.560]  four in the morning so that you're never interrupted and you wake up and your phone will
[35:26.560 --> 35:34.080]  say you've you know you're now running ios 14 welcome to ios 14 but it's also very easy you
[35:34.080 --> 35:41.440]  don't have to like dig into the command line and type a defaults thing to turn it off like it's
[35:41.440 --> 35:48.640]  you know it's a nice friendlier big blue button that says turn allow auto updates and it's sort
[35:48.640 --> 35:56.880]  of a less friendly not now underneath to say not now i'll do it manually but it's not hidden
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.200]  right well even on my mac it's been trying to install big sur for a month and i just don't let
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.080]  it like it needs me to push certain buttons to do the auto update it's downloaded it it's already
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.720]  it keeps popping up saying hey you have an update i ignore it and i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine
[36:10.720 --> 36:16.400]  i'm fine i'm not upgrading this machine it's this and in fact my hey this is an older machine i
[36:16.400 --> 36:22.480]  should be i'm gonna wait a couple of months before i update it if ever turns out that these old uh
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.320]  2014 macbook pros actually had a problem with big sur where it was bricking them like it wasn't even
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.400]  like it was like you have to like take it in to get service to get out of it and it's like well
[36:32.400 --> 36:39.040]  that's why i don't update automatically um so the only hitch is i do have a red i have a red badge
[36:39.040 --> 36:47.600]  for software updates uh that's it but otherwise i don't have to update it you know and most mac
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.320]  apps don't update automatically in the background when the app's not running the app is running when
[36:54.320 --> 36:59.360]  you launch it and you double click it and that's when most third-party apps that you don't get
[36:59.360 --> 37:05.760]  through the app store update and they you know a lot of third-party mac apps use the same framework
[37:05.760 --> 37:12.320]  called sparkle yes everybody listening to this podcast has almost certainly seen a sparkle app
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.440]  it's you know and it's just there's an update available do you want to download it now you
[37:17.440 --> 37:22.560]  download it now and then it downloads and you click install and then the app quits and when
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.120]  launches itself again and you've got the new version and it's all under your control and if
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.880]  you don't want it you could not do it and you probably have a preference to say don't even check
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.400]  don't even check yep and if you do use the app store you can turn off auto updates in the app
[37:38.400 --> 37:43.600]  store too and install those manually which is what i do because i don't want my apps to install i
[37:43.600 --> 37:52.720]  i'm i'm volunteering to give myself the chore of purposefully looking uh and that is the macintosh
[37:52.720 --> 38:01.680]  way and that has is inherited by ios it's also the ios way it should be and i mean this in a
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.840]  sort of ethical sense it should be up to the user whether whether and when they're updating
[38:08.720 --> 38:14.720]  and what the app is doing in the background like the flip side of it too is you should be in charge
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.640]  you should be in control of when your apps update if you want to and on the flip side is when you
[38:20.640 --> 38:25.520]  drag when you're like i don't want this app anymore and you drag it to the trash on the mac
[38:25.520 --> 38:32.480]  or delete it from your home screen on ios you should know that there's nothing left behind
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.440]  that is doing anything like are there preference files and stuff like that well in some ways that's
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.800]  actually a feature that those get left behind so if you reinstall it your data is still there
[38:43.360 --> 38:49.920]  but in terms of the actual software that runs it shouldn't be there it there should be nothing left
[38:49.920 --> 38:56.480]  behind and the way that chrome is designed where it installs like little invisible background agents
[38:57.200 --> 39:04.800]  outside your applications folder and sets launch daemons so that when you restart it runs you can
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.360]  delete chrome dot app but when you restart your computer it's still running the software updater
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.480]  in background once every three thousand seconds or something like that yeah that to me is a is is
[39:18.480 --> 39:26.640]  is it wrong it's wrong design and it's it's disrespectful and presumptuous it is them saying
[39:26.640 --> 39:33.120]  it's it's the chrome team saying we know better than you how you know how your chrome should
[39:33.120 --> 39:39.200]  update you're better off we know we know you're better off always having your chrome up to date
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.360]  and so we're going to install this for you and have it happen automatically and if they didn't
[39:45.360 --> 39:51.040]  have that design no one would be throwing shade at them for this chroma's badge scandal and i
[39:51.040 --> 39:54.880]  know some people immediately will say well apple doesn't give you an on off switch on your you know
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.760]  air pods max so apple's doing the same thing and i think the difference is like just the intention
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.000]  like apple knows that for a lot of people they'll forget these are a wireless product and if you
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.680]  forget to turn them off you'll drain your battery it's a bad experience so they'd rather just use
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.800]  the accelerometer to power them down for you and then when you put them back on they just work so
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.480]  to me it it's not the system per se it's the intention uh and the consideration behind it
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.920]  that matters yeah so that's my take is that they should not have this design for software update
[40:23.920 --> 40:30.960]  on the mac it it and i don't think they're going to reconsider but it it's never made me comfortable
[40:30.960 --> 40:35.760]  um i don't like it and i also think that they should document it if they're going to go this
[40:35.760 --> 40:41.520]  route they they they've decided purposefully it's not like google is some small tiny upstart
[40:41.520 --> 40:47.200]  that doesn't have the resources to document how it works um yeah it's open source on windows right
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.320]  like it's fully transparent on windows but not on mac right and there are other apps and let me just
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.680]  say this before i forget because i i want to mention it so just to name one friend of the show
[40:57.680 --> 41:03.360]  our good friends at rogue amoeba yeah who make audio software for the mac everything from audio
[41:03.360 --> 41:12.400]  hijacked to piezo to sound source uh yeah yeah their software which does very complex at you
[41:12.400 --> 41:21.360]  know at the high end like with audio hijack uh needs stuff that runs outside it's not it can't
[41:21.360 --> 41:26.720]  just be done as a simple app to do the sort of audio processing where you're grabbing audio from
[41:26.720 --> 41:32.400]  another application and filtering it into this like the whole point of the app is that they're
[41:32.400 --> 41:39.760]  doing things that are outside the capabilities of a simple app that you double click and so they and
[41:39.760 --> 41:46.000]  they have very copious instructions and installers to help you do this as best they can to make it as
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.160]  friction free as possible and they are so considerate their installers i was going to
[41:50.160 --> 41:53.360]  bring them up because they are just above and beyond they've thought through every
[41:53.360 --> 41:59.280]  sort of convenience you could imagine for those installers right so they need to have an installer
[41:59.280 --> 42:05.280]  and they need to be running something in addition to a double clickable app and they explain it all
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.120]  they make it as easy as possible they tell you what they're doing they tell you what they've done
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.840]  they tell you what needs to be updated when it needs to be updated and if you ever decide i'm
[42:17.840 --> 42:24.720]  out i don't want this anymore they make it completely easy to uninstall all of it and then
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.360]  you've it's like they were never even there um yeah and chrome doesn't need to be running in
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.400]  the background like that it doesn't need to have launch agents and they don't document it and they
[42:36.400 --> 42:43.920]  don't make it easy to uninstall it yeah very disrespectful perfecta yeah um anyway you're
[42:43.920 --> 42:52.320]  in review here we go yeah well what a year i was looking back so i made an outline and the funny
[42:52.320 --> 43:01.600]  part is the pre-pandemic part of 2020 apple did nothing yeah i was like so i mean they did stuff
[43:01.600 --> 43:09.040]  but there was no like consumer right uh so yeah i do see you what what did happen in that so
[43:09.040 --> 43:16.640]  january till the beginning of march uh i i forgot about richard plepler coming from hbo yeah uh
[43:16.640 --> 43:23.520]  uh yeah i guess that's interesting and it does sort of tie in to like i know ben and
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.600]  i have talked about this on dithering quite a bit uh and and mg seigler on my one of my
[43:29.600 --> 43:36.240]  highlights of the year on this podcast was mg's idea that apple tv plus is the new hbo
[43:36.240 --> 43:42.800]  which is like oh come on that's too and it's like wait maybe like it actually kind of is like
[43:42.800 --> 43:47.920]  i'm a fan of apple tv plus but even for me that was a bit too far and then i was like no now that
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.040]  i think about it i think maybe and it because it's both the fact that apple tv plus is a little more
[43:53.040 --> 43:56.400]  careful and it's like we're not going to have the most shows but we're going to try for the best
[43:56.400 --> 44:03.360]  shows and combined with time warner doing everything in their power to dilute the hbo brand
[44:04.240 --> 44:10.880]  so maybe christina warren uh you've spent on the show before brilliant also said it's like
[44:10.880 --> 44:15.360]  nbc at its heights and you know they have the comedies but they also have the dramas and they
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.160]  have the edgier stuff like la law you know it's almost like a classic tv channel programming
[44:20.160 --> 44:25.920]  maybe yeah i don't know um but really there wasn't much going on nothing consumer-facing
[44:27.920 --> 44:34.480]  and then i i i recall i forget if it was in march or if it was the end of february but i had
[44:34.480 --> 44:41.920]  federico vatici on the show and it was when italy you know was like the like the hot spot in outside
[44:41.920 --> 44:50.960]  china in the world and i i don't regret it it's not like i'm embarrassed by my take but it was
[44:50.960 --> 44:57.520]  very decidedly hey how weird is it that italy got hit hard by this bug like this good luck i hope
[44:57.520 --> 45:04.560]  everything works out for everybody um yeah but i it was definitely an assumption that did not hold
[45:04.560 --> 45:13.760]  up very well that italy was an outlier and uh did not take long for that to to be shown as the
[45:15.600 --> 45:21.840]  pretty bad assumption uh yeah like you've noted here that in that time period apples ended trips
[45:21.840 --> 45:27.440]  to china and started closing stores i forget when when did they start closing stores i forget when
[45:27.440 --> 45:32.240]  did they start closing stores because of covid i think it was starting in february and then moving
[45:32.240 --> 45:37.520]  into march and uh i know michael steibler on nine to five mac has been really good at pointing this
[45:37.520 --> 45:43.120]  out but apple has one of the best covid response teams i think anywhere you can almost always see
[45:43.120 --> 45:47.920]  by the apple store closings what the actual cities should be doing and aren't doing because they open
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.880]  up and close down on really good data with really good timing and i think we should all just be
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.200]  following his tracker because it would give us much better information than any government has
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.480]  and again you know and i think it's as simple as that they are
[46:04.960 --> 46:11.760]  striking the very correct balance between yes we would like to be open because we would like to be
[46:11.760 --> 46:18.960]  selling stuff and we would like for our employees to be you know doing their thing and we want our
[46:18.960 --> 46:23.920]  customers you know everybody's happy when we're selling stuff if it's safe but if it's not safe
[46:23.920 --> 46:31.200]  we don't want anybody being uh you know having their they're doing anything risky that they
[46:31.200 --> 46:36.880]  shouldn't do you know what what is the correct balance between wanting to be open but also
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.600]  wanting to do the right thing and i think apple has sort of struck it i think josh centers at
[46:41.600 --> 46:47.360]  tidbits has called it he's he's talked about that too that it's sort of like the apple store index
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.880]  that you know where apple stores are open is a really good indication of where things are
[46:52.880 --> 47:01.200]  spiraling out of control yes um yeah in hindsight for the year like ways that this year went off the
[47:01.200 --> 47:08.160]  rails like it didn't take too long you know into the end of april where before it started sinking
[47:08.160 --> 47:18.400]  in that this might be the whole year i mean yeah but i didn't anticipate even if that was the case
[47:18.400 --> 47:25.680]  if this whole thing had gone like it did really badly that there would be so much back and forth
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.920]  right like and if we just take apple stores as the index that they'd be opening and then closing
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.960]  and then opening and closing and yeah waves spreading around the country and around the
[47:38.960 --> 47:45.520]  world in north america um it it just didn't anticipate i really just did not anticipate how
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.760]  it would ebb and flow yeah well i think the culture clash with a lot of western countries
[47:51.760 --> 47:57.280]  was not anticipated they just the way that we would handle i think a lot of people just assumed
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.360]  that we would be the best in the world at handling everything and it would not be a problem and
[48:01.360 --> 48:05.680]  we would be helping you know those poor other countries get through their troubles and it
[48:05.680 --> 48:11.200]  just turned out completely opposite yeah yeah it's it's really strange but it was like we were
[48:11.200 --> 48:15.920]  anticipating a march apple event i think all of us thought that there would be a like a as usual
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.960]  a march apple event we'd all go to cupertino or wherever they chose to hold it and we would see
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.120]  a bunch of products and announcements and it would be just business as usual for the year yeah and
[48:25.120 --> 48:30.160]  well and the other thing too and that they clearly affected apple i mean they've you know they've
[48:30.160 --> 48:34.480]  said this we don't have to be insiders to know it they've they've talked about it on you know
[48:34.480 --> 48:44.800]  publicly but the way that it hit china uh sees it it literally like like an engine seasoning
[48:44.800 --> 48:50.480]  up it just totally shut down the entire supply chain i mean like just shut it down and also
[48:50.480 --> 48:54.160]  their ability to go there because usually they they are doing pre-production they work well
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.440]  ahead of a lot of products and they're doing pre-production that involves a ton of apple
[48:57.440 --> 49:01.760]  people going to china being there on the floor checking prototypes doing feedback monitoring
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.240]  quality doing it's in a very well we've talked about this before too right like apple books out
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.880]  entire airline flights routinely they're the biggest customers and that all just stopped
[49:10.880 --> 49:17.840]  right like however many uh employees in normal times are shuttling back and forth between
[49:18.800 --> 49:26.640]  sfo and china it's you know what it it was uh that they after standing order of 50 business
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.120]  class seats a day or something like that yeah it was some ridiculous number that you doubled it
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.160]  and it was still like right and like and it was like on united or something i think it was united
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.120]  but yeah and then somebody yeah someone photographed it accidentally uh at one point
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.760]  posted it in an apple right well it was like no it was yeah it was like a united internal sales
[49:45.760 --> 49:52.960]  presentation yes uh some poor some poor soul at united didn't didn't realize that apple considered
[49:52.960 --> 49:59.040]  that confidential um yeah but like somebody pointed out to me they're like in addition to
[49:59.040 --> 50:05.520]  like when i expressed my okay i guess i believe it but if you do the math that's just an enormous
[50:05.520 --> 50:11.280]  number of seats in the plane and yes they don't necessarily aren't doing it every day and if they
[50:11.280 --> 50:16.560]  have all 50 and they're like well we only have 10 people going to china today they they i guess
[50:16.560 --> 50:22.000]  release those seats and you know the united customers can maybe you get you're you're very
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.200]  lucky you get a free upgrade from coach to business class you know for a transpacific flight
[50:29.200 --> 50:34.320]  i mean what a delight that would be but so it doesn't mean they have 50 people doing it every
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.240]  day but they're certainly close enough that they keep the standing order but the thing that was the
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.520]  real eye opener for me was that somebody pointed out like that's just united like you know yes
[50:43.520 --> 50:47.360]  the people who you know some people prefer it because they want to get the points but other
[50:47.360 --> 50:55.440]  people who you know prefer comfort fly other airlines yeah like the the asian airlines uh
[50:55.440 --> 50:59.200]  and you get a better you get a better experience they're like they're and you know and they have
[50:59.200 --> 51:04.160]  the discretion not to have leaked how many seats apple has on those points well anyway
[51:04.960 --> 51:09.680]  all those flights weren't even taking off let alone being filled with apple employees
[51:09.680 --> 51:15.760]  um yeah and in hindsight so again speaking now me and you speaking in december
[51:15.760 --> 51:24.160]  apple made it work i mean this is has been i don't know what if anything in theory apple wanted to
[51:24.160 --> 51:30.320]  ship in 2020 and didn't but you know like let's say like this the tiles project right like i
[51:30.320 --> 51:35.520]  don't know there's a couple of what else is rumored the tiles thing and the headphones i
[51:35.520 --> 51:38.720]  mean the air the air pods max were one of those things we didn't think that they were going to
[51:38.720 --> 51:44.320]  ship and they still got them out um yeah damn if they didn't make it work i mean it's
[51:44.320 --> 51:51.360]  uh really really quite remarkable um but they updated almost everything what do you think the
[51:51.360 --> 51:57.440]  march event would have been so what they did is they had a remote press briefing on march 17th
[51:57.440 --> 52:04.640]  and i don't think i'm i'm 99 sure i just looked at my notes before the show that this this wasn't
[52:04.640 --> 52:11.360]  something it was only press only who got to watch it it wasn't streamed yes um yeah they hadn't got
[52:11.360 --> 52:15.520]  yeah they hadn't got that i think it would have been almost identical to the 2016 march event
[52:15.520 --> 52:20.480]  where they announced the iphone se and back then the 9.7 inch ipad pro and it would have just been
[52:20.480 --> 52:27.360]  the second iphone se and the new uh a12z yeah so what they did announce on march 17th was
[52:27.360 --> 52:33.840]  updated macbook airs where the real there was some kind of intel 10th generation blah blah blah
[52:34.400 --> 52:40.160]  and it was like ice lake yeah but it was really it gets the good keyboard that had just come out
[52:40.160 --> 52:48.240]  a year ago as you and i speak right now a year ago in the 16-inch macbook pro yes and it was like in
[52:48.240 --> 52:52.800]  march they're like okay you know that the good keyboard now it's in the macbook air and and they
[52:52.800 --> 53:00.320]  could have stopped right there the ipad pros got updated which in one of the weirdest updates for
[53:00.320 --> 53:07.600]  the ipad ever right because it was like they've never done this before instead of it they just
[53:07.600 --> 53:14.320]  they didn't go to it they they skipped the whole a13 generation and went from the a12x to the a12z
[53:15.200 --> 53:24.320]  and the a12z really was just enabling this the eighth gpu core right yeah it was higher bin
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.080]  because their yields were good enough that they didn't have to worry about you know the expense
[53:28.080 --> 53:34.720]  of those chips uh but it also i i wonder if they were just so busy with m1 and the a14 that they
[53:34.720 --> 53:41.520]  didn't have time to make the a13x and they still wanted to get lidar out on the market right as
[53:41.520 --> 53:48.960]  early as possible i guess that's the thinking if i had to guess as as what my theory is is that yeah
[53:48.960 --> 54:01.600]  that they the a12 z or x was so good that we you know they could easily not ship an a13x and ipads
[54:01.600 --> 54:09.680]  ipad pros are nobody's gonna say oh this is starting to feel pokey yes uh it was a simple
[54:09.680 --> 54:16.000]  that the the move from the x to the z going from seven cores where if you take out your microscope
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.360]  and look there's eight cores but only seven were enabled was clearly a binning issue right yes
[54:21.360 --> 54:25.120]  where they just got better at making them and like yeah we can just guarantee all eight of them
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.640]  were are good to go yep and the real big hardware change was going from a tiny little
[54:30.640 --> 54:37.760]  like old just single lens camera to a bigger square okay now it's a whole camera system
[54:38.320 --> 54:47.120]  with lidar um which again why though like that's my that's my my takeaway now lo these
[54:48.080 --> 54:54.800]  10 months later is why why why care about getting lidar out for the ipad pro like i don't
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.720]  i still don't see what the advantage what what the point of that was i just think it's them
[55:00.720 --> 55:04.080]  you know because it was going to come to the iphone and it still is you and i've heard rumors
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.880]  for years about a much better camera app that tied into the whole ar system and it still hasn't
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.920]  come out and that was the rumor you know because the the ipad pro was so strange for other reasons
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.720]  like the the camera team didn't enable portrait mode even though it has lidar so if you hit the
[55:18.720 --> 55:22.880]  portrait mode button and you're using the rear cameras it actually flips around and switches to
[55:22.880 --> 55:27.760]  the true depth camera front facing which is a really weird experience it just felt like they
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.120]  wanted to get this ipad out they didn't have time to do everything so they just shipped it which is
[55:33.120 --> 55:38.880]  really super odd but my only guess is that they need to get this technology out so that we're all
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.680]  you know developers especially but we're all using this stuff far enough advanced that they
[55:43.680 --> 55:48.640]  can get it into the iphone and then into whatever wearable products they're thinking about for next
[55:48.640 --> 55:57.520]  year i guess it's just hard for me to see it and it's like maybe there's a market in ar software
[55:57.520 --> 56:03.040]  for ios and for the phone that i'm just not seeing like i know that you can get like the ikea app and
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.640]  you know drop a kerfloggen chair in the middle of your living room and and see what it looks like
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.120]  and i've played with that and it's there's some cool stuff but maybe people are using that more
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.280]  than i think like i don't think so like i don't think they needed to ship this light like honestly
[56:19.280 --> 56:23.280]  i don't think we would have noticed if they hadn't updated the ipad pro because the magic keyboard
[56:23.280 --> 56:29.200]  which was the biggest deal and the cursor support worked with the a12x version right as well right
[56:29.200 --> 56:38.320]  to me the more interesting use of lidar as we know it now in these devices is just as an extra
[56:38.320 --> 56:47.200]  an extra aid for the regular camera system yes which is what the iphone 12 pro and pro max do
[56:47.920 --> 56:55.040]  yes is that they will the ipad does not do right that they'll use lidar in low light situations
[56:55.040 --> 57:01.280]  to help with autofocus yeah and they only need it in low light because when it's not low light
[57:01.280 --> 57:08.480]  the regular camera lens needs no help it it autofocus is so fast that the lidar is too crude to help
[57:09.200 --> 57:15.520]  it's like yeah yeah just pitch in when it's dark and you know that's good enough um but the ipad
[57:15.520 --> 57:21.200]  doesn't do that and i did ask i remember i i you know not that um you know it was all that
[57:23.360 --> 57:27.920]  not that it wasn't an obvious question but i remember in an off the you know talking with
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.440]  people at apple off the record being briefed on the ipad i asked about well does does this
[57:33.440 --> 57:40.000]  lidar sensor in the ipad pro help with autofocus you know with the regular camera and the answer
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.960]  was well that's an interesting idea but no yeah and that and i assumed that meant it was coming
[57:44.960 --> 57:50.160]  this fall but it didn't come this fall either right that's an interesting idea is always
[57:50.160 --> 57:57.600]  it that's like the best you ever get from them yeah yes it usually means it usually means
[57:58.800 --> 58:05.120]  we i'd like to say something but i can't and it i guess it's not coming to these ipad pros you know
[58:05.120 --> 58:08.480]  which i don't get because if they've built it now for the iphone and they're still like like you
[58:08.480 --> 58:14.160]  know ipad os and ios are still synonymous systems you know i i'm i was surprised they didn't update
[58:14.160 --> 58:20.960]  the camera app in iowa and ipad os 14 yeah just do all this or at least like in 14.1 or 14.2
[58:20.960 --> 58:27.680]  because there's always like the you know we're starting to see a pattern now where the 14 or
[58:27.680 --> 58:35.920]  whatever the new integer is 0.0 is very specifically cut off in august for the phones
[58:35.920 --> 58:44.640]  yeah for the new phones and the it's the 0.1 update that is really the point oh you know it's
[58:45.360 --> 58:50.640]  or what we used to think of as a point oh it's you know like the the point o's are somewhere between
[58:50.640 --> 58:58.720]  beta and real and in fact going back to our chrome talk a couple minutes ago apple doesn't even push
[58:58.720 --> 59:07.040]  the 14.0 or 13.0s to people as like an automatic update like yeah there's this weird internal
[59:07.040 --> 59:15.280]  criterion that they don't want to talk about as to when they decide to push the okay yeah here's
[59:15.280 --> 59:22.400]  your red badge first you know for upgrade get the new version of the os and the the point o's usually
[59:22.400 --> 59:26.960]  aren't it i just assume it's the emoji update that's the thing everyone cares about yeah
[59:26.960 --> 59:32.240]  you know that that's true that that's yes when they really want you to update when they're like
[59:32.240 --> 59:38.960]  yeah this is rock solid this is actually pushing this update out is going to cut down on our tech
[59:38.960 --> 59:44.080]  support and genius bar appointments not increase them that's when they're like and here's a bunch
[59:44.080 --> 59:50.560]  of new emoji here's a new emoji yeah so i don't wasn't much else from that though i don't really
[59:50.560 --> 59:55.360]  have much to say i have nothing to say about the macbook air that the intel one other than that
[59:55.360 --> 01:00:02.080]  the keyboard was better you know yes it i can say one was trash but the keyboard was better yeah
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:08.400]  one year later the the the return of scissor key switches in the keyboards has to be considered
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:17.280]  a triumph we now no longer talk about bad macbook keyboards except as a very faint memory of the
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:25.520]  faint and painful memory right uh april 15th the iphone se2 came out second generation i can only
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:32.320]  presume that if that the plan was to announce that all at one march event that it would have
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:42.800]  been the iphone se the tweaked ipads air ipad pros and the macbook um and it just wasn't because of
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.520]  covid that's what i think and the odd thing to me is that they had really well produced videos for
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.120]  the ipad pro they had craig federighi showing off the keyboard and the cursor and they had a video
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:58.000]  with developers showing off different parts of ar and there was nothing for the iphone se like
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.080]  as far as i can tell no apple presentation at all yeah well i guess we should talk about that i
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.880]  guess that the bigger part of the march announcement wasn't really the ipad pros but the magic keyboard
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:15.600]  and the magic keyboard what makes it magic it is a nice device i'm still i really like it it's one
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.160]  of my it would be one of my top picks of the year as an apple product but it was the it's not just
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:31.760]  the the keyboard itself it's the ipad os update that enabled a real mouse cursor system system
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:39.680]  wide which you know was like 13.3 or something like that like yeah totally even wait right 14.0
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.240]  right they just released it and it just worked and it you know apps had to be updated to really
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.920]  support it yeah but they even with doing nothing it was still pretty usable like it just clicks
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:59.360]  equals a touch and you know all of a sudden you and i we could just interrupt people right here
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:08.960]  tell people we can you can listen to me and renee argue about yes touch screen max and uh if ipads
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.960]  can add mouse support without messing things up why can't max add touch screens the same way
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.040]  you we you need a whole 38 minutes of us talking about it and yes go see it on renee's youtube
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.440]  channel because there it is that's terrific but the thing that i thought was super fun about this
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.920]  was when because the it leaked people found it in the firmware and everyone just assumed it was such
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:39.360]  a big change it would have to be ios 14. yeah definitely yeah the rumors just all jumped to
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.640]  the conclusion that it was ios 14 and they were just like nope right here in the middle of march
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.480]  within your keyboard they just shipped it right and it's great it really is i i i used my ipad
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:59.760]  so much more than i ever did before yeah it is my kitchen laptop i go days at a time without taking
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:07.440]  my ipad off the magic keyboard it was neat because i had the trackpad and external keyboard support
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.560]  i mean the external keyboard worked before but without a trackpad it was always it's just amazing
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.080]  how much more useful it is like when your hands are on the keyboard to have a trackpad right there
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:25.520]  and not have to reach and touch the screen um but the magic keyboard is so good at it like
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:34.720]  and in a way where they didn't they didn't cripple the the support for just using an external trackpad
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:42.560]  or bluetooth keyboard to get you like the only good way to use it is to buy this 170 dollar
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.640]  magic keyboard or whatever how much is a magic keyboard i think it's it's fun call it $300 i
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:55.120]  don't remember exactly but it's incredibly expensive it's very expensive yeah it but they've
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:02.400]  made just regular if you just use a bluetooth mouse or a magic trackpad from a mac that you
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.840]  have laying around and whatever third-party keyboard you want they've made it as good as it
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.800]  could be with bluetooth in ipad you know and but yeah that the thing that i've gone back and forth
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:22.000]  over the months of 2020 trying you know using mechanical keyboards and stuff with my ipad and
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.200]  going back to the magic keyboard the thing that is so that truly is the magic part of it is that
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:34.320]  you never have to pair and unpair it right like when i'm using a magic trackpad just the standalone
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.680]  trackpad and a keyboard i might like the keyboard better because it's a clicky mechanical keyboard
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:47.840]  but i pick my ipad up and i go off and it's still connected right and here's where it's like you
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.680]  want in theory you want bluetooth to have as good a range as possible but it's like the the better
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.640]  bluetooth ranges the more likely it is that i've wandered several rooms apart from my kitchen
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:05.200]  and i tap on something to type a url or something and i can't i don't have an on-screen keep what
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.280]  why is there oh it still thinks it's connected to the bluetooth key yeah and i that's how my
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.440]  mind thinks it's like you still think you're connected and it's like no i am connected that's
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.400]  why that's why there's no on-screen keyboard and i gotta like go up to control center and
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:26.880]  turn on airplane mode give it a second turn off airplane mode and then it all works it always
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.640]  it always takes me out of it whereas when i'm using the actual magic keyboard accessory as soon
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.640]  as i take the ipad off the keyboard the ipad instantly knows okay now i'll give you the
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.640]  on-screen keyboard and it never interrupts your flow it is like a dock it's like two states and
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.560]  i think federighi shows that off right in that initial video where you come you slap it down
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.200]  it's docked it's it's your keyboard you pick it up you walk away it's undocked it's no longer your
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:01.600]  keyboard it is a terrific experience it really is it is so very strange it is in fact 300
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:10.480]  yes uh i think that the the 13 inch one is an extra 30 bucks right it's like 329
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.560]  uh it doesn't seem right does that seem right to you that you have to pay more for the bigger one
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.080]  i guess big means more i don't know but it's like you get to our psyche you get the same number of
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:29.280]  keys you know it yeah they're just cramped closer together on the it doesn't seem weird oh it's 350
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:36.880]  so it's uh 299 for the 11 inch and 350 for the 12.9 inch it doesn't seem right to me but either
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:43.600]  way it is a premium price uh i have to say though if you really want to use your ipad as a laptop
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:50.720]  it's worth it it is yes it and as the year has gone on i i i see that as money well spent and
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.920]  this is for me a person who still even now that i'm more in love with using the ipad than ever
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.880]  before easily still the first apple platform i would ditch from my life if somebody came to me
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.800]  in some kind of bizarre sicko hostage situation and said you have to get rid of one of your apple
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.640]  devices and never use it again the ipad would still be the first one i would get rid of
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.600]  um in a bizarre christopher nolan movie if you're forced to choose the ipad would go for it right
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:28.400]  tenet two yeah i it's it's really what a successful product i and and as the months
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.520]  have gone on i'm only more keenly aware of how how how very nice it is um i don't have much more
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:41.040]  to say about it though no i think it was terrific really good start to the year yeah uh next up
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:48.880]  would be uh i don't think there was anything else still wwdc yeah and so the you know there's the
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.160]  run-up where it was like i forget when they announced that they but they pulled the trigger
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.520]  pretty early and just said you know what we're not gonna have we're gonna you know about as early as
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.560]  they usually ever announced wwdc and they just said you know we're gonna do it all virtual this year
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:10.080]  and people weren't sure because google just flat out cancelled io right and facebook was going
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.880]  was going facebook like wavered on their developer conference yeah and then they were like ah forget
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.600]  it i don't know we're not gonna have it and microsoft did a virtual one but it was very
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:30.160]  different than what wdc ended up being yeah um wwdc in hindsight you know it's really kind of
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:38.320]  remarkable that go you know it that it was only three weeks later than it probably would have been
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.840]  if it had been held for real uh and how high the production values were and how popular it was
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:55.200]  how well received i mean it was so well received that i i would say there's more people that i
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:03.200]  observed who said i hope that this is what they do every year than the other way around and developers
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.240]  were angry at apple going into wwc because of all the things with hey and with uh there was i forget
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:14.400]  the account that got cancelled so there was a lot of developer you know relation sort of uh fix-up
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:21.280]  to be doing but it seemed like when wwc hit a lot of that got put aside yeah it was a remarkably
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:31.440]  successful wwc even with the complete inversion of it being a real world traditional multi-thousand
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.640]  attendee conference in a big convention center um to being completely virtual it was very well
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.840]  received and content wise uh all sorts of all sorts of stuff that i think was also very very
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.120]  well received it was a very good year for apple's platforms and they kept the fun part like when the
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.240]  different engineers and program managers showed up to do their sessions they all had different sort
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.760]  of easter eggs on the desks and in the background and different sort of fun things in it and
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.320]  perennial friend of the show serenity caldwell did these daily wrap-ups yeah from the from the
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.600]  evangelism team on what happened every day they were i i they were so good and so tight it was
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.280]  like today's today's news in 60 seconds or 90 seconds or some unbelievably short period of time
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:24.400]  and yeah uh i was like i know her she used to be at my show yes this is really good and there was
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:31.200]  like a virtual serenity uh uh memoji memoji yeah yeah it was like that looks like her yep um and
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.920]  they all had that all the engineers all the programmers had their little memoji with the
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:40.320]  computer and the stickers and everything i think that i think that
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.400]  i don't know i honestly don't i could see this going either way like is this covid aside i mean
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.720]  2021 i think that is probably going to be virtual again because yeah i don't see i they might as
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:02.000]  well plan for it and it it's not that it seems like madness to plan on having a real world
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.400]  5000 person convention in june but it just seems so ill it just seems like unlikely to be advisable
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:17.280]  right like like late may rolls around and covid really is so you know if it's really just like
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.320]  what's the most optimistic realistic scenario for late may around the world imagine that in
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.760]  your mind there's not much hot spots are down vaccinations or have have largely helped mitigate
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.400]  this i still don't think you want to put 5000 people from around the world in a in a convention
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.840]  center together right and it's like vaccines aren't a guarantee right it's like you know that's
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.920]  not the way they work and that's if enough people take them which you know we still don't know what
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.080]  the supply and the take i think optimistically we've heard maybe by the summer things will be
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.800]  better so maybe the september events are being thought of either way but i can't imagine they're
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.960]  thinking about that for june yeah so i would i would have to guess that wwdc 2021 is almost
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:09.200]  certainly going to be a a virtual event like last year's and will you know but let's flash forward
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.600]  another year like let you know and i think it's very realistic to think that by june 2022 covid is
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:23.280]  past tense and we are like oh remember that is wwdc permanently a virtual event i i don't know
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.720]  how to predict on that because i could see it both ways i think there's aspects of the in-person
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:36.160]  experience that are irreplaceable from my personal perspective in the media and getting to talk to
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.600]  people uh in person i mean i'll still talk to apple people in person they'll still have press
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:48.720]  events the keynote may well involve be more like a traditional in a virtual post-covid world might
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:55.040]  be exactly like the iphone events where the only people who attend in person are the media right
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.200]  and it's at the steve jobs theater and you know with three or four hundred people instead of five
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:10.320]  thousand people um so that aspect of it i'm sure will still be you know replicated post-covid
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:17.760]  it's the fact that there's so many people in the developer community who i know and it both at a
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:24.320]  personal level but at a professional level where i i hear things and i learn things you know it
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.320]  there's certain aspects of real world interaction and trust that don't happen without being real and
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.320]  i would miss that i still remember when ios 7 was announced me you guy english lorne brichter
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.880]  and a couple you know gpu savvy friends standing at a bar trying to figure out how they were
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.520]  injecting all the transparency and gaussian blur into the system and you just can't do that
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.840]  virtually i do remember that yeah my guess is i were pretty bad but uh yeah i see and lorne and
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.400]  guy tried to figure that out it was pretty good yeah yeah and watching lorne like move his thumb
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.200]  up and down just uh yes yeah i don't know what do you think what's your gut feeling on the long
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.880]  you know what what apple's thinking about this i think well and i say i i say think but i also
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.280]  mean hope because you know someone newly indie the idea of having you know i still have no idea how
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.800]  to save or spend on any of this travel stuff myself because i don't have a giant media company
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:20.800]  paying for everything anymore but i think a hybrid model just given how good the production value
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.200]  was like i went back and looked at some previous events and the stage experience is great but it
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.000]  doesn't look as visually stunning as what they did this year and i'm sure we'll get into how
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.960]  they progressed and got better and better at the events over time but they really started upping
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.680]  the ante on how you could do these sorts of things as stream only events right and i think for the
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.120]  consumer stuff it still makes a lot of sense to present that and for developers because 5000
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.640]  isn't you know out of the millions of apple developers the amount they can reach through
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.680]  a virtual event is just significantly higher that i wouldn't be surprised that they have a hybrid
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.760]  model where people do come gather for things that they really need to like for brand new products
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.640]  that require hands-on or they want to give you like a tour of the audio facility or eventually
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.280]  maybe an ar facility or something i think that'll make sense to do in person but i think as much as
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.440]  possible if they can project this sort of stuff to the world it's it just invites everyone into
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:21.600]  like a really first class experience i feel like with the keynote or let's say keynotes
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.160]  plural because you know the the iphone event is always a keynote and the apple watch event this
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.160]  year which was separate from the iphone etc the keynotes i think are different i mean they're
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.080]  clearly are different but i don't know that i even as somebody who's you know job it is to be tuned
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.680]  into them i wouldn't say that they're better or worse they're just very different they're like
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:54.080]  plays versus movies or tv shows right and i yeah and i think apple i think apple really likes the
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:16:00.720]  production value playfulness of these virtual ones and the control it gives them and i'm sure it's a
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.760]  little bit of a breather for them that they're not live and so nothing can you know they have
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.440]  face id can't go wrong right then they can you know like they go to you know if it's a monday
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.080]  morning keynote they go to bed sunday night and they know it's already you know somebody's just
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.520]  gonna hit the play button and yes and it streams and they've got the streaming stuff down cold
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.360]  right i mean it's there's they they sleep more soundly the night before a keynote than than they
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:39.840]  did when it's live but i do think apple genuinely truly appreciates the intangible benefit of an
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:46.560]  enthusiastic live audience yeah and that there's a not just for the people in the room which again
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.920]  is limited to five thousand out of you know an intended audience of you know i don't know millions
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.880]  really yeah but that it gives an energy to the presentation even to the people who are watching
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.280]  from home you know craig's jokes are just night and day when that audience is there to react to
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:09.920]  them right they had to switch to like a a romance shot you know of him yes opening up the the macbook
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.760]  that to get just the crack marketing team stuff right it just doesn't it's different but i feel
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.160]  like the actual sessions for wwdc which is actually the meat of the conference as a developer
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:30.720]  conference yeah right we're clearly night and day way better this year without an audience without
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:39.440]  being on stage because it's just more they were meant to be watched remotely on a you know you're
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.880]  watching in the developer app on your mac or on your ipad or on your apple tv or whatever but
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:52.000]  that's how they were shot as opposed to when they're delivered live and it's for the people
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.800]  in the audience in the room and the slides it's not that they were bad that way but they're just
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:08.640]  clearly better this way and as the the fact that they're all delivered by the actual engineers who
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.960]  work on these technologies right if it's like you know what's new in core text you know and you're
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.640]  talking about all these great new features for right to left languages and stuff like that that
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:27.280]  the person who is delivering the session is the person who's just spent a year or maybe two years
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.680]  or three years working on it and they know it and they're excited about it and now they're getting
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:38.800]  to deliver it and they always it always amazes me how well they do every year you know because
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:46.000]  it's not their job their job 51 weeks of the year is being the super nerd on whatever it is they're
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.400]  the super nerd about in apple's platforms and then one week of the year they're presenting and i know
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.640]  it takes more than a week i actually that takes away from how long i know they put into the
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:03.200]  sessions you know but for a few weeks a year they're doing this to do one session it's it's
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.280]  more comfortable i think clearly however awkward it is for an engineer to suddenly be in a pristine
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.360]  apple staged room where they held all these sessions with a camera crew um it's probably
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.240]  easier than code review well maybe but i it it takes away the stage fright aspect of it though
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:30.240]  right like where you don't you're not in front of an audience of hundreds of people in a black
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:40.640]  blackened stage lit um theater lit conference room right yeah everybody i mean i do my live
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:46.320]  show once a year i mean i i public speak publicly a little bit more frequently than
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:55.520]  most people and it makes me nervous as hell every single time i mean it's it it just takes away one
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.200]  thing that they're not suited at and it's just a better format so i mean the sessions i i i
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:07.600]  honestly didn't see one comment from anybody that wasn't along the lines of oh my god the sessions
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.400]  are so much better this year just they're just more comfortable it's it's just easier to edit
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:19.280]  and cut between screenshots and video of the screen of the technology being you know shown
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:26.320]  off and the speaker and it was delightful and it felt like it was you got more you got so much
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.000]  more of a sense of the presenters did you get any feedback on this the only thing i didn't hear
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.320]  about and didn't follow up on is the labs because those i know they tried to do the best they could
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.040]  virtually but that was such a hallway filled with people you know talking and interacting
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.800]  with the engineers showing them their apps back and forth and i'm guessing that all just transpired
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.640]  over webex this year yeah i didn't it must feel different than being live i i didn't really hear
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.800]  much about that yay or nay it has me either yeah i i i can't help but think that there's
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:06.480]  that part of what's missing from that lab experience is it can't be replicated over
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:14.320]  webex right yeah it you just always you know and again it's not it sounds shady you know that
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.200]  they're like trying to cover their ass and that's not what i'm alleging you know that that there
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:25.600]  are things that if you can if you can grab the ear of somebody who works on core audio for your audio
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:31.600]  app and show them the bug right there you might get them to say something that they wouldn't put
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:39.040]  in writing in a radar you know and again it's not because what it was is is something that would get
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.760]  them in trouble if they put it in writing it's just it's like i said about you just human
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.320]  interaction and trust you know you just get something and they might say ah you know what i
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.040]  know or what are you you know how are you doing this are you doing this with you know blah blah
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.280]  blah and say yes that's exactly what i'm doing it's like ah there's a lack of formality and
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.760]  intermediation that just occurs in person i think you know and they might say ah i think there might
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.800]  be a bug there i'm sorry you know do you have a radar yes here's my radars okay i'm going to take
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.760]  a note of this i will look at them but in the meantime if you do it this other way i think you
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.440]  might have a workaround and you just hear stories that come out of lab interactions like that that
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:24.960]  i bet are less effective is it a reason to hold five thousand attendee wwdc in san jose i don't
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:30.960]  know yeah no i don't know either but you know it's like someone going up and saying yeah i've made
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:38.960]  your framework cry and here's how yeah all right let me take a break uh breaking after wwdc and
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:45.680]  thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at linode oh man do i like linode linode is where
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:52.720]  daring fireball is hosted it is a fantastic web service i use like a thimble full of the variable
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.760]  ocean of technology that linode has available for much more complicated websites and services than
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.960]  daring fireball but it's so delightful what a great service whether you're working on a
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:10.000]  personal project or managing truly integrate scale infrastructure you deserve simple affordable and

[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:32.400]  with a hundred dollars in free credit just for listeners of the talk show that's no exaggeration
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.200]  a hundred dollars in free credit when they first offered this i double checked it just to make sure
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.320]  i wasn't misreading it because i don't want to get them in trouble if it was like ten dollars and
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.720]  somebody typed an extra zero uh but it's true hundred dollars free credit get all the details
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:54.240]  on how to get it at linode.com slash the talk show linode.com slash the talk show they've got
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:01.520]  11 global data centers 24 7 365 human support that 365 the hell that's coming up by the time
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.320]  you listen to this these are the days of the year where you know 363 calendar support versus 365
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.760]  you know christmas new year's days like this coming up they're there standing by ready for
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.560]  you in case you're working on new year's day but you should probably take off um but they're there
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.040]  if you need them everything you can do you can use your hundred dollars in credit on their s3
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:30.000]  compatible object storage which just came out in 2020 on managed kubernetes and more so once again
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:38.080]  the url is linode.com slash the talk show and once you go there they just click on create free
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:45.280]  account there's a big button that's how you get started my thanks to linode so we buried the lead
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:53.440]  on this entire wdc thing john which was apple silicon i don't know i don't know when do we talk
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.680]  about do we talk about it at wwdc or do we talk about it at the end of the year is the last thing
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.520]  of the year i mean it's well they at least announced it and it put and the best thing about
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.160]  that is we didn't have to put up with rumors about apple silicon anymore right it was
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:15.680]  it was uh it it turned out much like i thought um which was that performance was going to be
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.520]  really stunning like and i was like am i mistreating i actually i don't do this a lot
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.680]  but i went back and watched the wwc keynote again leading up to the actual m1 announcement
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.880]  um to watch johnny suruji's part again because i was like when i watched that it seemed to me like
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:40.160]  he was saying i would love to tell you more but we're building it the and i think i was right like
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.280]  he said was look we started with iphone chips and i guess the ipad you know iphone and ipad
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.200]  and then he said we we took what we knew about those and we shrunk it to make apple watch yeah
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:26:00.160]  and now we're doing the opposite we're going bigger to make this for mac where as opposed to
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:07.280]  we're just going to put a13 a14 chips and max he said a family of socs right and and
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.280]  like the closest he got to saying what they wanted what they were going to do was to say that we we
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.600]  make these chips to suit the devices and then you know the in the same way that the a series chips
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:27.920]  would be too big too hot too battery you know and and overkill for use in a watch they're not good
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:33.360]  enough as is for use in the mac i mean and that's not to say they're bad they're just not meant for
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.520]  it right they don't have they're not meant for high capacity storage you know and yeah no for
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.680]  sure i think the key thing though well first it was great to see suruji i think it's the first
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:48.800]  time we've seen him right in an apple presentation but the thing that i thought was so interesting
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.840]  was that it showed that apple had been building this scalable architecture because a lot of
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.320]  companies make like one-off chips like you know qualcomm makes a chip for the phones and then
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.360]  they've been rehashing old phone chips for watches and that never took off and apple's been very good
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.400]  about not becoming like an intel like a merchant silicon provider who has to see all these different
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.120]  companies and make unique unique chips for all these different needs because that's really
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.920]  inefficient and i didn't want apple to become an internal silicon merchant that had a bunch of
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.520]  different clients competing clients within apple and instead they were like oh yeah you know what
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:29.120]  we get like an a13 that goes into the iphone 11 and then those that core architecture goes into
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.040]  the s6 or the apple watch and then the a14 goes into the iphone and the equivalent of an a14x
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.320]  with a bunch of extra mac ip goes into the mac and that whole idea of building an architecture
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.960]  over several years that could scale that dramatically i think is a really really smart
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.480]  investment on apple's part incredibly so i mean it's just and we now we see it i mean it's we
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.600]  still can't even here we are a month later and we still can't stop raving about it but they promised
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.280]  a two-year transition which i also thought was interesting it was so similar to what steve jobs
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.320]  promised with the power pc to intel right and how much of that is under promising and over delivering
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.840]  and giving themselves leeway and how much is it really going to be two years like do they really
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.280]  know i don't know well they did give us an imac since then that was on intel right well we you're
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.560]  you're skipping ahead to august oh sorry the least the least interesting update of the year yeah
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.760]  what else is there to say about the the m1 uh or at least from wwdc's perspective i guess the thing
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.400]  that i would say is and i don't think they did this to purposefully sandbag it i just think
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.840]  i i think that the one thing that that colored the actual hands-on
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:50.640]  oh my god you've got to see one of these m1 macs astounded jaw-dropping reviews was that the
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:57.120]  developer kits didn't really offer that hint right the the developer kits running on the
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:04.880]  what were they a12z a12z yeah like the the ipad pros were fine computers the developer kits are
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.080]  mac mini look they don't call them mac minis i don't believe but they're mac mini look-alike
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:17.680]  developer kits with an a12z inside and extra ram and extra and and they're fine and i don't have
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.000]  one did you get one you didn't get one did you no i didn't get one either because it's just i asked
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:29.440]  i think i talked to panzerino about this but like you know most people in the press wouldn't even
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.560]  think about it it's not a product you know but i am a developer too sort of i don't really have
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.960]  an app that i would use this for it would be more and i you know when i asked people at apples should
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:47.280]  i order one i their answer was very accurate like nah don't don't bother because it's not it's not
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.360]  indicative of what you're going yes it's not going to give you a heads up on anything you're not
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.640]  going to have a leg up on what what this is going to be like it was like okay because that just it's
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.200]  less for me to to deal with you know and the last thing honestly the way it turned out the last
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.840]  thing i would have needed in the second half of 2020 is yes more apple hardware to yeah set up
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:14.800]  install and run and test and observe but the fact is that those dev kits don't really they're not
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.960]  astounding i mean they're sort of like peers to the intel imacs that are mac minis that we know
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.040]  and if anything there's some bugs and some shortcomings and some things that aren't that
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.920]  great they're probably worse overall like one thing that was interesting is that they ran the
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.640]  ran the microsoft stuff under emulation better than microsoft was running it on on their own
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:41.440]  hard their own qualcomm hardware uh you mean like the with the surface hardware the devkit yeah the
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.000]  yeah the windows x i think i forget what they're calling it windows 10 for arm on windows x
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  hardware was running better on emulation it's on the devkit that's that's very it's just
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.120]  even the which which devkits i'm saying aren't even that good compared to the m1 which is
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:05.680]  really shows you how big a leg up but it it really did and it is different from the intel transition
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.240]  where the intel transition they gave out these devkits that were running in these hollowed out
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:20.160]  shells of mac pros with like a just a generic intel pc inside and they flew they were like
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:26.960]  oh wow mac os 10 already like the os itself which had been compiling for x86 all along
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:35.280]  in a secret lab flew right from the start and just just going to these generic intel developer level
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.480]  hardware machines it was like all the developers i know were like we have work to do there's lots
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.800]  of assumptions and the apps need to be improved blah blah blah but basically it they were very
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:50.000]  very fast this internal transition is going going to be high performance and it's going to be
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.280]  high performance whereas that wasn't indicative from the developer kits this year and then when
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:02.720]  the m1s did ship and the performance was holy shit yes everybody was like where did this come
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.400]  from you know and color that with and again i'm skipping ahead to the m1 part of this the show
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:16.640]  but you know color that with the everybody wanted to sort of say okay we know x86 performance on
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.720]  x86 because that's what everybody's been using even on the mac now for 15 years and we know
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:30.000]  what arm performance for pc class notebooks is because windows has been shipping on arm for a
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.080]  while and it's kind of cruddy how good could this be and it's like no no you're thinking about it
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:41.680]  wrong but anyway we can hold that for later the other thing to talk about if we're going to look
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.320]  is what you alluded to it started a little bit with the hay fiasco the week before wwdc
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:55.840]  then sort of rolls over to what was the news in july it was the antitrust hearing in front of the
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:04.960]  house in congress where tim cook was there and to me it's not that the hearing itself was all
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:13.840]  that worth revisiting it's the that's a moment where you could say look the us we know the eu
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:23.840]  was looking at apple along with the other big five tech companies um it's it it it's not a trump
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.200]  thing it's not a biden thing this is there is sort of bipartisan it's the one of the weird issues
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:36.320]  in the entire country where there's sort of bipartisan consensus that it needs to be looked
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.720]  at you know there's obviously you know there was a weird partisan slant on which aspects of which
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:48.800]  companies are deserving of scrutiny but there's general consensus on both parties that hey you
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.360]  know we need to look at this and with apple it's the app store is the thing that was instructive
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.680]  to me is that we had them gavel it in fairly normally the democrats went after the way that
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:05.040]  the companies treated their partners and their competitors the republicans largely went after
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.160]  this idea of conservative bias which a lot seemed like a lot of stagecraft because at the end they
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.880]  just gaveled it off saying you know antitrust breakup so it sounded like they had an agenda
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.760]  that was completely different than the talking points but the ceos themselves mark zuckerberg
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.480]  mark zuckerberg was just all up in everybody's face the whole time jeff bezos did the mute button
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.840]  thing and acted like he never understood how amazon was run tim cook wore clothing like amy
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.000]  from brooklyn nine nine where it was just zero contrast and they actually forgot he was there
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.240]  for about 45 minutes and sundar pachai just got nailed left and right by everybody yeah that
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:49.760]  would be my summary of it too and it was i i would you know and it's tim cook is yeah i i wrote
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.880]  recently uh i forget what he was even a reference to entering fireball but oh no it was his uh his
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:01.840]  terrific podcast interview with uh yes outdoor outdoors yeah i forget if it's singular or plural
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:09.200]  but but when he seemed more himself and a little bit less guarded he's very talk like he talks in
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:17.920]  real life which was really nice to hear he's he's very very cautious in his public uh speaking and
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:23.680]  you know it has served him very well he's he's been involved i mean how many things can you
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.560]  you know how many times have you have we ever thought oh tim cook's really put his foot in
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:34.160]  his mouth this time you know never really well even like angry tim cook when he got upset and
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.640]  said i don't give a damn about the roi when it comes to accessibility and the environment was
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.640]  like fiery tim cook and i was all there for that bloody he called it bloody yeah the bloody roi
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.600]  which you know that's like the most revved up i've seen him yeah i wasn't aware that uh that
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:57.120]  that was you know that that uh just mild curse words from england are popular in alabama but uh
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.000]  yes it makes me realize he almost said my feeling was that he almost said a different word
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.240]  yeah grasped onto bloody and quickly you know ran through the algorithm and it was like even in your
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.320]  hot-blooded anger it's like uh that that's fine and used it yeah yeah you don't see that very
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:20.000]  often but his you know and it's funny you know in the the alternate world where steve jobs hadn't
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.320]  gotten sick and was he would he still be yeah i mean there's you know we can do a whole show on
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.680]  what yeah would be going on but in a world where tim cook is the one or steve jobs is the one
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.080]  steve jobs is the one testifying at that hearing um i don't think he wants to be there no
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:42.480]  that's a little patient i think in theory in that world or or you know whether you want to say what
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.640]  if steve jobs was still alive now or if you want to say what if this hearing had happened 10 years
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.680]  ago whichever way you want to spin it i think that apple would have wanted tim cook to be the
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:58.320]  one testifying either way but they i you know for the publicity angle i don't think that would have
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:05.760]  flown you know like it i think bezos in particular didn't really want to do it um but that they really
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.440]  wanted the ceos you know uh well i think though if tim cook had become ceo and steve jobs had
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.800]  become the executive chairman and just stayed in that position for a long time it would have been
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.040]  similar to google where sundar patry showed up and not larry and sir right i think so too and
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.600]  you could say well what do you want he's the ceo he is the you know yeah you know he's he's taken
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.880]  over he you know he is in charge of the company now so i think that that's possible i just don't
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:37.760]  see steve jobs as being so on message like you know he couldn't bite his tongue and and you saw
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:44.160]  with bezos a bit like bezos was the one of the four who and he never said anything that was
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:52.160]  scandalous but there was the the one like uh the one moment where he was like do i need to explain
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.440]  to you how business works negotiation it was like somebody you know the question was something along
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.400]  the lines of well it might have even been with apple maybe you know with the whole issue where
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.960]  apple with amazon prime and um getting it on apple tv but it was something with like
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:15.760]  you know you guys were holding back on amazon prime streaming video and this other company
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.120]  whether it was apple or it doesn't even matter but that they had this other thing and then when
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.320]  they gave you the thing you gave them the access to the prime and and basis was just like yeah
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.880]  that's that's negotiation like do i need to explain this to you that this is this is how
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.720]  you do business like you have something you and ben covered that really well on dithering when
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:36.480]  it was happening you have something that i want and i have something that you want and then we
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.080]  just sort of you know nudge each other until we're both equally dissatisfied with the deal and then
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:48.640]  we walk away and it you know and he he wasn't you know again there was no scandal about it it wasn't
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.800]  like bezos humiliates you know congressperson and in front of the hearing but you could see his mind
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.240]  he was thinking about it yeah he was like i can't believe i'm answering this question it's like i
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.520]  have more disposable income than your country is worth right now i could buy you but i don't have
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:11.200]  the time uh but it's you know it my point bringing it up for the year in review is that we're not
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:19.040]  done with this yet right like i don't know where this goes i do think that we've seen facebook and
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.160]  facebook has already been charged and google i think three or four times now at least in the
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.720]  last couple weeks who knows what's happened while we've been recording renee uh there might be up to
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.320]  five yeah the antitrust yeah uh and they even got charged with the 30 and not apple it's like it's
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  a whole weird world yeah it's uh you know but it apples uh got less to lose i think that they've
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:49.280]  got less that's controversial um i don't think i think it's a lot harder to accuse them of having
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.920]  a monopoly to abuse like you really have to kind of bend over backward and again there's like the
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:03.360]  lowercase m monopoly of you just have a very strong business with a dominant position in the
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:09.360]  industry and the marketplace in which case you say yes apple has a dominant position in the mobile
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.280]  smartphone marketplace especially in the u.s not so much in europe especially in the u.s
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:19.840]  and even globally they they certainly have a monopoly of profit on selling cell phones yes
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:25.440]  you know a greater than 50 share of profit but that turns out not to be like a legally defined
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:34.000]  thing like having a you know you if you don't sell over 50 of the actual units that's not a monopoly
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:40.400]  uh and it's all and i mean the fashion industry should be disassembled if profit is right it's it
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.560]  but again or the makeup industry a lot of this isn't about the letter of the law but the politics
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:53.920]  of it you know and the politics is you know it it it's hard to hard to predict and the
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.840]  polything that concerns me is that the eu has shown like their their willingness to
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.120]  for example investigate ie's dominance until chrome becomes the dominant web browser and
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.200]  there's no rendering engines left right so like the results of their actions i think are are
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:14.880]  unclear even to them well and with the eu and in some ways i i my my stance is that the eu's
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  heart is in the right place and that they are very consumer focused but it doesn't come it doesn't
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.600]  necessarily come out of the legislation i mean all of these uh cookie banners that you have
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:35.440]  to click through on websites all the all the time to comply with what's the law the uh yeah and the
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:43.680]  ddpr yeah uh that hasn't really improved the it the way it manifests itself is it's made things
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.640]  worse it's giving you all these stupid things to click through like that's not or it's removed
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.280]  american websites from europe i just can't afford or or won't one of the resources to comply with
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:00.240]  the right to comply you know so you know there's a definite fear that they'll with good interests
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:07.520]  at heart will mandate things that do not make the experience better for actual users um we shall see
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.240]  but it you know and then facebook's response has been just to throw everybody else they possibly
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:21.040]  can into the fire in front of them it's it is you know like google it it you know ben and i
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.920]  have talked about this a lot like google is more exposed in more ways and has probably done more
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:34.960]  of a classic abuse of uh you know uh using their dominance and web search to benefit uh you know
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.920]  their clear monopoly and web search to benefit their other businesses is classic illegal bundling
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.640]  but the real villain here is facebook like everybody sort of agrees yeah i have this
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.080]  analogy that's terrible but i keep trying to make it work and that is that apple is a fine
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.480]  dining restaurant where you come in you pay a premium you tend to get really good meals that
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:58.080]  you pay your check and you leave google you come in you get a free lobster dinner but then they
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.800]  expect you to put out they just think that the lobster is so good you'll be willing at the end
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:08.880]  amazon is like the ultimate uh uber eats experience where you just pay them and they deliver anything
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.840]  you want to you and facebook will let you come in and graze as much as you want for free but you
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:19.680]  have to be naked and be willing to let them probe you and that's the different experiences they're
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:27.040]  all providing it's it's going to be interesting to see how it turns out i i i you can see apple
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:31.360]  and you know again this might be the way the system works you know that that the political
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.280]  pressure comes down and apple makes changes you know like would we have this small developer
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:47.360]  program at the end of 2020 if it wasn't for the serious federal eyeballing of apple's control over
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.720]  the app store and the app store economy yeah uh and then you dispute mechanism and several of the
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.920]  other changes they've been making right i'm gonna say no or at least we wouldn't have all of them
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.480]  and even if they were in the works i mean it's hard to say you know it's hard hard to deny that
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:09.680]  it certainly looks like there's a cause and effect of there's antitrust regulatory pressure on this
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:16.480]  and apple has made very clear moves in very real ways like the small developer program i know that
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.200]  a lot of people looked at and like well that you know that all these there's a handful of companies
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.840]  you know these big game companies and they make way more than a million dollars and there's no
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.480]  nothing to do with it but there are so many developers like it's not just pr spin there's
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.720]  an awful lot of developers who are like no this is this is a huge deal we you know the the
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:43.200]  difference for us is that we could hire an entire new engineer with the money that will be saving
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.240]  between 15 to 30 percent and it's also like it's the app store the original model as conceived by
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.520]  steve jobs and the team is 10 years old and it deserves to be reconsidered but also i think you
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:59.760]  know apple made this promise to investors that they double services income by 2020 and the app
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.240]  store is a big part of services revenue and they made that goal and i think it was very telling
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.720]  they didn't promise to do it again because that that cut off a lot of flexibility they had around
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:13.120]  the app store i think until until that happened and now they have a lot more well at least they
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.720]  don't have the expectation around it these well and that brings me to my last my last issue on
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:25.440]  this whole summer of and you know second half of 2020 regular antitrust regulatory pressure is
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.040]  the apple angle on it the other thing in addition to the app store is the the deal with google to
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:37.920]  make google search the default for safari which i know isn't quite a pay for play thing it's not
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:46.320]  like okay you pay us x billion and google search remains the cert the default search in google it's
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:54.080]  it somehow is uh it's in like an affiliate fee or referral right it it's accounted for by how
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:01.120]  many searches actually go through google from the safari field it was a startling amount of i did
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.720]  not expect it to be anywhere nearly as high as the amount of traffic they delivered to google
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.440]  right and it's you know they still haven't released the money right it's it's like the
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.000]  deal is still secret there and there's something that came out from like we know we we know the
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.440]  number from a legal like like the bizarrely it came out of the google oracle lawsuit over
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.760]  java and it was i don't know how many billion dollars but it was like back in 2014 goldman
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:35.440]  sachs has estimated it at like 18 million i think for 2020 or maybe that's the estimate for
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:42.320]  upcoming for 2021 but it's reasonable to assume that goldman's estimate is at least in the
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:50.720]  ballpark and it's somewhere on the order of at least 10 billion probably closer to 20 million
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.160]  you know call it 15 billion say say goldman's off by a few billion you know what's a billion
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:02.960]  here and a billionaire but 15 billion dollars a year is a significant portion of apples then they
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:10.080]  this is where i'm going with this is apple puts that under services and it's like the dark matter
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:16.080]  the the iceberg the part of the iceberg under the water for apple services revenue is this
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.720]  thing that people don't think of as an apple service people think of apple services is these
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:29.520]  things with brand names you know apple tv plus and the new apple one bundle and apple news and
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.760]  the apple arcade and it you know all these new things that they've been coming out with which
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.240]  are apples and fitness plus and blah blah blah and it's like oh yeah and the biggest money maker is
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:44.320]  the fact that google is the default search engine in safari yeah it's pure profit right so it's
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:51.760]  well pure profit except that they do it is it is this weird feather in the safari team's cap right
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.760]  like you don't think of safari and webkit as being this big money maker for apple right you think of
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  it like like does the finder team make money for apple no there it was famously firefox's almost
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:09.600]  entire income was the same sort of google search placement forever but but i think you can directly
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:16.880]  make the argument that safari is one of the most profitable software endeavors on the planet because
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.320]  it keeps people you know it it and it's not like it they're not doing anything nefarious they're
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:28.720]  not trying to make you search google more than you would otherwise and if anything they've added more
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:36.800]  features that when you type in the in the the url field that some things get answered without going
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.880]  through google you know like if you start they're abstracted away by the apple knowledge right and
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.280]  you know things like sports scores or the weather or something like that don't even go to google so
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.920]  if apple really wanted to throw as much traffic through this deal as they wanted to it actually
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.920]  would work differently but it's very very profitable but it is very much in the bull's eye
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.880]  of the regulators looking at this as something that that that that is actually illegal and if
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.880]  it just came i'm skipping ahead but it just came out this week that google also had a blue jedi
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.800]  deal codenamed blue jedi deal with facebook turns out it wasn't r2 or three people it was blue jedi
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:20.080]  and where they had a deal with advertising and facebook as well wow huh i thought i thought it
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:27.520]  was uh four-letter word jedi huh jedi well i lost that bet good thing i didn't put money on that
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.840]  um but anyway long story short i think that apple is looking at i and i'm sure they have to be
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.680]  realistically looking at we might need to cancel this deal you know yeah like we we might have to
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.000]  you know with this this money might be going away and it's a huge chunk of their services
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.600]  um and i think that's a big reason why they're not making any promises about future services revenue
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.640]  and and they've built up their own services the ones you think of as apple services to
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:01.040]  all be good businesses and it is doing you know their services division would be fine
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:07.360]  if the google money went away but it would take a huge hit yeah and people people you know
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:12.000]  investors who are looking at it would need to understand well this you know this has been taken
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.440]  away by regulators and my understanding is despite you know we're making complaints about magic
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.200]  keyboard costs but my understanding is that apple's hardware margins are significantly down
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.760]  from what they were years ago and services is making that look normal because of how high
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:30.640]  services margins are well and again we're i'm not a financial analyst but it's like you
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.920]  you know as long as you assume that apple isn't committing perjury or whatever whatever the the
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:42.880]  crime is to of submitting false information on their quarterly reports i guess it's perjury is
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:48.320]  wrong but sec sec securities fraud right i guess that would be that would be classified as a
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:58.320]  securities fraud their margins are uh it it's it they're more more regular than a of a five
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:07.200]  thousand dollar watch you know like yes 38.7 percent margin 39 percent you know high 38
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:14.480]  decimals to 39 every single quarter quarter after quarter but that used to be mostly hardware profit
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:18.800]  and now there is a significant amount of services revenue and it hasn't gone up which indicates that
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.920]  hardware margins are not right up at right so if the margins on services are higher than hardware
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:30.080]  which they have to be like 60 percent right yeah and the company's margins are exactly the same
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.480]  that means the margins on hardware have gone down uh and i know people they find that hard
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.920]  to believe they're like but wait aren't they selling thirteen hundred dollar cell phones now
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:41.600]  and it's like yeah but their thirteen hundred dollar cell phones are actually packing a
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.920]  an enormous amount of time again they're not selling them at a loss they're not breaking even
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:51.600]  on a iphone 12 pro max but they really are putting more expensive parts they really are
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:57.600]  very expensive yeah you know devices um and again poor poor apple you know maybe their margins
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:02.000]  you know you know here we are you know oh my god their margins on iphones might be down to like the
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:11.600]  low 30s oh you know it it's it's all good they're not going into the red but it's definitely
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:18.160]  something to look at if you know and and you're always asking for a bit of luck if you're hoping
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:25.040]  that investors pay attention to the details you know it's like for example should tesla's stock
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:32.640]  have taken a hit on apple car rumors this week no it should not have no no it did so it's very
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:38.240]  possible that something you know there could be some kind of like hey this uh agreement between
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:44.000]  apple and google for default search is over there's no more money changing hands and apple services
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.840]  takes like a 15 to 20 billion dollar annual hit anybody who's not paying attention might see the
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:56.640]  news as apple services is in the tank and you know yeah there goes there goes the stock yeah
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.760]  uh what else we got we got the whole second half of the year i don't know how we're gonna time make
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:06.880]  fun of epic and fortnite quickly yeah i think we got to before the summer's over yeah so the
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.640]  this was interesting to me because in the beginning i was i liked what epic was doing like
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.600]  it seemed really well calculated they made this uh epic drop where they said that they were going
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:20.400]  to stop paying google and apple the 30 that they were demanding that they were going to put in
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:26.160]  their own payment processing system uh you know in violation of the terms of services and then
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:31.360]  apple and google removed them from the stores and epic sued apple and i thought you know they've
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:36.320]  really got this plan they've got everything going then they sued google too even though google
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:41.680]  allows you to sideload and i was i started thinking what are they doing and then not to fast
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:47.360]  forward too far ahead but they got to the point where a judge said okay let's put everything into
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:53.120]  uh you will put all the profits into uh you know a special fund and at the end of the case
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.800]  we'll figure out who they go to and that would mean that everyone could keep playing fortnite
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:01.600]  on ios everyone would still be happy and epic said no and at that point i'm like this really
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.240]  wasn't that well planned was it yeah i'm not sure you know and and it you know there was a lot of
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:15.600]  uh fireworks at the beginning with the surprise move of epic that they had a effective you know
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:20.720]  and i i don't mean this in the malware sense but it just in the allegorical sense a trojan horse
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:25.280]  built into an app a version of the app they'd already gotten approved and they could flip a
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:33.680]  switch remotely and have the app take take payments i don't know what they really want
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:39.840]  you know like i'm sure they would just take it if if the legal system said yes
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:46.320]  epic you get everything you're demanding right now apple has to has you know 12 months to enable
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:56.640]  third-party app stores in on on ios and the epic app store game store is legally mandated to be
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.920]  one of the ones that's approved you know i'm sure epic would say you know what i'm going to do is
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:06.400]  prove that oh my god i can't believe that worked right that's great yeah but they know that's not
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.880]  going to happen it's not going to happen like that like what do they really want i don't know
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:20.880]  and and you're right i think that the the judge's offer of let's just go back run you know comply
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:29.440]  with the rules and all of the money from epics apps which is primarily fortnite would go into
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.760]  escrow and will you know when the lawsuits are finally settled you know then we'll figure out
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:41.360]  what to do with it the fact that they were like no we'll we'll just stay out um you know and i
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.600]  guess some people think that they're that that's just them sticking to the principle that that you
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:50.560]  know that they lose the moral high ground the principal high ground of we're the ones standing
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:59.440]  up to apple on this um but i don't know it doesn't play like it doesn't it didn't seem like that to
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:03.760]  me when it was fresh and now that we're at the end of the year and it's sort of settled in as old
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:11.040]  news it just feels spiteful right like does it seem to you i mean again no yeah it's it i think
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.640]  it goes back to what we're talking about with with founders are different than ceos and tim
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.840]  swinney seems to be acting like a hyper aggressive founder and tim swinney seems to be acting like
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:26.400]  founder and not a ceo who would probably have the best interests of his epic unreal engine customers
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.040]  you know and of and their shared ios customers at a much higher priority than him trying to i got
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:38.080]  the whole vibe from them it's like they didn't want to take the like the app store foot off any
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.960]  developer's neck they wanted to make enough room to put their foot down as well and that's a whole
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:49.840]  different sort of vibe than than i think most people were expecting see i don't get that like i i don't
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:55.680]  feel like they want to be the new you know we've got your foot on your throat i i just feel like
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:04.480]  if there's the most innocuous explanation i can think of is that like tim swinney and epic
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:12.480]  really literally don't see anything problematic with the state of like windows pcs and the way
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:17.920]  software is installed and works on it like they're very on windows they were very interesting because
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:25.600]  they went after um steam hard like they like they signed exclusive deals and they would give
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.400]  discounts if you had the if you used the fortnite engine on their game store and yes they charge
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:35.040]  less of a percentage but they still charge a percentage and they had a bunch of scandals where
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:40.480]  they were taking uh stuff that was created by people on the fortnite platform and just not
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.960]  sharing any revenue from it at all like different dances and emotes and the things that have ben
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:51.120]  explains it so well like zero marginal cost to them pure profit and just keeping all of it so it
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.360]  seemed like they were i said this before i know there are huge problems on the app store and a lot
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.920]  of things that need to be fixed but this was just not not the batman that anybody wanted to be
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.520]  wanted or needed in this case no and you know and again it could easily devolve into an hour-long
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:15.120]  discussion but my take of describing ios as an app console which was probably it's somehow
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.960]  inadvertently my biggest controversy of the year it's exactly what steve jobs announced it from the
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.680]  beginning it was announced as a console that the problem with it it clearly in hindsight i know
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:33.120]  i've talked about it before but clearly some people it's just a traditional linguistic problem
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:39.280]  where some people literally really believe that the word console implies games that if it's not
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.120]  for playing games it's not a console period whereas i'm that's why i'm calling it an app
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:49.840]  console it's like a game console but instead of games it's any kind of app but it's exactly that
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.280]  doesn't mean it's right right it doesn't mean it should be a console today it just means that it
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:59.680]  was designed and it's run like a car right and it's like there's i tried to explain it as best
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:04.080]  i could and if some people are like lol you think it's like playstation you think iphone's like
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:08.720]  playstation people put their lives in their iphone and it's like no no i get i see what you're saying
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:14.080]  that like your iphone is like where you live your entire online life your business and your
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:19.520]  socialization and all of this is there and it's way more important to you than like your place
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.360]  some of the reason for that is because of the safety that's that's created by having it run
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:26.800]  as a console and not as an open computing environment i mean that cuts both ways right
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:31.920]  but it's like that's the basic idea you know and and having epic be the one fight it out and have
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:38.560]  them say oh yeah we're totally cool though with xbox and nintendo and and playstation uh really
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:44.480]  undercuts the argument you know and the judge you know has has been very clear about this like
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:49.040]  yeah she's brilliant yeah she really she saw through all of bs by everybody yeah and i remember
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:56.160]  the one part where they were she was like grilling them on uh that this why are you holding i android
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.400]  and ios to this entirely different standard from the game consoles and they're like well you can't
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:04.720]  play your xbox on a bus and she immediately was like you could play your nintendo switch
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.880]  and it's like yeah i'll just sit down now yes yeah she's like are you gonna do better on the
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:14.640]  second part of this hearing it's like i don't even know like you said the quiet part out loud
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:20.240]  yeah i i don't know i wonder i don't know what 2021 has in store for the epic apple lawsuit but i
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:25.760]  just i don't know i i don't think it's i don't think anything's going to come of it to be honest
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.240]  if this was a cadre of like the problem is that a lot of the people like spotify that are teaming
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:35.680]  up in and now facebook has has filed and you know in support of epic these are a cadre of
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:40.880]  billionaires who who are super angry at the trillionaire and i would much rather prefer this
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:47.760]  be a group of independent app developers who know what they want and need litigating this than people
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.760]  who are worried about which of their ferraris they're driving out on the on the highway paid
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.560]  for by trillion dollar companies again right and you know just to tie it back to something from
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:04.480]  the early part of the show it's like think about like with chrome on mac os like on mac os it is
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:12.320]  the idiom it is the culture it's the it's the expectation that when you install a web browser
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:16.640]  in your applications folder if you want to uninstall it you just drag it to the trash
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.960]  and then it's all gone and there's no software running but it turns out that's just
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:26.080]  the culture and there's no technical requirement and so chrome takes advantage of this and has
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.800]  like this background software updating agent that stays installed if you just trash google chrome
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:38.720]  dot app on ios that can't happen literally can't happen you know i'm not saying that somebody can't
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.000]  happen in a way that somebody couldn't find a security exploit but any app that could install
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.920]  something that remains even after you delete the app is doing so by literally exploiting a
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.960]  security vulnerability and if apple found out about it they would close the vulnerability and
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:02.800]  you know cancel the developer's developer account like you it's not like you're you you as a
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:08.880]  developer are asked to be nice and when your app is deleted there's nothing left of it you have no
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:15.840]  choice and that is a huge benefit and to me the whole epic thing comes down you know not not epic
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:23.280]  particularly but epics argument over this isn't right that apple controls the app store this way
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:29.360]  is completely missing that that's that's a tremendous benefit it's got trade-offs right
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.640]  because sometimes you want your rogue amoebas to be able to do stuff and rogue amoeba can't do
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:41.120]  rogue amoeba stuff on ios because apps on ios can't do that it's again to circle back to you
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:46.800]  know an example from earlier on this show rogue amoeba is a perfect example of you know what we
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:53.840]  lose with the control you gain some you lose some and it it ultimately is sort of apple's argument
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:00.640]  for why some of our computing devices like iphones and ipads work this way and why the mac works
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.520]  this other way here's our platform where you are installed allowed to shoot your foot there's this
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.120]  huge problem i think a lot of especially like twitter and internet culture in general doesn't
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.360]  like multiple truths but quite often we have these situations where there are multiple truths
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.200]  like people deserve choice and does that mean that you should have the choice of running whatever you
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.960]  want on your iphone or does that mean that consumers should have the choice of a managed
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:26.720]  environment with the iphone versus an unmanaged one with android and are you taking away consumer
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.680]  choice if you turn the iphone into a non-managed environment it's like this whole thing where
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.880]  there's 90 of 90 of the things that apple does really benefit mainstream consumers but really
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:41.520]  irk the nerds the nerds have all the traditional computers but they still want the stuff that apple
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:46.000]  makes because it's really nice but then they want to change it and make it more nerd-like which is
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.680]  a disservice often to the 90 of the mainstream customers and even in this case like i really
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.160]  i'm sympathetic to the idea that apple should allow side loading because that way theoretically
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:01.760]  if vpns are banned in china or tik tok is banned in the us that doesn't stop people from loading
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:07.360]  them up but practically the servers behind the vpns and behind tik tok would be cut off and so
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:11.680]  the app wouldn't really help you and it would just be an extra vector for getting on the machine
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:15.440]  and i don't know what the right answer is i just know that if you're talking about it in black and
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:19.600]  white terms you probably haven't thought about it deeply right well or just look at what's come out
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.680]  with facebook you know and if facebook could encourage users to side load facebook.app then
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:30.640]  facebook.app side loaded could get away with whatever it can get away with and wouldn't have to
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.680]  or their vpn that they were putting out their monitor right which which they've literally it's
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:41.360]  it's not just like speculation have been shown and like australia is taking them you know to
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:47.600]  court over that they used to spy on their users and because they were spying using it to spy on
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.120]  all of what they did on their phones used it as competitive information to say yeah hey this
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:58.240]  whatsapp thing is both a really popular and growing really fast we should buy it for 20
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:05.600]  billion dollars we've got the data from the users of our vpn spyware you know and if that's there's
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.600]  and when apple blocked it they used enter they abused the enterprise certificate to let people
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:13.200]  load it right so we know what they would do if they could do side loading because they've showed
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.400]  us and you know yes it told us who they are right and it's you know and you could say well hey the
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.960]  mac's okay and i agree it wouldn't be the end of the world but it's like you have to you have to
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.800]  admit even if you think that the trade-offs would be worth it that there are trade-offs you know
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:32.800]  yeah yeah like you can argue that the app store is phenomenally successful and therefore should
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.840]  change we could also argue that maybe those changes would have prevented the app store from
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.160]  being more successful than the google play store is in terms of developer revenue for example
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:44.240]  nothing is in a vacuum all right we got to pick up the pace here i i'm going to take a break and

[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:56.240]  long story let's just cut out the iMac from August forget it gone i mean nothing happened
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:01.600]  in the fall anyway right yeah nothing else now but i think we i i don't think we're doing short
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:07.760]  short i mean you know this stuff is fresher in memory we've talked about the the hardware
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:14.720]  but the announcements you know so let's go through first one was the ipad air and the apple watch
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.800]  series 6 and apple watch can i just give you credit for a second here because you had a really
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:22.800]  good explanation for how apple was staging these events because a lot of people were saying oh
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:27.120]  there's no way they won't do the iphone there's no way they won't do the iphone with the with the
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.360]  apple watch there's no way they'll do more than one event there's no way they'll do three events
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:37.360]  and you explained it early on as sort of apple arranging their fall tv schedule yeah i i think
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:41.760]  it really stands up and i think the one everybody was like well they got to be done now what are
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.920]  they going to do with this mac they said there was a magic they'll just do another episode of the show
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.040]  yeah yeah yeah it's sort of like you know and like my you know if you if you're familiar with
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:56.720]  like 60 minutes right like the news show you know they might have three segments of roughly 20
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:02.960]  minutes you know for the hour-long show but the segments are clearly produced in a way where like
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:10.720]  oh the segment we're doing on the profile of uh jeff bezos is taking longer than we thought we'll
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.840]  use this other you know they're not meant to go together and and i think these events were like
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:22.080]  that they're like okay we'll do you know we'll we'll do 40 minutes about the ipad and the eighth
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.320]  generation didn't even ship until after they announced the iphone right which was weird you
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.240]  know but the phones aren't ready but if it would have been ready they would have been they could
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:38.640]  have put it in as part of the show um and you know and it's funny it it's a good show and it has that
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:45.120]  flavor like it's like oh another episode of the apple event show and you know you're cruising
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:54.400]  around the apple park and the spaceship and you know it it feels like a tv show and it just got
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:59.600]  better episode like they did that really cool shot of zooming in from uh jeff's watch jeff
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:03.840]  williams watch coming out and then they did all those different transitions and the the drone
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.400]  shots it it felt like the same show but they kept better getting better and better at making it
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.560]  yeah the other thing i would say and who knows maybe if they keep this up and they this is how
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.920]  they do shows going forward we'll look back at the ones from 2020 and see them as crude
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:24.080]  you know i always think like whenever you buy like the omnibus edition of a comic strip like
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:30.640]  calvin and hobs or the early um the peanut bloom counties yeah or the peanut strips you know yeah
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.320]  and you look at the first especially peanuts in particular because the peanuts ones evolved over
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:41.360]  like a decade but there were like ones from like the 50s like for 10 years where all of the
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:46.240]  characters look weird you're like man even garfield he's horrific in the first yeah garfy
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:52.160]  early you know it it in my opinion probably the the best of the best is bill waterson and
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.120]  calvin and hobs he's just yeah the best written it's just the pinnacle of the art form i mean most
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.720]  people seem to agree and he's also probably the best illustrator he's just amazing yes like and
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:07.200]  when he would really show off and do like one of the space like the spaceman space or the dinosaur
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:13.840]  ones or spaceman spiff versus the dinosaurs it's like oh my god he's like super amazing talented
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.280]  the first year of calvin and hobs they look a little weird you know they have to it takes a
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.760]  while to get your legs underneath you and figure out who these characters are and what the style
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:29.840]  is and you know it's like that with most tv shows too like the first season of a show often just
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.400]  looks weird in hindsight because they haven't quite figured it out i don't know if i look at
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:41.600]  a video from older than a month i can't believe how terrible it looked well you know but i you
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.640]  know i i don't know i feel like apple somehow you know maybe it's hiring talent you know if
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.560]  you throw enough money at it and you're discerning and you hire the right people they got it but
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:59.040]  um it the the that september event again i don't think we need to spend much time on it series
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:06.080]  series 6 apple watch not really that different adds the blood oxygen sensor if anything i almost
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:15.680]  feel like it was badly timed because blood oxygen levels are a covid thing and clearly that that's
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.840]  not why the 2020 apple watch has it but that's how people think yes right in same with the
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:26.480]  hand washing yeah well hand washing they did probably squeeze in for that like i don't think
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.520]  there would be a hand washing feature if it wasn't for covid do you no no for sure no i mean they
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.280]  one interview they said that it wasn't because that the other interview they said it was so i
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:40.720]  think you know it probably had to have been no it just but it doesn't require a special sensor right
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.880]  it's not like they have a hand wash sensor they're just using the accelerometer and the microphone
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:48.960]  and a bunch of other things to create every time i make pasta and i'm sizzling onions and turning
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.440]  the salt thing it goes starts counting down for my hand shit my uh and i had to turn the feature
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:13:00.720]  off i found it too too too patronizing it's patronizing it's like ah come on and it's like
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:07.360]  like you know if i go to the if i come in from outside yes i'm gonna wash my hands for 20 seconds
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:10.800]  and it's fine if i go to the bathroom i'm gonna wash my hands for 20 seconds there's times though
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.200]  where i wash my hands i really am just rinsing them and then it's like yes hey why'd you stop
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.640]  when you're in the kitchen what was this a quick rinse and it's like yeah i'm not yeah i'm done
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:23.760]  tapping my watch to tell you what what was going on here you're not my dad right and before my
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.800]  watch could tell me if it was 20 seconds i'm pretty sure i was thoroughly washing my hands um
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:36.320]  yeah trust me i was parent i'm uh you know we're all germaphones same yes it's but you know it's
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:43.360]  just a it's a talk year for the for the apple watch yeah yeah and the se was interesting in
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.800]  that it wasn't as low cost as the i as the apple watch 3 was the previous year but it was less
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:54.240]  expensive uh but it was missing like my favorite feature which is the always on yeah and i but i
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.240]  kind of feel like that's very purposeful like we don't know what they're going to do with it but
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:08.320]  one thing that i i think is part of when apple uses the se name is that it it's meant to last
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:14.160]  for a few years like so the first iphone se was sold for years i believe this one is going to be
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:20.160]  sold for quite a few years right and so that it's like a four-year cycle at least you know or at
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:27.920]  least until people stop buying it you know how long will people who are averse to technological
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:33.280]  change like my mom my my mom just got the new iphone se a couple weeks ago because she needed
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.600]  a new iphone her battery was really gone and she there was nothing literally nothing i could do or
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:45.200]  say to get her to want to try face id where i haven't seen her all year i couldn't talk her
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.960]  through it in person she's like i just want one just like my old phone i was like you know what
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:54.640]  okay you're happy you know it was like meant for she wants a button and she wants to use her thumb
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:00.640]  and there it is and for years to come now apple has the iphone se too that they can sell to those
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:07.840]  people i kind of feel like that's what the apple watch se is going to be like because right now
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:16.800]  with the iphone the apple watch series 3 as that 199 cheapest watch it sticks out because it
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:21.680]  doesn't look like the other watches and they have to still do the goofy thing where they're like
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:28.240]  sure this is a 42 millimeter or a 40 millimeter strap but it also fits the 38 millimeter iphone
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:36.000]  or apple watch 3 you know it it sticks out you know whereas if if it goes as i expect and next
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:43.040]  year they stop selling the series 3 and the se becomes the 199 apple watch they all look the
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:50.560]  same they all have the the new widths for the lugs and it all makes a lot more sense and then maybe
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:58.160]  the se stays for another year after that and it's only 179 or something like that yeah for sure but
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:06.000]  i feel like missing the always on display is and i'm sure it is actual cost saving but yeah it is
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:12.320]  a way that it is permanently easily here's a reason why you might want to spend an extra hundred
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:18.480]  dollars right yeah yeah it's like missing the modern design on the current iphone se yeah it
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:24.560]  just is this thing that and and you can be shown very clearly right there in the store look on this
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.600]  one when you move your watch away it just goes black on this one it stays on all the time still
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:38.640]  tells the time like a watch uh ipad air yeah yeah nice you know it's a you know i feel like i'm
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:47.040]  as we rush through the second half of the year i'm blowing off a very nice ipad upgrade and very
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:56.080]  you know the the the ipad pro as we know it is now a lower cost ipad for more people at a lower price
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:01.440]  and it works with the magic key keyboard we've already said nice things about touch id instead
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:06.560]  of face id so again it's easily differentiated right uh you know but what are you going to say
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:12.320]  about it it's not it's not new you know it got eight a14 technically first but didn't really
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:18.240]  ship with it first but they did a segment on it right which was weird and i still would love to
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.600]  know i don't know i don't know if you asked around i don't know but like did they really
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:30.640]  hold it back just to wait for the iphone or did they just like well we'll pre-announce it like
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.440]  i kind of have the feeling in the my my honest belief is if they wanted to they could have
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:41.760]  released the ipad air earlier and didn't yeah i i i still go back to your theory where they
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:44.800]  had all these sort of post-it notes with the different products in and they just had to
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:49.280]  arrange them to fit three different events and they just didn't they didn't want to announce
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:53.280]  the iphones early because they're in the habit of announcing the iphones and at least some of them
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:58.400]  ship within you know that 10-day windows so they couldn't do the iphones in september they they
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:02.320]  were going to do the apple watch anyway and the ipad air just fit in there and there's much less
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:07.120]  pressure much less time sensitivity at least so i i think if they could have shipped it earlier
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:10.320]  they they would have they probably just didn't have everything ramped up because of all the
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:16.880]  manufacturing yeah overhead for from covid yeah they announced the apple one bundle even though
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:24.000]  it was forthcoming and fitness plus included amongst it in a very what what to me was a
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.320]  strange segment it was only like it was seriously like like 90 seconds it was it was like this big
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:34.480]  thing that we thought was going to be a major segment of the show if it got announced and
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:39.280]  instead it was like hey we're coming up with this bundle that you know seems like we should have
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:46.480]  announced a year ago but we've got it this time and it is a good deal and you know that's it gone
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.720]  yeah and in the u.s it doesn't include subscription hardware which is already a thing that they do
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.640]  right right or apple care which i think was what would have been the bigger parts of the deal well
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.120]  and i wonder too to tie it in with the regulatory scrutiny that they're under right like there's
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.000]  something is that because they don't want to do that is that because they or bundling they're
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.200]  worried right is that they haven't gotten to it yet or is it because they're just worried that
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:19.280]  they don't want that that they they would face some kind of regulatory scrutiny over oh you're
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:24.400]  taking why does apple music come but not spotify right you're taking your hardware successful
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:30.400]  hardware platform and using it as a way as a cudgel a competitive cudgel to sell these services
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:35.920]  you know yeah yeah because surely you know that that would be the thing is just make it a monthly
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:41.440]  payment and it includes a new iphone every two years yeah that's sort of what everybody wants
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:45.520]  but i think you're right yeah i was surprised though that fitness plus was i thought it was
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:48.800]  going to be good just because the production value looks so high and it turned out to be better than
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:53.920]  i thought it would be everybody that seems to be the consensus on it right i mean the consensus is
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:20:03.040]  that it is it you know it people oddly to me oddly complain that it requires an apple watch
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:09.120]  um you can do it without it just i think it loses everything special about it if you don't have the
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:15.200]  apple right but everybody you know i don't know it's it's like people are still seem to be
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:20.720]  surprised that apple is good at the content thing right it's like yes and again it's like first
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:26.400]  impressions matter so much and it's like carpool karaoke was like their first original content and
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:33.120]  it yeah it was carpool karaoke and that app show yeah forget what the app planet of the apps right
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:41.760]  and it turns out those two shows are in no way indicative of what apple original content for
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:48.400]  apple tv plus would be like but they set expectations so low and i still feel like they
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.200]  haven't recovered you know that yeah that people still haven't gotten it through their heads that
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:59.920]  no this is seriously like you can argue that it still is not as good as hbo but it's like
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:04.640]  in the ballpark right like ted lasso ted lasso yes could be one of the best shows of the year
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.120]  could easily win best show of the year you know really really might and you know the the morning
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:16.960]  show deservedly of great acclaim and won a bunch of emmys um you know that that it's it's not all
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:25.440]  planet of the apps it really isn't and i feel like fitness plus in a way i know that this is a little
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.440]  bit diminishing because i know that they've got this interactive stuff where you see your live
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:37.680]  metrics from your watch on screen as you're doing it but it is the burn bar it is sort of it's like
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:44.320]  a modern day version of okay we have the apple tv plus channel where we show mostly fictional dramas
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:51.840]  like ted lasso and uh the morning show and stuff like that and now we have a fitness channel right
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:58.720]  it's it's like you know fox has the regular fox and then they have fox sports right and that's
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:05.040]  where they show nothing but college basketball and hockey and and sports news and stuff like that well
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:09.920]  now it's sort of like fitness plus is the new second channel of apple original content and it's
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:16.160]  just exclusively dedicated to these fitness shows but that it's it does sort of push forward that
[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:19.200]  thing that tim cook said at the beginning of the year that was sort of i don't know if it was
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:23.600]  controversial time but when he was doing that interview with kramer and said that he thinks
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:31.840]  that looking back apple will be best known for being a health provider it's very serious you know
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:39.200]  endeavor you know and and i really do think they take it to i mean that's not how i think of apple
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:47.280]  but i believe tim cook right like i believe that he thinks that way you know it it is unusual
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:54.560]  i don't know it again i don't i don't say it's a bad idea but i i'm not as surprised as some
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:23:00.080]  people seem to be that fitness plus is as well regarded as it is yeah no i really i'm really
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.360]  enjoying it and again i thought i would and i'm enjoying it more than i thought i would
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:12.160]  uh and very much personality based right like it's yeah it is not like reality tv in so far as that
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:18.240]  most shows that people consider reality tv are about like gossipy type stuff and it's the
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:24.000]  opposite where it's all sort of g-rated but it is like reality tv where it's very personality
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.600]  driven you know and that these people are like they're they they're the same sort of personalities
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:35.920]  uh and you know of diverse backgrounds but all young and attractive you know
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.960]  well they have like from they have a 60 year old one of them is a 60 year old trainer and they're
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:44.880]  all but they're all super engaging yeah that's sort but that's also sort of like reality tv
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:50.560]  right where there's always like uh some old just like an old guy on survivor right yes you know
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:57.280]  because it's you know it's it is and and they are they you know it's all what apple says on the tin
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:04.240]  you know they want everybody to feel welcome and if you are like a serious spin cyclist who's been
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:11.040]  doing it for years and you're up you know you're you you spin at a truly expert level there are
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:16.320]  classes for you and if you've never gotten on a spin bike in your life this is a great way to get
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:21.920]  started and you should feel just as welcome and again i i feel like that's been apple's approach
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:27.440]  to it you know the what business does apple have doing this aspect of it is to me that's sort of
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:33.520]  been apple's approach to computers right like yeah that we we can we we truly believe we can make
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:40.000]  a computer that is good for somebody who doesn't know anything about computers and also that the
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:47.520]  same machine could be a great computer for a programmer yeah yeah for they can make a computer
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.240]  that forever for everyone who has always felt alienated and inaccessible right to normal
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.480]  computer right it's you know or intimidated it's the computer for the rest of us was the slogan
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.240]  for the mac and it's like the fitness class for the rest of us but it also includes and they have
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.160]  like the sign language little bits in there and they do every you know and it's just really and
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:08.560]  they have people doing crossovers with the other trainers so you always see people you know and
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:14.480]  the it's really well thought out yeah uh next event october 13th a high speed event homepod
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:21.120]  mini all of the iphones and magsafe that's the word 5g more than i've ever heard it in my life
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:28.480]  before since 5g 5g 5g yeah and then and believe it or not the homepod mini doesn't even support 5g
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:34.240]  no we there's no way we can't we can't just go into detail on this what are your
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.720]  high level takeaways now that we're months out from the iphone 12 event what's your takeaway
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:45.120]  on the iphone 12 lineup uh i i think it's really good i think it showed apple expanding like if
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:48.880]  you think they originally had one iphone and now they're up to four iphones five if you include
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:53.680]  the iphone se i think the iphone mini was an interesting experiment because the original se
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:58.000]  was both smaller and less expensive and now we have a separate iphone that's less expensive and
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.280]  a separate iphone that's smaller and that sort of lets apple start testing segmentation because
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.400]  whenever any market gets big like the car market you have to start segmenting or you just stall
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:12.800]  growth so i think and again now the the i know some people hate this but the max model now has
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:18.080]  more features than the regular pro but that again is part of that segmentation so i think it's i
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:24.560]  think it's a very successful product i think the 5g thing is still not it's not ready for prime
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:30.240]  time but they had to do it and i think it was good they kept the pricing on the pros the same
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.160]  even if because of oled and 5g and all of that the pricing on the regular ones
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:41.440]  went up and i hope that's sort of a temporary thing i like the i still haven't ordered a new
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.920]  iphone i'm about to i'm just waiting now for christmas to be over because it's for me so
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:50.400]  i don't need it for christmas so i'll just wait and won't add to the holiday shipping
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:57.760]  but i'm i'm gonna get the uh the regular iphone 12 not not the main interesting for me it was like i
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.520]  i the first i thought you'd go mini it was very close that's what it came down to for me and it
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.400]  was the club it was the hardest decision at most years it's like oh i do see the appeal of this but
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:13.920]  i want this you know like last year it was easy i wanted the regular 11 pro max is too big yeah
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:19.520]  and last year the max didn't even have any extra features it was just big every designer i know
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.160]  went mini i think it really appeals to designer culture yeah it's this year was the toughest
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:29.200]  because all four were appealing right like the the one that would fit with the phone i bought
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:35.440]  every single year previously would be the 11 pro that you know the roughly regular size with the
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.440]  best possible camera and i honestly it's just like i just don't like the feel of it as much i don't
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:50.320]  think it's bad i just love the feel of the regular 12 better and i'm kind of over the 2x camera not
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:55.520]  that i you know if if they just would add that camera to the regular aluminum 12 i'd like it
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.320]  better but i'm willing to live without it and i kind of feel like look for at least the next few
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.320]  months i'm not going anywhere anyway so if i do get a new phone i don't really need the best
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:10.000]  possible camera so the max but it was the most tempting the biggest phone has ever been because
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.840]  the camera is better than the big one ever has been but i just can't it's not for me you know
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.560]  i so i had the same i had the opposite problem where i was torn between the iphone 12 pro because
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:26.560]  i love i love the telephoto and the iphone 12 pro max which is just too big and i ended up going
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:32.000]  with the max because i really wanted that camera and the 65 millimeter was interesting i really
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:38.800]  wanted um 4k 60 dolby vision because i use it for b-roll for my videos and the ability to do
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:43.120]  60 frames per second means i can use it for slow-mo which is really important for me and
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  then when you when i saw uh sebastian de witt's article on what that sensor is really capable of
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:53.040]  once you get some of the computational stuff that's auto correcting everything out of the way
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:58.160]  and especially with pro raw i was just sold and i said i'm gonna live with this tiny tablet just
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.640]  to have that camera so that's where you went you went pro max yeah i ordered the pro max yeah so i
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:07.040]  i see the appeal of it and it's the most appealing the biggest phone has ever been
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:14.160]  to me but i still uh i don't want it uh i mean it's just not for me um but all four were appealing
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:19.680]  to me and it's like all right i cut off all the pros all right i'm even gonna give just move away
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:25.520]  from the 2x lens even though i do love it and i i will miss it then it just came down to the regular
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:36.000]  12 and the 12 mini and it was close and you know it's my eyes as a 48 year old yeah it's close but
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.640]  it's like my eyes have gotten better in the last few years just long story short but it's actually
[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:47.920]  better than it was just a few years ago and i do see it fine but it's not the greatest and to me
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:54.560]  the thing that really pushes it over the edge is like when i'm wearing glasses or i don't have my
[02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:59.760]  glasses on and i'm holding it up and it's like when i'm using it as a camera it's like i have
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:04.160]  progressive so if i'm holding it down to read i can see it better but if i'm holding it up to take a
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:09.680]  picture then i don't see it as well and being a little bigger makes it better and then typing
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.560]  it's not it really does you know guess what it has it's nicer to type on a slightly bigger on-screen
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:19.920]  keyboard yeah but it was the closest it was so close and i feel like i was like the max or the
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:23.760]  mini that was the thing with me is i i discounted the ones in the middle and the mini was just so
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:29.520]  appealing and i think for people who the iphone isn't a primary computer the mini is so much win
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:34.560]  and the max if you if it is your primary computer is so much win at the same time but it was close
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:39.200]  but the winner for me this year is the regular iphone 12 it's like the combination of weight
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:45.600]  and a big difference to me with the 12 versus the 12 pro is the weight in addition to feel
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:51.200]  like i just love the feel better but part of the feel is the weight and it's like oh but man it's
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.960]  it was so interesting to me because every year i always have people tell me apple should just
[02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:58.160]  double the battery and i'm like you know how heavy that is like it's not a bunch of other problems
[02:30:58.160 --> 02:31:02.240]  like it's not rf transparent it increases the heat but it's heavy and they're like oh i can just hold
[02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:07.520]  up a phone and then all these people look at the pro like that's too heavy like yes it turns out
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:11.200]  that a light phone is part of usability because you can play games and watch videos and read books
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:18.560]  longer uh magsafe what's your takeaway on magsafe now a couple months in i'm optimistic and
[02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:22.800]  disappointed at the same time like i think the i think the idea is great and i think especially
[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:26.960]  if apple is going to go portless in the future magsafe is a really good way to sort of ease us
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:33.840]  into that thing but i'm still super salty about the loss of the charger in the box but especially
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:40.240]  that both chargers the magsafe and the magsafe duo do not come with the ac adapter in the box
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:46.560]  to me is just ridiculous well and the duo in particular because it's 130 it's a 130 charging
[02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:51.120]  mat that doesn't come with an ac adapter it's ridiculous well it was clearly made for a year
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:54.960]  when they thought travel was going to be a huge thing and for people who had a huge apple affinity
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:58.960]  were not price conscious and just wanted something really convenient to fold up and carry with them
[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:03.280]  when traveling but we did not get that year but even then it should come with the ac adapter if
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:09.040]  it's 130 it's ridiculous absolutely it's absolutely probably my biggest thumbs down of the year for
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:12.560]  all of apple products is the duo charger yeah because i don't think it's that great i feel
[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:17.840]  like it feels chintzy if it costs 50 bucks then i'd say oh sure go buy one and put it in your
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:24.160]  travel bag but at 130 and it's cumbersome yeah it's very cumbersome like they made the watch
[02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:29.120]  side way more cumbersome than any other watch charger because they put a big magnet magnet
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:34.160]  around it that doesn't do anything except keep it closed when you cinch it up and it doesn't come
[02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:39.360]  with the ac adapter have i mentioned that it's ridiculous and the wallet i'm sort of mixed
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.720]  feelings on peter mckinnon turned me around a little bit on it because he went he's a leather
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.840]  maker and he went through how well made it is and you know how it doesn't always fall off if you
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:52.240]  treat it like that sort of leather wallet but i'm still someone who needs more than two cards so i
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:56.480]  think it's got again it's one of these products that apple has put out that appeals to a very
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:33:00.640]  small part of a very highly invested apple ecosystem owner yeah and i kind of feel like
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:04.640]  they're showing you know it's like here's their very opinionated take on a wallet where you only
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:08.480]  have two or three cards and you don't need your apple card of course because your apple card can
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:13.040]  just live on your phone so there's you know that's why you can get away with it's like ah but i need
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:17.520]  a gym card and a driver's license and yeah my license yeah my medical card you're already over
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:22.160]  the limit but it's like well here's how you know at least other companies can take it apart and
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.680]  figure out how to make an adapter that fits on it um and some of the belkan stuff is good like
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:31.280]  that's why i'm i'm optimistic about it some of the stuff that we see coming out is really good
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:42.640]  i think ios 14 is has been a terrific update and yeah i don't know you know uh you know again we
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:48.640]  could do a whole hour on what's great about ios 14 to me the big win is the widgets and i feel like
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:55.360]  apple really nailed it i feel like the way that people are happy to futz around and make widgets
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:00.640]  and that widget smith is a smash hit and that it became a tick tock thing and people just love
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.760]  customizing their home screen and the way that shortcuts can double as you could just make a
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:11.920]  shortcut that opens an app and therefore you can put any app icon you want on it and it's a quick
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:18.240]  little easily understood hack to to make custom icons for any app you want and then you can hide
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:24.800]  the actual app in your app library and have this super minimalist thing i haven't really gone i
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.000]  that's not for me anymore but that's not me but that's the sort of thing i love doing with my mac
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:36.960]  in the early 90s i love making custom icons and customizing all of that and so like it it's
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:44.400]  exactly the same mindset of doing custom apps icons and customizing my desktop and it i remember
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:50.720]  when when you couldn't you only had a desktop pattern on macco on system seven and you didn't
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:54.400]  you couldn't have a whole picture on the background but there were third-party utilities
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:58.800]  that would let you do it and of course i did because it looks so much cooler and it's like i
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:05.840]  totally get that mindset and i think it is so awesome that i was 14 has given that level of
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:16.720]  enthusiasm to younger people today who you know that the phone is the main computer and it's it is
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:19.840]  and they're improving it like the latest beta stops you having to do the whole round trip
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:23.840]  through short through right shortcuts each time right right then it's not just for the app
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.960]  launching they've actually that's the other thing if i want to go the other way and put on my old
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:37.840]  man hat uh shortcuts has taken a huge step up it being a sort of serious automation tool like in
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:44.720]  a way that i was like very skeptical it would ever keep getting better but it is and it's gotten a lot
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:50.480]  faster there are a lot of stupid things that's like why is this slow to just make a list of these
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:54.640]  10 things and show a thing and it's like why does it take forever it's like now it runs as fast as
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:59.760]  you think it can and why does this bounce me over to the shortcuts app if it's just going to show a
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:05.520]  dialogue now it doesn't it just runs right there yeah and you're you can make little programs you
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:11.920]  can be yeah and and to me that ability to be like your own designer who can make the phone
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:19.200]  look exactly the way you want as it gets you into user interface design and the way that shortcuts
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.320]  can let you be a programmer and make a little program that does some stupid thing just for you
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:30.640]  that makes you happy is a great way to get you into programming and so to me the two best things
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:37.360]  about ios 14 are the shortcuts improvements and the uh the widgets which let people it's so good
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.280]  i don't know if i'm talking to federico vittucci rosemary orchard or matthew castanelli anymore or
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:45.680]  their shortcuts they could have set up a shortcut just to handle our conversations and it makes me
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:51.280]  so happy that apple has taken a keen interest in this and that they're listening you know they
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.480]  they see people's enthusiasm for it and jumped on it like you said to to make it so that the
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:01.360]  you know everybody was afraid when everybody customized these shortcuts yeah that apple was
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:05.760]  going to take it away you know just snatch it right and be like oh we didn't think that you
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:11.360]  would use these shortcuts to launch an app just to make custom icons for instagram or whatever
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:17.040]  so we're gonna disable that and instead they made it better and fixed everybody's complaint that it
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:22.000]  boomeranged you through the shortcuts app and it's like ah they're encouraging this level of
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:28.480]  tinkering i think that's great and my thing is as much as series assistant is still a frustratingly
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:32.720]  inconsistent experience the on-device intelligence has been great like i just replaced most of my
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:38.000]  home screen with those siri selected app widgets and almost every time that app i want is always
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.840]  right there waiting for me and i never have to move home pages anymore the one for me and it's
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:50.400]  on device it clearly because apple's been very clear that like the photos library management
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:55.040]  stuff happens on device and on the mac you know going back to the earlier in the show and activity
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:00.240]  monitor you can see photos library running in the background sometimes i don't have a lot of widgets
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:04.880]  that i use i have a weather widget from weatherline which is a great third-party app and they're at
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:08.960]  their widgets by the way have really gotten they started out great but now they're even better
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:14.160]  where they have like in the same little tiny widget they have your like next three hours
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:18.240]  and then the next three days side by side oh weatherline it's a great weather it's so good
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:23.520]  the built-in photos widget and i mean this sincerely i and i don't think i'm a sappy
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:29.680]  person who's prone to purple pros it's life-changing i just have this little
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:36.560]  wide two by four widget at the top of my second home screen with the built-in photos widget and
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:45.120]  it just every day shows me like an old photo from 10 to 15 years ago and they're the most amazing
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:50.880]  pics you could imagine and it's like it's just a so mine is a mine is a mixed blessing because i
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.200]  get the exact same thing like i'll get pictures of my god kids that just melt my heart and then
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:59.120]  i'll get a picture from one of the events that you and i were at that we can't go to this year
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:05.040]  and i feel like it's trolling me it's it's really been great for me seeing family and and and it
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:10.240]  just it the machine learning on it it's clearly driven because like i'll go open it up and the
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:15.120]  ones that they pick to show in the widget are invariably the better pictures you know yes
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:18.960]  and i just share them like right away i never used to share photos like that but it'll show
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:22.880]  me a photo from three years ago and immediately message send and people like oh it's so cute and
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:29.280]  when when it shows me ones from the longest ago that are in my library where my son is now he's
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:37.280]  about to turn 17 believe it or not wow i was shooting 35 millimeter film until he was yeah
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:43.760]  i forget how old but like the first two to three years of his life most of my photos of him as a
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:50.400]  baby were shot with the 35 millimeter film camera and i scanned the negatives and i'm probably a
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:59.440]  stupid thing but i just kept them all so if i shot 36 images and you know maybe you know 18 of them
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:03.840]  were worth keeping i just kept the other 18 even if they were like the back of somebody's head
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:07.040]  because it's like to me it's like well i paid to get the film developed i'm going to keep it
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:12.400]  whereas if it was a digital photo i'd be like go up delete delete delete uh it never the photos
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:18.400]  widget never shows me those images and it's not just which ones i've like heart hearted in the
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:24.640]  photos app um it it just has the machine learning to know that that's it's that's a bad picture
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:29.200]  yeah that whole mission that whole on-device intelligence group just killed it this year
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:33.440]  they did such good work and it's it goes through the entire system i've talked to a few people
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:38.800]  who've said the same thing about the photos widget and it's like if i didn't expect i expected it to
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:42.480]  be something that i would delete i was like i don't know why they're showing me this by default
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.560]  if you did delete it and didn't give it a chance that would be like my tip of the week would be put
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:52.000]  the photos widget back on like your second home screen and give it a chance and just like spend
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.080]  a week or two and just look at the photos it surfaces for you it it's it's really amazing
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.600]  um yeah i actually graduated it to my first home screen and it i have it in the stack and
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:07.520]  every once in a while it just comes up and every time it's fantastic all right we're
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:13.360]  propping up on the legal limit for a podcast length um okay so we're gonna have to cut one
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.800]  more thing one more thing i was there was there anything else that apple released this year i
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.760]  can't remember it at this point uh just the home pod mini but i think it's a home pod mini at this
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:29.600]  point now the m1 max we've talked about it the most recently i don't feel bad cutting it short
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:36.320]  it's to me the the most amazing thing that apple's done in years hardware wise yes it is a home and
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:40.000]  not just apple i'd say it's like one of the best things in processors in the last decade right it
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:46.400]  really is it's it's like a reaffirmation in the belief that computers can keep getting better
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:52.800]  right it used to be yeah axiomatic and then it's like it stopped happening and we just sort of got
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:57.600]  beaten into submission and it's like uh yeah i guess computers don't really get better and
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:02.480]  and when they do well it was like the core like when intel came out with core it was a revolution
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:06.000]  right for what like they were in the tank it was a revolution and it just changed everything i feel
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.640]  like m1 just changes everything not just at their high performance the high performance is almost
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:16.480]  like incidental to the design philosophy that resulted in m1 but just using a mac everything
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.920]  is as instantaneous as using an ipad and the quality of life is to me even as impressive as
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:26.320]  the battery life that we're getting right because you know you're doing so much more right and it's
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:32.240]  like that it's unlike the ipad where you know apps aren't getting frozen in the background and or
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:39.360]  jettisoned every three minutes right yeah exactly you know and that you are actually getting virtual
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:45.200]  memory and it's swapping memory to the ssd and you can't even tell because it's like the performance
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:52.320]  of getting it back off the ssd is so fast that it's faster than the ram on computers that we're
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:43:00.320]  used to it's like it's just really amazing it's it's yeah i don't know and it makes it makes you
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:05.920]  happy like it makes me smile using the mac and i i have not seen i have not seen a beach ball it's
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:10.480]  like if someone had made a trailer for the movie and they would say like imagine imagine a world
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:15.120]  without beach balls it would be beautiful that i've totally bought into that i've not found a way
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:19.680]  to beach ball i didn't want i forget what i did and i was like i should write this down and i
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.200]  can't remember probably an electron app um well and it's you know in terms of ending this show
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:33.040]  and ending our look back at apple's 2020 well i well they did release the home pod or not the
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:40.560]  home pod the air pods air pods max forget them you know we don't have time for that uh no i like on
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:46.960]  their air pods pro for your for your over here yeah but do i really uh it's just the case is
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:53.840]  funny but that's a whole other show the case is actually it it really is baffling it the more i
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.960]  think about it and now that they've sort of settled in and when you really look at the case and you
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.560]  can see how it's just sort of a origami project you know that it's yes somebody just cut off a
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:10.880]  piece of this cover from an ipad case it's like if we just took this rubber and cut it like this you
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:15.680]  could fold it and it's like if it's like chaps it's like putting chaps on an like there's holes
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.560]  in the bum area like it's just so strange if it was like a college design student's
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:28.240]  thesis project like here's how you could make a a headphone pouch out of a single piece of
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:35.440]  leather or rubber and you would save material because it's all one piece and you'd only have
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:40.960]  to attach it here and here you it would be like a plus this is an a plus student project this is
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:44.320]  genius but the cutout doesn't line up with the lightning port which is something that i would
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:49.760]  just drag samsung for i did for years so i figured it out it does line up with the
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:54.720]  headphone port if you tuck the steel arms all the way up into the headband
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:01.760]  oh okay well but who doesn't who wants to do that if if no i don't if you're comfortable size for
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:07.280]  the headphone is with the stems an inch down aren't you going to leave them there like that
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:11.760]  it's almost worse like i know people are dunking on them because the the lightning port doesn't
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:17.280]  line up with the notch can you believe we're going to go longer on the ipad the airpods pouch
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:22.800]  than the m1 max but here we are no but i know everybody's dunking on them rightfully because
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:28.400]  the lightning port doesn't line up with the notch for the lightning port but it does if you tuck the
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:35.200]  bars in but that that's worse but the bars being sort of stiff and resistance and holding their
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:40.720]  position is literally one of the top selling points they mention yes about the device so
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:46.320]  they're like one of the great things about this device is that these stems don't have notches
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:51.760]  and have this premium feel and they hold their place and then once you have it sized in place
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:58.560]  and it'll hold its position the lightning port will never line up with this with the notch again
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:02.400]  it would have been more apple to me if there was no case like that would have made more apple sense
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:05.520]  and people would have dragged them for that as well but i would have at least said well that's
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:12.000]  apple right it's it would have it's nothing is better than something bad it from the apple
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.440]  mindset it's better to have no touch at all on you you knew i was going to go here better to have no
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  touch at all on the macbooks than to have bad touch right it's it's yes that's the apple mindset
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:30.640]  so i actually agree with you i think it would be better and i i honestly believe i really do
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:37.680]  wonder if the number has to be greater than zero at least one person out there is going to throw
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:45.760]  is going to throw away the pouch thinking it was the packaging yes yes i guarantee you i it is so
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:52.480]  close to david pogue's wife is going to throw it it is so close to being really premium packaging
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:58.560]  that you throw away not a really crappy pouch yeah that somebody's going to mistake it for it it's
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:06.320]  so bizarre 100 all right there we go you're in review wrapped up under the legal three-hour limit
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:12.240]  uh renee everybody i i enjoyed being on your show a couple times this year but the most recent one
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:17.280]  thank you i i swear to god not joking i'm gonna put it in the show notes we had such a great time
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:24.000]  talking about touchscreens and uh whether or not they should or will ever come to the mac i will
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:29.200]  put a link to the to the show your whole show though is over there on the youtube youtube.com
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:37.760]  slash renee richie very easy to remember thank you for making it just your name oh anything else you
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.560]  want to promote what else you want to promote no that's it and i did start a new podcast with
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:46.320]  georgia dow called apple talk where she talks about the psychology behind all the technology
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:50.240]  and i just try to shut up and learn all i can and everybody the best way to find that i'm sure is to
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:55.760]  go to your favorite podcast app and just search for apple talk yep or youtube.com slash apple talk
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:02.560]  show this apple talk was taken but then you can wait wait youtube.com slash apple talk show all
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.560]  one word oh apple talk show oh now you're stepping on my toes here i didn't mean to i was trying to
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:12.880]  get apple talk and youtube made it so difficult and i'm still trying to pull some strings and
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:19.680]  see if i can get it you know my uh the talk show twitter account uh it's all it's actually died
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:24.160]  down because i feel like everybody who makes the mistake has maybe learned but the the mistake
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:33.680]  people make is i get i get people talking to the uh the talk tv show which is like a morning gossip
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:40.000]  tv show uh and it's definitely a different audience apple talk was this fernity caldwell
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.680]  idea because she's brilliant at naming and she was kind enough to let us use it yeah well it's
