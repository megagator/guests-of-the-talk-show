[00:00.000 --> 00:05.040]  As we record, we are recording on Thursday, November 19th. I have seen reports now on Twitter
[00:05.680 --> 00:09.520]  that people are saying that the Apple Pencils are actually starting to appear
[00:09.520 --> 00:14.160]  in retail stores. I saw somebody was in San Francisco and there's a whole bunch of them
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.320]  available. Yeah, yesterday, the Wednesday, the 18th, there were a lot of reports that
[00:20.320 --> 00:26.160]  it looked to me like they were making an effort to get them out. There were a whole bunch of reports
[00:26.160 --> 00:31.520]  like I saw five of them here and there were 20 of them there and I thought that was a good sign and
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.120]  there's more of that today. So it looks like whatever was going on, whatever logistical
[00:37.920 --> 00:45.040]  bottleneck was there maybe has, if it hasn't solved itself at least, has widened the bottleneck
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.720]  a little bit. I'm curious to see what happens to people who like were promised three or four
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.240]  week shipping dates like a week or two ago, whether they start getting them way earlier than promised
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.680]  or whether the shipping ones still take as long as they had thought. Yeah, that's the... I wonder
[01:01.680 --> 01:08.400]  sometimes if Apple has really thought through the whole dichotomy of shipping versus Apple store,
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.200]  you know, retail store pickup because with the Apple TV, I wonder how many returns they're
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.520]  going to get where people bought them the moment that it was for sale, had them shipped
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.120]  on the cheaper shipping so they would get them the next week and then found that they were all
[01:21.120 --> 01:26.000]  in the Apple stores on the day. That's what happened to me. I just got my box and just put
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.160]  the label back on it and sent it back out because three days earlier I just walked into my local
[01:30.160 --> 01:35.360]  Apple store and picked one up. Yeah. And this is like that too a little bit where it's like,
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.600]  you know, if you could get one in the retail store and your order says it's going to be four weeks
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.320]  out, that's, you know, that's sort of silly. I mean, I get why they don't want to turn people
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.320]  away who want to buy an iPad Pro at the retail store and want a pencil with it. They want to
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.800]  kind of have a pencil for them, but it would be frustrating if you were waiting at home for it
[01:52.800 --> 02:02.480]  for months. Yeah, and it just... like when you show it to people, it's like just showing it to
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.040]  somebody. If I didn't have the pencil, I honestly don't even know what I would tell them.
[02:07.040 --> 02:10.960]  It's like, here's a big iPad. Yeah, it is. I mean, and the keyboard is interesting. You haven't gotten smaller.
[02:10.960 --> 02:17.040]  People definitely want to try the keyboard and, you know, and it's, you know, and it's interesting
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.240]  to... it's easy to imagine a big iPad. It is different to actually sit down in front of it
[02:22.240 --> 02:27.680]  and use it, but just for like the first minute or two, everybody wants to use the pencil.
[02:28.880 --> 02:35.040]  Yeah, how could you not? And even though it's not like there haven't been styluses for iPads
[02:35.040 --> 02:40.320]  before, but this is, you know, it's the Apple stylus, so it's got that kind of attraction around it, and
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.120]  the idea is, and it sounds like this is bearing out for everybody we know who actually knows about
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.640]  drawing things like Serenity Caldwell, that it really does deliver on that, that its precision
[02:50.640 --> 02:58.480]  is pretty amazing, and that on the apps that have been updated, the lag is very, very minimal.
[02:59.200 --> 03:06.000]  Yeah, yeah, totally. I think it's bearing out, and the palm rejection is all bearing out as promised.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.360]  I've been trying to like figure this out and look at how they're doing the palm rejection,
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.440]  and it... I'm sure it's probably more than this, but it seems like the two things I can tell that
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.360]  they're doing is... and the one is obvious, which is kind of looking for what I'll just call a fat
[03:23.360 --> 03:30.160]  touch, meaning like the meaty part of your palm and just rejecting it outright. That, wow, that is
[03:30.160 --> 03:35.280]  that is either an enormous thumb or that's that's the palm, but the other thing that they're doing
[03:35.280 --> 03:40.160]  is like in a drawing mode. I could see it in the notes app when you're in a little sketch mode in
[03:40.160 --> 03:48.720]  notes, is sometimes when you put your palm down, you'll get a false hit, and it'll put like a
[03:48.720 --> 03:51.920]  little drawing mark there. It's hard to see sometimes, you know, you kind of have to look
[03:51.920 --> 03:57.440]  at it at an angle because your palm actually covers it, but it puts like a little false pen
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.000]  mark down, but then as soon as the pen touches, it just says, oh, okay, you're using the pen. Throw
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.480]  that throw that last mark away. Yeah, which I think has something to do with their... they've
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.280]  got this whole touch coalescing thing. I mean, they're trying to view... it's not a one-to-one.
[04:11.280 --> 04:16.000]  It's a little bit like autocorrect for typing, I think, where it's trying to look holistically at
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.840]  sort of like what it's getting input on the screen and make some judgments, and they may be
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.560]  sort of in real time they're trying to figure out what actually is going on instead of just
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.800]  it being... I think the old style touch screens were much more of a one-to-one kind of thing.
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.640]  It's... what it's not... I'll tell you what it's not is it's not locking out everything but the pencil
[04:33.200 --> 04:38.400]  because you can actually... I don't know if you've tried this, but if you put two fingers down on the
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.120]  screen in notes, you'll get the ruler. It'll actually bring up the ruler, and then you can,
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.360]  with your other hand, you can draw on the ruler, and it'll snap with the pencil. So it's not like
[04:49.360 --> 04:55.440]  it's locking out the screen from other... from fingers. Like, that's not it. It is looking for
[04:55.440 --> 05:05.120]  that meaty blob of the side of your hand or of the butt of your of your palm and realizing what
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.400]  it is and saying, I'm just going to ignore that. Right, and if it does get... I wonder if it...
[05:12.320 --> 05:18.320]  maybe, but it's... I think it's probably some kind of reasonable distance. You know, like, if you had
[05:18.320 --> 05:22.880]  if you had a finger way apart from the pen, it's going to know that that's not a touch from the
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.280]  hand holding the pen because it's too far away. It's like that distance of when you're gripping
[05:27.280 --> 05:32.320]  a pencil in a, you know, a pencil grip that that touch that's maybe like, what is that, about two
[05:32.320 --> 05:38.960]  or three inches away. Okay, that's... and it happened a half second before the pen began drawing.
[05:38.960 --> 05:45.520]  That's the one to throw away. Yeah, you're right. I just actually did it where I put my finger and
[05:45.520 --> 05:51.280]  the pen down simultaneously very close to each other and started moving, and that the finger
[05:51.280 --> 05:56.960]  mark started and then vanished because I realized you're kind of going along with the pen. You
[05:56.960 --> 06:04.480]  weren't meant to be there. Yeah, I think long story short, it's... and we can go long after the short
[06:04.480 --> 06:12.880]  version, but I think that even though I'm not an artist, I just appreciate it, and I just like
[06:12.880 --> 06:17.120]  playing with it, and I'm excited by it, that it's one of the most exciting things Apple's done in a
[06:17.120 --> 06:21.680]  long time. Like, this is the sort of thing that we look to Apple to do, and now they've done it.
[06:23.040 --> 06:31.200]  Yeah, this is... I feel like, right, they... so much of the story of this product, I think in hindsight,
[06:31.200 --> 06:37.440]  is stuff that Apple really didn't make much of an effort to integrate into the iPad until the
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.400]  moment when Apple wanted to build its own thing that was integrated hardware and software, and so
[06:42.400 --> 06:48.480]  you get all the keyboard stuff in iOS 9 is really leading to the smart keyboard, and the reason that
[06:48.480 --> 06:57.200]  they haven't done higher resolution digitizer, you know, more 240 megahertz or 240 hertz scanner
[06:57.200 --> 07:02.000]  on the digitizer, why didn't they do all that stuff? Because they weren't ready for it, and now
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.800]  they're ready for it, and so the pencil is the... gets to be first out the door, because of course
[07:06.800 --> 07:12.800]  it is, because it's the Apple accessory. Yeah, did I saw something? Is it... was it... do you know... was
[07:12.800 --> 07:18.000]  there like a teardown of the pencil finally? I think there was one. I'm not sure I read it, but
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.320]  they did... I think they did take it apart. I still don't think anybody has figured out exactly how it
[07:24.320 --> 07:29.600]  works, but like, from what I've been able to piece together, I don't... I think I was wrong in my
[07:29.600 --> 07:39.520]  review when I guessed that there's like some kind of new sensor, like something in the iPad to detect
[07:40.160 --> 07:47.200]  the pencil. Instead, I'm almost certain that what's going on is that the regular touch sensors
[07:47.200 --> 07:57.600]  in the glass are still touch... still detect skin the same way, but that they've added into the
[07:57.600 --> 08:04.800]  exact same layer the ability to detect the pencil, and the way that the pencil makes itself known is
[08:04.800 --> 08:10.720]  it emits some kind of like a radio wave of some sort at a known very specific frequency,
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.080]  but that it's not a different thing that's picking that up. It's actually the same as the touch
[08:18.080 --> 08:26.640]  sensors, and that somehow it's like the radio wave stuff is so precise is that that's what allows it,
[08:26.640 --> 08:32.720]  like if you imagine that it's a grid of sensors with capacitive touch where it touches your
[08:32.720 --> 08:38.640]  finger, it's always looking for a bunch of them to light up at once because you're, you know,
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.600]  it's like your little quarter of an inch round fingertip that's touching, and so it's lighting
[08:43.600 --> 08:50.000]  up all of these at once, and then with a pencil, it's right down to the actual pixels, including
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.080]  the ability to sort of tell when it's between pixels. Yeah, I mean, I don't know enough about
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.800]  this. Something funny is going on, of course, and we know that because you can't use it on
[09:00.800 --> 09:07.040]  another screen. It is not trying to trick the device into thinking that it's a really thin
[09:07.040 --> 09:16.160]  finger, right? Whether it's a radio signal or it's an electric signal of some kind that's not
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.760]  the kind that you would pick up from a finger, there's something going on where it's doing it
[09:21.760 --> 09:28.000]  and getting that precise, you know, it knows exactly where that pencil is, and then it also
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.360]  is talking via Bluetooth and registering the pressure so it knows when it's down and not.
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.600]  Long story short, I'm nearly certain that they didn't add a second sensor grid for it. What they
[09:37.600 --> 09:44.320]  did is make the existing sensor grid smarter and have it looking for this other new thing,
[09:44.880 --> 09:51.040]  this short-term radio burst. Here's a weird thing that I didn't write about. I haven't really seen
[09:51.040 --> 09:57.520]  anybody else write about, but I still am not sure what to think about it, but it really seems very
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.240]  strange to me is the fact that there is no interface to the pencil other than plugging
[10:04.240 --> 10:11.840]  it into the lightning port. So you charge it that way and you register it with the iPad that way,
[10:11.840 --> 10:16.320]  but then once you do that, once you have a fully charged iPad or pencil, once you have a fully
[10:16.320 --> 10:21.760]  charged pencil and it's paired, you never turn it on, never turn it off, and you never get any
[10:21.760 --> 10:29.520]  indication that it's on, off, low on battery or anything. Yeah, it's like a, I mean, we joke
[10:29.520 --> 10:35.440]  sometimes about Apple saying magical a lot and about how it wants to make its products kind of
[10:35.440 --> 10:43.040]  black boxes that you can't look into, but this pencil is like, I'm gonna pander to you and say
[10:43.040 --> 10:49.840]  this is the pencil that's on the desk that Dave Bowman wakes up in, right? It is like, look human,
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.840]  we have made a pencil and it's this perfectly white and a little bit silver slick kind of object
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.960]  that it does. I know it's shaped like a pencil, but it can't really be a pencil, right? And that's
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.320]  what it feels like to me is it has no interface, you're right. It has no kind of markings other
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.920]  than the little silver circle and yeah, you can get to the lightning port if you take the cap off
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.880]  and you can unscrew the tip, but it is featureless. It is just, I mean, it is literally featureless,
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.640]  like not just like it's looks of features, but it's features. You don't do anything with it
[11:20.640 --> 11:26.400]  except draw. It's very clever and I think it's also very much in line with Apple's design
[11:26.400 --> 11:32.400]  philosophy, which is to have as little there as possible. Yeah, we often joke about Apple stuff
[11:32.400 --> 11:36.480]  that, you know, they try to ship stuff with one button, but ultimately they want to ship something
[11:36.480 --> 11:44.880]  with no buttons and the pencil is the no button device. And there is this part of me that kind of
[11:44.880 --> 11:52.400]  wants it to light, have like a green, just a little green dot that lights up when it's on and being
[11:52.400 --> 11:59.520]  used and then it turns off when it's sleeping or whatever. But now here I am, you know, two weeks
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.720]  later and I don't have that and it's never been an issue. Like I kind of see why they didn't do that.
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.200]  But I just assume it wakes up based on some, but based on motion or something or based on,
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.760]  based on, I don't even know what it is. It saves some battery when you, when you lay it down,
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.320]  it doesn't move for a while or something. Right. It, cause it seems to, I still haven't even
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.320]  recharged it and I've been playing with it for two weeks or something. I don't, I don't,
[12:24.320 --> 12:30.560]  it, it definitely gets a long battery life. So it can't be sitting there emitting these waves,
[12:30.560 --> 12:37.600]  you know, until it's in use. But on the other hand too, like if it was just in your backpack though,
[12:37.600 --> 12:43.920]  moving, moving around as you walk around, I don't think it's on. I'm not quite sure when it turns on
[12:43.920 --> 12:50.240]  or what that means. Or maybe like a lot of these things you'd like in the way that you're, um,
[12:50.240 --> 13:01.440]  uh, your iPhone can use the motion coprocessor to count your steps. And it's not really having
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.520]  a significantly adverse effect on the battery life of your phone compared to all the other
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.240]  things that can actually drain your phone. Maybe they put like the equivalent of like a little
[13:10.240 --> 13:16.080]  M six in the pencil and it's always, they're kind of detecting similar things. I don't know,
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.960]  but it's kind of crazy. Isn't that wild though? That it doesn't even tell you if it's on, off or
[13:20.960 --> 13:26.640]  low on charge. Yeah, it's, it's featureless. It's empty. It's just a blank, right? It's just
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.440]  an implement that you hold in your hand and use it against the glass surface and things happen.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.640]  So it is that the big downside to it is that if it is out of battery, the only way you're going
[13:38.640 --> 13:46.480]  to know that is by like having it fail on screen. Like you're going to go to use it and you're going
[13:46.480 --> 13:52.560]  to stab at the screen and it's like the, the experience of figuring out that your pencil
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.800]  is run, has run out of power is exactly the same as the experience of having a pencil that isn't
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.960]  yet paired with your iPad. I think the difference is that your iPad knows how much battery is in
[14:04.960 --> 14:10.080]  there. And if you, not only can you swipe down in, in notification center, it will, there's a
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.840]  batteries thing that will show you the iPad's battery and also the Apple pencil's battery.
[14:17.040 --> 14:22.560]  And I would imagine, I would imagine that it tells you that the iPad tells you when you need
[14:22.560 --> 14:26.560]  to charge your Apple pencil. So I just swipe down and I can see that this pencil that I'm holding
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.360]  in my hand is 26% battery, but that's the interface. It's on the iPad. It's not, you know,
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.120]  it's not in the pencil. I think I screwed myself by like, uh, I, at one point in my review process,
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.320]  I just left it plugged in and I used it a lot, the pencil, and then I plugged it in and for no
[14:44.320 --> 14:47.840]  reason, it wasn't like it was out. I just plugged it in and left it plugged in and it, so it
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.600]  obviously filled back up. And so I haven't, I haven't run it back down yet, but yet I say I
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.840]  screwed myself because I really did want to kind of see what, you know, does it give you a warning
[14:57.840 --> 15:06.400]  like that? I haven't seen it give me a warning yet, but I can see that it's at 26%. So that's
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.960]  like the one place where I can, I can tell that it's communicating beyond the actual drawing is
[15:10.960 --> 15:17.760]  that it tosses in a little battery info into the notification center. I had lunch today with
[15:17.760 --> 15:27.920]  today with, uh, uh, Lauren Brikter, uh, formerly of, uh, Twitter inventor of pull to refresh
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.000]  Tweety, et cetera, et cetera. Hadn't he hadn't seen it yet. So I brought it along and he got
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.360]  to play with it. And his first comment was, um, and it's sort of like what you said about sort
[15:37.360 --> 15:44.560]  of like this, you know, the 2001 style industrial design or, or like, I, you know, futuristic space
[15:44.560 --> 15:50.080]  aliens have made this pencil that it is absolute. It's so he said that this is such an Apple device.
[15:50.080 --> 15:56.320]  It is so beautiful, but also this is not a material that anybody has ever used to create
[15:56.320 --> 16:03.120]  a pen out of before. Like nobody's ever made a pen or pencil that is slick. Yeah. And it's not
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.840]  to say that it's slippery and I don't know that it's even a problem, but it is a sort of material
[16:07.840 --> 16:15.120]  that nobody would have ever would ever have used for this before. It's a little slippery. I guess
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.600]  it reminded me of, I mean, pencils, depending on you get a brand new pencil out of the box
[16:19.600 --> 16:24.800]  and it's got that fresh coat of enamel paint on it. Um, it's not that far off from that. I think
[16:24.800 --> 16:28.960]  the difference is that I'm used to pencils that have, um, you know, that they're, they're not
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.280]  round. They're flat. They're, they're, they're whatever hexagonal or octagonal. They've got
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.120]  the little flat surfaces that come together to make the pencil. And this is just perfectly
[16:37.120 --> 16:40.800]  smooth and perfectly round and it would roll right off your desk, except it's weighted
[16:41.360 --> 16:48.080]  so that it will stop. Right. Um, I will say this and, you know, we can, we could do a whole,
[16:48.080 --> 16:54.160]  I could do a whole two hour show just on stationary pens and pencils. Um, but a very,
[16:54.160 --> 17:02.560]  very, uh, popular style of ink pencil. I mean, talking about real, real pens here are like a,
[17:02.560 --> 17:08.720]  a pilot G what do they call them? G threes. I don't use the pilots anymore, but the jelly,
[17:08.720 --> 17:15.760]  you know, the click right here. Yeah. Um, which, and you know, I use the ones from zebra. There's
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.960]  a couple of other brands, but you know, they're, they started in Japan. Now they're very popular
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.600]  around the world, but my point is they all, all of them share a design thing, which is that down
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.480]  where you grip it, there's a like a piece of rubber. Um, which just to me seems like total
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.440]  common sense, but it's, I don't know. I'm, I'm curious what people that one of the things I'm
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.480]  curious now that the pencil is going from, okay, Apple released a new thing. It's a novelty to,
[17:42.480 --> 17:47.200]  okay, people are actually using it is what are the people who are going to use this thing for
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.840]  like hours at a time for work going to say about the ergonomics of the materials and stuff like
[17:51.840 --> 17:58.800]  that. Yeah. I'm not so sure that it's comfortable. I'm not, I'm not either, but again, I'm, I don't
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.280]  think pens in general are comfortable. I don't like handwriting once I could stop turning in
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.920]  my papers in school, handwritten and could start typing them all. I was a very happy person,
[18:07.920 --> 18:13.760]  but yeah, it struck me right away that there was no, uh, I've gotten used to the grip on the G2
[18:13.760 --> 18:20.160]  at the bottom. Um, there's no clip on it. Um, and I guess maybe that goes back to this sort
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.280]  of Apple philosophy of the, I think it's what, uh, our friend John Syracuse calls the naked
[18:25.280 --> 18:31.040]  robotic core, like make it and build the product for its essence, almost knowing that if you want
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.920]  to add something to it, people will build things to add to it. But that Apple, if Apple adds those
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.560]  things on, then you can't opt out of them. And this definitely feels like somebody's going to
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.480]  want to make a grip for it and somebody's going to want to make a clip for it and a little inkwell
[18:44.480 --> 18:48.480]  kind of thing for people to, to stash it when they're not using it. All of those things will
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.680]  be made for it. But Apple wanted to kind of get it all the way to its base. Um, and whether that's
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.560]  right or wrong, I mean, I think it depends on whether you like, uh, holding it in its base form.
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.480]  If, if, if there are a lot of people who think, no, no, I just want this and nothing more. It
[19:02.480 --> 19:08.320]  would kind of be a shame if it had other things on top of it. Yeah. Uh, I wonder, I don't, it's
[19:08.320 --> 19:11.760]  another one of those things that probably, if it's not out already, there's going to,
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.160]  there's got to be like some Kickstarters from people who are going to make replacement caps
[19:16.160 --> 19:22.800]  that the only difference is that it has a clip. Yeah. Or even, or even just some kind of
[19:22.800 --> 19:28.400]  asymmetrical nubbin so that it doesn't roll at all. Right. A little clip on clip so you can put
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.600]  it in your pocket or something I think would be a natural. And I'm sure somebody's already
[19:32.320 --> 19:39.440]  got that 3d printed and ready for Kickstarter. Yeah. It's almost like, and I feel like that's
[19:39.440 --> 19:47.840]  also sort of Apple's decision on, on the much observed point that there's nowhere to put it
[19:47.840 --> 19:54.000]  officially meaning let's just say compare and contrast with the Newton where there was an
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.040]  official place to put the stylus with the Newton. It was a socket right in the top of the Newton.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.720]  And obviously that design wouldn't work for this because the pencil is actually thicker than the,
[20:04.720 --> 20:10.560]  the iPad. Or if it isn't, it's so close that there's no way that a socket would have,
[20:10.560 --> 20:15.760]  would have worked. But they wouldn't have done that anyway. Just because I think that there's,
[20:15.760 --> 20:20.800]  that's not really their style anymore. Yeah, I'm a little surprised there isn't an optional,
[20:20.800 --> 20:24.560]  you know, something and probably they looked and just couldn't find a way to make it
[20:24.560 --> 20:28.080]  make sense. I mean, you could use the magnets and clip it to the side magnetically, but
[20:28.080 --> 20:31.440]  they're probably not strong enough to really reliably leave it there. And last thing you
[20:31.440 --> 20:36.720]  want to do is have it fall off and break on the floor. So, you know, instead it's just,
[20:36.720 --> 20:41.520]  you find another place to put it and people will figure it out. Well, and I was a little
[20:43.120 --> 20:47.200]  surprised. I mean, this goes all the way back to September because I could see, you know,
[20:47.200 --> 20:51.040]  in the hands-on area that this was the case because they had the covers for it.
[20:51.040 --> 20:55.840]  But on that day, I was a little surprised that they didn't have on the smart cover and smart
[20:55.840 --> 21:01.600]  keyboard something, you know, whether it's just a flap that you could stick it in or a magnet or
[21:01.600 --> 21:07.360]  some, you know, something on the cover that is meant for a, well, okay, you can't connect it to
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.840]  the iPad Pro itself, but if you get our cover or our keyboard, there's a little place here where
[21:11.840 --> 21:20.480]  you can put your pen, a pencil. And they didn't do that. And I guess it's because not everybody
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.560]  gets the pencil. And so then the thing where you would put the pencil would look, you know,
[21:24.560 --> 21:27.440]  if you got the cover but not the pencil, it would look like you're missing a pencil.
[21:28.320 --> 21:31.680]  Yeah, I think that's, I think that's behind a lot of these decisions is it is not,
[21:32.640 --> 21:37.600]  as much as we all talk about it and write about it, it is not an essential feature of this product.
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.920]  And so you can't build it with the assumption that everybody's going to have one.
[21:43.760 --> 21:49.680]  Exactly. All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. And it's a new sponsor.
[21:49.680 --> 21:55.360]  I'm very, very excited about this. This episode is being brought to you by Braintree. Braintree
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.560]  lets you code for easy online payments. If you're building a mobile app, and you are searching for
[22:02.560 --> 22:08.800]  a simple payment solution, check out Braintree. They have an SDK makes it easy to offer multiple
[22:08.800 --> 22:15.440]  payment types. You can start accepting PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin, even venom, which I've never
[22:15.440 --> 22:22.480]  even heard of cards, of course, and more all with a single integration, one small snippet of code,
[22:22.480 --> 22:28.160]  and you're all set up in less than 10 minutes. That's how easy they say it is to learn more.
[22:28.880 --> 22:39.120]  And you get your first $50,000 in transactions fee free, go to Braintree.com slash the talk show.
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.640]  They're there. I mean, these guys are there. They're talking points for this are hell bent
[22:44.640 --> 22:48.240]  on how easy this is to implement. Not only did they say it's only gonna take 10 minutes,
[22:48.240 --> 22:51.520]  they say if you don't even have time, if you're you're worried about how long it's going to take
[22:51.520 --> 22:56.720]  to integrate, you can sign up and call them. And they have people on the other end of the phone
[22:56.720 --> 23:03.360]  who will walk you through the integration of hooking hooking up to the SDK. SDK is for iOS,
[23:03.360 --> 23:09.840]  Android and JavaScript for doing it through the web. And seven different languages.
[23:12.160 --> 23:19.280]  Dotnet, Node JS, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, all sorts of stuff like that. Elegant code,
[23:19.280 --> 23:25.360]  clear documentation. And literally, they're saying you can integrate this into your app with 10
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.240]  lines of code in your app. So go check them out. If you're a developer looking for payments,
[23:30.240 --> 23:36.720]  braintree.com slash the talk show. 10 lines of code can't beat that.
[23:37.600 --> 23:43.280]  It's pretty good. So you had a piece, one of the reasons I wanted to have you on the show,
[23:43.280 --> 23:49.520]  and I thought it really, really echoed my thinking on this. And I kind of touched on it,
[23:49.520 --> 23:57.600]  but skipped about it is this whole issue of, okay, now with the iPad Pro, and with iOS nine,
[23:57.600 --> 24:03.120]  and where it is today, can you use your iPad? Can you use an iPad Pro for work?
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.480]  Which is sort of I think the problem is that that's not a fair question. I feel like you need
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.920]  to specify what the work is. But I thought you had a good piece that was more or less
[24:13.520 --> 24:19.840]  for some definition of work. Yes. And for your work, mostly yes. But that it's
[24:19.840 --> 24:26.480]  with 20 some years of Mac experience under your belt and all of this stuff, maybe the
[24:26.480 --> 24:34.320]  answer is still just that you don't want to. Yeah, I counted it's 26. Fall of 89 is when I
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.640]  started using the Mac. I remember, I actually remembered from your article that it was exactly
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.200]  26 because it was such an uneven number. I figured it must have been exactly right. But I didn't want
[24:43.200 --> 24:48.720]  to say that because it makes us sound old. So I just, I went with 20 some. I know 20 some.
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.480]  Well, it could be even worse, but it's probably better. Yeah, it was because it was my sophomore
[24:54.480 --> 24:58.640]  year in college and I started working at the newspaper and they were all Mac there and I had
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.800]  an Apple II. So I'd used a Mac a couple of times before, but that was the point where I stopped
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.840]  using my Apple II basically. And I did all my work on the Macs at the newspaper office, even
[25:07.840 --> 25:14.720]  my schoolwork, because I didn't want to go back. But that's a lot of history. Yeah, I think
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.800]  it's absolutely true that you can't say the iPad and iOS in general are not possible
[25:21.760 --> 25:25.920]  tools to use to do your job. I mean, yeah, they're going to be jobs where the software isn't there
[25:25.920 --> 25:29.520]  and they're very particular. This is the internet, right? So people are going to say, well, actually
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.800]  my profession, I can't do on that. It's like, I'll grant you, there are professions where you can't.
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.280]  But if you're talking about general kind of, I look at spreadsheets and I write documents and
[25:39.280 --> 25:46.720]  I answer email and the kind of businessy jobs we think of, and I'm on the web, of course the iOS
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.040]  can do that. Of course the iPad can do that. I think my realization in spending, like so many
[25:51.040 --> 25:55.920]  of us who write about these products have done over the last few days, which is use the iPad
[25:55.920 --> 26:01.360]  Pro a lot to try to do things that we don't normally do on an iPad. It became clear to me
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.360]  that it was not, the issue wasn't, could it do it? The issue was the migration thing. It's like,
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.720]  you know, for something to be worth migrating to from a place where you're really comfortable
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.840]  and you've set up, like, I've got scripts and you're like this too. I know I've got scripts,
[26:17.840 --> 26:22.240]  I've got a workflow, I've got apps, I've got everything set up. I feel like I've super
[26:22.240 --> 26:31.040]  optimized what I do on my Mac for me over the course of 26 years. And for me to switch from
[26:31.040 --> 26:34.960]  that to something new, you know, there's the hit you have to take. You have to learn new apps,
[26:34.960 --> 26:42.160]  you have to learn new automation processes. You've got to put in, invest hours and hours of time
[26:42.160 --> 26:48.640]  to get back to where you were. And that's a pretty decent calculation that you can make. You can say,
[26:48.640 --> 26:54.960]  look, even if it's as good as the Mac is today, and let's just grant it that, you might,
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.200]  that might not be worth it because there's too much effort that's going to have to go into it
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.360]  to move over there. Or when you get there, it's going to turn out that you're not quite as
[27:03.360 --> 27:10.960]  effective, you're not as fast as you were on the Mac. And so I would say that I came to the
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.040]  realization because I edit a lot of podcasts in Logic and I've had a bunch of people say, well,
[27:15.040 --> 27:20.160]  you should really try Audition from Adobe. And I have the same sort of thing, which is Audition
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.880]  might be better than Logic. I'm not sure if it is for what I do, but let's say it's arguable
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.880]  that I would be better off editing in Audition than Logic. That's not good enough. It's going
[27:28.880 --> 27:34.640]  to be a lot better because I'm going to take a huge hit when I move and have to learn a new thing.
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.360]  And sometimes it doesn't, I mean, you don't, you never want to say no to learning a new thing, but
[27:39.360 --> 27:44.640]  sometimes the math doesn't work where it's like, it's incrementally better, but I will be so far
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.040]  in the hole in terms of my learning that I'm never going to be, it's never going to pay off or it
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.440]  won't pay off for years and years. And you don't know until you try whether it's actually going to
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.200]  be better or not. So that was my realization with the iPad is that probably 90% of the things that
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.160]  I've got set up to do on my Mac, I don't use very often and I don't need to bring over. I don't need
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.640]  to list like, oh, I've got a hundred scripts in BB edit that I need to change. It's probably not
[28:08.640 --> 28:14.800]  that, but there are things that I would have to adapt to. And that I think is going to be a
[28:14.800 --> 28:21.920]  problem for everybody. Fortunately, we don't have to switch, right? I mean, I can foresee using an
[28:21.920 --> 28:28.400]  iPad when I travel now in a way that I couldn't foresee it a year or two ago, not abandoning the
[28:28.400 --> 28:34.080]  Mac entirely, but using the iPad as a substitute when I want to travel light. I could see that now,
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.520]  but that requires me to put in some time and change my workflow and some of the things that
[28:39.520 --> 28:45.360]  I do and adapt to new tools, but it's a matter of choice. And for somebody who's younger and
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.880]  who doesn't really have those ties and hasn't super, you know, automated their computer experience,
[28:52.880 --> 29:03.360]  then that barrier is completely gone. Yeah. And in a couple of ways, podcasting is a pretty fun
[29:03.360 --> 29:09.360]  example, right? Because editing podcasts, now you'd mentioned that people are saying that you should
[29:09.360 --> 29:17.760]  recommend you switch from Logic to Adobe. That's on a Mac. But you did find, there is a new iOS
[29:17.760 --> 29:24.560]  app, and so you actually edited an episode of, was it The Incomparable? Yeah. On the iPad. What's
[29:24.560 --> 29:32.000]  the name of the app? The app is called Ferrite. F-E-R-R-I-T-E. Yeah. And it's free with two in-app
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.560]  purchases. It's basically, if you want to unlock all the features, it's $20. But you can try it
[29:36.560 --> 29:41.440]  without and you can unlock half the features for $10 and then go buy the other half for $10.
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.640]  And yeah, I tried it. I actually, I tried it and I was thinking, wow, these guys who wrote this
[29:46.640 --> 29:53.120]  totally read my mind. And then later I discovered that they actually had read my site and had seen
[29:53.120 --> 29:58.320]  my own. And had been like listening to your shows and listening to your, you're like, well,
[29:59.120 --> 30:04.400]  I, you know, one of the things that would keep me from being able to work on an iPad would be,
[30:04.400 --> 30:09.440]  I need to edit podcasts. And if I wanted to edit podcasts on an iPad, I would need this,
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.280]  this, this, this. And all those features are in Ferrite, which is, it was that moment of like,
[30:13.280 --> 30:17.120]  are they reading my mind? And it turns out, no, they're actually reading what I've written.
[30:17.120 --> 30:21.120]  And they were working on it, but that was like, I think it was a good, I didn't inspire the app,
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.200]  but I think I, to be created, but I think I maybe inspired some of the feature choices that they
[30:25.200 --> 30:29.440]  made, which is awesome because that's great for me. It's really nice when somebody builds an app
[30:29.440 --> 30:34.720]  and keeps you in mind when they're doing it. But I also forgot that in June, the guy wrote to me
[30:34.720 --> 30:37.920]  and said, do you have any sample files? Cause I want to use like real world examples. And I
[30:37.920 --> 30:42.160]  sent him an episode of the incomparable that was down to the, just to the tracks. And I said,
[30:42.160 --> 30:47.600]  here it is. And I totally forgot about it. And I sat down and edited not remembering any of that.
[30:47.600 --> 30:53.680]  I edited an episode and you know, it's the thing I did this with Logic once I did this with Audition
[30:53.680 --> 30:57.520]  once before I switched to Logic, I definitely tried it where you take a run at it and you're
[30:57.520 --> 31:02.320]  like, all right, experiment. Could I use this other tool to do this thing that I do every week? That
[31:02.320 --> 31:08.640]  is, you know, mission critical that if, if I'm, if I'm 25% slower, I I'm going to not be able to
[31:08.640 --> 31:14.080]  do my job because like, literally I've got it totally wired and it needs to be fast and it
[31:14.080 --> 31:19.440]  needs to be like this, or I can't switch. And I expected to get 10 minutes in and be like, well,
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.800]  it was a nice try iPad, but this is not going to happen. And like an hour and a half later,
[31:24.800 --> 31:28.480]  which is about maybe two hours, it's the standard time it takes me to edit an episode of The
[31:28.480 --> 31:32.960]  Incomparable. I had edited the entire episode and about halfway through, I was like, oh man,
[31:32.960 --> 31:36.880]  I'm actually going to edit this whole thing right here. And it was pretty great. I mean,
[31:36.880 --> 31:41.440]  there were some issues. It was, it went a lot faster when I had the keyboard than when I was
[31:41.440 --> 31:46.320]  just doing touch, but it was pretty, it was pretty great. And some of that was the screen size and
[31:46.320 --> 31:51.040]  some of that was the power. Although I think I could probably do it on the iPad Air, but that
[31:51.040 --> 31:58.160]  was a funny moment where I realized that when I had the right tool, the iPad was great for that
[31:58.160 --> 32:06.160]  sort of thing. Yeah. I do think, I think there's a, just to step back a little bit to where we
[32:06.160 --> 32:12.080]  were five minutes ago, which was this, when did you first start using a Mac and that transition
[32:12.080 --> 32:16.640]  from using something with like a command line interface as the main interface to the computer,
[32:16.640 --> 32:21.200]  to the GUI, I do feel that we're, that this is the same type of transition.
[32:21.760 --> 32:22.800]  Absolutely.
[32:22.800 --> 32:30.960]  Except that one was, it was different in a few ways for me, at least where the difference with the
[32:31.520 --> 32:38.400]  command line to GUI transition was that it was going to replace it for everybody,
[32:38.400 --> 32:42.720]  that this is clear that for almost everything, and obviously, you know, you used to,
[32:42.720 --> 32:47.600]  Macs today still shipped with a terminal app. And I know that for, you know, the main use I
[32:47.600 --> 32:52.320]  can think of is people who do like system administration type things, just use, you know,
[32:52.320 --> 32:56.800]  terminal and SSH connection. And for good reason that there's, you know, that that's actually a
[32:56.800 --> 33:02.800]  really good remote interface to something that might be slow. And there are things that you can
[33:02.800 --> 33:09.200]  do remotely administering a faceless server that the command line is just fine for if you're an
[33:09.200 --> 33:17.440]  expert. But you know, from 99 point, some very large 10th digit, you know, nobody needs to ever
[33:17.440 --> 33:25.440]  see that. Whereas with this transition, I really do think that Steve Jobs's trucks and cars analogy
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.800]  is just an amazingly good analogy, which is that for whatever odd reason, we made everybody drive
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.760]  a truck for a long time until we finally got good enough at this and came up with ideas that were
[33:37.760 --> 33:44.320]  more like a car. But you know, just go out on a highway in any state in the country, and you're
[33:44.320 --> 33:50.160]  going to see an awful lot of people who drive pickup trucks. But it's clearly not the majority.
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.280]  And there's no reason for it. Yeah, I mean, the command line thing, what struck me about it is,
[33:55.280 --> 34:01.200]  is so many of the arguments were the same, right? It was like, well, when you start using a Mac,
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.480]  back in the day, it was, well, you can't do, I can delete every file with this name in it by just
[34:06.480 --> 34:13.360]  typing a quick command in DOS. Can you do that? I can write a program and run it. And you know,
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.000]  but you can't do that on the Mac. And totally true, right? Totally true. But the answer was,
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.240]  we had our own ways, right? We had our own nerdy things that we did that weren't those ways. And
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.240]  they were right about those. But you know, the Mac was just different. It didn't do those. But,
[34:26.240 --> 34:29.040]  and that's the same argument, right? It's like, oh, well, the iPad, it's not powerful. You can't
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.520]  do this thing you can do on the Mac. It's like, totally true. Right. You could, it was that they,
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.480]  the argument about being able to delete, to delete, like every file with the same,
[34:38.480 --> 34:44.000]  you know, extension, you know, what was the DOS command for it? Dell was like the equivalent of
[34:44.000 --> 34:52.160]  RM. RM, right. Yeah. Right. That you could do star dot star. Sure. Dell or Dell star dot TXT or
[34:52.160 --> 34:59.680]  something like that. It's such a bad argument because being in it, cause that was a command
[34:59.680 --> 35:06.480]  that was, you know, like there was no undo. It was, you know, it's like, how fast can you...
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.400]  It's a nerd argument though. It's like power. I can, I'm, you know, I can take this thing,
[35:10.400 --> 35:15.360]  right. I, my car can go 150. It's like, okay, well, good luck with that. Right. You know,
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.480]  if you're not on the Autobahn, that's probably not that practical and you might get yourself killed,
[35:20.480 --> 35:24.240]  but good, you know, good for you that your car can theoretically go that fast. But it was a
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.480]  point of pride and flexibility. And I hear the same things when people, when I read about the
[35:28.480 --> 35:35.600]  iPad and I'm not Federico Vitici, right. I don't, I'm not 99% on the iPad, but I I'm open-minded
[35:35.600 --> 35:40.640]  enough about it that I hear from people who are like, no, never because of X and Y that it
[35:40.640 --> 35:45.120]  doesn't do the Mac. And it's like, you're right. The Mac does those things and it doesn't. I'm not
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.120]  sure in the end that for the people who are going to want to use the product, those things are going
[35:49.120 --> 35:52.560]  to matter. And the fact like the fact that it doesn't do Apple script and it doesn't have,
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.680]  it doesn't have some of the automation utilities that run in the background and stuff. That's true,
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.960]  but it's got its own scripting and its own automation utilities. They're just different.
[36:00.960 --> 36:08.320]  And they'll, there are OS, iOS nerdiness is there already. It's just not the same as Mac nerdiness
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.520]  and, and that, you know, that's going to be off putting for some people. I don't know the truck
[36:13.520 --> 36:19.200]  metaphor. I see what you're saying in, in some ways, but I don't think it's going to be a matter
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.680]  of that, that the touch interface is inappropriate or that the devices aren't, aren't powerful
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.240]  enough. I'm starting to think, and that's why I mentioned 26 years of using the Mac. I'm starting
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.120]  to think that it's going to be in some ways generational. That it's, that it's like, I'm
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.160]  more comfortable using these tools and this way, and this industry is more comfortable with these
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.360]  tools that are used this way. And I'm not sure that people who are you know, your kid's age,
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.720]  my kid's age are going to feel that way. Or even people in like in their twenties or thirties,
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.920]  people who haven't invested like in their computers as a nerdy platform, but just as a,
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.920]  you know, a standard tool that they use to get things done. Because it's, you know, I do think
[37:03.920 --> 37:09.120]  that these, that the iOS devices are capable of doing this stuff. That's not the issue. It's not
[37:09.120 --> 37:13.680]  like, you know, you can't load a couch into the back of your car, but you can into a pickup truck.
[37:13.680 --> 37:17.680]  It's, it's more like, maybe like how we'll get with self-driving cars where some people are going
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.040]  to want to drive their own car and other people are going to be like, nah, I don't care. Where
[37:21.040 --> 37:24.320]  it's, it's about like, what, what's your preference and what tools are you comfortable with?
[37:24.320 --> 37:27.440]  And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I don't think anybody should feel threatened
[37:27.440 --> 37:35.120]  that I mean, Apple feels very strongly like the Mac is, is a tool and iOS is a tool and you can
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.160]  use them as you choose and for the, for the right jobs. And I think that's a good attitude to have
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.920]  that, you know, it's not either or, and you know, people shouldn't feel threatened by one or the
[37:45.920 --> 37:52.320]  other, but they do some people totally do. Right. And, and like, I heard from some of the, like,
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.840]  some of the, you know, and, and I, if you're listening, if you're one of the people who's
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.440]  emailed me and, and sort of angrily denounced Tim Cook, this was all, it started with Tim Cook
[38:01.440 --> 38:06.960]  telling the newspaper in England that he, you know, he was, he was, I don't know, maybe he's
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.120]  still in Europe. I don't know. But he was on like an extended trip in Europe. He was, you know,
[38:11.120 --> 38:16.240]  visiting a couple countries over there. And he said that for this trip, all he's all he carries
[38:16.240 --> 38:23.520]  with him was his iPhone and his iPad Pro, and presumably his watch. In fact, I somebody,
[38:23.520 --> 38:27.920]  somebody pointed out that in one of the pictures, he's clearly wearing his watch, no surprise.
[38:29.280 --> 38:33.280]  And I heard from readers who were like, that's BS, you know, maybe if you're an executive,
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.880]  and you've got a staff that travels with you that can do your work, you could do your work with it.
[38:36.880 --> 38:43.920]  But it's like, I think people underestimate a lot of people underestimate how there are a lot of
[38:43.920 --> 38:50.720]  jobs in a lot of places where you can really could just do your job with nothing but communication
[38:50.720 --> 38:58.240]  tools, really, if you can read on the device, and you can, you know, send email and do iMessage
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.000]  and slack or whatever similar type thing. If it's mostly about communicating,
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.720]  you can easily do all your work with an iPad and a phone or even just a phone.
[39:07.680 --> 39:14.720]  Yeah, and, and our audiences are, you know, they're, they're, they're more advanced than
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.600]  a lot of people. They care about this stuff, to a degree that a lot of people don't. I think that
[39:19.600 --> 39:25.040]  that I think that's all, all true. But that's why when I, I hate to be so reductive, because
[39:25.040 --> 39:27.680]  everybody's different. Everybody has different needs. And there are going to be some people,
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.400]  I talk to them, and they say, can I do X? It used to be, can I switch to the Mac from a PC?
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.640]  I have these needs. And sometimes I would just say, I don't think it's a good idea, right? Because
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.920]  sometimes it's just, it's the tools aren't there. I, I, you know, my dad was a dentist and they
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.320]  talked to other dentists would say, what about this? And I'd be like, you know, all the dentistry
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.320]  software is on Windows, so you should probably just get PCs. I wish I could help you. But,
[39:50.320 --> 39:55.040]  you know, this is probably the safest option. And the same is true with going to iOS. But
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.920]  when I look, I mean, I was talking to David Sparks the other day, and he said to me, it was funny,
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.680]  he said to me something I had been thinking in the last few days using the iPad Pro, which is,
[40:03.680 --> 40:09.760]  he said, you know, I think Word is better on iOS than it is on the Mac. And it's, I totally agree.
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.760]  I think Microsoft Office on the iPad is way better than Office is, at least for my uses and, and in
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.320]  my testing with it than it is on the Mac. It's just, it feels really good. It's really, these
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.040]  are class of the platform kind of apps. And I think, you know, there are a lot of people whose
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.080]  jobs are entirely Microsoft Office and email, and you can use Outlook for that or whatever, and the
[40:30.080 --> 40:36.480]  web. And, and that's, those are their jobs. And they're not specialized in any way. And those
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.040]  kind of jobs where you're not having to dive deep into a particular vertical, you know, platform
[40:41.040 --> 40:48.240]  thing thing. Why not do that on an iPad? I mean, whether you want to use an external keyboard or
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.960]  not, not to say that you have to, but you could.
[40:50.960 --> 40:57.200]  Yeah. So I'm going to take another break. But when we come back, and this is where my podcast
[40:57.200 --> 41:05.440]  amnesia strikes in, what I want to talk about next is I want to go right from there into, to me,
[41:05.440 --> 41:13.200]  the lack of thought that Apple or maybe not thought, but the lack of, of running code that
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.400]  lets you use the iPad with a keyboard connected. In other words, that you can't net more or less,
[41:18.400 --> 41:23.040]  why can't you navigate the whole interface with the keyboard? But first, I want to tell you about
[41:23.040 --> 41:34.480]  our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace. Squarespace is the easiest way to
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.080]  build a website. You just go there, let's say you want to have a personal website, you want to make
[41:40.080 --> 41:47.040]  a blog, or let's say you want to start a podcast, or let's say you are a business that you want to
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.400]  set up an online store, any of those things, you can do it with Squarespace. Squarespace is just
[41:52.400 --> 42:00.000]  like it's, it's like Legos for building a website. It is so easy, and they take care of everything
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.480]  that you can register your domain with them, they obviously take care of the hosting. But they've
[42:04.480 --> 42:12.960]  got these great drag and drop visual tools, templates to choose from, both in terms of
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.360]  setting up a style, like a visual style for what your site's going to look like, or just the
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.600]  templates for setting up different types of sites, like the difference between a portfolio, like if
[42:23.600 --> 42:28.640]  you're an artist, and you're setting up a portfolio site to show off all of the work that you're done,
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.440]  they have that built in as, as something that you can already start working with.
[42:33.440 --> 42:39.360]  You can already start with and just make it work. Everything looks professional, you go through
[42:39.360 --> 42:45.120]  Squarespace, you get a professionally designed website, you don't need to learn, know any sort
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.160]  of code, it is intuitive, easy to use, you don't need, it's not like you're programming a website,
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.760]  you're creating it visually. But if you do know how to code, there are hooks that you can break in,
[42:55.760 --> 43:01.120]  you can insert your own JavaScript, that sort of thing. So you can customize it if you want to.
[43:01.120 --> 43:07.840]  Huge websites, they can handle all of the traffic you're ever going to get. And it starts, they have
[43:07.840 --> 43:14.000]  plans that start at eight bucks a month. So here's what you can do, you can go there, you get a free
[43:14.000 --> 43:21.280]  trial, no credit card required, just go to squarespace.com. And when you do sign up, just
[43:21.280 --> 43:26.480]  remember this, the code is Gruber, my last name, just remember that. And if you use that, when you
[43:26.480 --> 43:32.880]  do sign up for Squarespace, you will get 10% off your first purchase when you do it. So just keep
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.120]  it in mind. Next time you need to build a website, go to Squarespace first and remember that code,
[43:37.120 --> 43:43.920]  Gruber. All right, so I want to talk about this. I touched on this in my review. And more and more,
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.080]  I think, if I continue writing about the iPad Pro, I think it's the main thing I want to write
[43:48.080 --> 43:53.280]  about. I love the pencil, but I feel like because I'm not an artist, it's not really for me to go
[43:53.280 --> 44:01.680]  into depth about it. But I do use a keyboard sometimes. And the more I think about it, the more
[44:01.680 --> 44:09.760]  it drives me crazy that this is not more deeply integrated into the iPad. And here's what I'm
[44:09.760 --> 44:16.960]  thinking. I think it comes down to, all right, when they first made the iPhone and they said,
[44:16.960 --> 44:22.640]  Steve Jobs is up on stage and he's talking about what they did. And he says, it runs OS 10. And it
[44:22.640 --> 44:27.200]  is this, you know, for years and years and years, everybody, you know, we'd had this, what if Apple
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.320]  could do a stripped down version of Mac OS that would run on a smaller device? I mean, I say Mac
[44:32.320 --> 44:38.000]  OS because I would say that the dream of a, quote unquote, stripped down Mac OS that runs on a
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.880]  handheld device, even predates Mac OS 10. And here it is, they finally done it. And it's, you know,
[44:44.880 --> 44:51.840]  it's, wow, how did they do it? And it's not by running Mac apps, right? And there's no menu bar.
[44:51.840 --> 44:58.480]  It's like they went back to ground zero and rethought the entire user interface. And there
[44:58.480 --> 45:06.640]  are certain things that carried over, like the idea that there's an app and to launch the app,
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.280]  you know, what you would double click on the Mac, you just tap it on the phone, very similar.
[45:11.280 --> 45:16.080]  Other things very different, right? Like buttons were the same, like a push button, you tap, what
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.680]  do you do with a push button? Well, the same obvious thing you do on a Mac, you know, but you
[45:19.680 --> 45:26.960]  would click on the Mac, you tap here. Other things, though, very different. I feel like with
[45:26.960 --> 45:33.680]  the iPad, and to me, especially with the iPad Pro, and when it's hooked up to a keyboard, if all you
[45:33.680 --> 45:40.080]  did was lock up some good designers, and say, here's the form factor, we've already finished
[45:40.080 --> 45:48.640]  the hardware. It's this 12 inch piece of glass with a touchscreen. And it has this incredible
[45:48.640 --> 45:54.960]  resolution. And here's the keyboard it can connect to. What does the user interface look like to this?
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.640]  Like, what is the the home screen? What's the root level like when you're just starting? I don't
[46:00.640 --> 46:08.000]  think anybody would come up with what what the iPad home screen looks like. Like, it's, it's,
[46:08.000 --> 46:15.360]  it's so clearly like when the iPhone was not the macro, you know, what we think of as Mac OS just
[46:15.360 --> 46:20.000]  shrunk down to fit on the screen with a menu bar at the top and little draggable windows. That's
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.480]  exactly what they've done with the iPad, though, they've just taken the phone interface and, and
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.520]  moved it to this new thing. And now that it's more capable, and now that it's, it really is fast
[46:29.520 --> 46:36.080]  enough to be like, treated as a Mac, I feel like it's, it's almost painful that Apple hasn't been
[46:36.080 --> 46:38.640]  more ambitious with the interface to this.
[46:38.640 --> 46:46.080]  Well, I think this goes back to, you know, this is the iPhone OS, right? It's the iPhone OS. And
[46:46.080 --> 46:51.120]  it was formulated for a very small screen. And when they took it up to the iPad, they didn't do
[46:51.120 --> 46:56.000]  a lot to change it other than to say, you know, you've got more room to spread out your interface.
[46:56.000 --> 47:01.680]  And we've gone with that. iOS 9 shows some signs, right? That they're, they're like, oh, we need to
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.560]  really address this now. But it took them, people are out there using keyboards on the, on this
[47:06.560 --> 47:12.560]  thing for years and got very little support beyond the most rudimentary, like, yes, we will support
[47:12.560 --> 47:18.640]  Bluetooth keyboards. And, and it's only with iOS 9 that they really have, have been kicked into
[47:18.640 --> 47:25.040]  gear. And so they're kind of behind in it. But you're right. It's not, it's not the interface
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.960]  that you would build for this device. It's an interface that's evolved from the original iPhone,
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.480]  essentially. And there's still parts of it that haven't evolved very much. I mean, the springboard,
[47:34.480 --> 47:41.040]  the home screen is not evolved essentially at all. And there are lots of other parts
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.040]  that on the iPad Pro, it's just sort of a stretched out version of what was on the iPad Air.
[47:45.600 --> 47:52.160]  So, you know, it's, I don't know, I've seen people suggest that they ought to make, you know, they
[47:52.160 --> 47:57.360]  ought to consider this, you know, iPad OS and that it's, that it's something that needs to be, whether
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.960]  you call it something different or not, it needs to, it needs more investment into features that
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.160]  only matter for the iPad. On one level, it's totally understandable. The iPhone is so huge
[48:08.160 --> 48:13.280]  that you want to devote so much iOS development time to features that the iPhone will use. But
[48:13.280 --> 48:21.200]  I wonder sometimes if it's a self-fulfilling prophecy a little bit that the iPad isn't growing
[48:21.200 --> 48:27.360]  because they aren't putting the work in and making it more of a product than it could be. And, you
[48:27.360 --> 48:31.920]  know, it's always the iPhone that gets the priority, it seems, except with these new features
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.480]  in iOS 9, it's felt like, you know, it really is about the iPhone and the iPad is lucky to kind of
[48:36.480 --> 48:41.520]  come along. And the iPad Pro could be a lot better if there were more features that took advantage of
[48:41.520 --> 48:46.240]  things like an external keyboard. And I'm not saying it needs a mouse and drop down menus,
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.480]  which, you know, because then it's a Mac, but more than it's got now.
[48:51.040 --> 48:57.120]  All right. I definitely think that a mouse pointer is not the right way to go. I feel like that's
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.520]  this. I'm fully on board with exactly, you know, what Apple's executives, you know, Tim Cook,
[49:03.520 --> 49:10.000]  Phil Schiller, I think even Eddie and a couple of interviews at EQ. I really, I don't think it's
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.680]  spin. I think they truly believe this. And I do too, that the Mac and iPad OS are not going to
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.640]  converge. There's not going to be any sort of point in the foreseeable future. I mean, like
[49:22.640 --> 49:29.920]  years and years out where everything is just one OS and you can touch your iMac 5K. I really think
[49:29.920 --> 49:37.280]  that it, and I think the mouse pointer interface isn't going anywhere and that's in Apple world,
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.880]  that's called the Mac and the touch interface isn't going anywhere. But there needs to be some
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.000]  kind of directional input that's not touching the screen. And I think, you know, Apple TV shows how
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.080]  that's possible. Right. And I know that it's even the old Apple TV, which just had the, with no
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.960]  swipe pad, it just had up, down, left, right. You know, you could do it. And I feel like the new one
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.200]  with the touch pad, it even shows even more how possible it is. And this focus engine that they
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.240]  have, where you have these selections and it just shows you based on the depth. I'm not saying that
[50:12.240 --> 50:16.400]  that's exactly what they could move to the iPad, because then I don't think it would work with
[50:16.400 --> 50:22.400]  touch, right? Like I think if they put the focus engine UI on the iPad for use with a keyboard with
[50:22.400 --> 50:28.400]  like the arrow keys or with a track pad, a track pad that isn't there, but if they added a
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.400]  hypothetical track pad, you could do the focus. The focus thing would definitely work. And I think
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.480]  that would be pretty useful. And then you could use the track pad to move the insertion point
[50:38.480 --> 50:43.120]  around and text editing fuse and all of that would work and be useful and not introduce a mouse
[50:43.120 --> 50:50.240]  pointer, which I think is problematic in a lot of ways. Yeah, I mean the, in some ways the track
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.720]  pads already there, right? Because if you put two fingers down on the software keyboard, you can
[50:54.720 --> 51:00.880]  move the text insertion around. And so there is a pointing device. It's not gonna, you know, it's
[51:00.880 --> 51:07.120]  not a cursor that's available everywhere, but it is there. And in that way, you know, if you're
[51:07.120 --> 51:11.680]  using an external keyboard, you lose that feature and there isn't the support. I was arguing with
[51:11.680 --> 51:17.120]  somebody on Twitter, I think you were part of that chain too, about this idea of a track pad on a
[51:17.120 --> 51:22.160]  keyboard from Apple, which I think is less likely, but I kind of feel like they might as well just
[51:22.160 --> 51:26.400]  support Bluetooth track pads because, you know, just for text insertion, because it's not as if
[51:26.400 --> 51:32.240]  it's not there. The alternative would be something like, I think there was a patent for a keyboard,
[51:32.240 --> 51:37.920]  an Apple patent for a keyboard that you could also just move your finger across and it would
[51:37.920 --> 51:42.960]  act like a track pad, which, you know, that's how the software keyboard works. So if you had a
[51:42.960 --> 51:46.320]  hardware keyboard that you could do that, that might solve it too. It's like, look, if you want
[51:46.320 --> 51:50.080]  to move the insertion point around, you just, you know, you don't push down on the keys, you just
[51:50.080 --> 51:54.560]  drag your fingers over them and we'll, you know, that that's close enough for us to figure out what
[51:54.560 --> 51:58.880]  you're doing. So maybe there's something there because that, I mean, I, it doesn't get enough
[51:58.880 --> 52:03.040]  publicity, but that's like one of the biggest breaks with the iOS interface metaphor that has
[52:03.040 --> 52:07.520]  ever been, is the idea that suddenly you've got a little cursor that you move around on screen.
[52:07.520 --> 52:12.320]  That's, that's not something that we've, we've really had on iOS before. And once, once that's
[52:12.320 --> 52:15.360]  out of the box a little bit, I mean, and I think it's great for productivity. I think it's
[52:15.360 --> 52:20.640]  fantastic on the iPad Pro. It's the easiest movement of that. I find it harder to move
[52:20.640 --> 52:24.880]  around on the iPhone and on the smaller iPads, but it's really good because you've got that space
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.400]  and it totally works. So, you know, I'd like to see more of that in more places, plus simple stuff,
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.720]  like if I do a spotlight search, I can't arrow down into one of the results.
[52:34.720 --> 52:39.680]  I, I can't help but feel that that's just, that's just coming. It has to be coming.
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.000]  Sure. I think, I think a lot of these are, are very clearly like, they're very close
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.640]  and they're, and they're just not quite there yet. Autocorrect is one, I just wrote a piece
[52:48.640 --> 52:54.080]  about this yesterday on the iPad Pro for, for Macworld where autocorrect is one where there's
[52:54.080 --> 52:58.480]  this whole autocorrect system that's been built up for the software keyboard because it's really
[52:58.480 --> 53:03.680]  important for the software keyboard. But right now there's no system level way to assign autocorrect
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.320]  on or off for hardware versus software keyboards. So every time I use a hardware keyboard, I have
[53:08.320 --> 53:13.200]  to go turn it off because it is terrible when I'm using the hardware keyboard. It, it corrects
[53:13.200 --> 53:17.200]  things that I type correctly into other things. And I type so fast that I go right over it.
[53:17.200 --> 53:22.320]  My incidence of typos goes up. I'm, I'm correcting things all the time. And it's just one of those
[53:22.320 --> 53:27.120]  things that like, that's a pretty simple thing. I don't know, again, I don't know how deep into
[53:27.120 --> 53:30.880]  the text code, maybe it would be hard to implement, but from a user perspective, it's like,
[53:30.880 --> 53:35.200]  it makes sense that my rules for my software keyboard and my hardware keyboard would be,
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.280]  would be different. And it goes to like the autocapitalization stuff. I don't know if you've
[53:39.280 --> 53:44.480]  tried this, but if you type, if you hold down the shift key a little too long, so the first two
[53:44.480 --> 53:49.440]  letters of a word are capitalized and you're like, oh, I meant that to be lowercase. You lift
[53:49.440 --> 53:53.680]  the shift key off, you backspace, and then you type the key again on the iPad. It just stays in
[53:53.680 --> 53:59.600]  capital letters because it's, because, and that's been a problem from the iPhone since the beginning,
[53:59.600 --> 54:03.920]  which is like, no, no, you toggled the shift key up. You probably want to type a capital letter
[54:03.920 --> 54:05.680]  here. And, uh, yeah.
[54:05.680 --> 54:09.760]  Right. Like Siri Kusa has spoken about this where, where when you get to know in a rich
[54:09.760 --> 54:15.040]  text editing interface, like word or text edit, where there's bold and italics and underline,
[54:15.040 --> 54:22.800]  there are implicit invisible marks effectively. And in the old days, like when we used to write
[54:22.800 --> 54:28.480]  on our Apple twos, you could see them. Show codes. Right. Show code was a classic. Uh,
[54:28.480 --> 54:37.200]  it's a, but, but in other words, if I start typing Jason and I type on all, for whatever
[54:37.200 --> 54:44.720]  stupid reason, I just want the first two letters to be bold. If I go back and delete the a that's
[54:44.720 --> 54:50.720]  bold and I type it again, it's still going to be bold until I hit command B again before I type it.
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.440]  Right. And it's, the shift key is like that on iOS. The shift key is sort of like an invisible
[54:55.440 --> 55:00.080]  marker in, in there. It's like a mode that you go into and stays on.
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.360]  Yeah. I, and it's, I mean, that's just a bug, right? I mean, it's really just a bug,
[55:05.360 --> 55:11.440]  but it stems from the fact that there's this whole, um, infrastructure of input that has
[55:11.440 --> 55:17.040]  been built up around, around the iPhone originally, and then the iPad and the external keyboard thing
[55:17.040 --> 55:21.520]  is just kind of this weird thing that's grafted on, which in the context of the time made sense.
[55:21.520 --> 55:25.920]  But when you're trying to think of this as a more of a productivity device and that,
[55:25.920 --> 55:29.920]  that a lot of people are going to be using a keyboard that Apple sells a keyboard now,
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.760]  you know, it's all stuff that just needs to be better. And I keep coming back to the iOS 9 thing.
[55:33.760 --> 55:38.960]  I feel like what the real story here is just that Apple already has gotten the religion about this,
[55:38.960 --> 55:43.600]  but they didn't really get it until iOS 9. And then before then they sort of just kept
[55:43.600 --> 55:48.720]  their hands off of it. And then since they only got that, that religion for iOS 9, they haven't
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.280]  had time to build this stuff. And I was hoping to see a little more of it in the build of iOS
[55:53.280 --> 55:59.200]  that ran on the iPad Pro. And I'm still hopeful that maybe 9.2, maybe 9.3, we'll just see this
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.920]  stuff trickling out instead of having to wait for an iOS 10. But, um, you know, that's the
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.080]  optimist in me is that I, I feel like maybe they, they, they have got it right. They've got the
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.480]  product out there. They've got that, that keyboard. And they do know that this is important to the
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.560]  iPad Pro and that they're going to prioritize more of these features to make it, to make it better.
[56:16.560 --> 56:19.920]  Trenton Larkin I think that one of the most telling
[56:19.920 --> 56:25.840]  things, and to me, it contrasts with this, this episode of the show almost, it looks like it was
[56:25.840 --> 56:32.720]  organized. I think it contrasts so poorly with the pencil, where to me, every aspect of the pencil
[56:32.720 --> 56:41.360]  seems so thoughtful. And it, but the thing is, is that the pencil is this all new thing that slips
[56:41.360 --> 56:48.880]  into the touch world established by the iPhone. I'm not misspeaking, but like the 2007 iPhone,
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.480]  in theory, would work great with the pencil. Right. And I, I, my guess is that going forward,
[56:54.480 --> 57:01.440]  all future iOS devices will be, uh, have the touch sensor that, that the iPad Pro does and will work
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.640]  with the pencil. Or at least they could. And at least all iPads, I think, I don't know, maybe not
[57:06.640 --> 57:11.520]  the phone, but I don't see why not with the phone. Yeah, I don't, why not? And it's not the iPad,
[57:11.520 --> 57:15.120]  you know, Apple pencil for iPad Pro or something like that. It's the Apple pencil, period.
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.840]  But it doesn't, it doesn't force any kind of rethinking of the interface,
[57:19.840 --> 57:26.640]  of the touch centric interface. It's all new. Whereas the keyboard is so in conflict with that.
[57:26.640 --> 57:32.560]  And not that I don't think, I think that in theory, there's a way to arrive at a, this works,
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.280]  it works just as well with the touch and the keyboard, but you know, it different ways. And
[57:37.280 --> 57:42.480]  I'll give you an example of that in a second. But the other example, and it's, it just reeks to me
[57:42.480 --> 57:49.600]  of, of the, wait a second, didn't somebody think that this is crazy? So in theory, if you have the
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.880]  hardware keyboard attached, typing should be better in every way, because it's an actual
[57:54.880 --> 58:02.720]  keyboard, right? Or at least, or if in theory, you are the world's a world class type on the iPad
[58:02.720 --> 58:09.360]  screen typist, then it should be at least as good. But in a huge way, it's worse, because when you're
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.080]  using the onscreen keyboard, you can put two fingers down and move the insertion point. And
[58:14.080 --> 58:19.120]  which, you know, you just spent three minutes praising, I'll just say ditto, it's one of the
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.040]  greatest inventions of the touchscreen era. And then if you have the hardware keyboard,
[58:23.040 --> 58:30.800]  there's no way to do that. Yeah, I find that to be absolutely crazy that it just be and again,
[58:30.800 --> 58:35.280]  whether it, you know, I'm not saying it's an easy thing to solve. It's I, you know, like you said,
[58:35.280 --> 58:40.240]  maybe it's some kind of weird patented material that turns the surface of the keyboard into a
[58:41.280 --> 58:46.080]  touchpad sensor just for going just for just for moving around. You don't have to do anything else.
[58:46.080 --> 58:52.880]  I don't know what the answer is. But boy, that's seems crazy that you get this really cool feature
[58:52.880 --> 58:56.800]  with the onscreen keyboard. And when you hook up a hardware keyboard, you completely lose it.
[58:58.640 --> 59:09.120]  So the other example, the other in this one really bothers me is for command tab. So
[59:09.120 --> 59:16.320]  the the command tab that they've added to iOS is just it looks exactly like the max command tab,
[59:17.040 --> 59:23.520]  which in and of itself not, you know, okay, it's familiar. Your apps start with they go left to
[59:23.520 --> 59:30.480]  right with left is your current most app. And then as you move to the right, you see your the apps
[59:30.480 --> 59:36.320]  you've used in whatever, you know, the order in which you've used them. So one command tab gets
[59:36.320 --> 59:40.080]  you to the one you use most recently to get you to the second most recent, etc.
[59:44.320 --> 59:50.480]  But there's the double tap the home button switcher, which provides the exact same task,
[59:50.480 --> 59:55.680]  exact same solves the exact same problem, which is I want to switch to a recently used app.
[59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.760]  But on iOS, it's completely different. It looks different. It's this 3D stacked view.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.480]  And it's even goes in a different order, starting with Mac OS nine, it goes from right to left.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:17.760]  But they had a left to right version in iOS seven and eight with the old card style interface.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.640]  To me, as a general principle, there's absolutely no reason why that shouldn't be the exact same
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.960]  interface, whether you're using command tab or using the screen and double clicking the home
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:36.320]  button. It should be the and they had it they had it right there. They had the iOS eight switcher.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.400]  And I think the only reason they switched it for iOS nine was for the iPhone six s with the force
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:50.640]  touch where you can force from the edge. And I don't think that that's I don't think that's
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.040]  worth it. I feel like maybe they should have just made it so that you instead of force touching from
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.000]  the left edge, you have to do it from the right edge so that the the order could be the same
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.160]  between the two. I don't know. But somehow, if they wanted to add the force touch switcher,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.240]  they should have done it in a way that they could use the same switcher for double tap homes go from
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.640]  the edge and definitely from command tab. The command tab switcher should be the same as the
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:22.320]  double tap the home button switcher. And it's it's it's to me a lack of thoughtfulness that
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.280]  that it's not so. Well, I mean, it is more dense to have just the icons up there and not the
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.760]  previews. And if they had it, you know, although you could have that same sort of stack of, you
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.520]  know, angled textures of what those apps were, or something I'm sure I'm sure they could unify it
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.160]  if they really wanted to. But it's funny when you think about Apple taking the approach that
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.680]  each device is its own thing. And unlike Microsoft's approach, the Mac's gonna be the
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.520]  Mac, the Mac's gonna be the Mac, and the iPad's gonna be the iPad. This is a case where when
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.400]  you've got an external keyboard attached, the iPad kind of is a Mac, sort of. It's using the Mac
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.360]  switcher instead of. And I don't know whether that's a good thing because the people depends
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.920]  on if your attitude is people who use external keyboards are fossils. They're old people who
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.120]  want the old ways. And this is providing some continuity for our users who are less comfortable
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.640]  with the new ways of text input or whether, you know, it's just a nice accessory for people who
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.720]  want to input text faster. And if it's the former, then the app switcher makes sense because it'll
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.400]  scare them less. But it's not the same metaphor as the rest of the system. It's this bizarre
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.680]  thing that kind of got imported from the Mac. Yeah, and it just, in a way, I'm glad that it's
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:43.680]  there, you know, and I'm glad that while I've been trying to use my iPad Pro as, you know, like,
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.360]  how much of my work can I do on it, you know, to try this thing out? I'm certainly glad that
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:54.080]  Command Tab works. Oh, yeah. But I think that we'll just stick a Mac style switcher in there
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.960]  is crazy, especially when iOS 8 had a switching, an app switching metaphor that would have worked
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:06.080]  perfectly with Command Tab. And I really think that that's a lot slicker. And I feel like it
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:14.400]  really, I feel like the beauty of it is, and even the new iOS 9 switcher still has the same quality
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.840]  where you can see the apps as you're switching between them. And that doesn't really translate
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.920]  well to the Mac, because Mac apps can have lots and lots of windows open, but every single iOS
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.520]  app only has one screen at a current time. And I feel like the visual aspect of that where it's
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:38.320]  like a layer of abstraction has been removed, and you actually see the apps, Safari looks like the
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:46.880]  currently showing Safari tab is so much more iOS-like. It's so much more what iOS is supposed
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.160]  to be rather than this extra layer of abstraction where Safari is represented by its home screen
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:59.360]  icon. Yeah, and I don't even want to get into that when you've got two apps running in split view,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.240]  the iOS-based switcher is even weirder because I think the split view on the right just sort of
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:13.600]  vanishes. Because would it show the split view or would it show the last time it wasn't in split
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.960]  view? And there's a lot going on and you do get the sense, you said it, and I had been thinking
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.120]  that you do get the sense that there was a long debate at Apple about the app switcher stuff and
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.000]  about productivity for keyboard people. And at some point somebody said, look, just put the Mac
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.520]  app switcher in there for the keyboard people. Just it's good enough for them. So hopefully
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:42.240]  there are people and it's just hopefully that it's just some sort of, look, we can ship this
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:51.920]  big iPad now. We're ready to do it. We have the, I think, and again, this is the sort of thing that
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.640]  even when you know people at Apple and friends and they just don't like to talk about timelines,
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:02.800]  but I think that the iPad Pro has been something that they've been thinking about ever since they
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.200]  started working on the iPad in terms of what size of these devices would we like to ship.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:16.000]  And having to make something that's this big but is weighs as little as it does, right? Because
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.840]  think about the fact that the original iPad, you know, famously now everybody says, you know,
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.480]  talking about the weight of the iPad Pro weighs almost exactly the same as the original iPad.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.760]  Well then obviously at this size back in 2010, it would have been way too heavy.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:36.000]  Yeah. Right. Because it would have been as thick and as dense as that iPad and now it's heavier.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.440]  So it took them a while to be able to make something that was this big and that would be
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.880]  tolerable weight. And it clearly, once they've gone to the retina era, they ran into these
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.720]  incredibly difficult things with the graphics to be able to drive a screen this size that's retina.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.120]  You know, they had to do the same thing with this that they did with the retina 5K iMac where they
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.200]  have their own timing controller to control the whole thing because nothing on the market could
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:10.640]  drive that many pixels. So I think that this year, I think 2015, they've shipped a big iPad
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:16.080]  the first year that they could have. That, you know, with all the engineering constraints that
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.760]  they had to work with to be able to ship something that meets their definition for,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.880]  you know, here's what we would be willing to ship as an iOS device. To make one this size,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.480]  it took until now. And because they could do it now, they're shipping it now.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.720]  Even though the software, on the software side, clearly they're not caught up to the level of,
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.760]  well, what could we do with an iPad of this size? Yeah, I think that's exactly right. That this is,
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.680]  this feels like, like I was saying, like with iOS 9 and with putting the iPad Pro into
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.040]  getting it ready for production, there was a moment of like, okay, this matters to us.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.200]  This matters to us now. And the problem was that they weren't laying the foundation before.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.920]  And you can't turn on a dime and add all those features in. And so the software is lagging
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.840]  behind. And it's a shame that it wasn't. You also feel like the iPad Air 2 was so over specced that
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:09.680]  that was almost like the pilot program for the iPad Pro a little bit. It was like, whoa,
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:15.120]  where did this thing come from? It's like, oh, I understand now. And the hardware is spectacular.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.720]  It really is a great piece of hardware. And that's why I think it is striking that we come
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.440]  back to the software kind of hasn't caught up. And it's not just like, there's the whole other
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.800]  debate about professional software in the app store and all of that, but like the iOS itself
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.720]  is kind of just, it's, it's, it's a little bit behind what the hardware can offer. And it's,
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:40.560]  it's, it's not surprising because I think they, they got a late start because it wasn't a priority
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:47.040]  until, until they decided, I wonder, you know, I really wish I would be fascinated to know the
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.440]  stories behind it. I keep, my gut feeling is also that Apple has changed its philosophy about its
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.800]  product lines, where it feels that they don't have to be as focused, that every product doesn't have
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.560]  to be for every person. And I think that evidence one of that was the existence of the iPhone 6 Plus
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.080]  where it was not the flagship. It was this oversized phone. And I think that Apple felt
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.320]  bitten by the fact that they were so maniacally focused on having one iPhone that they
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.520]  got behind in the large phone category. And Samsung showed them that people wanted that.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.120]  And I wonder if that bleeds down to the iPad a little bit too, and it gives them the freedom
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.840]  to have this product exist where it's like, look, we can have a bunch of different iPads and,
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.760]  you know, the mini was the first example of that. And then this is another example where it's like,
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.840]  look, we can have a lot of these iPads. We can't ship them all the same year because it's too much,
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.360]  but we have to ship like a couple, one or two a year. But I wonder if there's a story there
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.880]  that maybe it's just me seeing things, but I feel like there's something there about Apple
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.840]  shifting gears from sort of like, this is the iPhone, just saying we have many iPhones you
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:54.000]  can choose from. We have many iPads. Choose the one you like. And that's not where they were two,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:02.800]  three years ago, but that's where they are now. Yeah, it's a fascinating device, the iPad Pro and
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.520]  pencil and the keyboard. And there's so much to think about. But it is as interested and
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.280]  fascinated in it as I am, I think you're exactly right, is that it is the device I would recommend
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:25.360]  to the fewest people for like one of their big things. I guess the only thing, again, I think
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:33.840]  the iPhone Plus, the 6S Plus and 6 Plus are similar, but maybe even a little bit less.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.160]  I feel like the people who want the plus size phone, they know it. It's just a gut feeling.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.720]  If your gut says, I wish my phone was really big, then go ahead and get it. Whereas this is
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:51.840]  a little bit more complicated. I really don't think it's not just an issue of...
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:59.680]  Like in the old days, I think it used to be, in the PowerBook days. The only reason to get like,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:06.640]  the old, back when we used to call them iBooks, remember that? Or even the MacBook. The only reason
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:14.560]  to get one other than a MacBook Pro was, I think, about cost. If you can afford the MacBook Pro,
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.920]  you're going to want that MacBook Pro because you're not really saving much else. It wasn't
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.240]  like they were lighter or thinner. They were just slower. Now, the only time I had a MacBook was,
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.600]  there was the period where the MacBooks were smaller and the MacBook Pros were not smaller.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.880]  And that was the reason to get it was, you want a smaller laptop, we've got it. But if all other
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.600]  things are equal, then... I don't know. Do you think the iPad Pro is a little bit like the old
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.560]  17-inch MacBook? Yeah, maybe. Right? Where it's sort of like, who wants this? And the answer is,
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.640]  there are some people who really want this. But most people are probably not going to want it.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.440]  And you could do the industries. And with the iPad Pro, it'll be different industries. But you
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.240]  could say, people who do want to do video editing, this might actually be on the road. This might
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.600]  actually be great for it because it's got the big screen. And people who want to draw, graphic
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.120]  artists, and comic book artists, and colorists, and all sorts of different jobs, with the pencil
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.880]  and the giant screen, perfect. And like a thousand other niches. Plus, if you're going to get a
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:20.400]  thousand other niches, plus the power user type people who can do their whole jobs with it. And
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.040]  then over time, maybe it becomes more than that. But that's my gut feeling now, is like, yeah,
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.760]  like a Federico, I mean, he's the poster boy for it, right? But I think there are other people, and
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.360]  you know, yeah, people who just like having their iPad and realize they've got Office on there, and
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.720]  that's all they need. I think it will find lots of surprising audiences. I'm really looking forward
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.480]  to actually, in the next six months, there will probably be a lot of stories about, oh, did you
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.680]  realize the iPad Pro is actually great for X? And you'd be like, oh, that is, of course, it makes
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.920]  perfect sense. I didn't think of it at the time, but it's a perfect product for that. But you know,
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.000]  that 17-inch PowerBook was like that too. It weighed a ton. It was huge. It was ridiculous.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.880]  And the people who wanted it, it was in the price list forever because they, people just did not
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.800]  want to give up the 17-inch in certain audiences. And it wasn't really until, you know, the finally
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.400]  the 15 was so powerful and the 15 with retina and all of that, that it was no longer the cafeteria
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.560]  that my laptop was no longer relevant. I think it's maybe that's, it's probably the 17-inch
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.920]  PowerBook, or no, I guess, did they, yeah, there was a Mac. Yeah, they, the last one was still,
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.480]  was a MacBook. They definitely had Intel versions. Yeah, I think that's probably a little bit more
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.280]  niche than the iPad Pro, but I think it's along that spectrum though, that you kind of need to
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.000]  have an exceptional need to justify it. I agree. It's not as expensive compared to the other
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.720]  I think, and it is not as kind of unreasonable. It's big and some people are going to get turned
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.840]  off by its bigness, but, you know, there are other people for whom having the bigger screen,
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.160]  you know, it's just going to be, it's going to be good. It's an iPad, right? In all other ways,
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.960]  it is an iPad and it's got this big, bright, beautiful screen. And if you don't care about
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.880]  the weight and the size of it, you know, it, it does, it does what it says. It is a big iPad.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.560]  I loved, I linked to it and even said it was just my favorite observation. I'm the one person's
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.080]  observation about the iPad Pro that I was jealous of, that I didn't think it was Horace
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.640]  that Jews, that it's a desktop iPad, not desktop, meaning like it runs desktops, you know,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.680]  the desktop, it gets so overused because that's what we mean when we say Mac and windows. Right.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.960]  But he just meant literally that you put it on a desk and it's meant to be used. So much of what
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:35.920]  we do now on desktops is actually a laptop. Right. I thought that was, I thought that was so keen.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.480]  And I have to say in all my time and, you know, and again, when you're doing these things and you,
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.600]  you know, you're in an R racket and you want to write like a review of this thing, you do,
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.800]  you spend an, I spend an awful lot of time on it in the, you know, the, especially that first week
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:54.640]  where I had the review unit. And I did everything on it, even things that I knew while I was doing
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.040]  it, like, wow, in the long run, I am not going to do, I'm not going to use this to do this, but I
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.640]  was doing it just to see what it was like. And I really have to say that the stuff that I usually
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.760]  do with an iPad on a normal day, just sit there at the end of the day and just sort of, if I'm
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.800]  watching sports on TV and I'm just paying attention to Twitter on the other, you know,
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:20.400]  the quote unquote second screen and I'm on the couch, the, the big iPad pro is cumbersome.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.200]  It's hard to hold in one hand. I mean, it's, this is not like something that you couldn't foresee,
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:32.720]  but it's kind of wants to be used on a desk or like on your lap with the keyboard attached so
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:38.560]  that it's resting on it. And that's to me is different than from what most people I think do
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.800]  with, with their iPad. Yeah. Everybody's ergonomics are going to be different, but,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.520]  but it feels, it feels comfortable. Yeah. On a table, on a desk, it's totally comfortable.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:55.920]  I think sitting up, it is for me, ergonomically, it's fine. If I'm sitting upright on, in a chair
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.280]  or even on my couch in my living room, when I'm leaning back, like I'm, I'm laying on the couch,
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.560]  or I'm laying in bed and I'm like checking email in the morning or something like that.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.320]  It's kind of ridiculous. I can get used to it, but it's like, it probably doesn't fit as well there.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.120]  It probably doesn't fit as well there. And I'm not sure people really want to have two iPads,
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.040]  right? They're like their, their big iPad and their small iPad, but it almost comes across
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.880]  like that, that this is not an iPad you, you use everywhere probably. Yeah. And it does,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.080]  it does seem like in some ways, Apple is sort of optimizing for the case where you're going to,
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.120]  you're going to have a whole house full of Apple products and just pick the one that, you know,
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.560]  downstairs, you know, like that, like the daytime nighttime iPhone guy, you're going to have an
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:48.800]  upstairs iPad and a, you know, downstairs iPad, which is terrible. It's so gratuitous,
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.400]  but I do kind of feel that way. Yeah, exactly. All right. Let me take another break here and thank
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:01.760]  another one of our longtime friends of the show. The good folks at Warby Parker. Warby Parker
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:07.840]  believes that prescription eyeglasses simply should not cost $300 or more. They bypass their
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.160]  traditional channels and they sell high quality, great looking prescription eyeglasses direct to
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:20.640]  you at a fraction of the usual retail prices starting at just 95 bucks and you can go from
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.800]  there and there's, you know, you get the lenses that go darker or something like that and it costs
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.520]  a little more and the bifocals cost more. But 95 bucks is the starting price for a regular pair of
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.120]  glasses and that comes with everything. They don't upsell you on anti-reflective coatings or
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:43.440]  anti-glare. They don't make you pay more for the good polycarbonate material that the lenses are
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.760]  made out of. They all come with that by default. They even come with nice cases and a nice
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:53.680]  cleaning cloth. Just really, really great stuff. Buying eyeglasses online sounds crazy, right?
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.400]  Everybody or most people I know are really super picky about something that they're going to put
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.840]  on their face and how do you get around that? Well, you go to their website and they've got
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.400]  some really cool tools. You can use webcam or just upload a picture of yourself and you can preview
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.360]  what some of the glasses will look like on your face. They even have a tool that lets you measure
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.280]  your eyes because part of the trick about getting glasses, you want to know exactly how far apart
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.680]  your pupils are. They have a little thing where you use a credit card. It's really clever because
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.240]  every credit card is sort of a standard width. You hold a credit card up to your face and they can
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:33.920]  measure your pupils. It's funny because I got that measurement. I did it with Warby. Long story short,
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.240]  I've been to the eye doctor a lot in the last year. The measurement I got from my eye doctor,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:44.480]  exactly the same as Warby Parker's seemingly gimmick-like online thing. Really, really cool.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:51.040]  Well, the best part though is they have this try-on program. You go to their website. You
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.760]  measure your eyes. You look at all of the glasses they have on their website in the catalog. You
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.960]  pick five pairs that you like. They send them to you risk-free. They just ship them to you
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.880]  with clear non-prescription lenses like the ones you would try on in a store. You try these five
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.840]  on at home. You have five days. You just look around, see what other people think, see what
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:17.520]  the people in your family think. Pick the one you like best. You send them all back with a prepaid
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.320]  return label. It couldn't be easier to send them back, but you send them back. You go to the
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.280]  website and say, here's the one that I actually liked. Next thing you know, a couple days later,
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:33.760]  you get your eyeglasses in the mail. Could not be easier. Really, really easy way to get new glasses.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:42.160]  They've also got prescription and non-prescription sunglasses. Anything you want that's
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.440]  eyeglass-related, Warby has it. They even do this cool thing where every time they sell a
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.840]  pair of eyeglasses to someone like you, a regular customer, they give a pair of prescription glasses
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.720]  to someone in need through various vision charities that are around the world,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.720]  which is a really great thing. If you think about that, imagine being so poor or living in a country
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:11.120]  where you can't even see sharply because you can't afford or can't get access to prescription
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.920]  glasses. Well, these charities help. Warby does a one-for-one matching with them, which is really
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:22.960]  great. Here's where you go to find out more. Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show. Warby
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:32.080]  Parker slash the talk show and check them out next time you need eyeglasses. My thanks to Warby Parker.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.880]  Anything else you want to talk about this week? I have a couple of other things that are sort of maybes.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:44.320]  No, I don't have anything more on my list. I mean, iPad Pro has been at the top of mind, I think, for
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:51.040]  so many of us the last couple of weeks. There's the issue that you touched on about
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.680]  this sort of... And I feel like that everybody's been talking. I mean, this is like a perennial
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.920]  topic. But the whole idea of, is there a market for professional software for the iPad?
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:07.840]  And if so, why does it seem like it's worse than on the Mac? Just to name a price. There's
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.360]  a lot of apps that sell for 20, 25 bucks on the Mac. And there are indie developers using that
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:21.200]  20 to 25 dollars per sale to build a healthy business. And on iOS, even on iPad, it seems
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:30.400]  like it's the, you know, $5 is considered expensive and you sell an app for 10 bucks
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.160]  and nobody buys it. And it just doesn't seem like there's a market. I don't know. If you look at the
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.440]  size of the iPad market, I mean, there's this argument that because the iPhone is so big,
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.280]  that people are building for iPhone and they're not worried about the iPad. But the iPad market
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:54.240]  is, what, bigger than the Mac market on its own? Because its average selling price is way less and
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.160]  the revenue is about the same. So I'm not sure I buy... I mean, I buy the argument that the iPad Pro
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.200]  is not going to have such a huge user base that products just built for the iPad Pro are going to
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.200]  not be able to sell well. I will agree with that. But I'm not sure if it's going to be as big as
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:14.080]  well. I will agree with that. But I'm not sure I buy it when it comes to the iPad in general,
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.640]  because the iPad Air 2 is very functional and so is the iPad Mini 4. And, you know, there are
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.400]  issues with the Mac App Store. There's no doubt about it that Apple could do a better job of
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.680]  making... I mean, about the App Store in general, not the Mac App Store. There are lots of issues
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.560]  with the Mac App Store. But, you know, the idea that you can't do tryouts and you can't do paid
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.800]  upgrades and, you know, it's the same stuff we've been complaining about forever. But I'm not sure
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.800]  that I... I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm not sure I buy that it's not possible for software
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:53.840]  companies to make money building iPad software. I don't know. And I know none of these observations
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.200]  are original, but it does kind of ring some alarm bells for me that...
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.760]  Just with the iPad Pro, like, what are some of the apps that people are talking about? Well,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.960]  Adobe has the Adobe Sketch app, which is a really cool demo app for the pencil. And one of the
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.360]  reasons it's cool to demo is that Apple has been working with Adobe long, you know, more than just
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.480]  the last week or two they let Adobe in early. People are saying... And I mentioned Microsoft
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:26.640]  Office, right? They were up on stage too. Yeah, yeah. And like you said that, you know,
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.120]  you can make an argument that the Office apps are better on iPad than they are on Mac.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.520]  But those two companies, A, they're huge, and B, they've both kind of switched to this subscription
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.600]  model, right? Where you just pay Adobe for the Adobe Cloud, and you have a subscription,
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:49.760]  and then you can use all of Adobe software. Well, that's fine for Adobe, to borrow a phrase.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.600]  But how many companies can get away with that? And I don't mean get away with it that they're
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:04.960]  cheating, but that they have a rich library of apps and decades of trust with certain user bases
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.440]  that people will look at the price of that and knowing, you know, go into it with their eyes
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.960]  open and know that it's going to renew and they're going to pay this every year. And they'll say,
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:22.960]  well, that's worth it because I use Office all the time. Yeah, like I said, I think it's not easy.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.760]  And I think that Adobe and Microsoft have this advantage in that they have a subscription
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.320]  relationship with their customers. That means they have ongoing revenue from these things. And
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.560]  not everybody, you know, most companies can't offer that sort of thing. They don't have the
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:43.600]  ability. But, you know, again, I think there are plenty of things to criticize and ways that the
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:50.160]  market could be better. But, you know, there are professional level iOS apps that come out
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:56.320]  that people love and that people are charged a decent amount of money for.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:04.160]  And on top of that, I'm not sure this is any different than a lot of other difficult software
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:09.280]  environments to work in. When I went to the release notes conference, I mean,
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.080]  what I heard loud and clear from a lot of the developers there is, you know,
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.800]  focus on niche markets. Don't try to build a hit app. Focus on these niche markets that
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.240]  want your stuff. And that'll give them a reason to adopt iOS. Or they're frustrated because they're
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.480]  using tools that aren't targeted at them. And that's true on the Mac, too. But you've got big
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.240]  players. And then you've got some players that build a better mousetrap so well that they grow
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.720]  a following. And then you've got apps that are not necessarily the most exciting, but they do
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:49.680]  the job for a particular area. And I think there's nothing in the iPad market that dissuades me from
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.520]  the belief that people can still have a success making professional software on the iPad. I think
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.200]  if it's just the iPad Pro, it's more problematic. It would be advantageous if that app also ran on
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:08.800]  the iPhone, of course. But I don't know. I guess I'm not saying that it's not hard and there aren't
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.400]  issues. I just don't think it's quite as extreme as all that, that there isn't a place for good
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.160]  professional apps to make money. But it's a very different game, right? The volumes are going to be
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:25.360]  a lot less, and the price is going to be a lot higher. But I don't know. I have a hard time
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.440]  saying it's going to be a barren wasteland. But I think it could be better.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:42.400]  Yeah. And I just, I don't know. I feel like, I want to say that the iPad Pro will help, but then I try to say,
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.880]  well, how am I going to explain why I think that's so? And it more or less comes down to,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:55.360]  because it's a really cool computer. And so I don't know what the path forward is. I can't
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:03.360]  explain it, but I think it needs to happen now, right? But one example of it would be,
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.240]  and it's that app we just mentioned earlier in the show, Ferrite. Now that's the exact type of
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:15.360]  app that I'm talking about, an app that somebody could use to do serious editing of a podcast
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:23.360]  using this device. So my hope is that those guys do just as well as they would if it was a Mac app,
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.120]  and that people don't hesitate to make these $20 in-app purchases to unlock the full app.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:36.240]  I don't know, though. I just worry, though, that the consensus seems to be that people
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.640]  in large enough numbers won't do that for an iPad app.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.320]  I think some of it is about the fact that there are trials, although Ferrite gets around that by
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.360]  making the app free, and it's very limited. And I think you can even do that with the Office apps,
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:59.440]  that for really basic use, you can just use them. You don't even need an Office 365 account.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.680]  And their point is that once you use them, you're going to want to connect to their services and do
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.240]  all these other things, at which point you need an Office 365 account. I think there are ways around
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.920]  it. But I get that it's scary, and moving something like Sketch from the Mac to the iPad,
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.520]  they've said they're not going to do it because they're afraid that, for $100, that their app
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.960]  would be  nobody would pay that sight unseen. I think there's some truth to that, although I
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:33.520]  think, again, people  there are ways. There are ways. But yeah, it's very easy to say,
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.160]  look, they should radically change how they handle apps for the iPad, and they should allow
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.160]  sideloading or something like Gatekeeper, where on the Mac you can download apps from third parties,
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.720]  and depending on your security settings, you can just run them. And that is a breach in this
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:57.840]  semi-impregnable wall of the fortress of iOS and the App Store. And it would bring problems,
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:04.560]  but it would also bring some freedom and latitude that some of the professional software developers
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.640]  might like. I don't know. It's complicated, and I think it's interesting to look at it through
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.360]  the lens of what we were doing just a little while ago about the keyboard thing, which is,
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:23.200]  is this  is the iPad being allowed to be its own thing? And if we start with the iPad,
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.360]  do we come up with some different answers than we might for the iPhone? And does it need to be,
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.840]  like, no, if it's this way on the iPad, it's always this way on the iPhone? Or does it become
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  a little bit more like the Mac, and the attitude toward things like software is a little bit
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.080]  different? I don't know. And I don't know if that would solve it. I don't know if opening up,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.240]  you know, the ability to download software from the internet rather than over the App Store,
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.760]  it would be a cure-all. It might help, but I'm not sure it's enough.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.880]  Yeah. And I wonder, too, how much of it is that independent developers, whether it's, like,
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:04.560]  a small, like, two-person, you know, true indie app-making, you know, duo, you know,
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.920]  sort of like the Tapbots gang, which I know is a little bit more than two guys now, or, you know,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.520]  bigger, you know, true companies where there's, you know, maybe, like, 10 employees or something
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:24.160]  like that, but all the way up to a company as big as Apple itself that  there's the whole
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.240]  mythical man-month aspect to software development that you cannot just throw engineers at a problem.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.640]  There's, you know, at some point there's too many  when there's too many chefs in the kitchen,
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.800]  you can't cook anything. It gets bogged down by the bureaucracy of managing the team.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:47.840]  And the world keeps moving, and the industry moves, and, you know, it's not all in isolation.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:55.200]  And I just wonder how much of it is that by having  wanting to keep your iPhone app up to date and
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:01.280]  moving forward and adding features and wanting to have, maybe for some services, like something like
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:07.520]  Slack where, you know, the big  their big screen interface sort of defaults to a web view, you know,
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:14.080]  even their native Mac app is a web view, whether it's a website or a Mac app, that by the time you
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.000]  do these things at the ends, which would be like one end would be the smallest screen like the
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.360]  iPhone and the other would be the big screen, like what are you going to do when you're sitting at
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.000]  your desk, that the iPad gets lost in the middle. And maybe that's  it's the exact same reason
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:35.360]  that some of these  that we seem to bemoan a lack of professional strength apps for the iPad.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:41.920]  And, like we talked about an hour ago, that just iOS itself, that seems to have sort of  like
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.400]  they just never seem to get around to making the iPad optimized.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:52.960]  Yeah, I think there's a chicken and egg problem there a little bit. And then there's also this
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.720]  issue of getting lost in the shuffle that, of course, you prioritize the iPhone over the iPad.
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.320]  But if you do that, then you lose the iPad because it needs love too. And, you know,
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:08.560]  it's got to have some percentage of it if it's going to  if it's going to succeed. But it's
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:14.400]  the same platform as the iPhone, and so it's not as if you can send a team off to do the iPad on
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:23.200]  the side. It's all part of the larger whole. And it is  yeah, back to the chicken and egg problem,
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:29.280]  that you almost need more people saying, this is a place where I'm doing work for  in order to
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:33.440]  create a place where developers want to be. But I think there will be some developer success
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:39.040]  stories. And I think maybe in a strange way, the existence of the Microsoft and Adobe apps on there
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:44.960]  makes it a more welcome place, because that gets you a long way. Between that and all the stock
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:51.360]  Apple stuff, you can go a long way with what's already on the iPad Pro. You can go a really long
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:59.040]  way. And that might make it easier for people to start using the iPad Pro and the iPad Air to do
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.600]  even more of this stuff. And the more welcoming a place it is, then maybe the more welcoming a
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.240]  market it is for people building other software. But it's not going to be easy. There's no doubt
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.800]  about it. I'm just not sure whether there are a lot of things that can be done to make it, you know,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:19.360]  easy. I think it's going to always be hard, because business is hard. And it comes back again
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.200]  to what we've been saying, which is, what level of attention does Apple want to devote to this
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:29.200]  market and this product line? Because on one level, if you look at the numbers on their own,
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:35.520]  it is a very sizable business. And on another level, it is in the shadow of an enormous business.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.240]  And I think that's been to the detriment of the iPad all along. The existence of the iPhone is
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.400]  as great as it is for Apple. It makes it just so easy to ignore the iPad. Right. And I wrote about,
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:53.520]  I forget, Brian, somebody's article, I wrote a piece on Daring Fireball, sort of
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.600]  taking an article apart for arguing that Apple is in trouble because the iPhone is so big.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:08.880]  But I do think that it's not that Apple is actually in a danger because the iPad or iPhone
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.200]  business is so big. But I do think that there are plenty of arguments to make that it's
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:20.720]  not good overall that the iPhone is so big, but they're subtle arguments. And for example,
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:28.560]  one of them is that the iPad lacks attention. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not right. Exactly right.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.880]  The danger of having such a wildly successful business. I wrote a piece about this like a year
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.600]  ago on six colors. And it was all just about the crushing math of the iPhone, right? It's like,
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:44.560]  it's so big that it's very hard if you're a responsible manager at Apple, not to always
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.880]  choose the iPhone, right? Because every little bit you do improves, you know, if you do a thing that
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:57.360]  improves the iPhone by 1%, you've made up, you'd have to improve the iPad sales by 40% or whatever,
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.360]  I don't know, whatever the number is, but it would be, it's just an enormously different scale. And
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:07.280]  so you need the discipline to say, this business is also important and it deserves a percentage of
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:14.480]  our time. But I can tell you as the guy who worked at Mac world, that once we were part of PC world,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:20.800]  which was larger than us, it became very difficult to get people to pay attention to us because we
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.640]  were a small fraction of the business. And if you, you know, it takes some discipline to say,
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.440]  I have two businesses that I run and I need them both to succeed. And it's very easy to say,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.640]  well, where can I get the most return? It's the big business. So let's just invest in the big
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.880]  business and not worry about the small business. And sometimes I see that with the iPhone and the
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:49.920]  iPad. Yeah, it's a much more nuanced argument to be had, but I do think it's there and it clearly
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:55.040]  sort of stands out. So switching gears a little bit, there's this article, I have not written
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.640]  about it. And I didn't even read it until just before we recorded, but Fast Company had an
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:10.640]  article this week by Bruce Tognazzini, aka Tog and Don Norman of the Norman, whatever group,
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:17.040]  what's it called? And it might be the Norman group. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:25.840]  Nielsen Norman group. Yeah. And this this article broke my heart. Because I mean,
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:35.280]  were you a fan of Tog back in the day? Yeah, I guess. Tog on Design. Tog was a guy who was
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.960]  at Apple like in the 80s and really kind of spearheaded the original human interface
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:47.120]  guidelines. And Tog on Design, I don't know how I got my hands on it. Because it was sometimes it
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.520]  was hard to get those books back then. I don't know. But at some point, like in high school,
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:59.760]  I got my hands on Tog on Design. And I realized I was like, so it was, it was the sort of thing
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:05.760]  I love thinking about. But it, it, it was like, this is what I want to do with my life. Like,
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.440]  I guess at the time, I thought more I wanted to design interfaces and do that. And instead,
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.200]  I've but I was right in a way, though, I just instead of really doing much design work,
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.560]  I just think about them and comment on them. But I knew that this was the field that I wanted to
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:28.000]  to dig into. And what I remember in particular about Tog on Design, was he had this whole chapter
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:39.040]  about how they started with checkboxes. And a checkbox was on or off zero or one,
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.880]  and not very hard at all. And I think it even got into like, remember in the old Mac,
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:51.200]  it used to be filled in with an X instead of a check. Like a phantom? Oh, no, yeah, right. It
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:55.440]  was next inside the square. Yeah, right. I mean, just talking, you were talking like system six,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.840]  system seven, like before they went to color. But then the other thing, but the the the the meat of
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.680]  the chapter, though, was that they encountered there were certain scenarios where something that
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:16.320]  clearly was asking for a checkbox could have an indeterminate state. And it wasn't on or off,
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.240]  but it was like halfway. And I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.120]  he had a good example. It's the I remember the role the idea of a roll up where you've got a
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:30.080]  you've got a couple boxes that are checked underneath. And the roll up is where you can
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.960]  toggle something on and off. And some of them are checked and some of them are not. So you can't say
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.440]  that the roll up is on or off. It's in this indeterminate, some on, some off. Right. Here's
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.400]  an example. An example would be, let's say I select the name Jason and I hit command I,
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.840]  and I italicize it in the middle of a sentence where the sentence wasn't italics.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.240]  And then when I still have Jason selected or I select just the J and I go up to the menu where
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.120]  it shows me italics, the word italics in the menu would have a check next to it. Now that's not a
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.680]  check mark, a check box, but it still is a check. And it's the same problem. What do you do, though,
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:17.680]  when I select your name and the next word, where one of them is so one word is italicized and one
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.560]  is not. What do you put next to the word italic? And they were stumped by this. And then the
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.640]  solution they eventually came to and they still use is to use like a dash. So there's a check
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:35.600]  to say that it's on, but then there's a dash to show that it's sort of on. Yeah, it's complicated.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:42.000]  I did that chapter. And the fact that they, some company that, you know, and I, well,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.920]  I knew who Apple was at the time. And I knew Apple was the computer company that I was most
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.000]  interested in, but the fact that they had, they had clearly spent as much time thinking about
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.920]  this problem as in my imagination, Apple spent on problems like this, that you could just go off and
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:00.640]  have like a team of your top people spend like a week trying to figure out how to solve the problem
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.280]  of what do you use when a check mark isn't quite right. I was like, this is what I want to do.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.040]  Like, so I don't want to say he was a hero, but he was clearly somebody who like
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:15.840]  inspired me to get into this industry. This article, Fast Company, it breaks my heart.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.480]  It's so bad. I just told you to read it before the show. What did you think?
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:27.120]  Yep. Yeah. I think what I, my response was, it's just as bad as I had feared from seeing
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.960]  it linked everywhere. You know, there are a couple of things going on here. It's how Apple
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.880]  is giving design a bad name, bad name. That's the headline. That's the actual headline of the
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.800]  article. Yeah. A lot of the way it's played, and I can't tell how much of this is the writers and
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:50.640]  how much of this is the editors. They want this story to be how current Apple design is a failure.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.560]  They want this to be about the, you know, the sort of last couple of years, functional high ground,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.320]  skeuomorphism debate kind of issues have left Apple in a place where it's kind of lost it.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.720]  That's the story that they, that they want to tell. And that Fast Company design wants to tell,
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.200]  right? That's, that's, that's the story. The problem is, and this is, I saw Richard
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.760]  Karas who used to work at Apple. He, he tweeted a link to this. And my response was, I love those
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.840]  guys, but you realize they've been complaining about Apple design for like 20 years now.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.800]  And that's one of my problems with it is I think it's, well, I know it is disingenuous. I'm just
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:35.360]  not sure exactly who's being how disingenuous. It is disingenuous to suggest that this is a
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:41.600]  comment about anything Apple has done just in the last couple of years, because these guys have been
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.920]  complaining. These guys have not been at Apple since basically right when Steve Jobs came back
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.880]  and they have been complaining about Apple's bad design for a very long time. They have been
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.720]  complaining about it. They complain about the iPhone design, you know, and I don't want to say
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:02.080]  that they don't have valid complaints. Some of their complaints about usability are right. There
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.520]  are some aspects where there's the old man yells at cloud kind of thing where they're like, it's,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.200]  it's totally Apple's fault, but why is Google following them? And Microsoft is also doing
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.200]  things that aren't that great where it's like, oh, so everybody then, except you, because you
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:20.880]  know how to do this and nobody else does. And, you know, again, there's plenty to criticize here,
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.000]  but I'm not sure this is the article that, that does the best job of it because it's not new for
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.080]  them to criticize Apple design. They've been doing it a very long time. I think a lot of the things
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.600]  they criticize are not recent. They're root issues about the touchscreen interface where they don't
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.400]  like it. And there's this little veneer that I have to, I have to say, I find kind of distasteful
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.560]  where I feel like, you know, they're really mad that there aren't dropdown menus and that there's
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.120]  not the discoverability because what they did with the dropdown menus and stuff in the early Mac,
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:57.040]  that was aces. And now, you know, now these devices aren't discoverable like that. And
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:04.640]  they're right that they're not, but you know, it's, it, we've come a long way since then. And
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.240]  there were kind of different metaphors at work there and you can dislike them all you like, but
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.600]  it's very difficult to play this as being like Apple isn't, isn't a design tailspin the last
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.920]  couple of years, because if you really went back and looked at what these guys have been criticizing,
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.800]  they've been saying Apple has been in a design tailspin for like 15 years or 20.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.440]  Trenton Larkin In theory, if you had told me a few years ago
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:34.000]  that Bruce Tognazzini and Don Norman would write this article about Apple design in 2015,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:42.320]  I might've thought a few years ago, Ooh, that might be really good. And the reason why,
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.160]  and I think at a fundamental level, they have a sort of, they approach design from what I
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:55.360]  would describe as a sort of academic background and they use a sort of academic level of rigor.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:02.080]  And they, they are both famously very, very strong proponents of user testing,
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:09.040]  where you, you get real people and you study them in a very formal way. And with, you know,
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.400]  with a real procedural aspect to it and you study, you know, AB test,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.280]  all sorts of different things and measure response times and, and stuff like that.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:30.160]  And Apple, you know, the modern Apple that they're comparing to, it's not quite, I wouldn't call it
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:37.680]  cowboy, but it is definitely not academic. It is a lot more of a liberal arts style approach to
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.080]  design and that to me, there are differences and there's definitely some things, you know,
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:49.680]  I think you could, there there's on this general subject, a book could be written a wonderful,
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.720]  thoughtful book that would, you know, be worth referring to for decades to come
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:01.040]  by talking about the differences between the old Apple that was more academic in its approach to
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:08.880]  user interface design and the new Apple, which is not, and this article is not it. This article is
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:15.760]  definitely more old man yells at, at the cloud. And it really just broke my heart.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.760]  I remember, so I started at Mac user as an intern in the summer of 93. So it was like,
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.840]  right when the Newton came out and it was, it was in the Scully era. And then I got to work there
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.800]  through the, through the sort of darker, even darker times and they got darker still. And then
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.960]  jobs came back and these guys are both representatives of that kind of like first half
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:40.640]  of Apple's existence. And you're right. You know, I, I don't know how much you had, if any,
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.160]  interaction with Apple at that time, I was just a super junior editor, so I didn't have a lot of it,
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.840]  but that Apple was so unlike the Apple that Steve Jobs fashioned when he came back because it was
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:56.880]  like super, they had pie in the sky, R and D, they were super academic focused. And the problem was
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:03.040]  that they spent a whole lot of money and they had a hard time shipping products. And I'm not saying
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.960]  that these guys aren't brilliant and that they don't make some good points, but it was a different
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:17.360]  company then. And the results of when Steve Jobs came back and said, you know, we're not going to
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:21.840]  be like that anymore. We're going to be like this. They started to ship some really great products.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.800]  Now, were they compromised in ways that perhaps some of the earlier Apple products weren't? Maybe,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.240]  but those early Apple products were compromised in all sorts of other ways. So, you know, it's,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:38.720]  the academic Apple, I would say, as much as I appreciate it conceptually, I got to live through
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.680]  the, the, the latter days of it and it was bad. I mean, it was like, they did a bad job with
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:48.160]  products and they might've been thinking about it really hard, but the actual company was falling
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:52.720]  apart and the products were bad. And I, you know, I don't know, Tog was long gone, I think by then,
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.520]  but I, you know, I don't know this, this article. Yeah. There's some, there's some old manuals at
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.040]  cloud in here where it's like, why is nobody listening to us? And why are all the touchscreen
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.200]  interface is bad? And I don't agree that they're bad. There's some valid criticism in there. They
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:12.160]  have some very, they pick on some very specific things that are very obviously, um, problematic
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:17.120]  in the way, uh, Apple's products are designed, I think, and totally, totally valid. And then
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.560]  there's this third thing at work and that's what I can't tell it, whether it's how much of it is
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.360]  Fast Company and how much of it is the writers, which is what's the news peg for this? How do we
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:29.680]  make this relevant? And the answer is to sort of play up that Apple has suddenly gotten to this
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.120]  point. And, you know, the, these aren't the, the, the guys who cried wolf. Um, this is a,
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.960]  this is an alert about what's going on at Apple right now. And the fact is, these are the guys
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.560]  who cried wolf. These guys have been complaining about Apple design for years. Yeah. And there's
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.000]  aspects of it though, of their criticism that to me are just wrong. Like they're complaining about
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.440]  that on like the iPhone and I guess iPad, but like on iOS, that the fonts are too, too thin to read.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:02.080]  Uh, and I think that was true of the iOS seven public beta, or I guess it wasn't a public beta,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.720]  but like when I was seven was first shown two years ago at WWDC and, and they were using the,
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.880]  the really lightweight version, uh, weight of Helvetica Noya throughout the UI, including it
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:18.480]  was like the default font for the, the body of an email. I would totally agree. I think that
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:24.400]  that was too thin, but they changed that before it even shipped. Yeah. Uh, the fonts are not too
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.480]  thin and they're saying, and they kept saying that the contrast is too low. Almost all the text I
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.680]  read on my phone is black text on a white background, or even in like messages where
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.640]  you've got these colored backgrounds. I don't think it's a lack of contrast. And I think that
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:48.240]  the, uh, the font size, uh, choice for system-wide control of the font thing is really great in iOS.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.160]  I think that they're totally, I think it's, I think that what they're saying is a problem
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.840]  is actually one of the things that iOS does great. I think, and especially with the switch to, uh,
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.000]  San Francisco, I think text has done nothing but get more readable on screen. And I say that as
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.320]  somebody with less than perfect vision at this point. I think, I think, and some of what they're
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.720]  picking up on is, is some technical issues, which again, makes, makes it feel a little more dated,
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.720]  which is, uh, some apps haven't really adopted the, uh, text size, the system-wide text size
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:27.360]  format, like Google's apps last time I checked didn't, didn't do it. Right. And so, uh, my mom
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:32.160]  was using the Gmail app and she was, uh, she's got an iPhone six now, so it's scaled up and it's
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.640]  bigger and she could read it better, but she wanted to scale up the font and, but she uses
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:41.280]  the Gmail app and it does, it doesn't scale up. And, you know, that's a, that's a technical issue
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.680]  where app developers aren't adopting it. But the idea that you can set a system-wide text size,
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:51.120]  if you want it bigger or smaller is, is not a bad one. Um, yeah. Slack doesn't do it,
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.600]  which bothers me. It's like Slack's default font size is actually beneath the threshold
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.920]  of what I can comfortably read and they don't follow the system-wide setting. And I don't want
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.560]  to change my system-wide setting for Slack because I like the default system-wide setting for
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:09.600]  the system font, but I feel like if you're going to go with a custom font, which Slack has, then
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.360]  you need custom font size. And, but anyway, I'd really doubt that Norman and Tog are talking about
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:20.080]  Slack. But no, my big problem with it, with, I think the premise of the article that Apple
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.640]  is destroying design is that in the end, it's so reductive. What they're basically doing is
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:29.280]  look, there are two ways to do design. And one is you start in the user and you think about how,
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.520]  about usability and you build a design from it. And the other way is you just care about how it
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.280]  looks and you don't care about it. And Apple's doing that. And we think you should do this. And
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.240]  it's like, I think it's really unfair to say that Apple's doing that. I think Apple, I think the
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.800]  fact that Google and Microsoft are also doing it to a degree suggests that they're all struggling
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:51.120]  with how you do touch interfaces and create discoverability. I think, you know, I don't
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.800]  think Apple's like, as long as it looks pretty, the usability doesn't matter. I think it's a way
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.720]  more complicated story than that. I do think it's true that, you know, Johnny Ive has a huge amount
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:04.640]  of weight and he is a very visual designer. And so there perhaps is too much of an emphasis on that
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.760]  in a lot of the decisions Apple makes and that, that he might need a counterbalance of some sort
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.720]  that isn't there, but not to the extremes that this article seems to take it where it's the
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:19.200]  destruction of design and it's all about style over function. And I just don't, you know, I
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:24.720]  just don't, you know, I don't agree. They argue, they argue in favor of the Android system-wide
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:31.280]  back button. Yeah. Which, which if you've used it, I, I find, I haven't, you know, I haven't
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:35.680]  used it in a while. I do have a new Android phone here that I've been trying just to try to stay up
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.280]  on it. But my history with the Android back button was infuriating because you never knew where it
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:47.200]  would take you. The previous app, the previous function in this app. Or back to the home screen,
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.600]  right to the home screen, right back to the home screen. Oh, I thought I was going back to it's
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:58.400]  really bad. And, and they don't mention that iOS has added, I think a very clever system-wide
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:04.720]  feature in iOS nine, which is effectively gives you that it gives you that cross application back
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.560]  so that when you're in mail and you tap a link and you go to Safari and you just want to go back
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.160]  to where you were, which is a real problem. And iOS wasn't great at, but now actually is really
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:21.120]  pretty good at, because it, it, it both gives you like, just tap here to go back to where you were,
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:26.160]  but way better than Android. It tells you where it's going to take you. Cause it goes back to
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:33.120]  mail and the whole, the whole thing that drives sacrifices, some beauty for discoverability,
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.240]  right. Which is exactly what they say that Apple's not doing now. They do make some good
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:41.280]  points. I think, and I feel like they could have written a whole article about, uh, but it would
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.280]  have, you know, the old style would have been to also propose a solution, but they do point out
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:52.800]  that undo is better and on the Mac than on iOS because on the Mac, pretty much everything you
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.960]  can do, you can just go command Z and a whole lot of things that you could want, might want to undo.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:06.320]  You can undo an iOS undo is, is literally like a joke. Like they didn't know what to do. They knew
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:12.160]  they didn't have it. And an engineer at Apple, like as a joke said, well, we could just make it
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.440]  so that you shake the phone and undo it. And Scott Forstall was like, great, that's it. Do it.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:22.640]  And they were like, no, no, that's not really it. And he was like, no, let's do it.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:27.600]  Like actually in tech, in tech, starting with iOS eight, the, the undo is better because the, um,
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.280]  the, the smart bar or whatever they call it, the quick bar, um, has an undo icon on it. So if
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.200]  you're in text, you can at least undo it. And there are undo buttons in other places, but it's
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:41.040]  not, it's not system-wide, you know, unless you're using a keyboard, in which case you can usually
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:47.040]  command Z now and undo. But yeah, the, the bumping the phone thing was always, there's nothing worse
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.120]  than you're out in the world and you see somebody like shaking their phone like a tambourine and
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.680]  it's because they need to try and get that thing back that they just undid by mistake.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:59.680]  So it's an interesting, it is, there's an interesting argument to be made there that,
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:06.320]  you know, given the, the, the idea, the basic gist of the iOS interface, how do you implement undo?
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.280]  It's a, it's a heck of a puzzle and Apple clearly hasn't solved it yet. And I don't know what the
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:17.440]  answer is, but on the other hand, I really don't think that it's a real world problem that's set
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:23.600]  iOS back. Like what I see in the real world. And again, I just feel like they've, these guys have
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:31.040]  missed it, is I see real people who are doing more stuff with either the iPhone or even if it's like
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:36.480]  Android, which is clearly follows the iPhone's fundamental idea of what the design is like,
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.800]  that they're, they're doing more than they ever did on their old computers because they're, it's,
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:48.960]  it, it, it actually is a better design for, for most people. Right. Because of the amount
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:53.120]  of complexity that's been packed into that screen, it's actually kind of a harder challenge and
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:59.840]  people feel really comfortable using their phones. Yeah. I have one last sponsor to thank and it's
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:09.600]  our good friends at Harry's. You guys know Harry's. Harry's makes high quality shaving and personal
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:15.200]  grooming products. They just sent me, I just got a new thing. They have a facial wash. So now I've
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:21.120]  got a fancy, fancy facial wash that I can take with me in the shower. Great products like that.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.280]  You guys have heard of them before they've sponsored the show many times. But what they
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.680]  want me to tell you about right now and remind you while it's, while it's still fresh is that
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:37.920]  they are the official partner of the Movember Foundation and they are donating money and helping
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:45.040]  to raise awareness for men's health. Movember is the thing where what you do is you grow a mustache
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:51.280]  you grow a mustache for the month of November and then when people ask you, hey, are you growing a
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.440]  mustache? Then you tell them I'm doing it for Movember. It's a thing where we raise awareness
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:00.640]  for men's health issues. It's like a gimmick. You could do it while you're writing your national
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.160]  writing, National Novel Writing Month thing. That's right. Simultaneously. Yeah. Grow a mustache,
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.880]  write a novel. Well, Harry's is a big partner in this. They do all sorts of good stuff and they're
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:17.600]  raising money for this. And to top it off, the fact that they're they're raising money for a
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.960]  great cause. They make great products and it's super, super convenient where you can just get
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:29.440]  into the get into the Harry's products and then you just you never have to go buy shaving stuff
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.240]  again. You just sign up for it. You get you find out how frequently you need new blades and they
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:40.080]  just ship them to you. Really high quality stuff. Great blades. They own their own factory over in
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.880]  Germany. Great handle. Great. They're shaving creams and lotions and stuff. Everything I've
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:51.680]  ever tried from them, I really like. Amazing packaging. Really cool stuff. And the website
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:58.480]  is super easy to use. My dad was not really that good with computers. My dad saw that they are
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.040]  always sponsoring my stuff. He needs to shave. He signed up for it. He actually navigated the
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.520]  website and bought it and he called me to tell me how proud he was of it. Super, super easy.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.040]  They say you can get started in 30 seconds or less. I believe it. It's that easy. You
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.160]  just sort of go there, pick what you want, enter your name, your credit card,
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.640]  your address. Most of that stuff for most of you probably autofills and then boom,
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:25.200]  next thing you know, two days to three days later, you got a nice little Harry's kit in the mail.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.600]  Also makes a great gift. So if you want to get somebody else in your family,
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.000]  a little starter kit from Harry's for the holidays, now's the time to order.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.640]  Here's the thing. You can go there, go to Harry's.com and enter the code
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:47.760]  talk show. These guys don't have the the, it's just talk show and they will give you five bucks
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:53.600]  off your first order. So you could get started with that code talk show. You could get the
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:59.120]  starter kit for just 10 bucks. That's a razor, a couple of blades, some shaving cream. Great deal.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:06.320]  So my thanks to Harry's. Go to Harry's.com slash talk show. You've got the membership thing going
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:12.320]  at six colors. That was what I was going to mention. So yeah, I did it. I spent like a
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:18.400]  year fussing about whether I wanted to do it and the implementation actually took like an hour.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.840]  So after a year of saying, do I want to do this? Do I want to do this? I did it in an hour.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:28.960]  So how did you, how does that work? How did you, cause I, it's funny, I did memberships for Daring
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.720]  Fireball a long time ago and then I've got the card and it, you know, I really, the only thing
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:41.600]  anybody ever got out of it was a card and I kind of moved away from it and it's, well, not kind of,
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:48.080]  I totally moved away from it, but I, I spent an awful lot of time implementing it and I didn't
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:52.480]  have any features. It was, I think it's just me stubbornly trying to build everything for Daring
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:58:00.960]  Fireball myself. So what are the mechanics behind it at six colors? So yeah, so I mean,
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:07.520]  technically fortunately there is a company that has integration with Stripe, which does credit
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:14.560]  card processing called Memberful and Ben Thompson uses them for Stratechery. Federico uses them for
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:21.840]  Max Stories and I had been looking at them since sort of mid-year for, for six colors and they're
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.520]  very easy to work with. You pay them a monthly fee and they take a percentage of the credit card
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:33.200]  transaction, which includes the percentage that's going to Stripe and, and they, and you drop some,
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.480]  they've got a WordPress integration, but of course, like you, I am using movable type,
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.560]  which has no integration, but there's a JavaScript integration where you put some JavaScript in the
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:46.720]  header of the page and it basically takes all the links to Memberful and turns them into little
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:51.280]  pop-ups. And I actually got an email from somebody who said that it was the easiest e-commerce thing
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:56.480]  they'd ever seen because they never left the page. You know, you click and a little box comes up,
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.520]  the Stripe box comes up and on the back end, Memberful does all the membership. What they
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:07.840]  provide is the signup stuff and they keep track of the members and you can cancel and renew and
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.920]  update your information and all of that using their servers. And then they have integrations
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:17.200]  with other things. So there's a, the benefit, I mean, the primary reason for it is to say,
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.520]  you know, you want to support me in what I'm doing. And the more people who do that,
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:25.360]  the less freelance work I'll take. There's some freelance work I really like to do for
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.240]  various reasons, but there's a lot of it that I, in the first year of being an independent person,
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:34.880]  I've said yes to, because it's very hard to turn down money when you're starting out and you don't
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:40.080]  have a salary anymore. And some of those yeses, I would like to turn into no's and instead spend
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:45.600]  that time writing more on six colors. But so that, that's, that's the premise. But I also
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:51.120]  didn't want it to be a purely kind of karmic subscription where I didn't want to go out and
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.720]  say, hey, give me money because you'll feel good and you'll help me. I wanted to at least
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:58.800]  give something back because I felt like it was important that there be something tangible as a
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:04.320]  part of it. So, although I did think about the membership cards, like, like the one I've got for
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:10.000]  Daring Fireball, what I decided was to do, I wanted to do a newsletter. And I was thinking
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.360]  about frequency and do we want it to be weekly? Sometimes that's a bit much for people. Do I want
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:20.880]  it to be, you know, every other week? And I decided for the start, at least I want it to be monthly
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:25.280]  and I'll try to make it a little more substantial. And at that point, I'm doing a monthly release,
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.360]  I might as well call it like the six colors magazine. And that's mostly because, you know,
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:33.280]  I used to work in a magazine, Dan Morin, who writes some stuff for the site, you know, he works,
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:39.920]  he worked at a magazine too. It's not going to be like a super fancy magazine magazine, it's going
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.400]  to be a monthly, you know, a bunch of words and some pictures in a newsletter. But that's what
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:48.640]  we're going to do monthly for the subscribers and maybe throw in some extra stuff. So there'll be
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:53.520]  something that only people who pay can get. But the goal is not to like gate content on the site
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.360]  or anything like that. The site, the goal is actually to use the money from the people who
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:03.200]  are subscribers to generate a lot more stuff on the site for everybody to see. So it's a
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:07.520]  combination of karma and getting something in return. Right. And if there's a certain,
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.360]  you know, however, you're a fast typist, but there's still a limit to how many words are
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:15.920]  going to come out of your fingertips in a month and to get more of those, more of that writing
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:25.120]  on sixcolors.net and less of it spread about the, you know, various places. You can spell it with,
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.720]  you can spell the colors with a U though, but it is a dot, it is a dot com. I was really hung up
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.320]  on getting a dot com for this one. But yeah, that is, I think I would say that's the number
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.880]  one feature of the Six Colors subscription is not the newsletter, the Six Colors magazine.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:45.040]  It's that the more people subscribe, the more I can do. And honestly, also the more I can pay
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:50.480]  Dan Morin to do, and the more stuff we will do on the site instead of taking an assignment for
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.360]  something that, you know, that is not going to be on the site. It might be on a site with,
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.560]  you know, a bunch of ads on it that you don't want to see or on a subject that you don't really
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.360]  care about. We, you know, we'd like to be able to do less of that and more of Six Colors because,
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.880]  you know, it's like more of what you want to see. Yeah. And I find, and I'm sure that you feel the
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:13.840]  same way, but it's, when I went full time with Daring Fireball, it wasn't just about getting
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:22.640]  the revenue up to the level where I could call it a salary. It mattered to me that it was coming from
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.560]  multiple sources. Like I wanted it to be a stool with three or four legs. And sure, maybe one of
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:35.840]  the legs would get bigger over time. Like I get more money from say the weekly RSS sponsorships
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:42.000]  than the deck or whatever, but that, and maybe five years from now that now that would change
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:47.920]  though. And maybe if, you know, the demand for the RSS sponsorships waned, maybe the deck would get
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:54.640]  more popular or whatever, but I've just felt much better when I had four or five things that were
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.240]  all contributing to, wow, that's, I can call the, I can actually say I do this full time. Then if
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:05.920]  it was all coming from one source, because that just made me very nervous because what happened,
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:12.320]  you know, as we've seen the industry changes and things that used to be popular don't, aren't
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:20.160]  popular forever. And direct support from users is one that I feel like if it works, boy, that's one
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:26.400]  that should stay consistent as long as I keep doing good work. Right. And diversifying is
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:30.960]  definitely a part of it. I did hear from a bunch of people when I launched the site who said, I
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:34.720]  want to support you and I'm not going to sponsor your website because I have nothing to sponsor.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:37.680]  And right now that's the only, that seems to be the only way that you're being supported,
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.000]  basically saying you're ad supported. Why don't you also be reader supported? And that was
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.640]  definitely a motivator to make this happen is it wasn't just my scheme like, oh, they will pay me
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.840]  money. Haha. It was people saying, I will, I will pay you money. Let me pay you money for what you
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:56.160]  do. And so that was part of the plan. But you're right. It's also about diversity. I saw that
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:02.640]  during the, during the recession that, you know, at, at IDG, the, you know, a company that is
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:07.120]  largely run by salespeople that there's that moment when the sales go off the cliff, where
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:13.680]  suddenly the fact that you've got these hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers became a much
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.680]  greater asset than they had ever appreciated because those people were still there and they
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:22.720]  were still paying, even though all of your clients that you used to sell ads to have, have vanished
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:28.080]  because they're afraid of the recession. And I, that, that lesson stuck with me that being,
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.000]  being diversified is not a bad thing. And when I left Mac world, that was always part of my plan
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.720]  was to have like, um, uh, some money coming in. So the incomparable has sponsorships. So there's
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:41.520]  some money coming in from that and I wanted to do tech podcasting. So I, I do a couple of things at
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.240]  relay and there's money coming in from that and, and six colors. I figured, okay, if I can do a
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.000]  weekly sponsor, like you do on daring fireball, that there would be some money coming in from
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.520]  that. And then that was my plan was sort of like the three pronged attack. And in reality, um,
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:01.600]  I picked up some freelance writing work, which I hadn't planned. Um, and, uh, and then there was
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.480]  this thing kind of floating out there about the reader support. So that, that makes it that much
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.040]  more diverse and also lets me, gives me the freedom, like I said, of making some decisions
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.520]  of saying no. Cause the first year in, I felt like it was very hard for me to say no to anything
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:19.440]  because it's like, you know, you don't have a job and these people will pay you money to write an
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:23.040]  article and you could write that article. So why don't you go ahead and write that article?
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.160]  And at some point you need to be able to say, I did this with you with Mac world, right? Where
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.280]  I finally, one of these days I came to you and I said, you want to write a back page column?
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.400]  And you're like, yeah, I don't need to do that anymore. Yeah. Uh, but it was a huge
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:40.080]  deal to me when it happened though. I mean, and it was, it did come about at a time when I was,
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.600]  you know, daring fireball. I mean, it was, it, it, it's a lot more successful now than it used
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:50.080]  to be, but it was never, there was never any point where it was like, wow, all of a sudden it's,
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.800]  it's successful. It's just been like a slow steady increase. And, you know, 10 years ago,
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:00.640]  you know, getting to write a back page column for Mac world, you know, maybe once a year or so,
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:07.520]  actually was like, yeah, like we need that money. I remember very clearly, uh, you wrote a how to
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:12.800]  article for me about, uh, BB edit and you were doing daring fireball at the time, but you wrote
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:17.920]  this article. It was like a two page, three page how to article. And I remember later you said to
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:22.480]  me, I think I might've made more money from that article than I made from daring fireball. That
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:27.280]  was really, really early on. And the, and the freelance rates at Mac world were really good
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:31.920]  back then. But still, I mean, that was, that was the, in the early days and then, and then,
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.360]  you know, and then over the, over time you made more money from during fireball and there comes
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:40.320]  that point where you say, you know what, I need to say no to things and I need to focus on the
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.120]  thing I want to do that. And I have the ability to do that now because of the money that it's
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:50.720]  bringing in. And ultimately I said this in my, in my post about the six colors, uh, membership
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.880]  is, um, ultimately what I would love to do is do six colors and some podcasts
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:03.520]  as my job that w that would be like the perfect thing. And, uh, I'm not, I'm not at that point
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:07.920]  yet, but I would love, I would love to be able to get there. And the, the membership thing helps me,
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.680]  helps me move toward that. Yeah. So how's the reaction been so far?
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:19.200]  It's been good. I had a little number in my head of, um, of how many people I hoped would be done,
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:25.200]  you know, would sign up after the first sort of week. And it's within like, it got within about
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:29.760]  15 of that after the first week, which I always really happy about because I thought that was
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:35.520]  just the beginning. And, uh, I, you know, I haven't even mentioned it very many places other than
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.160]  on Twitter and on the site. So, you know, there's, there are more people who will hear about it over
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:44.560]  time. And so I hope that that number will grow. So I'm pretty happy with that initial, like week one
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:49.040]  number. I think that's, I think it's, uh, that's pretty good. I'm surprised the percentage of
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:53.840]  people who choose the annual and just pay for a year upfront is, is much larger than I thought.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:58.000]  It's about three quarters. Yeah, that's what I did. And that's beautiful because that's people
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.200]  who say, look, I'm not going to try it out for a month. I'm in, I'm in for the year. I think that,
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:07.120]  I think that's really great. So it's been going pretty well and Memberful has made it really easy.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.040]  So that's, they're not paying me to say this. In fact, I'm paying them, but that, that's made it
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:16.720]  a lot easier too, to not have to deal with a lot of the stuff that, um, I was afraid of about dealing
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:21.360]  with, uh, dealing with money. And I've only heard from two people who said, uh, what I expected,
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:27.120]  which was I pay, you know, I paid $60 a year for Macworld or $50 a year for Macworld. Why am I
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.160]  paying $60 a year for six colors? And the answer is, well, you're doing this to support me number
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.200]  one. And number two, Macworld was able to have hundreds of thousands of people pay them. And I'm
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.680]  not going to have, if I tell you what, if I have a hundred, hundreds of thousands of people paying
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:50.560]  me for a six color subscription, I'll cut the price. I guess I, I never, I got two of those
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.040]  though. So it's okay. My reaction is to laugh. And then I want to stop laughing. Cause I want to say,
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:00.400]  I, I, I never want to tell other people what to do with their money. And, and I agree,
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:05.760]  it's a very personal thing. And if that's really how you feel. Okay. But you, you know, I do feel
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:11.520]  like there's a teaching moment there about the scale of something like six colors or daring
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.320]  fireball. And I replied to both of those people. I replied to both of those people. And I had
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.240]  somebody tell me, Oh, you shouldn't don't reply to those people saying, no, I, I think it's a
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:25.040]  teachable moment to say, look, you know, this is mostly about supporting me. Um, it's not, you
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.480]  know, I, I'm not supported ad supported at the level of, of something like a Mac world, but, um,
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.560]  you know, a hundred percent of it is going into, you know, we don't have a lot of corporate over
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.120]  overstructure here and, you know, you should do it because you want more stuff on this site that
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.360]  you like. And if that makes you feel good and you want to get some benefits out of it too, then you
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.480]  should do it. And if you don't want to do it, that's fine. The site's still free. I'm not
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:53.040]  making you feel bad about it. I'm not trying to guilt people into giving me money. Um,
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.040]  please continue to read the site. The RSS feed is free. The website is free.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.880]  Keep reading the site. Right. And both people responded quite positively. And one of them
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.360]  actually said I'll pay. So, you know, that's not bad batting 500 there.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:10.080]  It makes a lot of sense. It makes me, warms my heart and makes me feel good about the state of
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.960]  humanity. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Uh, well, I, I, I knew you were talking about it and I, you know,
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:23.680]  I'm the master of having, uh, ideas to do things like with the site or to start a new site or
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:27.680]  something. And then, you know, years go by and yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Uh,
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:32.400]  so I knew you were thinking about this from a while ago when you first struck out on your own,
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:37.120]  but I, I, I think hitting it right on like right around the one year anniversary was,
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:42.960]  it somehow felt right. Yeah. Yeah. Any, anyway, I'm glad that it, uh,
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.240]  in the end, it's a bonus feature that I got a little more of a track record to do it,
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:53.600]  even though I was just hopelessly, um, you know, procrastinating and it's hard, it's hard to ask
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.320]  for money from people. It really is. And you don't know whether they're gonna, uh, you know,
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:02.400]  they're judging you at that point. So that makes it a little harder. And I got better over the
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.160]  first year at asking sponsors for money, but, uh, at asking the audience, asking the readers
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:13.360]  for money is just, this is why I'm not an ad sales. And so it, I think ultimately that's why
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.400]  it took me a year to actually do it is that I just, every time I thought about it, I'm like,
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.320]  oh man, I don't really want to do that. And I would just put it off. So I, you know,
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:28.080]  finally I got kind of spurred into it and, uh, and given a deadline and, uh, by some friends
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:32.480]  and I was like, all right, okay, I gotta, I gotta make it happen in November. So let's do it. So I
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.600]  did it. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you did. And anybody out there who's thinking about it, go check out,
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:45.760]  uh, six colors.com and you can see how to become a subscriber yourself. Um, Jason, I thank you for
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  your time. It was a good episode. Uh, anything else you want to promote? I mentioned some of
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:59.680]  these other podcasts you're on. You're on, I'm counting right here. I was going to make a 40.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:08.880]  It's too many. I'm not sure I can count that. I, I'm on four, four weekly podcasts and then
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:15.840]  others that kind of come and go with the wind, but upgrade and, and clockwise on relay and, uh,
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:21.680]  and the incomparable, those are the, those are the big three. Um, and, uh, and yet, you know,
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.480]  that new star Wars movies coming out, maybe, uh, maybe I need to talk to you about that sometime.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:30.560]  It might be a good one or is that going to be the holiday spectacular this year?
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.560]  It seems like it would be a good thing. Like now the idea, the idea is we did a holiday
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.680]  spectacular last year. We're, you know, in that nether zone where there's no news happening around
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:43.520]  the holidays. We just talked about star Wars and now we're going to have a new star Wars movie. But
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.640]  I wonder is, is it, is it fair to do it right when it's new and assume that everybody's gone to see
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.040]  it in theaters? I almost feel like with this one, it is fair. Like, come on, who's not going to go
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:13:04.000]  see this in theaters? I think so. Well, if it's that nether week, that's going to be like a week
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.840]  and a half after it came out, two weeks after it came out, that's plenty of time for the people
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.680]  who care. And the people who don't care should just not listen or they could listen and they
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.320]  don't care either way. Right. I doubt there were going to people be people who want to listen to
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.120]  many hours talking about star Wars yet have not seen a new star Wars movie two weeks later. It
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.360]  seems like that's a really small, I was going to say it's, it's pretty easy to avoid spoilers on
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:30.320]  a podcast because even if you're using a podcast player that plays auto plays the next episode,
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:34.400]  once you realize that we're talking about star Wars, it's pretty easy to pause it and wait until
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:39.600]  you go see it. So let's file it under probably that we will talk about the force awakens.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:43.760]  Yeah. I thought you were going to do a Yoda there.
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:55.280]  No. All right. I will not spoil the podcast. Do not.
