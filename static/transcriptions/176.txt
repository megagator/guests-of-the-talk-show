[00:00.000 --> 00:06.720]  Ah Craig's good to hear your voice. Yeah. Likewise. It's been a while since we talked. Yeah
[00:10.800 --> 00:16.600]  You want to this this let's let's just get it out of the way we got to talk about this Trump tech tech summit
[00:17.320 --> 00:19.320]  Because here's the thing. Oh, man
[00:20.960 --> 00:25.280]  You're gonna lead off with this I would have you know started my heart holiday party
[00:25.280 --> 00:34.360]  Here's the thing even as I'm not really shying away from writing about politics on daring fireball
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.640]  Even if I decided that if I had chosen differently and said, you know what? I'm not you know, whatever my feelings are
[00:39.640 --> 00:41.600]  I'm gonna make this a
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.180]  Politics free site even even in this there's that here's an intersection of of the Trump administration
[00:48.180 --> 00:54.540]  Administration incoming Trump administration and the stuff that I do write about that, you know, it would be criminal not to mention it
[00:54.960 --> 01:00.620]  So what happened? I don't know and for anybody had their head in the sand Trump and his buddy Peter Thiel
[01:01.100 --> 01:02.780]  put together a
[01:02.780 --> 01:04.780]  summit of
[01:04.860 --> 01:13.340]  They invited I only invited 10 people. I think there were like 14 people from Trump's immediate family and his
[01:13.340 --> 01:19.820]  All right a transition team in attendance and 10 leaders of of the US tech industry
[01:20.660 --> 01:26.020]  Who were in attendance? I think it was Tim Cook from Apple. What a primo seat
[01:26.780 --> 01:31.540]  To away from Trump, you know the seating, you know, if you'd looked at the seating chart, it was clearly very very
[01:33.020 --> 01:35.800]  Play was thought out. Yeah, I just thought out definitely
[01:35.800 --> 01:43.000]  Yeah, I mean, you don't you don't just say oh, hey, why don't you three kids sit over here, right? It's like it that it that
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.600]  Into the table was like, you know, but the kids table that you know Thanksgiving, right?
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.840]  But yeah, I mean that the thing that got me was that that picture of
[01:56.080 --> 02:02.640]  Tim Cook, right? This is just the look on his face. I mean, I I try not to read into pictures too much
[02:02.640 --> 02:05.320]  I mean you we've all done, you know, you know, you're watching a video or whatever
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.780]  And you know you paused and it's like the person's making that face which is like what the heck, you know
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.860]  Because it you know, it doesn't fit into the the story that's going on with it. Just making some funny face, right?
[02:16.280 --> 02:18.960]  but I look at that picture of Tim Cook and
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.320]  That is the expression. I think I would have if I was at that meeting
[02:24.320 --> 02:38.360]  Right, just like ashen kind of what the hell is going on here
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.240]  Somebody do you ever do watch the HBO show the Larry David show curb your enthusiasm
[02:43.880 --> 02:49.840]  Because they the show for anybody doesn't watch the show usually ends it's a very it the show is incredibly awkward
[02:49.840 --> 02:57.160]  It's about it's nothing about other than about creating awkward situations and then a typical episode ends in a horribly awkward
[02:57.520 --> 03:04.580]  Situation with a freeze-frame and then this funny music comes up. Yeah, that's all that was missing. Is that funny music?
[03:07.240 --> 03:10.200]  There's another thing too where I'm always hesitant to
[03:11.400 --> 03:13.800]  especially coming out of a political
[03:13.800 --> 03:21.960]  Election whether it's national or local there's obviously there's it it's and it's only gotten worse because I think I think because
[03:22.440 --> 03:29.200]  Our politics have gotten so much more partisan and the fact that there are so many more photographs taken because digital
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.640]  cameras if you ever watch at these press conferences that it it really almost sounds like
[03:36.200 --> 03:39.800]  Not a war zone, but it almost where where the the
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.400]  Pro photographers and the journalists have these SLRs
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.640]  Digital SLRs and they just they just hold the the shutter down and they just keep right they just keep shooting
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.380]  you know six to eight frames per second every second non-stop because the
[03:55.040 --> 04:00.620]  Cards, you know, but yeah, that's what I'm saying about, you know, it's really easy these days to cherry-pick an image
[04:00.620 --> 04:05.880]  Right to define the one where Tim Cook is making that face because you know, you've shot
[04:05.880 --> 04:09.360]  Right frames, you know, and I don't think that's the case though, right?
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.480]  And so in election ads in election ads you are both sides do it
[04:14.480 --> 04:17.000]  It's this is here's one where it's not really a partisan thing
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.920]  But they tend to find an unflattering photo of the opponent to put in the ad if it's an attack ad and a lot of times
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.680]  I think it's very obvious that you can tell that it's just one of those like
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.680]  Everybody knows it like when you're going through your family photos and you say like, you know
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.160]  Oh, you know, look at that sunset hair you guys stand right there
[04:34.160 --> 04:37.600]  I'll take a couple photos and like the middle one, you know, somebody, you know
[04:37.600 --> 04:44.160]  One of the subjects in your family just looks horrible. Just absolutely like the classic mid blink, right?
[04:44.160 --> 04:50.700]  It's like you you look like you've been smoking bongs all day because your eyes, you know halfway shut and it's like right
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.440]  Or like I like the the person was, you know
[04:54.440 --> 04:58.600]  They know that you're taking a couple of photos and they were trying to hold their eyes open for the first one and then it
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.500]  Just feels like there's something in there. So they make like a weird blink to like clear their eyes
[05:02.500 --> 05:07.020]  Hopefully before you shoot the next shutter, but in fact, it's mid shutter and they just look not so
[05:07.020 --> 05:10.600]  I don't think that's Tim Cook in this scenario. It looks to me
[05:13.740 --> 05:19.340]  That that's that that would you know, that is how I would feel in that situation I don't you know, it's like
[05:19.980 --> 05:21.980]  And it's it's you know
[05:23.020 --> 05:24.320]  Ben
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.500]  Thompson made a good thing in his a good point in his newsletter and that
[05:28.500 --> 05:35.300]  That really struck me was that Trump is saying, you know, oh we want to help you all
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.240]  well
[05:37.240 --> 05:40.760]  There's a flipside to that right? What happens if he does?
[05:41.900 --> 05:50.180]  Not want to help you, right? He's he's he's already ever the what is it last week or maybe earlier this week?
[05:50.980 --> 05:56.800]  Where he put out that tweet about canceling a Lockheed order and their stock tanked. Yep
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.800]  and
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.320]  He's got some power now and
[06:03.160 --> 06:04.840]  You don't want
[06:04.840 --> 06:05.960]  that
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.960]  power to affect your
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.400]  shareholder value the week before he
[06:10.920 --> 06:16.720]  was complaining about an Air Force one order for or Air Force order for a
[06:17.240 --> 06:21.240]  New Air Force one, you know the current the current Air Force one
[06:21.240 --> 06:27.360]  And you know if you're like a this is one of those things that I knew but I find fascinating
[06:27.360 --> 06:32.980]  I find Air Force one to be a fascinating thing. It's like a history geek and I'm you know, just someone who's a
[06:34.400 --> 06:39.440]  That's about to say I am I'm a proud American and I like certain aspects of it and Air Force one's a cool thing
[06:39.440 --> 06:44.920]  But one of the things I've always known is that Air Force one is not an airplane a single airplane
[06:44.920 --> 06:46.920]  It's actually right. I think there's two of them
[06:46.920 --> 06:53.800]  Yep, but it's Air Force one is the official designation of the one that's carrying the president
[06:53.920 --> 06:59.560]  So right like if the president and the United States is like sitting in the Oval Office. There is no Air Force one
[07:00.200 --> 07:02.840]  There are two planes that could be Air Force one
[07:02.840 --> 07:08.840]  but it becomes Air Force one when the president of the United States is on the plane and then it gets that official designation and
[07:08.840 --> 07:10.840]  That the two that they have right now
[07:10.920 --> 07:12.760]  were
[07:12.760 --> 07:18.820]  Commissioned under the Reagan administration and I believe George HW Bush was the first to fly them
[07:18.820 --> 07:20.820]  So these are these planes have been in use for
[07:21.440 --> 07:24.240]  the original George Bush Bill Clinton
[07:25.720 --> 07:27.720]  George W Bush and
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.720]  Barack Obama and they will be the the ones that Trump gets they
[07:32.480 --> 07:35.640]  The new ones that the Air Force is looking to Commission
[07:36.640 --> 07:42.280]  Would not be ready until either the very very very tail end of an eight-year Trump administration
[07:42.280 --> 07:45.600]  Which let's face it whenever, you know, if we get eight years at Trump, we ain't gonna make you know
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.240]  His successor and anyway Trump bitched about the cost of these planes and
[07:55.080 --> 07:57.080]  And Boeing's stock
[07:57.600 --> 08:03.840]  Tanked, you know not tanked it didn't recover, but he tweets and stocks move that it's a fact
[08:03.840 --> 08:08.120]  I mean like we in between the joking about it and you know, the the partisanship of it
[08:08.120 --> 08:12.740]  I mean, there's just no denial that when the president United States comes out and says he's you know
[08:12.740 --> 08:18.600]  Like to cancel the five billion dollar order for Air Force One. Yeah, that's gonna have an effect on that company
[08:18.600 --> 08:26.460]  yeah, I read the other day that that on Bloomberg now the Bloomberg terminals that that the that the market uses to keep track of
[08:26.460 --> 08:31.580]  News has Trump's tweets on it. Now. They just feed Trump's tweets into the Bloomberg terminals
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.560]  Because it's important, you know about immediately exactly it moves the economy
[08:35.560 --> 08:37.560]  It's like
[08:40.560 --> 08:42.560]  Jesus
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.680]  So
[08:44.680 --> 08:47.840]  No, I let me read from this cuz I actually wrote to Ben
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.160]  You know Ben's on the show all the time and he's a friend and I told him I thought his take was excellent
[08:52.160 --> 08:54.360]  it was I filed it under the I
[08:55.680 --> 08:57.680]  Wish I had
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.720]  Thought of it, but that exactly what you said that that the hey, I'm here to help you folks do well
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.120]  That's actually an actual quote from him. I'm here to help you folks do well, and we're gonna be there for you
[09:10.280 --> 09:16.180]  Yeah, it's it's a massive violation of economic reading from Ben's email
[09:17.040 --> 09:18.640]  Government ought to be set
[09:18.640 --> 09:23.960]  Setting and enforcing the rules of the game not actively helping one of the teams. It's a recipe
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.720]  for not just
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.400]  Corporate ocracy and the inevitable corruption that comes with it
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.560]  Parentheses, this is where I note that Trump's children attended the meeting and parentheses
[09:36.120 --> 09:44.400]  But the closing off of opportunity to the unknown companies that might challenge those large enough to be quote helped
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.760]  This should be of particular concern to the startup ecosystem and I can't say it any better than that. I think it's exactly right
[09:51.960 --> 09:53.120]  that
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.520]  It's that's you know, and again you say, you know, there's there's positives and negatives to every system of
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.200]  of government, but you know part of the gist of
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.200]  a
[10:03.200 --> 10:04.960]  democratic
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.360]  capitalist nation is that the role of government I
[10:10.760 --> 10:14.400]  Think this is you know, again this I don't think this is a partisan viewpoint
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.760]  I think it is it's just a statement of fact that kids learn in elementary school
[10:18.760 --> 10:23.980]  The role of the government is to let keep a fair level playing field. Yeah, it's all about fairness
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.800]  exactly, it's all about fairness and
[10:26.800 --> 10:28.720]  and that's
[10:28.720 --> 10:29.840]  the
[10:29.840 --> 10:32.360]  Discussion about diversity too. It's about fairness
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.960]  right, you know protecting the idea that the role of the president is to protect the ten biggest corporations in tech is
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.280]  The opposite of it because the whole point is that it's healthy for for example
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.680]  You know like in if this meeting had been held in 1981 AT&T would have been one of the would have been the probably the company
[10:50.680 --> 10:52.680]  Right. Yeah
[10:52.680 --> 10:56.960]  You know in the fact that they yeah and it goes against competition right, you know
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.560]  You look at Apple Maps is getting better because it's competing against
[11:02.440 --> 11:04.440]  Google Maps and
[11:04.760 --> 11:08.480]  Android is getting better because it's competing against the iPhone, right?
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.560]  It's a competition and having that competition be fair is what makes it work
[11:15.160 --> 11:19.400]  Right if somebody comes along and says, you know, well, hey Tim Cook, you know
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.680]  He's gay
[11:21.680 --> 11:23.960]  hmm, maybe Google's better
[11:24.960 --> 11:26.960]  right
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.840]  What did you're not competing on a fair playing field at that point
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.160]  And I think everybody in tech would have a problem with that ever. In fact, hopefully
[11:38.160 --> 11:40.380]  Everybody in the u.s. Would have a problem with that
[11:41.240 --> 11:44.080]  Yep, that's the road that we're heading down right now
[11:45.320 --> 11:47.320]  most
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.920]  Most people in tech this has been noted before this meeting that most of the industry
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Was
[11:56.240 --> 11:59.000]  You know on the side of Hillary Clinton in this election
[12:00.680 --> 12:05.800]  On for several reasons, but certainly largely on on immigration
[12:06.400 --> 12:12.720]  And on social issues like, you know gay rights and stuff like that. Yeah
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.720]  One
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.240]  Of the people though, I believe this CEO of Oracle
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.120]  What's her name? She's actually in the same picture with with yeah, she looks very happy to be there
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.720]  She's very enthusiastic in her remarks before the the meeting and
[12:33.600 --> 12:35.960]  And then after the meeting it was announced that she's joining
[12:35.960 --> 12:42.280]  His transition team in some form right and she's good. There's obviously some people there and selling databases
[12:43.840 --> 12:45.840]  But my question is
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.240]  There's a large number of people and I think it has to be addressed who
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.940]  Who think that the people like Tim Cook
[12:59.240 --> 13:00.680]  Satya Nadella
[13:00.680 --> 13:02.240]  from Microsoft
[13:02.240 --> 13:07.240]  Larry Page from Google should not have attended this meeting. They should have declined the invitation and
[13:07.920 --> 13:15.280]  on the basis that it was just dog-and-pony show and it was just a photo opportunity for Trump and his children and his
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.960]  Transition team to have these people parade in front of the media
[13:19.960 --> 13:23.980]  I mean there's a reason why the media was there and that the photographs were taken and it wasn't you know
[13:23.980 --> 13:27.280]  Certainly could have been held privately if they wanted it to it was not it was held publicly
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.280]  certainly not for the benefit of
[13:30.280 --> 13:35.680]  Those who were invited it was certain, you know only for the benefit of Trump and his transition team
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.000]  I don't see how that's disputable, right? Should they have declined the invitation?
[13:39.600 --> 13:45.240]  On the basis of of it being a form of protest against Trump and what he you know
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.200]  What he campaigned on and what he's you know, trying to do. I
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.320]  Think that they're playing a longer game here. Yes, it is a PR opportunity
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.560]  In fact, they you know, they use that PR opportunity to take a swipe at Twitter, right?
[13:57.560 --> 14:01.080]  yeah, just for the whole Crooked Hillary thing and
[14:03.200 --> 14:05.200]  Yeah, I don't think you want to
[14:06.080 --> 14:08.080]  it's it's not a matter of
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.400]  agreeing with him at this point
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.200]  I think it's pretty safe to say Oh Oracle CVEO is named saffron cats, by the way
[14:16.200 --> 14:21.940]  I want to get that out there. So before the meeting saffron cats the one who has joined his transition team
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.580]  While remaining at Oracle CEO, I should add
[14:25.580 --> 14:32.420]  Her quote was I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and will help in any way
[14:32.420 --> 14:38.500]  We can and my take on during fireball was that that sounds a lot like I'm ready to spit sign spit shine his shoes
[14:40.700 --> 14:46.940]  Because ready to help in any way we can is and and with him are pretty unequivocal
[14:46.940 --> 14:54.780]  A statements of support which I don't think are supporting and compare and contrast that and I pointed this out on during fireball. I
[14:55.460 --> 14:57.460]  think Tim Cook and
[14:58.060 --> 15:02.340]  unsurprisingly so was very very precise in his
[15:03.380 --> 15:05.380]  on the record
[15:05.980 --> 15:10.700]  Remarks, so what they did is they started the meeting by going around the table and introduced themselves and hit Tim Cook
[15:10.700 --> 15:18.140]  All he said was Tim Cook very good to be here. Not very glad very good to be here and I look very
[15:18.660 --> 15:23.420]  Forward to talking to the president-elect about the things that we can do to help you achieve
[15:24.060 --> 15:28.220]  Some things you want. Mm-hmm end of statement
[15:28.860 --> 15:36.180]  He's not raising, you know, he's not using it. He's not raising a stink. It's it's all polite on the surface
[15:36.180 --> 15:41.580]  I'm sure in the moment as it went around the table it it went on but if you think about those words precisely in particular
[15:42.020 --> 15:47.300]  the difference between we're with you and ready to help in any way we can from Oracle versus
[15:49.980 --> 15:52.020]  Help you achieve some things you want
[15:52.020 --> 15:57.220]  Like I said, they're playing a longer game here, right and they've played they've played games with the federal government before
[15:57.220 --> 16:01.300]  All right, the last year with the you know, the whole iPhone FBI thing, right? They're
[16:01.300 --> 16:05.700]  You know, they know that this is not just gonna end, you know
[16:07.540 --> 16:15.300]  Now that there are the it's inevitable now that they are the biggest we are at least for now the biggest company by market cap
[16:15.300 --> 16:18.820]  And you know, there's only a handful of companies within
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.260]  Spitting distance, you know alphabet being being I think number two
[16:23.820 --> 16:27.340]  Exxon Mobil looks like they might have a good eight years four years at least
[16:27.340 --> 16:29.340]  Mm-hmm
[16:29.860 --> 16:36.220]  But now that they're big now that they're big they're now that they're big though, they they're obviously in the crosshairs of
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.300]  Antitrust type stuff which we saw with the iBooks thing
[16:41.300 --> 16:47.860]  Which I roll my eyes at because of the whole fact that the iBook store was never the dominant seller
[16:48.020 --> 16:53.820]  They were yeah, they were at every point along the way way smaller than Amazon
[16:53.820 --> 16:57.140]  But I would almost point that as that was Amazon
[16:57.140 --> 17:02.020]  it was Amazon who played the Justice Department and it was apples like sort of
[17:03.060 --> 17:08.840]  Disinterest in uninvolvement in the that game that let them be painted in that corner
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.860]  I think that's where they started realizing that Washington is a game. Right? Right. That's
[17:14.580 --> 17:20.380]  Because it's true. It's beyond you know that what Amazon had the Justice Department's ear and I'm not saying it's
[17:20.380 --> 17:26.460]  Corrupt, I'm saying no. It was a mistake. We're we look at that situation purely from technical a technical
[17:27.060 --> 17:30.000]  Point of view right, you know, we're engineers, right?
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.540]  We we see who's making what money and what you know kind of money they're charging and you know
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.540]  how the system works and and
[17:39.820 --> 17:43.100]  That's not how Washington works at all. It's it's more
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.060]  emotions and politics and leverage and that kind of thing
[17:48.060 --> 17:55.660]  So yeah, that's in fact, that's probably what this this, you know, they went into this meeting with you know, it's like, okay
[17:56.740 --> 17:58.620]  How am I gonna?
[17:58.620 --> 18:03.340]  Survive what's going on here, right? Let's let's let's you know number one
[18:03.340 --> 18:08.500]  I mean did everybody who attended that meeting know who else was gonna be there? I don't know. So yes
[18:08.500 --> 18:11.180]  yeah, you know and it's it's
[18:11.180 --> 18:17.420]  It's interesting especially since it was such a small small and invitation list. Yeah, I found it interesting
[18:17.940 --> 18:20.820]  That you know of the invites three of them were women
[18:21.740 --> 18:24.780]  Ginny Romedy the the CEO or girl and
[18:25.380 --> 18:26.980]  Sheryl Sandberg
[18:26.980 --> 18:30.460]  All right. All right Zuckerberg did not attend Sandberg
[18:31.160 --> 18:33.160]  attended as the representative
[18:34.500 --> 18:37.820]  Which I think is I don't even think it was
[18:37.820 --> 18:39.820]  Just
[18:40.540 --> 18:44.500]  To seat a woman at the table, I think that my understanding again
[18:44.500 --> 18:48.440]  I don't follow Facebook anywhere near as closely as I do Apple or some other companies
[18:50.420 --> 18:53.780]  But I think it's representative of her role there
[18:53.780 --> 18:59.460]  I think I think it's very fair to say that she's she is to suck what cook was to Steve Jobs
[18:59.580 --> 19:05.460]  Yep, you know that more than a lot more than a typical CEO more of a partner
[19:05.460 --> 19:12.340]  I've said this many times on the show many many times, but I believe it as much now as I ever did that
[19:13.460 --> 19:14.740]  during
[19:14.740 --> 19:20.620]  Especially I would say like from the iPhone on especially like but at some point I believe
[19:21.340 --> 19:28.340]  well, maybe even before that I you know, but at some point cook clearly had jobs as trust and I really do think that if
[19:28.340 --> 19:35.260]  You described Tim Cook's day-to-day activities at Apple to somebody who didn't know the company and you said what position do you think?
[19:35.260 --> 19:41.980]  this person has that most people would say well that sounds like he's the CEO that Steve Jobs was really more like a day-to-day head of
[19:41.980 --> 19:43.980]  product and
[19:44.020 --> 19:51.460]  Tim Cook ran the company and I think Sheryl Sandberg has that same role where Zuckerberg can focus his his time entirely on
[19:51.540 --> 19:53.540]  product and she handles
[19:54.180 --> 20:00.860]  yeah, this other stuff that needs to be handled when you're as big and influential as Facebook and the advantage for those people who are
[20:00.860 --> 20:07.860]  charged with the innovation and developing the products is that they get to think about things that that are important to them and
[20:08.620 --> 20:12.080]  you know, there's a lot of stuff that about running a company that that
[20:12.900 --> 20:14.900]  People like that don't want to do right?
[20:14.900 --> 20:21.160]  So yeah, they're they're essential in that regard right that they you know that you know
[20:21.160 --> 20:23.160]  they're the ones that keep the machine running and
[20:24.860 --> 20:26.860]  You know, that's probably a more
[20:26.860 --> 20:31.740]  Appropriate person to send to a meeting with Trump then, you know somebody who's
[20:33.060 --> 20:35.540]  innovative and passionate and
[20:36.940 --> 20:40.500]  Potentially gonna say something that's damaging to the company
[20:41.300 --> 20:48.380]  This so that I I wrote this and I don't like to trot out the what if Steve Jobs were still around thing too often
[20:48.380 --> 20:50.380]  Because I think it can be so overused
[20:51.020 --> 20:53.020]  But I do
[20:53.020 --> 20:55.300]  Have been beautiful well
[20:56.660 --> 21:02.500]  I had I had an interesting discussion with on Twitter about it and I you know, I think everybody I was it was
[21:03.060 --> 21:05.220]  me and Matt grants and
[21:06.220 --> 21:11.260]  Dr. Wave from Pixar a couple other people and I think we were all in complete agreement
[21:11.940 --> 21:16.140]  That if Steve Jobs in the alternate universe were Steve Jobs, you know
[21:16.140 --> 21:18.060]  It was still healthy and it was still at Apple
[21:18.060 --> 21:24.820]  If if he were at that meeting, it would have been fascinating at least as soon as the press left the room
[21:25.780 --> 21:27.340]  and
[21:27.340 --> 21:28.660]  Then there were reports
[21:28.660 --> 21:35.940]  I will add that there were reports that that two of the attendees Cook and Musk got private meetings with Trump afterwards
[21:35.940 --> 21:42.580]  So maybe the fireworks would have happened in that meeting if Steve Jobs had a private meeting with Trump
[21:42.580 --> 21:45.340]  But there is absolutely no way I don't
[21:45.340 --> 21:52.060]  You know, damn the torpedoes. There is no way Steve Jobs was kowtowing to Trump
[21:52.060 --> 21:55.820]  No, and I don't think kowtowed either. No, I think the difference
[21:55.820 --> 22:02.400]  I think the difference though is that cook could bite his tongue and Steve Jobs couldn't I think that's what I'm saying
[22:02.500 --> 22:06.420]  That's what I'm saying about the you know, the passion that's involved with innovation, right?
[22:06.420 --> 22:12.820]  That's a much harder thing to hold it back Tim Cook, you know, he's a guy who negotiates contracts and stuff
[22:12.820 --> 22:18.140]  He knows when to shut up, but I think there's a good chance and and dr. Wave and France
[22:18.140 --> 22:21.980]  I think agreed that even in the alternate universe where Steve Jobs is still at Apple
[22:22.220 --> 22:26.300]  Cook was the one who would go to that meeting. Yeah, same way that Sheryl Sandberg exactly
[22:26.300 --> 22:28.980]  Yeah, no, no doubt in my mind that that would have me because you know
[22:29.060 --> 22:33.860]  Steve Jobs is was self-aware enough to know that yes, he had that streak and
[22:34.740 --> 22:36.740]  that streak
[22:36.740 --> 22:44.520]  Can be used for good. It can also be used for evil, right and you know, that's well
[22:46.100 --> 22:48.620]  Caution on the part of Apple and then on the other hand
[22:48.620 --> 22:53.760]  I also think it would have been a strategic way to not give Trump what he wanted
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.580]  Which is that I mean Tim Cook is a well-known. I mean, yeah, he's yeah
[22:58.580 --> 23:03.900]  Yeah, he's the biggest, you know the company he's very well known but he is nowhere near as famous as Steve Jobs
[23:03.900 --> 23:07.860]  Yeah, no way. Yeah the day before Kanye West was having a meeting with them, right?
[23:07.860 --> 23:11.860]  That's that's the level of person that he wants to be associated with right?
[23:11.860 --> 23:16.320]  It's if you paid gallop to you know, go around the country and and get a you know
[23:16.380 --> 23:21.620]  10,000 random people and ask them who Tim Cook is you I don't know what the awareness is
[23:21.980 --> 23:26.020]  It's certainly higher than most people and most CEOs
[23:26.020 --> 23:31.020]  But if you ask them who Steve Jobs is it's you know, it's practically up at like Walt Disney levels, right?
[23:31.020 --> 23:36.920]  Yeah, they could describe when it looks likes and yeah, it's it's just yeah, that's I think not
[23:37.740 --> 23:44.340]  Not sending Steve Jobs would have been a way to sort of lessen Apple's involvement in the dog-and-pony show of it
[23:44.340 --> 23:48.620]  We're sending Tim Cook doesn't really right. Yeah, it doesn't really do anything in that way
[23:48.620 --> 23:52.380]  It's a little bit of a way to give Trump the finger to write, you know, just you know
[23:52.380 --> 23:55.620]  No, we're not sending our best person. We're sending our second best person
[23:57.100 --> 23:59.100]  Bezos with Bezos was there
[23:59.100 --> 24:01.940]  The Jenny you said Jimmy Jimmy Rometty from IBM
[24:02.980 --> 24:06.580]  Larry Page to Google had two people well alphabet
[24:07.020 --> 24:08.180]  whatever
[24:08.180 --> 24:14.340]  Larry Page and what's his name Schmidt Eric Schmidt? Yeah, and Microsoft had to
[24:15.820 --> 24:18.660]  Satya Nadella and then Brad whatever his name is their
[24:19.420 --> 24:20.740]  COO
[24:20.740 --> 24:27.220]  It was weird that Microsoft got and Google got to and Apple only got one and I wonder if that was by choice if Apple
[24:27.220 --> 24:30.620]  You know had you know cook was like no, we don't need another one
[24:31.420 --> 24:32.940]  Yeah
[24:32.940 --> 24:39.260]  That's why I say I was interesting to know if you know how that list of people was chosen, right?
[24:39.260 --> 24:44.620]  It's you know, did they sort of self choose or were they asked like quickly?
[24:45.220 --> 24:49.020]  Companies companies get an invitation and they got to choose who to go or were the end of
[24:49.460 --> 24:52.660]  Invitations to people probably just to the companies. I think well
[24:52.660 --> 24:56.220]  It looks like there were a fixed number of seats around that table and that table
[24:56.220 --> 24:58.220]  kind of dictated
[24:59.260 --> 25:01.260]  How many people were gonna be there?
[25:01.420 --> 25:06.460]  So, you know, maybe that's it. Maybe that's why Jack Dorsey wasn't there. They're just you know, wasn't in another seat
[25:07.060 --> 25:11.420]  You know, you don't know I suspect not though. It's the vindictive
[25:12.180 --> 25:14.420]  Angle, well, there's two things though
[25:14.420 --> 25:19.740]  There's a cup there's a couple angles on that one the angle in favor of Dorsey being there would be that
[25:19.860 --> 25:23.600]  Trump has made more use of Twitter far more than he did Facebook
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.100]  I mean and it's I mean, I don't even think it's close. I don't know if he'd
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.680]  You know, his campaign has it the president's on on Facebook, but personally he's all Twitter
[25:33.300 --> 25:39.040]  His his Facebook feed is not on Bloomberg. His Twitter feed is on Bloomberg. That's it. That's the bottom line
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.780]  right
[25:41.980 --> 25:48.260]  But the other thing too is it does seem there's a case to be made I think Gabe Gabe Rivera made it first
[25:48.260 --> 25:52.800]  He's Gabe is the guy who runs the excellent tech meme a news aggregator
[25:52.800 --> 25:58.240]  That it seems as though the invitation list was sorted in order of market cap
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.760]  That it was it's not you know in terms of who got invited or not. It's the you know
[26:04.200 --> 26:10.040]  Six or seven biggest by market cap tech companies and by that measure Twitter isn't even close because their stock is
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.160]  Deeply depressed. I mean there it's there. They're not even in the ballpark if
[26:15.160 --> 26:22.360]  They're market cap and in their remarks in in Trump's own remarks at the meeting. He even mentioned that
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.760]  You know his way of bragging about the meeting was that he said he didn't want to talk about the he wasn't going to mention
[26:27.760 --> 26:30.720]  The hundreds of companies that called asking for a seat at this table
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.280]  And that there were ones and that Peter meaning Peter Thiel kept saying no, they're too small
[26:36.280 --> 26:42.160]  They're too small that that and small meaning market cap, I think, you know, so that was how they measured
[26:42.160 --> 26:44.160]  Alright
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.540]  So I don't by that measure Twitter had no chance yeah, so they weren't measuring by influence they were measuring by
[26:50.200 --> 26:52.360]  Money, but is that smart? I don't know
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.400]  Kind of goes back to the bin Thompson's point, right?
[26:56.400 --> 26:56.680]  You know
[26:56.680 --> 27:02.180]  It's like the smaller companies are often the ones that didn't do more interesting stuff and the stuff that affects the future
[27:02.180 --> 27:08.200]  Yeah, and that drives the economy forward over well and the government certainly shouldn't play a central role in determining that
[27:08.200 --> 27:12.720]  yeah, anyway, the other story that came out was that the Twitter did not get invited because of a
[27:14.560 --> 27:16.680]  Dispute from the summer that
[27:17.800 --> 27:20.440]  Twitter sells these things called branded emoji
[27:20.440 --> 27:26.360]  Well, they call branded emoji and we can I can go on our side grand about the use of emoji in that context in a
[27:26.360 --> 27:28.560]  moment, but the gist of it is that a
[27:28.560 --> 27:37.400]  sponsor can buy a hashtag and then when people tweet that hashtag, they automatically get a a
[27:38.160 --> 27:42.480]  Emoji or a little sticker an illustration behind it
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.960]  So for example right now if you tweet the hashtag rogue one
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.560]  You get a little death star image after the thing now
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.620]  I wasn't aware of this because I like anybody with any kind of cooth or taste. I use a third-party Twitter client
[27:59.680 --> 28:08.120]  On everywhere. Oh just about everywhere and these things are only visible in Twitter's own Twitter apps and this stupid-ass ugly Twitter website
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.040]  so I wasn't aware of this but apparently over the summer the Trump campaign wanted to buy one for
[28:13.600 --> 28:15.600]  hashtag crooked Hillary and
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.520]  Who even knows what the icon would have been? I think they said they wanted it to be a
[28:19.520 --> 28:22.400]  Bag of money flying away or something like that. I don't know
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.960]  and Twitter
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.960]  declined to accept the
[28:27.760 --> 28:35.120]  Sponsorship apparently Jack maybe Jack Dorsey himself put the the Knicks on it and that the Trump campaign hasn't forgotten it. I
[28:38.160 --> 28:43.440]  Don't think that's it though. I'm not sure that it I'm sure it didn't help because I think they are vindictive
[28:43.440 --> 28:48.880]  Petty people, but I don't really I think that the market cap angle was a bigger one. I think yeah
[28:49.840 --> 28:53.680]  Now that you mentioned that it's probably Peter Thiel had more
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.520]  Influence on who was at that table than then Trump. Yes. Oh, it's it really sounded
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.360]  It sounded like Trump's own remarks that it was really largely just
[29:04.160 --> 29:10.720]  You know, there was a list of finalists and Trump ran him by teal and teal said yes. Yes. No, no, no
[29:10.720 --> 29:17.520]  No, yes. Yes, or vice versa, right? Maybe teal had the way it sounded more like it sounded more like it was
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.040]  Teal who was given the yeses and no, I mean obviously if Trump had said I want I want Twitter it would have happened
[29:23.040 --> 29:29.520]  Yeah, as tech people we have a different view on all this, you know, it's like it's like this this Russian hacking thing, right?
[29:30.080 --> 29:32.080]  It's like, you know that to me is
[29:32.720 --> 29:36.960]  Totally, you know your first hint of that was like oh, yeah
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.720]  Cuz anybody who's run a server has seen, you know
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.480]  IP addresses from you know, the Eastern Bloc
[29:45.840 --> 29:50.400]  Pinging our servers, you know looking for you know, WP login pages
[29:51.040 --> 29:56.000]  PHP my admin, you know, it's just it's just like they're just they're looking for
[29:56.960 --> 30:00.880]  Ways into what you're doing and and you know that
[30:00.880 --> 30:06.080]  That did you see the effect? Did you see the presidential election is just
[30:07.200 --> 30:13.360]  You know, it's you know again back to the fairness argument, you know, how in the hell is that fair?
[30:13.920 --> 30:17.040]  did you see that uh among all of the
[30:17.680 --> 30:25.040]  Just like series of unfortunate events that all just happened to break the wrong way for the clinton campaign
[30:25.040 --> 30:31.760]  It was just one thing after another and it just all broke the wrong way. Um, but one of them was that when
[30:32.560 --> 30:34.960]  John, podesic got the phishing email
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.640]  And it was forwarded on to somebody like what's going on with this and the person on the staff who you know
[30:40.720 --> 30:44.500]  Evaluated it wanted to write back this this email is illegitimate
[30:45.520 --> 30:48.640]  Uh, john should change his passwords immediately
[30:48.640 --> 30:55.600]  Um, but instead wrote inadvertently. This email is legitimate. John should change his passwords immediately. And so apparently he
[30:56.480 --> 30:59.840]  Because it said that he used the link in the email to change his password
[31:01.280 --> 31:08.880]  All right, and that this person who wrote made this mistake and wrote legitimate where they wanted to write illegitimate, right?
[31:10.240 --> 31:14.320]  Yeah, it's it's a couple of letters on the keyboard that we've written
[31:14.320 --> 31:20.960]  Uh, yeah, it's is a couple of letters on the keyboard that we've all right made the mistake with
[31:21.840 --> 31:23.520]  right
[31:23.520 --> 31:28.800]  Is you know heartbroken and as apparently is apparently crushed well and and and
[31:29.600 --> 31:36.160]  You know that the flip side of it. Okay. Yeah, they they hacked the democrats. Well, do you think they hacked the republicans too?
[31:37.200 --> 31:43.360]  Uh, there's it's widely it's that's actually, you know, they haven't leaked but it's it's actually I mean this isn't speculation
[31:43.360 --> 31:49.760]  But it's actually yeah that that that to me is leverage and blackmail and all the other nasty shit. So
[31:50.640 --> 31:52.640]  You know this this, you know
[31:52.800 --> 31:54.800]  That this this is an issue
[31:55.120 --> 31:57.440]  It's clearly a non-partisan issue
[31:58.160 --> 31:59.200]  right
[31:59.200 --> 32:00.640]  Well, it should be
[32:00.640 --> 32:06.080]  Yes, it should be and and if you try to say that this is oh the democrats are just you know, sour grapes
[32:06.080 --> 32:08.080]  It's like oh, that's bullshit
[32:08.560 --> 32:10.640]  This is this affects everybody, right?
[32:10.640 --> 32:16.560]  This is you know, again, it goes back to the fairness, you know that our government should be a level playing field
[32:16.640 --> 32:18.640]  Yes, there are two teams
[32:18.800 --> 32:20.800]  Right and they compete against each other
[32:21.040 --> 32:23.840]  But if the if the fucking playing field isn't level
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.480]  We got a problem
[32:26.480 --> 32:29.440]  yeah, I don't want to be too histrionic about it, but uh
[32:30.000 --> 32:37.520]  It does fundamentally come down to whether the parties see themselves as two opposing parties within one nation
[32:37.520 --> 32:40.800]  or they view each other as their enemies and
[32:42.480 --> 32:50.640]  The democrats clearly still see the republicans as their opposition and the republicans see the democrats as their enemy and you and that's
[32:50.800 --> 32:52.320]  Again, I don't mean to be histrionic
[32:52.320 --> 32:56.880]  It sounds if you if you happen to be of conservative bent you think that that's just me being a liberal
[32:56.880 --> 33:02.880]  You can see it in the polls where a poll came out today of what's your net positive or negative?
[33:02.880 --> 33:08.160]  Negative on the following people and they asked a survey of republicans in the united states
[33:08.720 --> 33:10.080]  uh
[33:10.080 --> 33:13.840]  It was like barack obama was a negative 64 net negative
[33:14.480 --> 33:16.660]  Hillary clinton was a net negative 77
[33:17.600 --> 33:20.000]  And vladimir putin was negative 10
[33:21.120 --> 33:22.080]  right
[33:22.080 --> 33:24.080]  so vladimir butin is is
[33:25.180 --> 33:29.840]  54 points more popular among republicans than barack obama
[33:29.840 --> 33:33.620]  I mean, it's it's no joke or kidding or exaggeration
[33:34.720 --> 33:36.720]  that the republican party
[33:37.360 --> 33:38.960]  largely sees
[33:38.960 --> 33:42.720]  The democrats as more of their enemy than they do the russians
[33:43.520 --> 33:46.640]  Which is nuts, especially for people of our age
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.040]  Where the republicans were the ones who were the hardline realists?
[33:51.120 --> 33:55.280]  Oh jeez, I was just gonna I was just gonna say, you know, ronald reagan is rolling over in his grave
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.400]  Well as a kid and a teenager when I first, you know became politically aware and I was a news junkie
[34:00.720 --> 34:07.760]  I I viewed myself more as a republican than a democrat because I thought that the republicans were the party of
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.640]  Uh, you know to put it succinctly the party of
[34:13.520 --> 34:18.240]  The cold hard truth and that the democrats were more of a saw what they wished for
[34:18.880 --> 34:19.920]  party
[34:19.920 --> 34:21.360]  um
[34:21.360 --> 34:27.120]  You know and that the the main issue at the time wasn't something like climate change. Uh,
[34:28.960 --> 34:30.000]  Uh
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.360]  Or a few other things where it comes up
[34:31.360 --> 34:36.240]  but climate change is a perfect example today where one party is looking at facts and the other party is just
[34:36.560 --> 34:38.560]  Believing what they want to be true
[34:38.640 --> 34:45.360]  um, but at the time the pre-eminent issue was the cold war because it was you know, hey if this turns out poorly
[34:46.160 --> 34:49.520]  Every we're all dead. We're screwed. Yeah, right. We're all dead
[34:49.520 --> 34:52.000]  This is a game with no winners
[34:52.720 --> 34:54.080]  yeah, uh
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.920]  And it seemed to me like the republicans were the I I I think history has shown it to be true that the republicans were
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.480]  The ones who looked at it with it, you know
[35:03.760 --> 35:06.960]  Just cold hard facts. Yeah, right. Uh
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.240]  So it's ridiculous to me that they've now become the party that's like ah russia's good people
[35:13.120 --> 35:15.120]  well, maybe they are good people but
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.360]  The russian government leadership. Oh good people. Yeah, it's you know, it's it's kind of like, you know that
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.560]  They have to you know
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.440]  It's a win at all costs kind of situation for them
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.560]  Right and and the the the the problem I have is that those costs are going up
[35:33.280 --> 35:36.960]  In ways that hurt our society and hurt our government. I mean
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.240]  Well, i'm i'm i'm at i'm at odds with many people in my family now because of this
[35:42.240 --> 35:44.880]  Yes, i'm sure that's true for a lot of people
[35:45.600 --> 35:47.600]  And I it sucks
[35:47.840 --> 35:55.280]  But you know, they they had to vote for their republican person because you know, and and the fact that
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  that
[35:58.880 --> 36:01.280]  You know the the people that are celebrating a
[36:02.560 --> 36:04.400]  the the trump
[36:04.400 --> 36:06.400]  win include the the
[36:06.400 --> 36:13.460]  The ku klux klan and in evangelical christians in the same group. I mean what is wrong there?
[36:14.420 --> 36:15.860]  All right
[36:15.860 --> 36:20.740]  Well, you start to get the feeling that maybe the evangelical christian base may maybe
[36:22.480 --> 36:24.480]  Christianity isn't there
[36:25.780 --> 36:28.020]  You just start to think maybe it's not their top priority
[36:29.940 --> 36:32.820]  Our faith that people are inherently good
[36:32.820 --> 36:35.140]  Good we're screwed
[36:36.980 --> 36:41.140]  Well, let me use that as a segue to talk about harry's razors
[36:42.020 --> 36:47.860]  This is now look this show's coming out tonight. December 16th. This is a gift that you can get you've got time
[36:48.100 --> 36:53.780]  If you're listening to this show tonight on the 16th, you can even still get ground shipping after tonight
[36:53.940 --> 37:00.100]  You're gonna have to pay for air shipping, but you can get this as a gift for the holidays still you gotta act
[37:00.100 --> 37:02.980]  I hope you're listening to this show while it's hot off the press, you know
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.180]  Press it onto the 45 record or whatever you're using to listen to this show
[37:07.380 --> 37:10.500]  But if you act quick you can do it you can
[37:11.540 --> 37:13.620]  Go to harrys.com and get an order in
[37:15.220 --> 37:18.820]  Now why why would this make a good gift? Well, one of the reasons is it's a great product
[37:18.900 --> 37:24.500]  I've said this before they make nice handles really really great nice blades. They own their own razor blade factory
[37:24.580 --> 37:29.140]  This is how they get the prices down. This is how they keep the quality up. They're not just like buying
[37:29.140 --> 37:36.340]  White label razor blades and putting harry's name on them. They own a razor blade factory over in germany that they make their own
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.580]  There's no middlemen. No distributors
[37:39.060 --> 37:44.100]  No, no markup on the way to to to retail. It's just they make them
[37:44.740 --> 37:48.660]  They package them they sell them to you. Uh, so it's a great product and they've got good
[37:49.220 --> 37:54.180]  Shaving cream and stuff like that. They've got what do they have here a limited edition set if you haven't heard of them before
[37:54.180 --> 37:59.540]  Um, you can get this set it comes with a razor handle of your choice
[38:00.580 --> 38:03.700]  shaving cream replacement blades and a nice little travel cover
[38:04.260 --> 38:10.420]  Uh, they have something called the winston set that includes an engraveable chrome handle if you want to add a personalized touch
[38:11.540 --> 38:17.060]  The other reason these things make a nice gift is that the packaging is so nice so you can wrap this up
[38:17.300 --> 38:18.420]  And when people open it
[38:18.420 --> 38:20.980]  It's not like you sound like you're giving them one of these blister pack
[38:20.980 --> 38:24.020]  Razor blades that you'd get at a drugstore where it looks you know
[38:24.260 --> 38:28.580]  This looks like you've bought them like a nice thing like you even if you don't even know what's inside
[38:28.580 --> 38:30.180]  It's just like this cool box
[38:30.180 --> 38:34.340]  It's it's not like a blister pack where you've got to go get a razor blade just to open the damn thing up
[38:34.580 --> 38:36.580]  It's a nice box with a nice lid
[38:36.820 --> 38:37.620]  uh
[38:37.620 --> 38:42.500]  I've i've said before it's the type of packaging that's so good that I feel bad throwing it out and I have to defeat my
[38:42.660 --> 38:47.460]  Sort of natural inclination to be a pack rat and keep it like why in the world would I keep an empty box?
[38:47.700 --> 38:49.460]  That had razor blades in it
[38:49.460 --> 38:56.580]  Stupid but it's so nice. It always pains me as I toss it into the the bathroom trash can it's a great great product
[38:57.940 --> 38:59.860]  So if you're listening tonight
[38:59.860 --> 39:02.340]  You can still get ground shipping. Otherwise, uh,

[39:26.660 --> 39:28.660]  Great product
[39:28.660 --> 39:34.020]  All right. I'm done talking about politics. Let's have fun. Yeah. This is thank you. Trump stuff is some stuff is no fun
[39:34.100 --> 39:36.260]  Well, it's it's no fun, but we've got to deal with it
[39:37.060 --> 39:40.740]  Right got to deal with it. You can't put your head in the sand and that's the reason why I think that's the reason
[39:40.740 --> 39:44.100]  I think that's the reason I think I just put it bow on this topic
[39:44.180 --> 39:50.420]  That's the reason why I think it was right that tim cook and jeff bezos and satya nadella and whoever else went to the meeting
[39:50.740 --> 39:52.740]  Is you can't put your head in the sand. You can't just
[39:53.060 --> 39:57.220]  Put your fingers in your ears and go la la la, you know, I don't want this guy to be the president
[39:57.780 --> 40:02.980]  Uh, you got to look at it. You got to stare it right in the eyes, you know pretending that it didn't happen exactly
[40:03.060 --> 40:05.960]  Stay angry and don't let it get normalized
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.560]  Because this is not normal no matter, you know, anybody who says it's all you know, it'll it'll all play out
[40:11.560 --> 40:15.160]  Well, it's like no this is not going to play out. Well, I just hope no
[40:15.320 --> 40:18.360]  I hope we're around in four years to to have another election
[40:19.400 --> 40:25.000]  Because you know you you see this shit happening with you know, china right now. It's like oh right. Oh jesus
[40:25.080 --> 40:27.080]  This is not where we want to go
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.280]  It's like yeah, so for my parents generation that happened in cuba, right then and then
[40:32.280 --> 40:38.360]  People freaked out. Well, hey, guess what? It's this generation's chance to have that little freakout moment
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.280]  But yeah, let's not talk about the politics anymore. I've got one thing that's even less fun
[40:42.280 --> 40:48.360]  It's even less fun than trump and I have to talk about it. No fun at all. It's super mario run came out
[40:51.560 --> 40:54.680]  And my god, it's got an in-app purchase oh my god
[40:55.560 --> 40:57.800]  So super mario run came out yesterday
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.840]  Super mario run came out yesterday. Uh, here's how it works. I think it was a mystery
[41:02.840 --> 41:04.840]  I don't think it was announced how exactly
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.680]  I think the only thing we knew was that it was going to be a free download with a couple of levels to play for
[41:08.680 --> 41:10.600]  Free and then you'd have to buy it
[41:10.600 --> 41:16.360]  So the way it works is free download. You get three levels to play after that. You need to buy it and it's 10 bucks
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.800]  But the way that they're doing the in-app purchase is such that the 10 bucks is per device
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.920]  I think I don't think I think if I had an ipad, I think i'd still have to i've i've heard a complaint from
[41:26.920 --> 41:32.760]  One of my colleagues sean ebert said that he had to buy it for himself and his three kids
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.120]  he's got he's got three boys that want to play it and
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.360]  You know, it's a 40 game for him now from nintendo's perspective
[41:40.360 --> 41:46.920]  That's the way it's always worked right if you if you have a 3ds and your kids have a 3ds
[41:47.480 --> 41:49.480]  And you want to play this game
[41:49.560 --> 41:55.240]  You could you know at the same time you could you'd all have to buy your own version of it now
[41:55.240 --> 41:58.520]  It when it was cartridges you could like share the cartridge
[41:58.600 --> 42:00.920]  But then only one of you could play it at a time and there's no way
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.920]  To do that with an in-app purchase. You can't have an in-app purchase that says your whole family can use this app
[42:06.920 --> 42:10.920]  But only one of you can use it at a time. It just doesn't work that way. So from nintendo's perspective
[42:11.400 --> 42:13.560]  This isn't that unusual
[42:14.440 --> 42:17.000]  And they don't sell ten dollar games for the 3ds
[42:17.080 --> 42:19.800]  This would be like a 40 or 50 game for the 3ds
[42:20.280 --> 42:23.240]  But on the other hand before anybody even says it and writes to me don't write to me
[42:23.240 --> 42:30.840]  I understand that even with the purchase this entire game is probably less expansive than a typical 3ds game that it's smaller
[42:31.240 --> 42:33.640]  Whatever. I can't get 10 bucks is so little
[42:34.280 --> 42:40.200]  Honestly, I I do get it and that there's family sharing we use it. We we've got a lot of stuff on the family sharing here
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.600]  Um in this particular case, I I can't blame it. I I want nintendo to make money on this I do
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.400]  Yeah
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.360]  I'd love to see a lot of game developers make money. But yeah, no argument from me that ten dollars
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.480]  Is a per device is a premium price for an iphone game, but honestly i've played this game for a day now
[42:59.560 --> 43:02.200]  It's a premium game. It is a premium game. So
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.800]  yeah, and and and the the problem right now though is that there are a lot of people who have been
[43:08.500 --> 43:13.160]  Indoctrinated into the you know, well, I can earn coins to to get what I want, right?
[43:13.240 --> 43:16.920]  It shouldn't cost me anything and they're the ones that are complaining about
[43:16.920 --> 43:22.520]  You know just this game right at the I mean, we'd all love it as developers. We would all love it
[43:22.520 --> 43:24.520]  If people just paid for the thing
[43:24.920 --> 43:28.200]  Right, that's what we all want. Just just spend your money
[43:29.400 --> 43:31.400]  If you like it buy it
[43:31.960 --> 43:36.360]  And and instead we're jumping through all these hoops, you know doing you know
[43:36.520 --> 43:43.720]  Things that make people look like they're not spending money because we call them coins instead of dollars and you know, that's
[43:43.720 --> 43:49.000]  You know, it's it's all you know the deception and and so, you know
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.880]  kudos to the hindu for just saying hey
[43:52.680 --> 43:54.680]  It's going to cost you ten dollars
[43:54.840 --> 43:56.360]  Deal with it
[43:56.360 --> 44:04.120]  Yeah, and the three levels that they let you play before you are asked for a nickel. I think are indicative of the
[44:05.240 --> 44:10.360]  The gameplay and they even show you on a there's like a when you complete a level
[44:10.360 --> 44:13.400]  They show you that there's six worlds of four levels each
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.360]  And so you get through the first three levels of the first world before you have to pay to continue
[44:18.760 --> 44:20.680]  You both have a you both have a very fair
[44:21.240 --> 44:26.840]  Idea of what the game is like to play and you also have a very fair idea of how much is unlocked
[44:28.840 --> 44:34.440]  Right when you pay the 10 bucks you to me it's a very fair deal and I think
[44:34.440 --> 44:41.080]  I think it you know again, you know, and if you've got you know, somebody's out there surely has three or four kids
[44:41.240 --> 44:43.000]  You know and it's like hey, it's you know
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.520]  You're telling me it's a sixty dollar purchase for my kids and my wife and I to play this I understand that you know
[44:48.840 --> 44:50.120]  that that's
[44:50.120 --> 44:52.120]  It's pretty a lot. It's a lot of money for iphone game
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.280]  but
[44:54.280 --> 44:55.720]  You know
[44:55.720 --> 45:03.080]  I'd much rather have nintendo doing this and having it as a fair upfront price than to see nintendo succumb to the you know
[45:03.080 --> 45:09.640]  Keep putting two dollars in to buy a bag of coins to keep going, you know, or to right get past this log jam
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.320]  You know this level is for all intent and intents and purposes
[45:13.800 --> 45:19.880]  Unbeatable unless you've got a thousand coins and you can only really have a thousand coins if you pay us three bucks
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.760]  Right or go watch a bunch of ads or whatever the hell these other games make you do
[45:25.560 --> 45:30.440]  It's you know, it's not like that and I think it's you know, and then to me as somebody I you know
[45:30.440 --> 45:37.160]  I you know, i'm not a die-hard gamer. I'm probably the opposite. I actually probably spend a lot less time playing video games than the average person
[45:37.880 --> 45:38.600]  my age
[45:38.600 --> 45:44.440]  Uh, and probably for someone who's interested in technology and computers way i'm probably way at the bottom in terms of how much time
[45:44.520 --> 45:45.880]  I spend playing games
[45:45.880 --> 45:52.040]  Uh, I think I get the impression you're probably the same as me. I went through my childhood before nintendo became a thing
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.040]  All right. I I don't I don't get mario or any of the you know
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.040]  the
[45:58.040 --> 45:59.880]  that whole
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.880]  80s gaming thing because you know in the 80s I was you know, 20 years old and had
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.400]  Began an adult life. So yeah it uh, do you have an atari or were you too too old?
[46:09.400 --> 46:11.880]  Yeah, no, we would have a friend of mine had an atari but you know
[46:11.880 --> 46:18.040]  It was just the pong and all the other kind of crappy games and and you know at the same time that that that was
[46:18.920 --> 46:25.960]  Happening I was also discovering computers. So it's like I could write my own computer games. Why the hell am I sitting in front of the TV?
[46:25.960 --> 46:33.000]  Fiddling with this little dial. It's like oh man, I got I got a basic interpreter. This is way better, right?
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.240]  I understand the feeling exactly. Uh, yeah, I could be making something
[46:37.880 --> 46:42.360]  Um, and that's these days and i'm glad it happened that way it made, you know made me who I am
[46:43.400 --> 46:50.840]  Yeah, I have an on-off. I i've never been a huge nintendo fan. I never like I didn't like the nes. Uh, and then in my college years
[46:51.800 --> 46:53.800]  there was the
[46:53.800 --> 46:55.400]  Uh
[46:55.400 --> 47:01.320]  Not the n64 super nintendo super nintendo was the one of the early 90s early and mid 90s
[47:01.640 --> 47:05.320]  I had a sega genesis which was I thought the superior system
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.960]  uh, at least for the type of games I wanted to play like john madden football and the the
[47:10.680 --> 47:12.680]  nhl hockey game
[47:13.880 --> 47:17.400]  And sega's version of mario was sonic the hedgehog
[47:18.280 --> 47:20.360]  Right, which was the 2d scroller
[47:20.360 --> 47:24.120]  Uh, I did have an n64 which I liked a lot. Um
[47:24.840 --> 47:29.240]  Later on it's probably the last console. I really played a lot although I guess I had an original xbox, too
[47:29.240 --> 47:32.360]  And I played that sometimes how old were you with jonas as a kid?
[47:32.840 --> 47:36.120]  Well, when what how old were you when you're playing these games?
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.960]  Uh, sega genesis was my college years. So that was like 91 to 96, right?
[47:42.760 --> 47:47.000]  Roughly, uh, that was a 32-bit system or was it 16?
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.840]  Yeah, so you're sitting in a dorm room. It's a it's a thing to party with right? Yeah, exactly
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.200]  It was a dorm. It was a big dorm room thing. Uh
[47:56.920 --> 48:03.020]  And it's partly because they the the ea sports games. I don't even know that they had them for nintendo
[48:03.560 --> 48:09.560]  Or super nintendo and if they did they were inferior like the the sega genesis was better at the sports games
[48:10.600 --> 48:13.720]  Um, and that was what we all played each other. That was what we played non-stop
[48:13.720 --> 48:16.600]  Uh n64 was good though. There was this golden eye game
[48:17.400 --> 48:24.760]  Anybody who had it knows exactly what i'm talking about and anybody it was a 3d shooter and you'd play you could play against your roommate
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.480]  And it it was split screen. So you each got like you split the screen
[48:30.200 --> 48:36.120]  And because it was a four to three screen it was I forget if it was horizontal and you got like a real wide angle
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.600]  Thing or if it was side to side, I think it was I actually forget
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.840]  True story true story. I had a roommate my first year after college. I had a roommate, uh,
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.840]  Don and we played we had an n64 and that was when the playstation first came out
[48:51.720 --> 48:58.120]  The original playstation and what we used to do was rent video games. You could go to how to get a disc
[48:58.120 --> 49:03.560]  So you'd go to blockbuster and you could rent a game for four days for I don't know five bucks four bucks
[49:04.120 --> 49:08.040]  Way cheaper than buying 60 dollar games. So you could rent a game for four days
[49:08.040 --> 49:14.920]  Way cheaper than buying 60 games, right? We didn't have the money to buy a bunch of 60 games. The renting thing was awesome
[49:15.400 --> 49:17.080]  So we had an n64
[49:17.080 --> 49:23.560]  you basically is it's you binge on the game and you know, you've you've you've you're getting the the the the content for
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.080]  So
[49:27.080 --> 49:33.640]  We'd go to blockbuster and you'd look and like the playstation section had all of these awesome games like
[49:34.520 --> 49:37.080]  at the time realistic car racing games
[49:37.080 --> 49:38.120]  and
[49:38.120 --> 49:46.120]  Shooters and all of these awesome games and then the nintendo section had like seven titles and most of them were like for little kids
[49:48.680 --> 49:54.140]  But then golden eye came out and golden eye fixed everything in fact effectively our n64 turned into a dedicated
[49:54.680 --> 49:58.120]  Golden eyed box. It was a good one player game
[49:58.120 --> 50:05.160]  It had the a very long campaign where you played james bond going through the golden eye movie scenario really good first
[50:05.160 --> 50:10.360]  Per you know one player mode and then the two player thing was just unbelievably fun
[50:11.540 --> 50:16.280]  unbelievably fun and eventually I got just every it was one of the only games I ever got pretty good at and I
[50:16.440 --> 50:21.560]  I got ever so slightly better than don was like this is after maybe a whole year of playing
[50:22.200 --> 50:26.440]  And I was always a fraction of a section a second quicker than him
[50:26.680 --> 50:30.280]  and it got to the point where he couldn't beat, you know, we used to be like 50 50 and then it was
[50:30.280 --> 50:35.720]  I somehow gained like I leveled up a little bit and he couldn't beat me and one time he threw this controller out the window
[50:36.040 --> 50:38.040]  And we lived on the third floor
[50:39.160 --> 50:41.160]  Time to buy a new controller
[50:41.240 --> 50:47.480]  But it was the most satisfying victory ever right like what could be more satisfying than making your friend throw his controller out the window
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.120]  Yeah, but then at that point you're pretty much done with the game right because the guy knows he can never win again
[50:52.200 --> 50:54.200]  And you know, it's like okay
[50:54.520 --> 50:55.880]  Why play?
[50:55.880 --> 51:01.960]  Oh, yeah, but anyway, then my other experience with nintendo is we had the wii the one the first, you know, not the wii
[51:01.960 --> 51:06.440]  We have the wii youtube, but we never play it. Yeah. The wii was great that the one where you'd had the
[51:07.560 --> 51:11.960]  Basically the physical games were awesome, right? Right. It just got people moving around
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.160]  I thought that was right and that that was how jonas learned to play video games
[51:15.160 --> 51:17.160]  We had that when he was I don't know
[51:17.400 --> 51:20.920]  Three or four or something like that and that's another one
[51:20.920 --> 51:26.520]  That's another one where you can throw the controller but not necessarily because you're meant to right
[51:26.840 --> 51:31.240]  We have these we have this we jonas and I laugh about it because jonas is very much into video games now
[51:31.240 --> 51:33.240]  And he's almost 13
[51:33.960 --> 51:37.800]  Is that when he we first started playing there's a great great series of games
[51:38.200 --> 51:43.800]  uh these lego games where you play as a lego character from like movies and you go through and
[51:46.040 --> 51:50.120]  You know like the one that we played that was the first one was the lego star wars and you just
[51:50.120 --> 51:57.160]  Game, and it had all six of the original star wars movies meaning the first three from you know, the 80s then the prequels
[51:58.280 --> 52:02.200]  And each one was broken up into six like adventures
[52:02.200 --> 52:08.200]  so you had 36 adventures to go through from all of the star wars movies and you just play as two characters at the same
[52:08.200 --> 52:11.000]  time on screen and you go through and smash things up and
[52:11.720 --> 52:16.360]  Take the bricks and rebuild them into other things and it was very very just very fun
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.600]  Very very kid-friendly, but very fun for me as an adult to play too
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.000]  But the funny thing was that when we first started playing it, I don't know if jonas was three or four probably around four
[52:25.560 --> 52:27.560]  was that um
[52:27.720 --> 52:30.760]  And it's sort of like an iso. What's the isomorphic?
[52:31.860 --> 52:33.160]  perspective
[52:33.160 --> 52:36.280]  Isometric, right? Yeah isometric perspective the game
[52:36.920 --> 52:39.640]  And jonas just had tremendous trouble
[52:39.800 --> 52:45.400]  Like if you had to walk on it, you had to get your character to walk on a cat walk diagonally, right?
[52:45.400 --> 52:49.880]  Uh, not even like a tightrope, but you know, but like a a three character wide
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.000]  Catwalk that was at a 45 degree angle. He would just keep falling off and it's one of these games where you
[52:55.560 --> 52:59.320]  You don't probably he probably didn't have the spatial capabilities in his brain. Yeah, right, right
[52:59.320 --> 53:01.400]  That's just that right being able to say
[53:02.040 --> 53:04.040]  to project that
[53:04.040 --> 53:06.040]  Into his mind. Yeah
[53:06.360 --> 53:09.720]  And and to transfer it into a movement with his thumb, right?
[53:10.120 --> 53:14.200]  Right, and it's one of these games or one of part of the part of what made it so much fun to play with
[53:14.200 --> 53:19.080]  A little kid is that you you never you don't run out of lives and have to start the level over
[53:19.320 --> 53:24.200]  Every time you die, you just lose some of the coins you've picked up and it just shoots you back to you know
[53:24.840 --> 53:27.000]  15, you know five feet away from where you died
[53:27.400 --> 53:33.000]  You just keep respawning and you all you lose are these coins and when you finish the level with the most coins
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  It's an accomplishment. So, you know you can
[53:35.720 --> 53:38.920]  You know finishing without dying which is gives you more coins
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.920]  So there's an advantage to not dying
[53:40.920 --> 53:46.840]  but you never actually like have to start the level over but there would be certain things where he just spatially couldn't navigate and it
[53:48.040 --> 53:51.080]  I think i'm a pretty patient father, but eventually it's like just give me the give me the
[53:53.800 --> 53:55.800]  Dad's gonna help you out here, right
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.760]  And it wasn't like getting him past like a boss, you know villain
[54:00.840 --> 54:06.600]  It was just getting him through like a very narrow hard to navigate little thing. Uh, and it's just very
[54:06.600 --> 54:12.760]  Very it's very comical now when I try to play video games with him because probably it's actually the opposite
[54:12.840 --> 54:18.280]  Yeah, I was gonna say he kicked he's kicking your ass now, right? Because he's young he's got good eyesight good reflector
[54:19.300 --> 54:21.080]  Reflexes. Yeah, he's
[54:21.080 --> 54:21.800]  What was it?
[54:21.800 --> 54:24.680]  It was a lego game like lego batman or something like that
[54:24.760 --> 54:28.600]  And I was like i'll play that with you and I started playing and it was clear that I was holding him back
[54:29.960 --> 54:31.640]  Right
[54:31.640 --> 54:33.960]  He's not gonna say anything, you know, he loves you and everything
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.920]  he's not gonna like hurt your feelings, but he's like dad just just
[54:37.480 --> 54:40.680]  Well, I was like remember when you'd be the one holding me back and he'd be he laughed
[54:40.680 --> 54:44.760]  He had a good sense of humor. Yeah, but it was very clear that I was the one holding him back
[54:45.880 --> 54:51.720]  Uh, anyway, I wish nintendo the best. I think they're going to do very well with it complaints about the price aside
[54:51.960 --> 54:55.160]  it does seem like they're being very aggressive on the trying to keep the
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.520]  Whatever countermeasures they've taken against piracy it seems like they've
[55:00.520 --> 55:05.160]  Done quite a bit one of them being and here's the one that's going to affect honest people
[55:05.320 --> 55:10.520]  The most is the game does not play if you don't have a network connection. I tested it. It's very true
[55:10.920 --> 55:13.560]  Like if you turn on airplane mode and try to start the game it says
[55:14.120 --> 55:19.560]  Oops, you know try to move just try to move somewhere where you have a better network connection. Oh, that's not gonna
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.720]  That's not gonna play out. Well, I mean as soon as somebody you know, it's like on launch day
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.040]  You're not gonna notice that but over time, you know, you're gonna be wanting to play it in the game
[55:30.040 --> 55:31.480]  play it in a
[55:31.480 --> 55:38.380]  In the subway on an airplane airplane, right? Yeah. Well, and it's funny people have even pointed out that at the announcement
[55:39.460 --> 55:41.460]  miyamoto even said because
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.600]  It's totally playable one-handed that it's great to play in a subway now. Maybe you know, maybe
[55:47.160 --> 55:50.280]  He's thinking of I don't know. I've never been to tokyo, but maybe tokyo
[55:50.280 --> 55:55.640]  I wouldn't be surprised if it is one of those cities where the subways even part you'd be good at cell service
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.360]  Yeah, I noticed the last time up
[55:58.360 --> 56:00.440]  uh last trip to wwtc that that
[56:01.320 --> 56:08.520]  The their cell service and bart now, you know from the airport to downtown you pretty much have a network connection all the time
[56:09.080 --> 56:09.320]  All right
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.960]  but when this when this news came out that the game doesn't work without a network connection a bunch of readers wrote to me and
[56:13.960 --> 56:15.960]  Just said well my kid, you know has
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.200]  an ipod touch or
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.480]  You know the the the the ipod touch that an awful lot of kids have is a two or three year old iphone
[56:23.480 --> 56:25.080]  That doesn't have a sim card
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.800]  You know just to hand me down here's my you know, this was dad's iphone from two years ago
[56:29.960 --> 56:35.400]  Just take the self just take the sim card out and you've got a you know, a hand-me-down ipod touch
[56:36.040 --> 56:38.040]  Uh, yeah
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.440]  Yeah car trips that's another, you know, you know, that's it. That's exactly it
[56:42.520 --> 56:47.820]  Do you want it and and then okay. Okay, well you have to set up a wi-fi hotspot just so the kids can play nintendo
[56:48.760 --> 56:50.600]  right
[56:50.600 --> 56:52.600]  Right. It's like no, thanks
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.820]  Right. No, okay. Let's let's drain mom and dad's batteries so we can play nintendo
[56:58.120 --> 57:04.760]  And I saw something about the fact that the game has a lot of it doesn't seem to run on a lot of jail bricks
[57:05.160 --> 57:11.000]  uh, it seems which only makes me think that nintendo is specifically looking for signs of
[57:11.560 --> 57:14.120]  Common jail breaks and is refusing to run
[57:15.560 --> 57:19.100]  How are they gonna do that? That's actually a hard thing to do in a sandbox
[57:19.100 --> 57:23.340]  You the uh, apple might have looked the other way
[57:24.380 --> 57:26.540]  I wonder some of these things. I don't know
[57:27.500 --> 57:30.380]  And I don't want to I don't you know, not knowing how it works or anything
[57:30.460 --> 57:32.460]  But my that would be my first reaction. It's like
[57:34.780 --> 57:37.100]  Maybe there's there's my other question. My other question is
[57:37.900 --> 57:44.620]  It's it is ios exclusive right now. It is apparently coming to android eventually. How long do you think until it comes out on android?
[57:45.420 --> 57:46.700]  and
[57:46.700 --> 57:53.820]  Google will probably want to use it like apple did as a way to to promote a new software release or something like that. Um,
[57:54.620 --> 57:56.620]  I could see it happening at the next io
[57:57.260 --> 58:04.140]  Or something, you know, just like it played well at the iphone 7 launch. It'll play well at some google launch
[58:04.620 --> 58:06.620]  So I think that that would be your answer
[58:06.940 --> 58:10.140]  So maybe like six months, I don't know but is it old news in six months? I don't know
[58:10.140 --> 58:16.140]  Yeah, who knows? I mean, it's the the half-life for games these days is pretty uh,
[58:17.260 --> 58:22.960]  Pretty insane. It's it's like, you know pokemon go right middle of summer. It was just everywhere
[58:23.660 --> 58:26.780]  In fact, you know, we had a deck down at the beach where you know, I go every day
[58:26.860 --> 58:33.280]  It's like there's there was one tree that everybody'd be standing under because it had shade and pokemon characters
[58:34.620 --> 58:38.620]  And it got to be kind of funny. It's like everybody walked by. Oh, yeah, that's the pokemon spot, you know
[58:38.620 --> 58:41.820]  And and you you know, you talk to people there. Oh, yeah, i'm waiting for the you know
[58:42.060 --> 58:46.940]  You know the gym or whatever it is and oh my god. I saw a thing on I saw a thing on twitter
[58:47.180 --> 58:50.940]  I wish I had had it but it was the gist of it was somebody was like, oh my god
[58:51.020 --> 58:53.580]  I can't believe they had to put this sign up. Somebody was in like a museum
[58:54.620 --> 58:59.500]  Or something and it was like a part where they were showing like, uh, something really grave and serious
[58:59.500 --> 59:02.220]  it was like relics from uh, I don't know like a
[59:03.400 --> 59:07.900]  Concentration camp or something like that, you know something really really grave and serious, you know
[59:07.900 --> 59:09.900]  like here's a bunch of artifacts from some kind of
[59:10.460 --> 59:16.380]  Uh internment camp or I don't think it was the holocaust but something like that though where like a bunch of people were were you know?
[59:16.860 --> 59:17.820]  political
[59:17.820 --> 59:19.820]  You know prisoners and and people died
[59:20.380 --> 59:22.860]  And it went on a long time and and there was a sign up that said
[59:23.500 --> 59:25.500]  Please no pokemon go
[59:25.500 --> 59:30.540]  Right like because you can only imagine like a sign like that doesn't go up unless people were doing it
[59:31.020 --> 59:34.380]  Yeah, you know like somehow they're really yeah, they're reacting to something
[59:34.380 --> 59:38.540]  Yeah, right. Well, I you know, I thought the you know what the in it in the middle of summer
[59:38.540 --> 59:42.860]  I was my one of the thoughts I had was like what happens when it gets cold, right?
[59:42.860 --> 59:46.700]  All these people going out hunting for pokemon. What what the hell are they gonna do when it's you know
[59:46.700 --> 59:51.660]  raining or snowing or you know middle of a hurricane or whatever and it's like
[59:53.100 --> 59:54.940]  you know so that they launched that in a
[59:55.980 --> 59:57.980]  really good time and
[59:58.060 --> 01:00:03.340]  You know, maybe they had the expectation that it's gonna have six great months and then
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.780]  Who knows?
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.820]  I think we're in the who knows right now, you know, it's like, you know, maybe
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.820]  You know mario on ios is going to be the same way
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.380]  I suspect or not. It's there's a lot to be said for that brand
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.420]  Same is true with pokemon there. You know, it's a huge brand a lot of uh
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:28.300]  Nostalgia in that brand. I mean that's you know, the fact that you were, you know talking about you know, all your past
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:33.760]  Consoles and the games you played. I mean, that's it's it's nostalgia is a powerful thing and
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.400]  you know, that's
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.920]  and it it's
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.920]  it's interesting too that that that
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.560]  mario is is
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:49.280]  Is nostalgia that's getting passed on right? There's there's a there's a generation of kids now who are going to grow up and
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.440]  their first encounter with mario is going to be you know on their their iphone or their ipad or their
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:02.000]  Ipod touch, you know, that's that's their beginning and where's it gonna go from here. Uh, who knows?
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.480]  Yeah, the comparison I think is you know, and it's it's obvious one that a thousand people have made before
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.320]  Is to mickey mouse and the donald duck and you know the whole gang of characters
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.300]  That is you know, so old that they disney literally has to keep petitioning the us federal government to keep extending
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.300]  the copyright, uh expiration date, uh
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:32.340]  Because they're sold that they would have already passed into the public domain by now and yet are completely relevant and popular
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.540]  And and and a good source of revenue
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.180]  right well
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.060]  Yeah, I mean that but they're usually popular for a reason, right?
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:46.660]  Well, and one reason one reason why that they've remained popular is that the even under walt disney
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.740]  I think it started with walt disney. I think it started with walt disney. I think it started with walt disney
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.700]  I think it started with walt was don't be afraid to move them into new
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.580]  Media just keep keep going up with technology. Don't don't
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.100]  Don't say well mickey is a movie star. So he's never going to be on tv
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.180]  No, we're going to have a tv show and and you know get everybody to watch it
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.260]  I mean, it's one of my favorite stories and it's one of the
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:14.500]  best comparisons between walt disney and steve jobs that i've ever seen was that he was so willing to let go of the past
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.300]  And always hungry for the future which was the it goes against human nature
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.300]  I mean it even ties back to
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:28.100]  our discussion on trump and those tech leaders and trump seeing his job as president as protecting the current top companies
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.660]  As opposed to just keeping it fair and letting
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:35.700]  The revolution happen, you know walt was you know in the 50s when tv started to become a thing
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:42.980]  Uh, the movie studios were totally disdainful of television and saw it as a lesser medium. I mean we saw that until
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.140]  really up until just a handful of years ago where
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.820]  Being an actor and in the movies was is was seen as way more serious than being an actor in tv
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.180]  it really took until the last handful of years and shows like
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.300]  The sopranos and madmen and westworld where people and game of thrones
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:06.500]  Where people see tv as being as good or even better than movies. Yeah. Yeah walt disney
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:12.900]  Unlike all the other hollywood studios the other holly the way that hollywood attacked the tv was by and part of it is cool
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:19.300]  I love cinemascope and 70 millimeter prints is that that's when tv that's when movies switched from the four three
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.700]  Aspect ratio 16 16 to 9 and the bigger the bigger cinemascope 2.1
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:31.780]  Widescreen and they built bigger screens that had curves and they'd start shooting in 70 millimeter
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:39.300]  It was okay. You want to have a little dinky rinky dink, you know 19 inch black and white display with a lot of static on it
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.500]  Well, we're gonna you know start shooting in color and we're gonna make it bigger and that's a fine response
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.660]  but it certainly didn't stop the march of progress with tv walt disney on the other hand was like
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:53.700]  We'll keep making movies. But hell yeah, I want I want to be I want mickey mouse on that tv
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:04:00.100]  He i've always loved that quote of his where you know, he he made movies so that he could make more movies, right?
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.780]  No, he made money so he could. Yeah, exactly. He made money on movies so that he could make more movies and that's
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:12.500]  Tv was just another way for him to make money to make more cool things, right? Right. And that's why I hope you know things like
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.980]  Nintendo I hope they do really well on on ios because if they do they're gonna do more
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.580]  And they'll embrace it. We don't make we don't make movies to make money. We make money to make movies. There you go
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.420]  Yes, and he met it, you know, you can roll your eyes, but he meant it, right?
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:36.420]  Right and and tying that in is the recent announcement that nintendo has signed a big big long-term deal with universal to get
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.620]  Uh, like nintendo world into universals theme parks around the world. Sure
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:49.460]  Makes sense, which I am i'm looking forward to tremendously. I I don't you've probably never been there but uh at universal in florida
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:54.580]  They have a big I don't know. I gotta be billion dollar deal with uh, the harry potter franchise, right?
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:00.520]  I've seen pictures of it. I've never been there. But yeah, it's and it looks great. I mean, yeah, we love nostalgia
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.660]  Were you a madman fan
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.540]  A whatever wants to show mad madman. Oh madman. Yeah, you ever watch it. Yeah
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.180]  Yeah, oh right, of course. Yeah don draper and that's
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.380]  That's probably where I got that from
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:25.960]  Nostalgia, it's delicate but potent. Yeah, teddy told me that in greek nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.360]  It's a twinge in your heart
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.880]  for more
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.880]  More powerful than memory alone
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.560]  That's nostalgia. Yep, that's good writing
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:44.120]  Yeah, that's the uh, the one with the the kodak, uh slide. Yep. It's really it's the it's it was like the first season
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.960]  But it's the best it's the best episode and you know, you look at that kodak thing, right?
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.840]  That's that that was revolutionary at the time, right?
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:57.880]  And we as you know kids growing up that was like, you know, we didn't have eye photos and swiping through, you know
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.160]  we had
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.160]  oh, let's put up the screen and
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.560]  stare at dad's slides
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.640]  Well and another example of a company
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:12.520]  A company that lost its way by protecting what it had rather than going to its future. They were making all their money from film
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.520]  and they were
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.840]  it's it's absolutely astounding when you look at how many of the uh,
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.780]  The foundations of digital photography started at kodak
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:31.240]  And the people that you know in charge at kodak patted the engineers who had all these digital camera technologies ready to go
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.640]  You know and patted them on their head and said nice work boys, but uh, we can't sell film
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:41.080]  Yeah, well, we're not selling any film for digital cameras. So, you know keep that in the labs
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:47.640]  But it was actually worked out so well exactly is that actually polaroid who came up with the first digital camera like oh, whoa
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.000]  Why didn't you guys follow through with that so much of it, right?
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.840]  Polaroid and kodak did so much work on it and never took it to market because it would have disrupted their own film business
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Well bottom line
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.680]  Xerox did the same thing, right? It's a there's a there's a line of companies that that we remember fondly because they
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:13.240]  Didn't do what apple does which is you know, kill your babies right preach into the choir here, but it's in 2006
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.280]  The single most important product that apple computer made was their line of ipods
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.160]  And it was very clear to anybody who looked at the iphone
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.680]  With open eyes that well once you have one of these you'll never buy an ipod again
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.120]  Yeah, except maybe the cheap no screen one that you don't care about wearing in the pool
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.560]  Right, the one that doesn't actually make the company money, right? Yeah
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840]  The
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.760]  At the same time. I don't think we
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:49.880]  Appreciated how important that camera was going to be. No, we definitely no, definitely not because I mean the first camera was like
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:56.600]  Yeah, it's yeah, it's it's better than that that that feature phone I used to have but yeah
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.320]  But barely i'll still carry my ds i'll barely carry my dslr around, you know
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:06.680]  Barely carrying my dslr around, you know, yeah barely better, right? It was it was more convenient though
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.600]  that was the thing that
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.760]  It was like ah, right and you know
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.200]  Instagram and all this other stuff took off because oh shit. It's always there
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.000]  I just think that the the time nobody maybe even apple just didn't foresee how quickly
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.840]  Cameras that could fit in the space that was available theoretically just you know
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.760]  However much however much space you want to devote into a iphone size device to the camera
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.720]  Uh how good the image quality could be out of that camera?
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.480]  I just don't think anybody really foresaw what the next five years were going to be that first one
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.640]  It's ridiculous. I i've said this before on the show
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.960]  Like every every time it comes up i'm like I I don't think it even shot video and then i'm like no wait
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.360]  That's not possible and then I look it up and it's like yep. Didn't you didn't even shoot shitty video?
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240]  Shot, you know video whatsoever
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:59.720]  And now you know, it doesn't even fit in the case anymore. And that's okay, right?
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.160]  you know that we got we've got the camera bulge because it's like it it's
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:09.080]  It's more important to have that good camera than it is to have that clean. I'm not gonna say it's okay. I accept it
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:18.040]  It's it's a compromise, right? It's definitely a compromise. But yes, we'd all love it if that back was completely smooth, but
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.640]  We also love the fact that it's not
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.320]  I have that's the one thing. I I don't know what to think about with the pixel
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:31.880]  I have a google pixel and so google pixels google's just google's way around that wasn't to have they have no bump for the camera
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.080]  on the back
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.960]  but
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.840]  The entire device is slightly wedge shaped
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:43.560]  So down at the bottom it's thin and that's the that's the thinness they like to talk about and up by the camera
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.600]  It's thick and there's no one point where there's a bulge
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.720]  um, and it's not super
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.600]  At a glance it's you can't even tell but in your hand it's obvious and it is sort of top-heavy
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.040]  It's I have mixed feelings about that. I do think just I don't want to go too deep on the camera bulge
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.800]  But I but now that the iphone 7 has been in my hands for what three months october november december
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.800]  Yeah, about three months. Uh
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.440]  I do what two little things that I really really like about it
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.960]  And I know people keep saying that it's the same industrial design
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:21.160]  It's the same industrial design, but it's only at a glance the two little things that I really like number one
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.080]  I like that. This camera bump is more of an honest camera bump
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:33.400]  Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's absolutely. Um, i'm 100 with you there. It's like it's it's it it looks like a bump
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  Right and and it is a bump
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.680]  And they're still running those ads that show the hero shot of the shiny jet black iphone 7 plus
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.880]  Where the the entire central focus of the hero shot is the big capsule sized camera bump on the back
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.320]  Like, you know and it's perfectly lit and glossy to highlight it and I just keep thinking
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:04.600]  Yeah, it's the complete opposite of the original iphone 6 ads where the articles were apple's product shots are
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.880]  Hiding the bump, you know where they'd show it from the side and you had you had to hunt for it on the apple site
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:15.000]  In order to see it. Yeah, it was just it like they just pretending it wasn't there
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:22.840]  The other thing I really like and I can't explain why I like it so much is that the volume buttons are no longer in a channel
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.800]  on the side
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.040]  They're just two buttons that stick out of the side
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.440]  There used to be a little feel them. Yeah. Well, but I think I think they're easy to locate for me at least
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:40.600]  But there's like a there was like a little channel dug in and the gap between the two volume buttons was therefore more
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.840]  I don't know. It just felt cheap to me on the iphone six and six
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.400]  s in a way that the
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.880]  I really like the volume buttons on this better. But anyway, that's neither here nor there
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.920]  Quick quick question. Did you get the jet black? Yes
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.640]  I did. Do you love it? I love it and I I have I have I made it I
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.160]  Love being able to carry a phone without a case again
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.680]  It's just like it's sticky in my hand and that's all I wanted. I don't you know, yeah
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.600]  Yeah, I got the micro abrasions. I hold it up here to the light. It's like I can see them but
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.560]  I don't spend my time looking at the back of the phone. I spend my time holding the back of the phone
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.320]  Yeah, and it's just so clearly better there. Yeah, and I think it's awesome after three months of daily use
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.680]  I can tell I can project what it'll look like after two years
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.640]  I mean I will only use it for one year but I mean it but somebody who who a normal
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.120]  A normal smart person would do and use the phone for at least two years. It's gonna look fine
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.200]  It's not gonna look perfect, but it looks fine. And at a glance it still looks nice black and shiny
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.680]  Um, but it's the feel of it. The feel is so much greater the other thing I can happily, you know
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.880]  Going back to the weather. That was my question in september
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.200]  It was like in september when I first felt it. I was like this definitely feels better to my touch
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.040]  But september was a warm month for us. Um, and so my hands, you know had that like, you know
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.320]  It was warm hands now that it's freezing cold. I can say it still feels better even with very very cold hands
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.480]  It it's not slippery
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.200]  Total win I recommend it wholeheartedly
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.000]  Yeah, I mean it
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.200]  Like I said, it's just so nice to be carrying a phone without a case anymore
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.480]  And that's it. That was the only reason I put it, uh on my on my five and my six. Yeah
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.400]  Is I know a lot of people it felt slippery. It really felt slippery and I mean I got big hands, right?
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.880]  It's like, you know, I think you know, it shipples out on me really easy
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.620]  It's like it's for you holding a phone is like a normal person holding like a matchbook
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.800]  It's easily it just slips
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.840]  You know, yeah, the ipad mini is the right size
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:46.860]  Uh, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor it is longtime friend of the show what a great company squarespace
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.880]  Start building your website today at squarespace.com enter the offer code talk show
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.680]  Once again, just talk show at checkout and you'll get 10 off
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.560]  What you mean there's they do websites. Yeah, it's great
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.920]  You just go there and they can do any type of website you want. It is absolutely amazing
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.520]  It really is more of a software platform than uh, like a hosting service. It's it's
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.520]  They do the hosting so you can go there and register your domain and they they're the ones who take care of hosting the server
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.040]  Um, but it's so much more than that. It's not it. It's not work. You shouldn't think of squarespace as a web hosting
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.240]  Provider that has wizzy wig stuff. It really is a platform for building websites
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:34.040]  Sites look professionally designed regardless of your skill level. No coding required. You can pick through a whole bunch of templates
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.040]  For like a blog you could host a podcast
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:45.560]  You could host a store you can host a portfolio if you're like an artist or or a designer
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.440]  Intuitive to easy to use and easy to use tools
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.200]  But if you want to get in there and modify the code you can do that, too
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.600]  There's like a I wouldn't even call it an escape hatch
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.000]  but you can get out of the wizzy wig mode and
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.120]  Inject your own code if you want if you're if that's something you can do you can definitely do it
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.720]  And if you sign up for a year you get a free domain name
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.840]  Is this is the easiest and best way
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.840]  The easiest and best way to get a website off the ground
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:23.000]  One of the all other ways that squarespace is a great service for the sort of people who listen to this show
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.200]  Is if you have somebody else in your life
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.000]  Like let's say like a school maybe you're a parent you're involved with the school
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.720]  Or a church or at some other community group and they need a website and you're sort of the technically minded person
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  Who's involved with the group or whatever?
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:47.020]  So squarespace is a great way to get somebody like that to get them a site at a low price
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:54.220]  On a monthly basis and have it in a way where once you've got this for them and you can hand it over
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:00.380]  You don't ever get your phone never rings with we need to update this. We need to change this it can all just happen
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.900]  By the people who are involved you you can just wash your hands of it and they'll thank you so much because they've got this
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.900]  website that they love

[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.980]  Off your first purchase squarespace i've got a question for you
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:35.260]  About you can ask me anything craig could could they make daring fireball a uh, uh responsive web design
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.260]  Uh
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:43.740]  Well, I could make during fireball a responsive website I do think all the squarespace's default templates are yeah
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.020]  responsive
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:50.300]  I bring that up because that's an important thing these days and I know I know and that's a cheap shot
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.700]  But no it's not it's overdue. It's overdue by years
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:59.260]  And it's it's it the fact that it's overdue by years is that only contributes to the inertia of of not updating it
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:03.260]  Uh part of it's your fault really as much as anybody. Oh, yeah, i'm sure
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.260]  because back in
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.500]  2007
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.860]  Uh when oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:15.420]  You gave me the meta tag that made daring fireball
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.700]  I i've had to update that since because the way those meta tags have worked for the viewport size. Uh,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:29.420]  Like the the curse of daring fireballs existing design is that it's one double tap away from being right pretty good
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.060]  Yeah, that's right in large part
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.060]  Uh
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.640]  I I would say at least 85
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:44.460]  Maybe at least probably around 85 of what it would look like if it were responsive just by double tapping the column. Yep
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:52.220]  But the thing that bugs me the most is when I tap on the quoted part and then the the text around it
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.500]  Right falls out off the edges and it's like, uh
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:01.180]  So, but yeah, you're you're you're close and I yeah, I do remember that. Uh, that made a tag. It's your fault
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:08.140]  Right if daring fireball had looked a completely unreal. Do we want to give everybody my email address so they can pitch to me?
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.740]  No
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.700]  I well I but that's the thing that it's it's
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.500]  For a non-responsive site. It's about as good as it could get, you know
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.340]  So I don't you know people complain and people and when it becomes responsive and it will
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.380]  I'm sure people will be thank you. This is great. Um,
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.580]  Oh, you know, but who knows i'll probably get just as many complaints because the fonts will change at the same time. Uh,
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.740]  but
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:38.700]  It'll happen, but it's it's the fact that it's in my opinion pretty darn good as is is makes it easy to say
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.340]  Well, this is it's never quite rises up to the here's how I should spend the next two weeks
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:49.340]  You know, I got a got a question for you. Somebody who used to have a website has a dark background with light text
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.380]  Um, and somebody who got older are you having trouble reading?
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.500]  The site these days with the the light text on the dark background
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.420]  no, I still find that the color schema during fireball is from my eyes at least is is
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:10.860]  More readable than the opposite. Yeah, that's because it's not super high contrast exactly not yeah
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:15.580]  Yeah, that's I think that's the thing. I mean the icon factor used to be like black black
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.700]  with white and
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.580]  you know orange hyperlinks and
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.060]  it was when we
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:32.860]  Retired that site. It was like oh, thank god because you know, the contrast was killing me. It's like I I
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:38.700]  Was in my 40s and it's like my eyesight started to deteriorate and it's like oh, what do we do here?
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.500]  You know, I see I in fact I see a lot of design that
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:49.020]  by designers who are in their 20s or early 30s and have great eyesight and
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:56.380]  Make decisions based upon that and don't realize that you know a large portion of their audience is
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.140]  Not got their good eyesight
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:07.820]  The uh curse of it is that I still I love my my taste in graphic design runs towards uh,
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:13.980]  Very small print and on not even really online online. It's always been frustrating for me because I couldn't make it small enough
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:19.500]  Like I that's one of the things I missed from print design is I love putting truly tiny type into designs
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:25.180]  Inappropriate like little in jokes or you know footnotes and stuff like that. Um,
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:32.460]  But you know at this point, you know at a very young age. I've I've got the presbyopia where it it's really really hard for me to read
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:38.780]  It's really really hard for me to read it. Well, you've also got the display preference too that I've made, right?
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.300]  How many people actually scroll down to the bottom and see display preferences there?
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:48.140]  Uh, very few so anybody who doesn't know if you do think that the type on during fireball is too small if you go to
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.220]  during fireball.net
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.220]  Prefs, you don't don't even hunt for the link, but it's at the bottom of the page
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.340]  It says display preferences and actually I think there's it's down to one preference there used to be more
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:03.340]  Yeah, it's like font size save
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.260]  Can I tell you a story I I there used to be a thing in here for
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.300]  Uh, this is totally off
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:14.860]  Off topic, but it's interesting to me and maybe people who I haven't wanted to write about it
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:17.740]  But if I talk about it, maybe I can get this fixed. I don't know
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.460]  uh
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.660]  There used to be a preference in here where you could set your amazon country
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:30.220]  And I had a script so that whenever I linked to an amazon product it would based on that preference setting
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.420]  Put a link in with my amazon
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:36.940]  Affiliate code for that country. I think there were only three
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.100]  I think the only I didn't bother going all the way around the world
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.300]  but I took like the top three countries for daring fireball readers, which are
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.660]  The us canada and the uk
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.780]  Uh, very few people ever did it for the uk
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:54.540]  but I at one point early on as when daring fireball went when I went full-time with it the amazon revenue was
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:00.700]  It was it was like a multi. It's good. It was good money. Yeah, it's it's right
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.100]  It was never ever anywhere close to something I depended on but it was you know
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:10.060]  a little bit it was a little bit here a little bit there a little bit there and you know, it contributed to
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:14.700]  It's not it's not paying your rent, but it'll pay for a couple of good dinners every month
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:22.460]  Yeah, right. And the the importance of that revenue as a percentage of daring fireballs over revenue slipped every year and I also
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.820]  started feeling in recent years
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:34.940]  Very recent years that it was maybe not a great idea for me to put amazon links in there because amazon has become more
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.940]  Of a company that I write about
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.740]  Editorially, like I don't do conflict of interest kind of thing. Yeah
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:47.180]  Right, just you know, not in a big way, you know, but in a little way, you know
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:51.900]  Like maybe it's just a little better if if I don't and I I also thought
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:57.980]  This way when I link I so for years now, i've just linked to amazon without my code
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.100]  Usually every once in a while. I think yeah what the hell put it in
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:06.940]  But whenever I put it in I always feel like I should say and sometimes I have said that's a promotional, you know
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.980]  Put in parentheses. That's a promotional link and i'll get a few promotion links
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:14.860]  That's a promotional link and i'll get a few percent of whatever it is that you buy if you click it
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.780]  um
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.860]  But I haven't I I just i've just gotten away from it and my amazon affiliate revenue
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.020]  used to be maybe
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.620]  you know like a thousand dollars a month and sometimes maybe around christmas like
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.460]  It would be like, you know
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:33.580]  like I I think I think the most it ever was is maybe like three or four thousand dollars in a month for december because
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:37.180]  I would put like a hey, here's a couple of top selling holiday items
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:42.380]  And if you click any of these links, you'll you'll this is maybe like 10 years ago eight nine ten years ago
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.740]  Uh, anyway long story short about two months ago
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:54.540]  I got a note from amazon an email that said that I violated their clause by telling people to click on a link
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.300]  oh
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.420]  and
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:03.340]  And they've terminated my account. It was and I searched there were no other I never got a warning
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:07.340]  I didn't ignore. I I mean because this is very common for me. I have so many unread emails
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:14.140]  It was one shot and done. I'm out of the amazon affiliate program. Yeah, they've done
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.660]  They want to avoid click baiting, right? It's like well, it's uh, but
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:23.740]  But when did I thought well when the hell did I ever do that? And I found one article that was back in like
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.460]  2004
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:32.860]  Maybe when I first started using amazon affiliates and then what I did there was technically against and I guess against
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:38.400]  Against what they're saying I did but it was a 2004 article and not one. That's like an evergreen
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:47.100]  Uh, very popular article that that people keep looking linking on and i'm sure that somehow they ran some automated tool that uncovered that article
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:54.460]  But it was 12 years old or somebody didn't like something you said and they went looking for something to
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:01.100]  Maybe but I don't think amazon doesn't strike me. You never know. Yeah, you never know but it's
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:06.220]  It's it's good, but they could have also you don't rely on it, right? It's also it's great
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.360]  You know that you don't you know, you've got your sponsors
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.580]  And that pays for your writing and that's awesome, right?
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.420]  You're in a awesome position
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.060]  They could have looked and seen that and I would say for the last year or so
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:22.780]  I've had maybe like a hundred to two hundred dollars a month in revenue from amazon affiliate
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.580]  so it's cutting off a very small portion of it, but
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.140]  I thought that the what the
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.940]  They didn't cut off everything. They only cut off a portion
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.140]  no, they cut off every they did my my
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:41.740]  You know, basically it's tagged no longer works. Okay. Okay, that makes sense. That's it. It's completely out. Yes
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.900]  it's the equivalent of
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:49.900]  One, you know like having like the apple equivalent of you know, like what they did to the dash developer, you know, you're out
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:55.820]  Yeah, you're done with no warning and and and they even I think the email even said there's no you know
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.300]  There is no there is no recourse, you know
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:02.140]  there's no work, you know, there was nothing like if you would like to uh,
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:10.460]  You know, uh, no appeal no nothing. Yeah, right you're out and then it ended with like have a nice day. I swear to god
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.220]  Hope you have sponsors
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.020]  Thank you, right
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.820]  So if there's anybody at amazon who's listening to the show who thinks that's kind of fishy, you know
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:24.780]  Write to me at daring fireball and I would love to have a communication about not so much that I even care
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.540]  I want to put it back on but
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:31.180]  i'd love to know more about what happened with this because it's to me very curious and
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.540]  You know
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:37.900]  It seems like these things get publicized a lot when apple does it to people and i've never seen anybody complain about this with
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:43.580]  Amazon before but there are other sites that are completely and utterly dependent upon their amazon affiliate revenue
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.660]  I mean, it's pretty much the secret to like the wire cutter and and their business model. Yep
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:53.280]  Yep, kotki is another case where you know, you yeah, that's a the gift recommendations
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.240]  and as you know, every one of those is going to come up with the
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.880]  The awesome his old oscillate domains, you know, it's like you see that and it's like okay good Jason making some money there
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.760]  Awesome. Um, I don't know. I thought that was kind of odd
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.680]  Did you see this thing, uh moving on you see this story about the uber self-driving car that ran like san francisco
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.680]  Yeah, that's pretty funny
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.840]  I will put a link in the show notes one thing that I thought was wow, that's scary
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.280]  To the video was shot by like a cabs dashboard cam
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:27.200]  Uh, and it really did show a a volvo an uber self-driving volvo with the whole big
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.520]  It's very obvious because it had the the self-driving rig dingus on top. Yeah
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.120]  Yeah, yeah, it's a real big dingus on top and it just
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.880]  Sails right through a red light like three seconds after it went red and it's pretty close to a pedestrian too, right?
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.240]  You can see the person that's like, you know, okay, it's two or three feet away, but you know, hey
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:52.560]  You know, we we've all been crossing the street in a city and have a close call and think well
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.520]  Yeah, the other that could have been me the other thing that could have been ended badly
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.520]  Right. And the other thing that struck me in terms of that could have been me is that's right at the part of san francisco
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.720]  Where we always go it's like right by the w exactly right in front of the museum. I think it was
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.380]  Right right right in front of the moma which is right around the corner from moscone
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:18.020]  And is there for like I mean for those of us who just yeah, we could have been drinking for the last six hours, right?
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:28.740]  It's part of that whole south of market union square area where people who go for moscone related events
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:34.020]  You know, you just tend to become familiar with it was right there like it's i'm not familiar with most of san francisco
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.020]  But it's the part of san francisco i'm intimately familiar with. Yeah, although, you know, holy crap
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.540]  Although if you're drinking at the w or the st
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:46.500]  Regis or one of those places you're probably not having that much to drink because the drinks are so expensive. But yeah
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:55.460]  Here's the thing that struck me now i'll put a link into the show notes with this bloomberg story, but uh,
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.580]  uber pr uber spokesman matt wing
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:04.980]  Said in a statement now hats off to them for at least putting their spokesman's name in the statement unlike apple who almost never
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:10.820]  Puts the spokesperson's name and just attributes to an apple spokesperson. But anyway, this is the statement
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.020]  This incident was due to human error
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:18.180]  This is why we believe so much in making the road safer by building self-driving ubers
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:25.640]  This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continued to investigate
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.180]  And you think oh, so it wasn't, you know, like the driver ran the red light
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:36.500]  But I think no, I think this is the worst type of public relations statement possible
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:42.500]  Where I think this was very carefully calibrated word by word where you read it and you think oh
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:46.260]  So it was a human error. It was a human driver who ran the red light
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:52.260]  Whereas if you think about it if if it was the self-driving car that ran the red light
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.220]  Why the hell would the yeah, yeah
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:59.700]  This is what I think happened. I think this car was in self-driving mode
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:04.500]  I think they were lucky and there was I think they're not lying. I think there was no passenger
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:11.300]  At the moment because otherwise that would be just a blatant lie because it said quote was not carrying customers. So I think it was empty
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:16.740]  But I think the self-driving car went right through and when they say it was human error
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:23.300]  What they mean is that the the employee behind the wheel did wasn't paying attention because it was in self-driving mode and didn't manually
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.140]  Apply the brake when it was clear that the car was going to sail through the red light, right?
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:33.460]  That's what I think happened. I think it was a self-driving error. The self-driving car went right through the red light
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:38.820]  There was a pedestrian right in front of it who luckily, you know seemed to hear the car coming and you know
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:45.860]  Waited, uh, and they're saying it's human error because the human behind the wheel didn't manually apply the brake
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:51.460]  Yep, which would be I think would be an excruciatingly hard job. I really do
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:56.660]  If let's say you had to spend six hours in a self-driving car, that was 99 percent accurate
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:03.780]  Yeah, and to hit the absolutely it's like, you know those those those videos that show the uh,
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:05.780]  the teslas in their self-drive mode
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.300]  I
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:13.380]  Get so anxious with those and I can't take my hand or my eyes off of the the driver's hands
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:18.340]  Either that are clearly not touching the steering wheel. It's like, oh my god, what's gonna happen next?
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.740]  Oh my god, what's gonna happen next?
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:26.580]  Right, like it would be it's easy to drive a car for six hours and not run a red light or hit anybody because you're driving
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.740]  But to not be driving
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.740]  And have everything go fine
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:35.300]  Maybe for like five days, maybe you've done it five days in a row and nothing wrong has happened
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.940]  But to still be at a moment's notice to hit the brakes
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:43.700]  Yeah, I think it requires a level of concentration that I know I personally do not have now. I also know
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:50.260]  And you're probably you're probably also monitoring other things about the system right looking at you know dials and switches
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.420]  And you know, it's like, okay
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.580]  You could put me behind the wheel of a self-driving car for an hour
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:02.260]  And I would be I would be completely at paying attention because I would be it would be like holy shit
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:05.940]  This car is driving itself. I'm terrified i'm ready to go, right?
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.980]  I'd have my hands, you know, my fingers twitching ready to take the wheel my hand my foot on the brake
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:16.580]  You know ready to go because for like the first hour or so i'm going to be blown away and amazed and kind of scared
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:20.740]  After like, you know, 20 hours 30 hours, it becomes normal, right?
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:24.820]  it is very hard to be paying that level of attention to something that
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:29.940]  99.9 percent of the time you don't need to be paying attention to yeah
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.460]  it's interesting to me that that
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.460]  When you connect this piece of news with some piece of news
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.460]  the
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.020]  from what was it last week week before about
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:48.100]  The the actual cost of an uber trip is like 40 or 60 percent more than they actually charge you
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.220]  yeah, um
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.300]  If you connect those dots it's like
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:57.140]  Uber, you know anybody who runs a business knows that
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:03.780]  The cost of your employees is by far your biggest cost. Yeah, it's just that's where all the money goes
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.340]  so
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:11.860]  You know them saying this is why we believe so much in making the road safer by building self-driving ubers
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:18.600]  That's kind of bullshit, right? They believe in building self-driving ubers because it's going to make their business profitable
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.220]  right you can you can you can
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.100]  that
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:24.340]  Oh, it costs 40 or 60 percent
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:29.140]  Too much. Well, you know, you don't have to pay a driver sitting behind the wheel
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.900]  and
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.900]  all of a sudden the whole economic
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.040]  situation changes and
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.200]  You're making shit loads of money because
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.640]  You know, you have a one-time cost for that computer that drives the car
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.040]  You know, you you're you're you're calling your front cost of the computer and the car
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:54.080]  I think there is a hey, let's save lives and switch to self-driving cars. That is true
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.760]  There are way there are millions of people who are killed every year by automobile accidents
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.560]  and I truly and honestly believe that we will look back on that as and and and our
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.340]  Societies and my personal acceptance of it. I own a car I drive
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:07.940]  uh
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:13.460]  As barbarous. Yeah, like no, it's hopefully sooner rather than later. Hopefully it'll happen really soon
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:19.220]  And then maybe 10 years from now, maybe 15 maybe 20 at the most but I think we'll look back on it
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.420]  and and and I think it'll I think people who
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:28.820]  Who continue to insist on driving their own cars will start to be looked at as people who you know smoke around babies
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:34.580]  I really do because I do think that the I think the technology it's clear it's not here yet
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:39.400]  But it's clearly going to be here where a system where all the cars are automated
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:47.480]  Will and they network together. Yeah, they network together and and the safety improvements will be dramatic absolutely dramatic
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.260]  But I I think you're exactly right that uber's
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.900]  interest in this
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:53.860]  Yeah
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:59.460]  Very much primarily about the wages. They have to pay to a driver in every car and a bigger issue is our society is not
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:02.260]  prepared for this change
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:10.100]  Right when you think about okay, all of our transportation infrastructure is going to become automated. I mean compare that to our entire
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:17.300]  Manufacturing infrastructure becoming automated, you know robots are well in in production lines are putting people out of out of work
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.200]  Those people that are out of work become disenfranchised
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.980]  Those people that are disenfranchised
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.460]  do weird shit at the time when it
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.540]  Time to vote it ties back in ties back in with trumpism
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:34.660]  Where trump's story is that a bunch of good jobs all went to china and that we could bring those bad
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.420]  Bad jobs back to china and it's true that obviously a lot of stuff is made in china
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.380]  Or other countries in asia, but I there's a whole bunch of stuff if you read I mean, that's true
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:47.960]  It's but it's a more complicated story than that and that I've I've I think it's I think it's arguable
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.400]  And at least some people have made the argue based on facts that more manufacturing jobs in the u.s
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.320]  Have been lost to automation than to um, yep. Yep
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.440]  Now the fact that it's like a double whammy right and vocational training, you know
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.840]  Teaching people how to work in that new environment is just not there
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.480]  Right, that's what i'm saying. So, you know society isn't ready for it, you know, is it and you know
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.800]  All these truck drivers that you know that they haul all our shit cross country
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:22.440]  Uh, what are they gonna do? There's an awful lot of an awful lot of people. Let's face it mostly men, but you know
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:30.680]  Certainly a lot more women than there used to be who are truck drivers, but truck driving is is a large a very very common profession
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.920]  And it is I think going to be one of the first that goes away in the world of autonomous vehicles
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.880]  Yep
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.400]  Uh, and and it'll be it'll be better for all of us, right?
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.680]  It's like, you know, you think of it it when these vehicles are networked together, right? They know
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.440]  A lot more about each other than we do, right?
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.720]  You don't know what the intentions of the person driving in front of you is if that's a computer in front of you
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:05.160]  You can share your gps coordinates where your destination is where you've been. Oh so much gas you've got, you know
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:11.240]  There's all sorts of data that can be exchanged between these between these devices. It's like, you know, it's
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.800]  You know, it's a huge computers are way more interesting than a single laptop sitting on your desktop
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:24.520]  Right a huge source of car accidents and I think often non-fatal ones thankfully, you know once but but you know
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:29.720]  For all the fate of obviously the fatalities are the worst thing worst. I mean just you know, I don't have to yeah
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:36.040]  Emphasize why but the the minor ones the fender benders on a freeway that maybe nobody's hurt
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.680]  At all, but can you know cause you to be an hour and a half late for work?
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.480]  And you know simply a matter of paying attention it ruins your day and I think they're those
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.920]  They're the ones that are be the easiest. They're the ones that will be the easiest to avoid when every car involved is is
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.720]  Is autonomous? Yeah. Well, you've seen those those videos of you know, the wave propagation right one person taps on there
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.120]  Yeah on there on there their brakes somebody sees the red lights they tap on theirs
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.600]  So on and so on and you know that wave propagates to the point where the wave stops
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.680]  Right and you know, it's all happened to all of us. It's like, you know, why am I stopped on the freeway, right?
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:18.040]  Oh, there's got to be some accident up ahead of us, you know five minutes later, you know
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.040]  You're looking for this accident and it's not there
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:28.680]  Right. So, you know eliminate that and everybody's life gets a little easier except for the people that get paid to drive
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.000]  Yeah
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.200]  Yeah
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:35.080]  So there's a sci-fi everybody knows the sci-fi future
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.840]  The sci-fi future is very few people have to work and we have robots, you know
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:45.320]  It's a life of leisure for everybody and you know robot, you know, it's the uh, the people who live on the ship in wally
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.360]  right, just you know lounge about the the
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  You know the pool deck all day long
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.320]  And robots bring you your food and you don't nobody has to work. Uh
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040]  kill me
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.680]  Right, but there's there is a very painful period between here and there
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.640]  Because here it's expected that to be a successful person. You're gainfully and fully employed at a you know
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.040]  At a as high a wage as possible
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.680]  So, I don't know
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.200]  problems coming
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.240]  uh
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.360]  Let me take one last break here and and then afterwards we have a great thing to talk about your book
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.680]  But let me tell you right now about our third and final sponsor
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.040]  Our good friends at back blaze back blaze offers unlimited native backup for your mac and pc
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:37.960]  No credit card required to sign up. No risk 15-day free trial. Just go to back blaze dot com slash
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.120]  Daring fireball not the talk show not talk show daring fireball
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.600]  They just use that same code whether they're on the site or whether they're here on the the podcast
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.840]  You install it it's a great native
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:58.360]  System pref panel runs on your mac. It's written by former apple engineers. Uh, it doesn't mess up your system or gum it up
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.440]  Or anyway, it's not like some kind of gross thing, you know
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:08.120]  Like running something that runs in the background and does something it's it gives you the heebie-jeebies backblaze runs and it backs up everything
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.240]  Everything you want backed up if you have an external hard drive and it's like a big like four terabyte external hard drive
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.240]  You think well, I gotta pay extra for that. No
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.320]  It'll back it up. The only hits the only thing where it's like well that sounds too good to do
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.920]  The only hitch is that the more data you have the more external drives the longer it takes for that initial backup to get everything
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:29.480]  Up there. They can't beat bandwidth. Whatever your upstream is from your computer to the cloud
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  That's how much can get backed up at a time
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.700]  So it might take a while for that initial backup, but then after that everything gets backed up incrementally
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.680]  They have iphone apps android apps a website where you can access your backup
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.760]  So if you're out and about and you're on your iphone and you need like one file
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.600]  Just to send somebody you can use the back blaze app log in get that file email it off or send it by text message
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.720]  Or whatever
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.720]  Catastrophe strikes something happens
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.000]  Roof leaks water gets all over your computer shorts it out or something like that
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:09.240]  Something terrible you need to restore everything you can get them to to put everything you have on a hard drive
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.800]  And have it overnighted to you by fedex
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:17.720]  And if you want when they do that, uh, you can restore it put it on your own hard drive
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.440]  And then you can send that hard drive, you know, erase it send it back to back place
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.680]  Uh, and they'll give you your money back for the drive
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:30.760]  You'll just pay for the shipping or whatever. It's it's a great service if you need a full restoration if you just need one file
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.920]  They've restored over 10 billion files for their customers. No gimmicks. No additional charges. Here's what it costs five
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:43.480]  Dollars a month per computer for unlimited on throttle or off-site backup. Here's why I am so happy
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.380]  To do that do this read this show go home for the holidays
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.120]  and
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.880]  Give your parents give them a real present. Give them a present. Give them give your dad a the shaving kit from harris or whatever
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.320]  But while you're there at their house just sign them up for back place
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.480]  Don't give it to them as a gift because back up it doesn't sound like a good gift. Just do it
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:08.200]  Though just go to your parents house or wherever else you go. Anybody else who's in your extended family when you're home
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.960]  For the holidays sign them up for back place put it on your own credit card
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.280]  And just know that you're done them a great favor for just five bucks a month
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.760]  Yeah, what a great thing to do for your parents that that and it'll be peace of mind for you
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:27.560]  That five bucks is cheap as soon as you lose your data and everybody as soon as your mom your mom calls you up
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  in the middle of july
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:36.200]  Your mom calls you up in the middle of july right and says this says there's a kernel panic
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.480]  And whatever and the thing doesn't start up or whatever
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:44.280]  You just you just think you know what how great is this? I know that I you know
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.520]  All of her stuff all your mom's stuff. Your dad's stuff is backed up. Just do it for him
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.360]  What a great feeling it would be
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:53.980]  It if you did that so go do that over the holidays when you see him go to backblaze.com
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.840]  Staring fireball to find out more
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:00.840]  Uh, and you'll support the show. All right craig. Here we go
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  Making sense of color management
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.040]  Yeah, it's an eight dollar book from a book apart. How long did it take you to write like it?
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.160]  Two years. I started in november
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:18.840]  2014 and you know you blame me for
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:24.520]  The uh non-responsive during fireball. I blame the safari engineers for
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.640]  for this whole thing happening, um, they
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.760]  it was mountain line was the release at the time and
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.120]  All of a sudden the colors in safari were subtly different than the ones in chrome
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.000]  I was like what the heck is going on here and you know
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:46.520]  We have that product x scope which has you know lets you do all sorts of screen measurements and stuff
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:53.560]  A lot of designers a lot of developers use it to to has a loop x scope has a yeah
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.320]  Scope has a x scope has an on-screen loop that you can it's a little window
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.880]  You can drag over another window and then you can have it zoom in on that window and show you what's underneath
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:08.060]  And it could be like at the time I think what you're saying is you could drag it over safari
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.240]  And it you'd see this one color in safari and then you'd look at it in x scope and it would be like a slightly
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.760]  Color shifted. Yeah, you know and and and you expect it to be you know
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:18.600]  hash
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:25.560]  You know c zero zero and it's like hash c three six. I'm like what the heck is going on here?
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.040]  And it turns out that they had implemented color management for their css colors
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.880]  and
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.880]  That was like, oh, okay
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  I've got to fix this bug
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:41.000]  and that was the start of my learning about color management and
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.520]  As I learned about it. It was like I should write this down, you know, maybe make a good blog post and
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.640]  And it's one of those topics that the more you learn about it the more you know
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.800]  what you don't know
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.080]  and
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:00.920]  There got to be like 10 000 words in my blog post. I was like, this is not a blog post anymore. So
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:07.800]  I got in contact with uh, jeffrey zeldman and some other people at a book apart and they're like, yeah
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  We'd love to publish this
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.240]  And it's only what is it about 75 pages? Yeah, I mean that was the hard part, right?
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.880]  He's taking this really complex topic and distilling it and I mean I
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:26.040]  My editor at a book apart was tina lee. It's just awesome because you know, she would challenge me
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.320]  It's like, you know, this is too long, right? I don't understand what you're saying here
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.200]  And I really had to you know
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600]  I've probably wrote the book
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.840]  In its entirety three different times
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.360]  Um, I in fact we were pretty close to being done
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:47.000]  And apple announced color management in ios 10. I was like, uh, oh wait, we're not done
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.600]  So, you know basically two chapters, you know the chapters on
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:58.600]  web browsers because safari on ios changed significantly in that release and the chapter on
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.400]  mobile apps
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:07.640]  It was completely rewritten and sample code and all the stuff that goes along with it was like, oh, okay
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.120]  But I think it came out really well on the end
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.280]  It affects anybody who makes anything for the screen honestly
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:19.720]  I mean this and so i'm not just trying to sell copies of the book but whether you're a designer a graphic designer who makes assets
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.320]  For you know graphical assets for apps and websites or if you're a front-end developer on the web
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:30.440]  Who's making stuff for for, you know, html css, you know web development
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.280]  Or if you are an app developer
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.320]  For native apps for mac or ios
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:44.680]  This book is for you and and not in no way and one of the things one of the things that I love about the
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.800]  Book is at no point to me. Does it is it?
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.280]  Is it all that clear who the main audience is for it's balanced. It's not like oh, it's a book for
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:58.680]  Programmers, but if you're a designer you can still get something out of it or the other way
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.680]  It's it's a book for designers, but you should read it if you're not a designer
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.680]  But you should read it if you're a programmer because you need to understand this stuff
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.880]  Yeah, it's we perfectly balanced from all those perspectives. I'll tell you a little story
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.960]  We struggled with the title because you know
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:19.720]  initially, we're going to call color management for developers and then it was like no because it's for designers too and then it's like
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.600]  working with color is kind of like too vague and
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:32.120]  Jason santa maria came up with making sense of color management. It was like just clicked right because it's like that's what it's all about
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.200]  right, we're trying to take this black dark art that
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  that everybody's kind of
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:46.920]  Fiddled with some knobs and kind of maybe got something working but doesn't really understand what's going on. It's and you know that
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.640]  you know when you read the book you realize that the
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:58.040]  Making sense also applies to our visual sense, right? There's a lot of but the fact the core of color management is really
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.720]  a mathematical modeling of how our eye works
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:09.080]  Which to me is which is explained really well in the book. Yeah. Yeah, really? Well, that was that was my aha moment
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.520]  It's like oh wait
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:16.680]  we've got all these devices that have different color profiles different way of characterizing color and they all kind of
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.920]  They're a little different
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.640]  But then we got this thing called an eye which
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:27.960]  Doesn't change it does it, you know, yes, it's changed over, you know millions of years due to evolution, but
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.480]  You know and it at its core. I mean that is the thing that says it doesn't change
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.480]  so it's a you know color management all revolves around that sense of
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.880]  Vision so and in terms of being well timed in terms of where we are as an industry
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:46.840]  You're right web browsers safari leading the way. Yeah
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:50.440]  The reason they did that it's clear now, right? It's like they need a color management
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.960]  Because they knew that they were coming out with these new displays which have a wider camera
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:03.480]  That's the other the other shoe that's dropping is the display technology. It's starting with the iMac 5k last year
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:10.120]  Yep, which was their first product with the what do they call it a deep color gamut? It's a wide wide color
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.120]  Yeah, it did right if this gets into the argument that you've had with our customers
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.800]  It did right this gets into the argument that you've had with our mutual friend gus. Mueller who technically
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.520]  edited your book gus prefers
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.080]  Deep color. Yeah, it it it
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:32.440]  He's right tech. It's technically it's deeper. You've got, you know, 16 pics or 16 bits instead of eight
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.560]  so yes, it's a it's a deeper pixel, but
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:41.800]  That only talks about the pixel and I think the reason why apple has started calling it wide colors
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:45.560]  Not only talking about the actual pixels, but it's also talking about the gamut
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.320]  which is the thing that that, you know, these displays can display more color and
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:55.320]  Yeah, it's it's not like something. It's not like retina right retina. You looked at the display and it was immediately obvious
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.600]  The the thing that i'm hearing in fact, my wife got one of these new, uh 4k
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.240]  lg displays for her new uh
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.280]  MacBook
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.800]  pro and
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.080]  it was like
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.040]  The first thing she said to me was like wow, this display looks great
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.280]  right
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.440]  Horace Horace did who said the same thing about the the uh, the ipad pro the 9.7 inch ipad pro the first
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.240]  ios device that had a uh
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:29.320]  Wide colors, please. There's something striking about display. I don't know what it is, but it's just it looks great
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.720]  it's and the the way that I explain it to people it's like the
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.440]  You know if you'd only ever had a bass speaker
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.520]  Right, you know, you've always ever listened to music on you know, a bass speaker
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.800]  And then somebody gave you a tweeter
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.600]  You would be like wow, this sounds a lot better. You know, you basically you're getting more detail
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.920]  Right, you you you you become accustomed to something and that's what retina was retina gave us more pixels
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:00.360]  people picked up it on it immediately, but then you start talking about a
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:05.880]  A wider range of tonal values and it's a lot harder to express that, you know
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.680]  It's like, you know, you give me more dynamic range in your music and it's like it sounds better
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.680]  But you don't really know why
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:17.000]  Yeah, and I don't think it's any I don't think there's any trick to which which came first
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.640]  Retina resolution is far more important. I would you know, I think everybody would agree
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.440]  I'd rather have a retina resolution without the deep gamut than to have a deep gamut display
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:31.640]  But the old pre-retina resolution, it's not right, right, but it's more important. It's more noticeable
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.720]  But the next step is clearly increasing the number of colors
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:41.320]  That's why I think apple goes with wide because I think they're describing it from the user's perspective. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:49.160]  yeah, it gives you a wider vision of of of your of your life and you know, the fact that the
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:56.280]  And you know the fact that the uh, the iphone cameras now are shooting and display p3, you know
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.280]  There's going to be a lot more
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.720]  Of these wide gamut images floating around. Um
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  You know the internet right? Well, there already are right every photo that's taken with an iphone 7 already. It's exactly
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.040]  yeah, and and and you know, we actually uh,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.680]  um
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:22.680]  the the guys at instagram, um, mike krieger and then the the crew there I gave an early version of the book because I knew
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.720]  You know, they're going to have this problem
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.680]  You know the you know, you kind of
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:35.640]  Apple loves to have apps on stage when they announce something new. It's pretty obvious to me that the display p3
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.160]  screens and cameras were coming to the next iphone
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:45.400]  Connect the dots. Okay, and i'll give them a copy of the book and it really helped them right when the ipad pro got it
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:50.920]  Yeah, when the ipad pro got the wide color gamut with the in the 9.7 form factor in march
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:56.680]  I thought it was a sure thing that the iphone would get it me too and it and and that explained, you know
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:04.040]  Again back to you know mountain lion the guys in safari changing the way things work subtly it all
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:10.600]  Kind of fell into place that okay. This is not just a mac thing. This is an ios thing
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.280]  This is you know, it turns out that the touch bar
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:18.520]  On the new macbook pros is a display p3
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.280]  gamut
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:23.340]  And on an old yeah on on an oled
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:31.000]  Yeah, so it's gonna be everywhere and and and I did not know that that's great and as developers who are just thinking that
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.560]  Who are just thinking that that that a pixel is, you know, eight bits of red eight bits of green eight bits of blue
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.200]  You're in for some surprises
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.200]  when that's no longer
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.120]  just eight bits number one and number two, it's
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.080]  characterized by an icc
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.320]  color profile
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.760]  Right a year
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.680]  that's and that's the the thing that I
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560]  I'm describing in the book
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:04.040]  Yeah, and the challenge for people working today it it'll
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.320]  I'm, not going to say it'll be easier but in a way it would be like let's fast forward 10 years
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.120]  And I think we can probably guess that
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:18.120]  10 years from now almost all commonly used devices will have the wide color displays
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.840]  Oh, and yeah, absolutely
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.360]  You know
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:25.480]  It's a competitive advantage for apple right now, right? Right?
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:30.600]  They yes, they are they're ahead of the game, right? Like they were the head of the game with retina, right?
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.160]  They're ahead of the game and a lot of technologies
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.680]  This looks better. Is it is a compelling?
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:45.480]  Competitive advantage in almost every single field. There's almost no market where this looks better than the competition is not
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.360]  Even seriously, i'm not even being a jerk
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.880]  But even like if you're selling produce if you have fresh fruit that looks better than the store across the street
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.920]  It's better. It's a competitive advantage. Yeah
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:02.280]  That's one of the things. Yeah. Yeah, that's one of the things that pissed me off about the the google pixel
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:05.000]  Comparisons with the iphone
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.280]  All the comparisons I looked at were in the srgb color space
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.720]  they had to actually take the photo that came off of the iphone and
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:15.240]  Crappify it to compare it on their
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:17.480]  You know their web page, right?
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.700]  They they we talked about this and there were some of these some of these competitions
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.860]  And or you know, like hey, let's compare the google pixel to the iphone 7 in photos
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:28.060]  it looks like whatever they did to
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:33.260]  Reduce the color gamut and some of the cases it it really washed them out
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.340]  I mean because it's there's different ways to do it
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:40.060]  there is no easy way to just say take this image that was shot with the wide color gamut and just
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.260]  do the one true way to show it on a
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:49.100]  On a right pre, you know display or it seemed like some of them converted it in a way that really washed it out
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:51.500]  Yeah, or you can if you then
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:57.900]  Decided okay. I'm going to just ignore the color profile. You've got a different problem, right? You've got color shifting
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.300]  So it's either going to wash out or it's going to shift
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.220]  so
[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.220]  you really
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:08.940]  And and that's why web developers need to start understanding this stuff, right if you're going to present this good
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:16.220]  High quality photography on your web page or in your mobile app or wherever you need to understand what you're dealing with
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.620]  and well here this
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:21.820]  That this is why I love the book. I love the book and I I
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.780]  You were kind enough to ask me to write the foreword for it
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:29.020]  Uh, and I did and I hope it turned out. All right, but no, I just want to write it forward
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:33.340]  I'm, very happy you did that as it made me the nut forward the nut of it is that
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:39.980]  What makes the book great is that you don't just say here's what to do to make your stuff look right you explain why?
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:42.780]  Right if you do this
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.820]  This is why it will look right on
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:52.620]  All of the displays you're targeting whereby right is the best it could possibly look according to your intentions as the designer
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:55.100]  Or the photographer or whatever it is that you're displaying
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:00.220]  Here's why here's what to do and why and understanding it?
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:05.260]  Makes it so much easier to remember it and it's also more satisfying because that's to me
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:09.420]  at the voodoo of before and and like the eye-opener for me was that
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:14.220]  For me the something that was completely opposite of what I expected is that sometimes in some cases
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.020]  You're actually better off you the right thing to do is not to embed a color profile, right?
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:26.700]  Right, right. Right. I've always done that and then did things don't look right my my daring fireball, you know, five eight two five eight
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.380]  Doesn't quite look right. It's like all of a sudden the background
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:38.060]  Why and then I start flipping switches and then all of a sudden i've got a exported ping that looks right here and there. Okay
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:45.580]  It's i'm happy because now i've got this asset that looks to my eyes right on both chrome and safari but because I don't know why
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:50.700]  It's like I lose a little sleep at night. Yeah, right and then you go look at it on an ipad
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:56.860]  Or an android device and it's wrong. It's like that. That's yeah, that's the classic one is like, oh
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:05.500]  So the other thing that I that I really love about this book and I think it really shows and now you even spoke about
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:08.940]  working with your editor is that it
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:15.340]  It clearly a lot of work went into what's there but then a lot of work went into taking out what's not there
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:19.500]  And there was an old adage in the print days and I know a lot of people buy their books now as ebooks
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.980]  And and for computer books in particular, that's true
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:26.380]  But in the print days there was a a real problem
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:31.740]  And people who are at least in tech books, which was that uh, and this is true
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:38.300]  I mean i've spoken to uh, I I one time I met tim o'reilly and even spoke to him about it
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:45.920]  But that they knew based on on on sales that based on topics what people would do is they'd go into the bookstore
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.300]  And they they knew they wanted to get a book on
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.500]  Sql and they did there's 12 of them so they would just buy the thickest one because they would think well
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:57.100]  They're all forty dollars. I'll just get this one that's thicker and figure it's got more
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:02.940]  Got it. There's a real correlation. I hated those books that had you know, just reams and reams of source code in the book
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:08.380]  It's like oh, and you know, they were doing it just to pad it out. Just there was there was it to be heavier
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:14.700]  a really strong provable correlation between best-selling books by topic and
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:18.620]  topics by length the the longer thicker books by
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:23.260]  Topic were tended to be the best sellers and that didn't make them the best books
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:29.340]  Sometimes the best book is is shorter. Sometimes they're you know, there are some great books some great technical books that are really thick
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.100]  You know the the programming pearl is one that I go to all the time. Yeah
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:39.180]  Larry wall and and donald newt right, you know, there's the art of computer programming that that can't be a short book
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:41.900]  Well, it takes up it takes up a whole shelf
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:46.540]  Right, that's great. But there are other books that really should be you know
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:50.380]  The fact that this is 70 pages is because there's or 75 whatever it is
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:56.060]  It's there's 75 pages to say about it. And that's the 75 pages that are in the book and it really shows
[01:59:56.220 --> 02:00:00.060]  It's like building a products. What a deal. It's like building a product right you
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:04.460]  The parts you take away are the hardest and most important
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:09.340]  Craig you should be really proud of this book anybody out there listening if you
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:16.940]  Have any sort of job that entails putting pixels onto screens and you want them to look right? I highly recommend this book
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.740]  I really do mean it. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I don't know that I've ever even written a forward to a book before
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:27.900]  Yeah, but I did it not because you're my pal, but because the book is good. I don't frankly I don't really like you that much
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.900]  Yeah
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:32.380]  I buy you drinks every once in a while. So, you know, that's
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:37.260]  There's that a book apart products, you know
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:45.100]  You know, don't just check out my book the whole book apart family that's true great
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.180]  That's true great. It's actually very I mean
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:51.580]  They've got a they've got that notion of shorter is better
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:57.580]  And you know if you're looking about anything about responsive web design, for example, hint hint
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.380]  You know, they've got an awesome book on it
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:06.540]  You know and as somebody who is personally, uh, who does judge books by covers?
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:11.900]  I I judge them by the contents too. But the whole thing you can't judge a book by the cover. It's a bunch of bullshit
