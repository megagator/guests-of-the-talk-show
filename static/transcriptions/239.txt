[00:00.000 --> 00:03.940]  How are you Renee? Happy New Year. Very good. Thank you. Happy New Year, John. We've done this
[00:03.940 --> 00:09.300]  I think I think it's a tradition at this point that we've had a sort of year in a review on the talk show with me
[00:09.300 --> 00:11.120]  And you Apple an Apple year in review
[00:11.120 --> 00:15.160]  I mean we can't do the whole year for everything because we'd be here for a whole year the whole year
[00:15.680 --> 00:19.680]  But what you know what better way to end a new year than a look back at the year
[00:19.680 --> 00:23.560]  Is that what we do honest to God I my memory is is really flushed down the toilet
[00:23.560 --> 00:25.360]  Do we do a year in review or do we do a year ahead?
[00:25.360 --> 00:28.500]  I think we do you do a year in review because we don't know what's coming up
[00:28.500 --> 00:31.180]  No, I mean we have guesses, but they're as good as anybody's
[00:31.660 --> 00:33.660]  So here's a let me start
[00:33.820 --> 00:36.460]  With a few things before we get to the year in review. I've bought
[00:38.380 --> 00:41.140]  I've in the last month. I have bought three
[00:41.980 --> 00:47.220]  Personal computers for use in my home and none of them are from Apple. Oh, wow
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.640]  and I can't remember the last time I
[00:51.460 --> 00:54.740]  Guess if you count the pixel that would count as a personal computer
[00:54.740 --> 01:00.980]  I bought a pixel three when it came out so in the last quarter. I've bought four non-apple personal computers the pixel though
[01:00.980 --> 01:05.260]  I buy one every other year, but in December. I bought three I bought
[01:05.900 --> 01:07.900]  Jonas a gaming PC
[01:07.980 --> 01:13.220]  Okay, which we set up after Christmas. I think the last episode of this show. I was talking to Jason Snell
[01:13.220 --> 01:17.120]  It was we it was in the house, and it was packaged up, but now I've got a Windows
[01:17.780 --> 01:19.780]  freaking machine running on my network
[01:19.780 --> 01:27.000]  The other two actually both well one of them inspired by my talk show last week with Jason
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.480]  I bought a Raspberry Pi finally. Yeah, I had one before
[01:31.080 --> 01:34.200]  Still haven't set it up for reasons. I will get into
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.160]  But I put that do you have my Raspberry Pi have you ever played with this I have played with them
[01:40.160 --> 01:43.580]  I don't own one currently, but I keep looking at their home kit support and just it's about it
[01:43.580 --> 01:48.580]  Well, that's what I'm that's a Jason's mention of home bridge. Which is an open source project that
[01:48.580 --> 01:54.140]  Again, I haven't gotten into it yet, but basically my understanding is home bridge is sort of it
[01:54.140 --> 01:56.740]  I think it's an I think it runs on node JS, but you don't really need to
[01:57.380 --> 01:59.660]  To know it, but you set up home bridge
[02:00.660 --> 02:03.960]  Which I think seems fairly easy to set up if your command line
[02:04.620 --> 02:07.060]  If you're vaguely familiar with command line stuff
[02:07.540 --> 02:10.240]  You run it non-stop on a machine on your network
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.640]  And then you can set up plugins which each one is configured with like a little text file
[02:15.640 --> 02:18.740]  I probably in JSON format. I haven't even looked at it
[02:18.740 --> 02:22.180]  But if it's not JSON, I'd be shocked because everything's JSON these days for good reasons
[02:22.540 --> 02:26.220]  but then you can use it if people figure out a plug-in system for a
[02:27.060 --> 02:31.820]  non home kit compatible like yeah out of things device
[02:32.300 --> 02:37.300]  Some people, you know people can figure out like maybe it's like a plug that goes in the wall socket, but it doesn't have
[02:37.980 --> 02:42.920]  Home kit device either yet or it never will but they've figured out a way to get it
[02:42.920 --> 02:45.740]  You know to do a plug-in so that home bridge can talk to it
[02:45.740 --> 02:49.340]  then you get home bridge on your home kit network and then you can
[02:49.580 --> 02:55.460]  talk to Siri and get this thing that doesn't even have home official home kit support to work on home kit and
[02:56.020 --> 02:57.680]  That's good. No, it's not even important
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.700]  I don't even have a thing but at least there's it's like the thing that put me off on buying a Raspberry Pi for years
[03:03.700 --> 03:08.180]  Even though it seems like so much fun and it's so low priced. I mean for those of you who haven't heard of it
[03:08.900 --> 03:11.700]  Basically, it is a simple little computer
[03:11.700 --> 03:16.020]  You can literally see that you just you could just run it as a motherboard. You don't even need a case for it
[03:16.260 --> 03:18.980]  It's a simple little computer with a low power arm
[03:19.820 --> 03:21.460]  processor and
[03:21.460 --> 03:25.900]  You I think they go as low as like 15 bucks 25 bucks and you know
[03:25.900 --> 03:31.980]  Like the quote-unquote good ones are like I bought a kit for like 80 bucks that comes with everything and it has Wi-Fi
[03:32.380 --> 03:35.180]  Yeah, and more it runs a special version
[03:35.180 --> 03:37.940]  Well, you can probably just probably dozens of versions of Linux
[03:37.940 --> 03:43.300]  But there's you know special versions of Linux that you install on an SD card and then it boots from that
[03:43.620 --> 03:47.720]  And you have a little computer little low-power computer that you could leave running all the time
[03:47.720 --> 03:52.660]  It's not going to take up a lot of power and if you're interested in computers in general and just seeing how they work
[03:52.660 --> 03:54.460]  It's kind of fun to have a computer
[03:54.460 --> 03:57.500]  Again, where you can just look at it and see how everything is hooked up
[03:57.500 --> 04:05.720]  I think the perfect hobbyist computer it truly truly is and it's great. It is super great. I'm sure I know I for education, right?
[04:05.720 --> 04:07.720]  yeah, because as
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.520]  Quote-unquote real computers. I mean like just take a look at the iPad Pro, right?
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.080]  Maybe the most, you know as we foreshadow the year in review, maybe the most amazing
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.640]  Hardware wise personal computer portable person
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.800]  Personal computer anybody's ever made it is truly amazing, but it is truly a black box. Yes
[04:28.520 --> 04:32.280]  It is both literally and figuratively a black box at least
[04:32.280 --> 04:34.280]  It
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.000]  Is sealed up and you don't get to look at the insides and study how they work
[04:39.240 --> 04:45.560]  Whereas the Raspberry Pi literally is an open box and he has no outside, right? But what a great way to learn the basics of
[04:46.680 --> 04:52.160]  Systems architecture then to actually have a real system that you can play with and tinker and and do stuff like that
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.000]  But I've just put it off for years because I just like well what the hell am I gonna do with it?
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.560]  And now that I have like a mission like to get this homebridge thing set up it it's like now it's like, okay now I
[05:00.560 --> 05:02.560]  now I can do it and
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.280]  then the third one I bought based on my friend Daniel Jalkett got one for Christmas and it was on a
[05:08.680 --> 05:10.680]  slack was share slack
[05:11.080 --> 05:13.720]  Mentioned it and as soon as he mentioned I'd never heard of the damn thing
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.800]  but as soon as he mentioned it, I immediately had to go buy one is I
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.920]  Didn't know this existed. I don't know how I didn't know existed a
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.960]  C64 mini. Oh, yeah, I saw him tweet about that. Yep. So it's a
[05:28.120 --> 05:30.120]  Commodore 64
[05:30.120 --> 05:35.200]  Emulator, I guess yeah comes in a adorable little
[05:36.480 --> 05:39.040]  fake like half-size Commodore 64
[05:40.400 --> 05:43.160]  It was 50 bucks. So, okay. I'm not gonna complain
[05:43.800 --> 05:50.500]  But the keys don't actually work. The keys are just sort of virtual keys, but it's it it is a looks like a door
[05:50.500 --> 05:52.280]  I wish those keys worked
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.680]  But I can't blame them for not because they're so tiny
[05:55.280 --> 05:57.280]  But it's an adorable little fake
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.360]  Commodore 64
[05:59.360 --> 06:01.360]  with HDMI out and
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.240]  USB in
[06:03.240 --> 06:05.800]  ships that the box ships with a
[06:07.360 --> 06:12.680]  Joystick of the era, you know, but it's USB it a joystick of the era's style
[06:14.200 --> 06:17.360]  But it's USB so you can just plug it right in you could buy
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.760]  Extra an extra joystick if you want to play two-player games
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.360]  HDMI out is perfect because then you can plug it into you know, you know, you wouldn't in a way
[06:26.360 --> 06:30.400]  It's these emulators, you know, Nintendo has come out with a bunch of these type things, you know
[06:30.400 --> 06:32.400]  And it's better than the actual
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.880]  Retro hardware unless you're so serious that you're gonna keep like an old CRT display. So yeah, absolutely
[06:38.880 --> 06:46.080]  and the the game the thing comes with 50 games 50 classic Commodore 64 games pre-loaded in a
[06:46.320 --> 06:51.560]  you know the ROM or whatever the hell kind of storage is inside the thing so you don't have to go hunting around the
[06:51.560 --> 06:58.240]  you know have to find your old tape drive or the you know, the darker areas of the internet where you can find disk images and
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.880]  set that up and
[06:59.880 --> 07:06.080]  It's it's a real lazy way to get this working and I haven't hooked that up yet either just because it only arrived today
[07:06.080 --> 07:08.720]  But I can't wait to so anyway
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.440]  Gaming on his high-end gaming machine and you'll be gaming on the Commodore 64
[07:14.520 --> 07:16.520]  I I
[07:16.880 --> 07:19.920]  Gave serious thought to the fact like would it have been funny on
[07:19.920 --> 07:21.920]  on Christmas morning if I
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.160]  He wouldn't know he's too smart he wouldn't have fallen yeah, and I'm not that I'm not like a prank prankster parent
[07:30.160 --> 07:36.320]  Yeah, I can't remember the last time I've played a prank on on Jonas Amy's more of the prankster parent
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.080]  One time the first time we went to Disney World 10 11 years ago, she woke him up and
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.760]  You know, he knew we were going to Disney World
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.480]  We'd had a little set up a little calendar with like a countdown and he was very excited and she woke him up and said
[07:51.480 --> 07:56.520]  Jonas we're going to Disney World and and you know, come on get ready and he bolted out of bed and
[07:57.040 --> 07:59.040]  And she said tomorrow
[08:04.720 --> 08:09.540]  See I could never bring myself to do that but I can bring myself to laugh. Yeah
[08:09.540 --> 08:14.780]  But anyway, I'm very excited about that. I think I'm more excited about the Commodore 64
[08:16.100 --> 08:20.260]  Yeah, I'm just glad there was no mention of a pixel slate in there John or I would have we've had had a stage an
[08:20.260 --> 08:22.260]  intervention
[08:23.340 --> 08:30.020]  The PC is weird. I haven't used Windows honest to God haven't used it at all and I
[08:30.980 --> 08:34.900]  Don't remember the last version of Windows that I used for more than a minute or two
[08:34.900 --> 08:39.060]  It must have been before Windows 7 though
[08:39.940 --> 08:47.100]  Well, that's I shouldn't say that I've used Windows 7 like tinkering around but only in the touch mode, you know
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.500]  like trying
[08:48.500 --> 08:50.500]  some of the newer devices
[08:53.700 --> 08:59.060]  But like using it on like a PC and like regular gooey Windows mode, I haven't used it in a while
[08:59.060 --> 09:02.400]  I have a Windows 10, but it's really just a bootloader for VR
[09:02.400 --> 09:07.760]  I don't do anything with it besides that. Yeah. Well, that's effectively what Jonas is using it for
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  Like you're running it's a shell for steam. That's what yeah more or less. I
[09:13.640 --> 09:15.000]  Will say that setting it up
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.140]  I was worried because I didn't know how to set it up, but I'd done enough research and it seemed like you know
[09:19.140 --> 09:21.140]  It would be alright
[09:22.520 --> 09:29.960]  It it is funny we got we got a we got a PC from a company called MSI MSI Trident X and I
[09:29.960 --> 09:31.080]  I
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.400]  Like I liked it because it's a small. It's sort of it's considered like an eSports case
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.920]  It's you know
[09:37.920 --> 09:43.080]  relatively small like you wouldn't call it a portable but it's smaller and a lot lighter weight than a lot of these other ones spec
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.640]  For spec so that you one could in theory easily take it to a gaming tournament or something like that
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.760]  And you look on the back of it and it's got I mean it has so many USB ports and they all have
[09:56.760 --> 10:04.440]  Weird cryptic labels that I don't understand like some of them have this SS. I think the SS means that it's USB 3.1
[10:05.520 --> 10:08.080]  Maybe and maybe higher power. I don't know
[10:09.600 --> 10:11.600]  Some of them are just for charging devices
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.800]  Some of them are clearly USB 2
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.480]  And so like he doesn't have a lot of USB stuff to hook up, you know, it's like you want to
[10:21.480 --> 10:28.280]  It connect the display to the US to USB so that you can then, you know use the display as USB hub
[10:28.920 --> 10:33.800]  I think he has his keyboard plugged directly into the the PC
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.200]  But it's like you open it up and there's a nice getting started guide and all it says is
[10:42.280 --> 10:44.720]  Connect the display keyboard etc
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.640]  To plug the power in three turn it on. That's that's the entire getting started guide
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.800]  So I just I I just want to make sure it was set up right and I'm like which you know
[10:55.800 --> 11:00.000]  Is should I be which USB port should I be using for what and I was like, well, I don't know
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  I'll take my best guess and everything worked
[11:02.160 --> 11:03.800]  I
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.800]  got him a 4k display and
[11:07.400 --> 11:11.160]  It's nice it is a very nice display it quality wise
[11:12.120 --> 11:14.840]  but like Windows 10 defaults to
[11:15.640 --> 11:17.640]  effectively running it in like
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.760]  One X mode so every everything is truly minuscule
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.280]  I mean like yeah it and with my eyes it did I
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.040]  Really have to get about three inches away from the screen to read anything and I get I'm sure I remember from the old days
[11:32.040 --> 11:38.680]  With Windows that there's some way to change what the display is right. Yeah, but I just think I find it humorous that it defaults
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.440]  To running with each pixel is the actual pixel pixel the point perfect
[11:44.440 --> 11:46.440]  Very comical
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.000]  But it you know, it was actually pretty easy. I have to give them a fair amount of credit
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.040]  It was certainly easier than setting up a PC was 10 15 years ago
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.560]  You know dip switches everywhere now no dip switches everything it's you know
[12:02.240 --> 12:05.080]  Modern connectors that all work pretty well
[12:05.080 --> 12:10.080]  you know USB for the input devices and then the display connected by I
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.680]  Think it's called DisplayPort 1.4. But you know the cables that came with the display was exactly what we needed
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.120]  You know, it was very obvious where and it was very obvious where that went and the display and where it went into the graphics
[12:23.120 --> 12:29.280]  Card on the PC and then everything my favorite things about other vendors is they often just include the cable in the box
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.040]  Yes, it was you know, everything everything came in the body and that was my and I'd done enough research
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.120]  I had done I told Jason last week. I'd done a tremendous amount of research
[12:37.120 --> 12:45.040]  like a like whatever the dollar figure is on my time it added very significantly to the cost of this PC
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.160]  I put a lot of a lot of hours into this and it seemed like everything came with it
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.600]  But it was like just my nightmare as a dad because he didn't get to set it up Christmas Day
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.640]  We went and visited family and he was a very good sport about it
[12:56.640 --> 13:02.760]  I can't I don't think I would have been nearly as good a sport if I had gotten an excellent gaming PC that I'd been
[13:02.760 --> 13:10.440]  Asking for and wanted for over two years and then to you know, have it in my hands and be told you can't open it until tomorrow
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.440]  But I didn't feel too bad because it on the 26th he still slept in so
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.440]  You know, his priorities are remarkably similar to mine
[13:21.440 --> 13:25.440]  Victory Royale has to wait. I gotta sleep in first
[13:25.440 --> 13:33.440]  But you know, it all worked windows setting getting windows set up was pretty good, you know, I don't know
[13:33.440 --> 13:41.440]  But here's here's my other story. So one of the other things I bought also because I blame Jason's now is I bought the
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.440]  The vortex race 3 mechanical keyboard that Jason talked about on the show last night
[13:46.440 --> 13:48.440]  I'll put a link in the show notes
[13:48.440 --> 13:59.440]  It's very nice. I got the cherry blue switches, I think no not blue Brown Brown Brown which are similar to blue in actuation force
[13:59.440 --> 14:01.440]  But don't click. Yeah
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.440]  And it's a fun little thing, but it
[14:05.440 --> 14:10.440]  It it it needs a firmware update apparently
[14:10.440 --> 14:18.440]  To work well on the Mac. So what you can do is there's there's
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.440]  So PC world it's you
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.440]  Out of the box you plug it into USB and if you and there's an FN key
[14:25.440 --> 14:28.440]  But the FN key on this keyboard is not the max FN key
[14:28.440 --> 14:33.440]  This FN key is specific to the keyboard itself and the Mac never stops
[14:33.440 --> 14:40.440]  It when it's pressed like there's a great little utility called key codes by Peter Maurer for the Mac
[14:40.440 --> 14:42.440]  That gives you all sorts of tech, you know
[14:42.440 --> 14:47.440]  You can fire up key codes and then when you press and release any key including a modifier key
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.440]  It tells you all sorts of stuff like developers might need to know about it like the hexadecimal representation of that key
[14:53.440 --> 15:00.440]  What it represents, you know, like it gives you like the plain English like a hexadecimal representation of that key
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.440]  What it represents, you know, like it gives you like the plain English like hey, it's the command key
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.440]  But it also gives you like the hexadecimal equivalents, etc, etc
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.440]  Anyway, when you use that utility this FN key on the keyboard doesn't doesn't even show up
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.440]  It's only for the keyboard, but you hit FN on this keyboard and L and it puts you in Linux mode
[15:19.440 --> 15:27.440]  Which as far as I can tell just means that the control key goes to caps lock and caps lock is control
[15:27.440 --> 15:36.440]  Then you can do FN M and it puts it in Mac mode, but it's it's Mac mode is not good
[15:36.440 --> 15:43.440]  Including the fact that it doesn't swap the key right next to the right side of the spacebar doesn't make it a command key
[15:43.440 --> 15:50.440]  Now you can program the key. There's a programming mode and there's a PN button for that
[15:50.440 --> 15:56.440]  But long story short it's it effectively what you want to do is you want to upgrade the firmware on this thing
[15:56.440 --> 16:03.440]  you can go to the vortex website and download a firmware update for the keyboard and then it changes it to work better on the Mac and
[16:03.440 --> 16:05.440]  Jason's has the upgraded firmware
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.440]  so I was like chatting with Jason and he's telling me but he's had it for a while and he'd sort of forgotten what he'd done to
[16:11.440 --> 16:16.440]  Upgrade it and some people apparently when they bought get open the box. It already has the upgraded firmware
[16:18.440 --> 16:25.440]  But he's on his on his keyboard which is exact same as mine hardware wise you don't do FN M to go to the Mac
[16:25.440 --> 16:31.440]  You do PN there's a PN button PNM to go to the Mac and the command key already works
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.440]  And I know you can go to the keyboard
[16:34.500 --> 16:38.320]  System prefs thing on the Mac and remap, you know
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.640]  Like the windows key to be what you want and alt keys to be command keys
[16:42.640 --> 16:43.160]  You can do that
[16:43.160 --> 16:49.720]  but the reason I wanted it to work on the keyboard hardware is if I plug it into an iPad to have those keys work the
[16:49.720 --> 16:53.100]  Right way because on the iPad you cannot do that. You can't remap the keys
[16:53.100 --> 16:55.100]  Are
[16:58.380 --> 17:01.660]  You are you with me so far yeah, it's just keyboards all the way down
[17:02.540 --> 17:08.460]  Alright, so you go to the vortex website and I have a list of firmware updates including and now here's the here's the hitch
[17:08.460 --> 17:14.380]  The hitch is the firmware is only can only be installed from Windows. It's an dot XE executable
[17:15.020 --> 17:18.140]  So the funny thing is is I probably would have bought this keyboard
[17:18.140 --> 17:26.180]  Anyway, based on Jason's recommendation in it and just scratched all the itches of a maybe I should get a nice new mechanical keyboard
[17:27.660 --> 17:32.540]  It just I mentioned them on the show last week, but like the key caps are in Helvetica not aerial
[17:33.260 --> 17:38.380]  You it comes with Mac command keys that you can replace and pop them on so it you know
[17:38.380 --> 17:42.120]  You're not looking at the stupid windows key or having alt keys next to your spacebar at blah blah blah
[17:42.700 --> 17:46.340]  I probably would have bought it anyway, but then I don't know what I would have done
[17:46.340 --> 17:48.260]  to
[17:48.260 --> 17:50.300]  Update the firmware because I didn't have a window
[17:50.300 --> 17:56.940]  I don't have I don't have windows in the house and I don't really have easy access to it and it's sort of it's it's
[17:57.580 --> 18:00.220]  People have done it but doing it through
[18:01.620 --> 18:06.040]  Like virtual PC or you know, what are the other things like that?
[18:06.780 --> 18:08.300]  VMware VMware
[18:08.300 --> 18:13.940]  It's tricky because they don't really have direct access to the hardware USB ports
[18:13.940 --> 18:16.660]  But there's a way to do it and there's a big long reddit
[18:16.660 --> 18:21.660]  You know reddit is a fantastic resource for these mechanical keyboards the mechanical keyboard nuts on reddit are
[18:22.780 --> 18:25.100]  Well, no, it's I mean it sincerely they're excellent
[18:25.100 --> 18:29.780]  Is there when they find how to do something they document it and they document it?
[18:29.780 --> 18:35.460]  Well, like literally not missing a step and being very precise about every step. So there's a way to do it
[18:35.460 --> 18:40.420]  I guess that's what I would have done, but I don't have I don't have I don't have anything set up like that
[18:40.420 --> 18:45.160]  Because I just I have no need to run Windows and it seems kind of ridiculous
[18:45.860 --> 18:49.980]  To set up an entire virtual machine running Windows just to update the firmware on my keyboard
[18:49.980 --> 18:55.980]  But anyway, as luck would have it. I now have a brand new Windows PC in the house. So I
[18:57.420 --> 18:59.420]  Go up there and
[18:59.540 --> 19:04.120]  Jonas has had it. This was yesterday. I think so. He's had the had the thing for
[19:04.940 --> 19:06.940]  two days
[19:06.940 --> 19:13.380]  I'm playing a lot of games mostly through steam. I say hey, can I use your computer for a bit? I
[19:14.660 --> 19:16.660]  Want to set up this former and he said, okay sure
[19:17.820 --> 19:23.040]  So I go to the vortex website on the PC and there's the XE and it's got like a weird
[19:23.660 --> 19:29.980]  Filename, you know vortex something blah blah blah dot XE and I download it and it's only like three megabytes
[19:29.980 --> 19:31.980]  So it doesn't take long and then I get prompted
[19:31.980 --> 19:36.020]  And what do you want to do with this download? You want to run it or save it or I?
[19:36.860 --> 19:42.500]  Forget what the third option is. I said run and I said to run it and I got a weird error
[19:43.220 --> 19:50.740]  For it seemed like a Windows error not a browser error Windows error that whatever I tried to run in the like
[19:51.100 --> 19:55.580]  Jonas slash download slash whatever it was I tried to run
[19:56.340 --> 19:59.220]  Didn't exist or something and I thought that's weird
[19:59.220 --> 20:02.980]  I thought maybe maybe like it so I thought maybe it's a safety issue for the browser
[20:02.980 --> 20:05.960]  They don't want you running executables. You download it right from the browser
[20:05.960 --> 20:11.260]  You got a so I tried it again and hit save and then I went to Windows the file explorer
[20:11.260 --> 20:17.780]  I went to his downloads and he needs a brand new computer. There's only like six files in there. One of them was like the
[20:18.980 --> 20:20.980]  fortnight thing
[20:22.300 --> 20:26.860]  Two or three others that clearly weren't it and then there's one that was vortex something something dot XE
[20:26.860 --> 20:32.580]  I thought well, there it is. Obviously, there's only six files in here and I double-click it and it launches this thing
[20:33.580 --> 20:39.220]  It doesn't look anything like a firmware installer. It's like it's like it looks like an alternative to steam
[20:39.220 --> 20:46.180]  it's like a sort of a steam like interface except it's brown and it's it's got like all this stuff about game mods and
[20:47.860 --> 20:51.420]  mods for just cause for which is a PC game and I
[20:51.420 --> 20:56.540]  I hunted from its big window and I hunted from the top left to the bottom right and
[20:56.780 --> 21:01.220]  Looking for something about either keyboards or firmware or something and there's nothing in it
[21:01.300 --> 21:07.540]  It's absolutely no way and I've got the keyboard plugged in. I thought well, maybe I don't maybe just does it automatically
[21:07.540 --> 21:12.820]  I don't know. It's just weirdest, you know, maybe it just installs the firmware and then they're trying to sell you on this
[21:13.380 --> 21:15.380]  game mod stuff I
[21:15.580 --> 21:18.740]  don't know and but I take the keyboard and unplug it and
[21:18.740 --> 21:23.500]  Not it's the same. It's clearly it doesn't seem like I got the firmware
[21:25.180 --> 21:29.580]  And I tried it again this was through it Microsoft Edge tried it again through Chrome
[21:29.620 --> 21:36.620]  Which is one of the things Jonas had already installed same the same thing. It just launches this other thing that looks like this
[21:37.180 --> 21:38.620]  gaming thing
[21:38.620 --> 21:45.020]  And I seriously I blew like an hour and a half on this and I'm looking I'm searching the web for
[21:45.020 --> 21:48.820]  Anybody who had this problem and it seems like everybody
[21:49.540 --> 21:55.620]  Who upgraded the firmware all these Mac users who upgraded the firmware and I guess who even Windows users want to upgrade the firmware
[21:55.620 --> 21:57.780]  There's a couple other features on the keyboard
[21:58.020 --> 22:04.540]  nobody seemed to have a problem with it and then I finally found a post where they had screenshots of the of the firmware installer and
[22:04.540 --> 22:10.940]  It looked exactly like what you would think a Windows firmware installer would look like just a tiny little dialog box that
[22:10.940 --> 22:17.980]  It tells you the version number that of the firmware you're installing the version of the firmware
[22:17.980 --> 22:23.220]  That's of on the keyboard that's plugged in right now and then a button that says update. I
[22:24.300 --> 22:29.860]  Don't say I don't see a dialog box like that at all. There's no mention of this other crazy big steam like interface
[22:31.220 --> 22:35.420]  So I try it one more time and I as I've mentioned so 27 inch display
[22:35.420 --> 22:37.900]  I've got to keep my face pretty close to it this time
[22:37.900 --> 22:42.660]  I noticed as I downloaded a tiny little white box in the lower right corner
[22:43.540 --> 22:45.660]  sort of like like like a
[22:46.900 --> 22:51.680]  Notification center thing on the Mac but in the lower right corner instead of the upper, right?
[22:52.060 --> 22:57.580]  It's it's on screen for about I don't know second and a half and it was something something Norton
[22:59.820 --> 23:05.140]  So what was happening was I would download the vortex thing the
[23:05.140 --> 23:09.140]  The firmware updater Norton took a look at it, which I didn't know
[23:09.140 --> 23:13.260]  I guess Norton came pre-installed on the on his PC. We certainly didn't install it
[23:13.820 --> 23:16.820]  Norton took a look at it and said this is a dangerous download
[23:16.820 --> 23:19.580]  We're going to remove it and then give you an edit
[23:19.580 --> 23:24.120]  But this tiny little dialog in the lower right corner is only up for a second and a half and it goes away
[23:24.660 --> 23:26.660]  so I go into Norton I
[23:26.940 --> 23:29.260]  Take that that thing and say no
[23:29.260 --> 23:34.780]  I want I do want I trust this restore it and then it puts it back in the downloads and it's an entirely different
[23:34.780 --> 23:40.300]  Thing I double-click it. It shows me the dialogue that I wanted to see which is the
[23:41.700 --> 23:45.420]  You know a very obvious firmware updater it updates the firmware
[23:46.260 --> 23:47.820]  and
[23:47.820 --> 23:52.480]  Tells me everything was okay with okay spelled with a lowercase K, of course
[23:53.140 --> 23:58.740]  And then my keyboards updated to the newest firmware. Although of course, I had to run it twice the first time it gave me a
[23:58.740 --> 24:00.580]  weird error
[24:00.580 --> 24:06.300]  So what it had happened long story short what had happened is there is an entirely separate thing called vortex
[24:06.300 --> 24:12.900]  Which is a thing for gamers on the PC to install like game mods and stuff and it just so happened
[24:13.060 --> 24:18.980]  Yeah, that was one of one of three things Jonas had downloaded in the two days. He's had it like what are the odds?
[24:19.900 --> 24:21.900]  Like so I blew two hours
[24:22.220 --> 24:24.220]  Wow two hours
[24:24.660 --> 24:30.420]  Because I just assumed that with five items in his downloads folder and one of them being called vortex
[24:30.420 --> 24:35.300]  That that was the thing I had just downloaded and even though the file name wasn't exactly the same as the thing that I saw
[24:35.300 --> 24:36.940]  When I hovered over the mouse in the web browser
[24:36.940 --> 24:42.460]  I just figured that the thing that I downloaded when I hovered was like a dot XE zip
[24:42.860 --> 24:48.220]  Executable that unzipped to show me this. I mean it's called vortex and there's only five things in the downloads folder
[24:48.220 --> 24:49.780]  And one of them was fortnight
[24:49.780 --> 24:51.780]  What the fuck are the odds?
[24:51.780 --> 25:00.820]  That he had downloaded another thing from an entirely separate company had nothing to do with keyboards entirely do with things called vortex
[25:00.820 --> 25:04.220]  Thank God you saw that Norton box. You'd still be there. That was my day yesterday
[25:06.140 --> 25:09.540]  This is why I didn't have a chance to set up the Raspberry Pi yet
[25:10.620 --> 25:15.620]  Computers are labor-saving devices. All right. Here's my other problem. I ran into my other problem. I ran into is
[25:17.020 --> 25:19.020]  Jonas had been yeah, I had a 27 inch
[25:19.020 --> 25:24.380]  Thunderbolt display from Apple that I had used until and then I replaced that
[25:25.100 --> 25:29.100]  Or I took it off my desk when I got the my retina 5k iMac
[25:29.180 --> 25:34.380]  Which I don't even know it might be four years old because I got the first one when they're in a 5k
[25:34.380 --> 25:40.340]  I max came out. I bought it. I still use it running great. It's one of the best things I've ever bought
[25:40.860 --> 25:41.900]  so the
[25:41.900 --> 25:48.140]  My my Thunderbolt display went to Jonas at the time and became his desktop thing that he'd plug his MacBook Pro into
[25:48.140 --> 25:50.820]  When he wanted to use a bigger display or play games, etc
[25:51.100 --> 25:55.500]  Now that he has a gaming PC with a new display now that becomes a hand-me-down again
[25:55.500 --> 26:00.860]  And so I thought vaguely well, I could just use that as my spare display and like at least for setting up
[26:00.860 --> 26:03.700]  I like ultimately I plan to run the Raspberry Pi headless
[26:03.700 --> 26:09.460]  But I could yeah put this in and maybe I could use it to play the switch use it as a TV when people you
[26:09.460 --> 26:10.340]  Know, I don't know
[26:10.340 --> 26:17.260]  I I just figured I'd buy a little adapter to let HDMI input work on the Thunderbolt display and then I could hook up any
[26:17.260 --> 26:22.300]  You know like the switch or the Raspberry Pi or anything that takes HDMI out and use it
[26:23.700 --> 26:30.140]  And then I I didn't I did I just hadn't thought it through I didn't realize that thunderbolt really means thunderbolt
[26:30.140 --> 26:36.580]  and there's nothing that can drive the thunderbolt display other than thunderbolt and the only adapter that exists is
[26:37.900 --> 26:42.020]  Because it's it's a you need to plug it into a thunderbolt to port, you know
[26:42.020 --> 26:45.780]  The Thunderbolt display has has one plug and that's it
[26:45.780 --> 26:49.700]  well, there's power and then there's thunderbolt and then Apple has a
[26:50.460 --> 26:56.420]  Dongle that'll turn it into you at Thunderbolt 3 aka the thing that looks just like USB C. Yes
[26:56.860 --> 27:00.180]  So we and we have that dongle because you know
[27:00.180 --> 27:04.820]  We have Macs and MacBooks in the house now that only have that that USB C and that works perfectly
[27:05.020 --> 27:09.820]  There is no way because Thunderbolt like the monitor if you think about it, it doesn't even have a power button
[27:09.820 --> 27:16.300]  Oh, yeah, like so and and the thing that's frustrating is that Thunderbolt 2?
[27:17.300 --> 27:18.580]  looks like
[27:18.580 --> 27:19.780]  DisplayPort
[27:19.780 --> 27:20.980]  one
[27:20.980 --> 27:27.300]  Yes, a boy Thunderbolt carries display. Yes, it carries display for it, but it only works one way
[27:27.940 --> 27:29.940]  so you could
[27:30.780 --> 27:33.460]  Use your Thunderbolt Mac
[27:33.460 --> 27:40.980]  To drive a DisplayPort display, but the Thunderbolt display needs to go into a Thunderbolt Jack
[27:40.980 --> 27:47.300]  And there is it's literally like technically impossible to have a dongle that would I remember years ago
[27:47.300 --> 27:52.660]  They're being a ridiculously expensive dongle like 300 bucks or something. That's split HDMI into
[27:53.060 --> 27:57.260]  DisplayPort and audio separately and I guess never justify buying it
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.900]  Yeah, and I think that you could theoretically like set up an entire computer
[28:01.900 --> 28:03.900]  to
[28:05.020 --> 28:10.020]  Sit between them like you can set up like a Mac mini that because HDMI carries DisplayPort as well
[28:10.020 --> 28:12.900]  But who knows if what what the different standards are now, right?
[28:12.900 --> 28:14.460]  But so there's another one there
[28:14.460 --> 28:20.540]  There was another hour or two of my time gone by if people are people are wondering people are looking at during fireball thinking
[28:20.540 --> 28:25.620]  It's been relatively quiet this week and they think well, I'll bet John is just having a you know, a nice
[28:26.500 --> 28:29.860]  Relaxing vacation. It's it's that I've been chasing these rabbit holes
[28:29.860 --> 28:34.700]  But so now I've got a 27-inch Thunderbolt display that is in perfect working condition
[28:34.700 --> 28:40.460]  And I have devices that I would like to hook up to a spare display. Yeah, and
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.980]  There is no way to
[28:43.060 --> 28:47.740]  Connect them together and I had this moment where it was it was like
[28:49.180 --> 28:52.300]  You know ultimately expressed in the words it was like ah fucking Apple
[28:54.020 --> 28:58.660]  Right, it's like it's a very appley situation and now I'm stuck with
[28:58.660 --> 29:01.740]  This display with a terrific technology thunderbolt
[29:02.940 --> 29:06.540]  But because it really only ever was a thing in the Apple universe
[29:06.540 --> 29:11.900]  It is no good for hooking up to anything other than Apple products. I mean, it's an Intel technology
[29:11.900 --> 29:15.180]  It was supposed to go everywhere, but I think everyone else just looked at it and went no. No
[29:15.180 --> 29:22.380]  Yeah, very similar very similar story historically to firewire, which was never intended to be Mac only either wasn't really an Apple technology
[29:22.380 --> 29:25.860]  I think that might have been Intel too or no Intel was always behind USB
[29:25.860 --> 29:33.060]  Sony called it IEE something like they'd put that weird name on yeah, but they were really it was intended to be totally cross-platform
[29:33.060 --> 29:36.180]  But USB just sort of killed it effectively
[29:36.180 --> 29:41.060]  But we Mac users were you know using our iPods with firewire ports
[29:43.940 --> 29:46.980]  But now I don't and then here's the other thing of me
[29:46.980 --> 29:54.660]  You know it is a very unique to my Apple centric lifestyle is that I don't have I don't I literally don't have a display image
[29:54.660 --> 29:58.260]  I literally don't have a display in my house that I can hook these things up to a spare display
[29:58.260 --> 30:00.260]  I've got TV. I've got a TV set
[30:01.540 --> 30:07.100]  You know I guess I could hook it up to that, but I'm actually thinking about buying just some piece of crap
[30:07.100 --> 30:09.100]  You know $150 Dell
[30:09.260 --> 30:11.860]  Display just so I have something like that
[30:11.860 --> 30:13.860]  And I think at my old house
[30:14.140 --> 30:18.260]  Like we moved two years ago, and I got rid of a lot of stuff that I didn't think I'd ever need again
[30:18.260 --> 30:22.500]  I'm pretty sure I had something that some kind of display that I could have hooked this up to
[30:22.500 --> 30:24.500]  but like I've
[30:25.060 --> 30:27.500]  You know I got talked into throwing a lot of stuff out
[30:28.820 --> 30:34.580]  The old server closet display. Do you have anything like do you have it like if you needed to hook up a Raspberry Pi?
[30:35.100 --> 30:40.020]  To display do you have like a spare display around I have like the LG?
[30:40.660 --> 30:44.660]  5k display that's only Thunderbolt 3 so I play be just as crap out of luck is yeah
[30:44.660 --> 30:49.820]  I'll bet you'd be just I bet the Raspberry Pi would cry if it yes to drive a 5k display
[30:49.820 --> 30:55.940]  Yeah, and maybe there's a USB. Maybe there's an HDMI dongle, but I don't probably have one around here right that at least yeah
[30:55.940 --> 30:59.340]  And I think yeah, I think to drive 5k. I don't think a
[30:59.860 --> 31:01.860]  HDMI I'll do it no
[31:02.660 --> 31:06.300]  So I don't know what to do. I guess you know it just feels like such a waste to buy a
[31:07.300 --> 31:12.660]  It just seems like something. I should have sitting around right yes, and I'll blow how should come with them
[31:12.660 --> 31:15.140]  I'll blow 150 bucks on anything
[31:15.140 --> 31:19.900]  Yeah, but it just feels like a waste to blow it on a display that I don't want
[31:24.220 --> 31:26.220]  How was your Christmas
[31:26.220 --> 31:29.060]  It was good. I mean I was I was dumb I forgot to
[31:29.820 --> 31:31.380]  to cancel
[31:31.380 --> 31:35.100]  Sponsorships for the week, so I had to just keep making videos if I was smarter
[31:35.100 --> 31:39.260]  I would have taken the week off, but no nowhere near that smart. I I every single year
[31:39.260 --> 31:42.220]  I need to do more like I'm not really a journaler
[31:42.220 --> 31:46.460]  I don't really have an interest in journaling, but I'm sort of a note to self er
[31:46.460 --> 31:48.540]  I write notes to my future self
[31:48.540 --> 31:52.720]  And I really need to write one this year about how to do the holidays
[31:52.720 --> 31:57.900]  And they really get pound it through my thick head that you're not gonna. You're not gonna. You're not gonna. Do a damn thing
[31:58.500 --> 32:00.500]  Yes after
[32:00.700 --> 32:07.020]  December 22nd or so yeah, yeah, you just don't don't plan on it. You know maybe a podcast
[32:07.020 --> 32:11.140]  You know that that seems like fun, but and like real people with real jobs
[32:11.140 --> 32:13.380]  They do this they black out periods they take weeks off
[32:13.380 --> 32:16.940]  They managed to do all these things that I just feel helpless looking at well
[32:16.940 --> 32:20.940]  I just always have these grand plans, and I just think oh the whole world would be quiet
[32:20.940 --> 32:24.020]  I will get so much work done. I'm gonna write so many great
[32:24.020 --> 32:28.520]  I have a couple of long pieces in the back of my head that have been gestating
[32:28.740 --> 32:32.820]  They're all gonna. I'm gonna have all this time to get them out, and it's like no it doesn't work that way at all
[32:32.820 --> 32:34.540]  Yeah, no
[32:34.540 --> 32:36.540]  It's everything gets in your way
[32:36.540 --> 32:42.260]  Oh, let me take a break. Thank our first sponsor, and then we'll get into this year in review
[32:44.220 --> 32:48.980]  It's Casper look Casper products are designed by humans for humans
[32:50.060 --> 32:52.940]  They make mattresses they make all sorts of other
[32:53.900 --> 32:57.700]  Sleep products too. They're focused on sleep truly
[32:59.340 --> 33:06.180]  Their original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with just the right amount of both sink and
[33:06.180 --> 33:07.260]  bounce
[33:07.260 --> 33:13.160]  As a breathable design helps you sleep cool and regulate your body temperature throughout the night
[33:14.740 --> 33:21.980]  They have over two twenty thousand reviews and an average of four point eight stars across the Casper website itself Amazon and Google
[33:22.540 --> 33:24.540]  It's the Internet's favorite mattress
[33:25.180 --> 33:30.980]  They offer two other mattresses to the wave and the essential the wave is their high-end product
[33:30.980 --> 33:37.740]  It features their patent-pending premium support system to mirror the natural shape of your body and the essential is their streamlined design
[33:37.980 --> 33:39.980]  With a price that won't keep you up at night
[33:40.860 --> 33:46.900]  And they really do they have a wide array of other products like pillows and sheets, and they're really great
[33:46.900 --> 33:50.540]  We've we've gotten some of this stuff, and it's all really really great quality
[33:50.540 --> 33:55.140]  And it's all designed developed and assembled right here in the US
[33:55.140 --> 34:01.220]  Now internet mattresses. I'm telling you. It's a crazy thing and it's the it's really the one of the best of
[34:01.620 --> 34:06.100]  The whole shift from going to actual brick and mortar to buying this stuff on the internet
[34:06.100 --> 34:08.940]  It's going to a mattress store is pain in the ass and
[34:09.660 --> 34:12.700]  You're not actually sleeping on the mattress even if you sit on it
[34:12.700 --> 34:16.580]  And you know what are you gonna? Do lay down on a mattress in a store gross?
[34:17.340 --> 34:20.420]  You're not gonna sleep anyway, so just laying on it for a minute
[34:20.420 --> 34:22.740]  What the hell is that gonna teach you if it's a good thing to sleep on?
[34:22.740 --> 34:24.580]  Get it on the internet
[34:24.580 --> 34:30.180]  It shows up from Casper in a remarkably small box for a big mattress
[34:30.980 --> 34:36.740]  That's the magic of these foam technology things you take the box up to the room where you want it
[34:37.260 --> 34:39.980]  Unpack it sucks all the oxygen out of the room
[34:40.820 --> 34:43.940]  And then you know opens up there. It is you've got this mattress
[34:44.660 --> 34:49.460]  Here's the thing the delivery you don't have to worry about it the setup is easy
[34:49.460 --> 34:55.220]  And then you've got a hundred night risk-free sleep on it trial a hundred nights where you can just sleep on it
[34:55.220 --> 34:58.300]  And you get to the end of that three months, and if you don't like it
[34:58.820 --> 35:05.500]  You just go on a website say take it back. They come pick it up. Give you all your money back. No questions asked
[35:06.020 --> 35:08.020]  You can't lose
[35:08.660 --> 35:12.420]  It's really great. We've got multiple Casper mattresses here in
[35:13.540 --> 35:15.540]  talk-show world headquarters and
[35:15.540 --> 35:19.940]  Talk show world headquarters and everybody loves them. They're great
[35:20.780 --> 35:26.780]  They last long the one that we got from a longtime listeners of the show will know that Casper has been sponsoring this show
[35:26.780 --> 35:28.780]  For quite a long time and the first one we got
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.620]  Which I think is now in Jonas's
[35:32.980 --> 35:35.820]  Has been with us for years seems
[35:36.380 --> 35:38.580]  in every single regard brand new
[35:39.380 --> 35:44.520]  Really great long lasting stuff high quality product. Here's their special offer for listeners of the show
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.520]  You can save 50 bucks

[35:58.660 --> 36:02.340]  At checkout and you can save 50 bucks towards select mattresses
[36:02.340 --> 36:13.340]  Casper comm slash talk-show special code talk-show terms and conditions to apply. Ah, I
[36:15.460 --> 36:17.460]  Tell you I found this whole thing I
[36:18.660 --> 36:22.500]  got worried with the keyboard thing that it was I
[36:23.620 --> 36:26.180]  Like I knew I was in an unfamiliar territory
[36:26.180 --> 36:28.620]  I knew this is why I like Apple products, right?
[36:28.620 --> 36:32.840]  But I got to tell you I got worried that I was that this was a sign that I was getting old
[36:33.100 --> 36:35.100]  right, it seems to me like
[36:36.380 --> 36:42.860]  Seems to me as a computer enthusiast in general one ought to be able to figure out how to update the firmware on a device. I
[36:45.260 --> 36:49.660]  I still mean what are the odds he did downloaded three things and one of them was named. Yeah
[36:53.060 --> 36:57.420]  And the stupid Norton was hiding the other one if he had if it hadn't hid the other one
[36:57.420 --> 37:00.340]  I would have seen the two and thought well which is which and I would have you know
[37:00.340 --> 37:03.580]  Even if I guess wrong first when I open the second one, it would have been pretty obvious
[37:05.780 --> 37:11.460]  And whoever sold the computer probably deleted the perfectly good Microsoft built-in stuff just to put Norton nonsense on there anyway
[37:11.460 --> 37:15.780]  Yeah, I don't know what to do about that. That's that's the other thing. I I still find window
[37:15.780 --> 37:20.620]  I find it to be if anything in some ways better like the first run experience was better than ever
[37:20.620 --> 37:24.100]  But ultimately just sort of poking around the start menu. It is so
[37:24.100 --> 37:27.540]  What's the word Baroque? It is?
[37:28.980 --> 37:31.620]  It just seems like a labyrinth of
[37:32.580 --> 37:38.420]  Levels of what the hell is going on where and why and where does it all go?
[37:40.340 --> 37:44.900]  It just seems like to make to create the facade of this being simpler
[37:45.180 --> 37:50.420]  They've just continued to build scaffolding on the old stuff that's always been there
[37:50.420 --> 37:54.140]  it feels like digging an ancient Greece or ancient Rome and knowing there's just like
[37:55.100 --> 38:01.940]  Infinite amounts of other cities that have been buried underneath you. Yeah, I do vaguely worry that Apple is going a little bit in that regard
[38:01.940 --> 38:03.940]  too
[38:04.460 --> 38:09.180]  You know like I get it like what you like with Safari extensions
[38:09.300 --> 38:12.960]  Like I get it that you don't really want to be
[38:13.220 --> 38:18.100]  They don't want people dealing with the finder to do it and download a thing and then go to
[38:18.100 --> 38:19.860]  home
[38:19.860 --> 38:21.500]  library
[38:21.500 --> 38:24.540]  Safari extensions and put it there, you know
[38:25.180 --> 38:27.180]  but I worry that it's
[38:27.580 --> 38:33.940]  You know that there's too much magic behind the scenes with with where stuff actually is in the file system now
[38:34.380 --> 38:40.180]  And you think that poke apocalyptic future where one guy dies and on no one knows how to maintain anything anymore like objects
[38:40.460 --> 38:47.060]  Right, and it's you know, it is similar similar with the the past the actual honest to God
[38:47.060 --> 38:52.660]  What is on the file system path to stuff in iCloud, you know where it's all in these
[38:53.580 --> 38:57.340]  Weird long directories abstracted containers, right?
[38:58.340 --> 39:04.500]  like I get the I get the desire for the user experience of abstracting that but I
[39:05.020 --> 39:08.820]  Don't know there was it's it kind of irks me
[39:10.020 --> 39:15.460]  That the whole thing isn't as clean as it used to be right like when Michael Apple calm thing
[39:15.460 --> 39:21.420]  Right, like these the URLs are all perfectly human readable and other sites have all these crazy URLs that no human could possibly parse
[39:21.620 --> 39:25.200]  And you just want iCloud stuff super give it to me
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.980]  But let me go to a slash user slash iCloud and see all my file right exactly, right? That is really what I
[39:32.340 --> 39:36.060]  There must have been a debate inside but I really do feel like it should have been just been
[39:37.420 --> 39:38.580]  You know
[39:38.580 --> 39:45.580]  Slat twiddle slash Gruber slash iCloud slash and there's all the stuff and maybe even you know
[39:45.580 --> 39:48.500]  And and the one thing that they've done in recent years that I you know
[39:48.500 --> 39:53.900]  Maybe is what they should have done with that is like the way that they made the library folder invisible by default
[39:54.260 --> 39:56.580]  Sure, and so, okay you you
[39:57.420 --> 40:01.980]  Jane or Joe typical user buy a new Mac and you open up your home folder
[40:01.980 --> 40:06.540]  You don't see the library folder and you shouldn't need to but if you're vaguely interested in
[40:06.540 --> 40:10.820]  In you know tinkering with stuff in there manually
[40:11.500 --> 40:17.620]  You could google and quickly find out that you know starting inversion whatever the library folder is invisible
[40:17.740 --> 40:21.560]  You can make it visible with this simple these simple steps
[40:22.300 --> 40:28.820]  It will stay visible afterwards and there there you go. Now you know you have easy visible access to your library folder
[40:28.820 --> 40:30.820]  I think they could do the same thing with iCloud
[40:30.980 --> 40:34.380]  Everything on the Mac should be like that because that's the whole virtue of having a Mac, right?
[40:34.380 --> 40:38.820]  And then it's nice clean simple, you know
[40:40.260 --> 40:43.420]  directory names and structure, I mean, it's it's I
[40:44.460 --> 40:47.460]  Always say like I like to say I like to use the term
[40:49.180 --> 40:53.340]  You know like when Apple bought next and at the end of 1996
[40:53.740 --> 40:57.940]  I mean literally I guess that anniversary just passed it was right around Christmas
[40:58.460 --> 41:02.580]  Because if effectively because of that, you know, like we said like this week is sort of a dead week
[41:02.580 --> 41:05.260]  It really didn't take effect till January 1997
[41:06.020 --> 41:13.220]  And the joke half joke has been that it was a you know reverse that it was next that acquired Apple
[41:14.180 --> 41:17.860]  because certainly ultimately with Steve Jobs and Devanian and
[41:18.320 --> 41:21.060]  Scott for stall and a whole bunch of other people, you know
[41:21.060 --> 41:26.820]  The senior leadership of the company largely came from the next side, you know and wiped out most of the Apple side
[41:28.260 --> 41:30.260]  especially technologies people wise
[41:30.260 --> 41:36.420]  But I like to call it a reunification like to me I do and I mean this sincerely
[41:36.420 --> 41:41.500]  I I really do think that when you look at it historically that when Jobs was exiled from Apple and
[41:41.740 --> 41:45.100]  Founded next he founded a company with very Apple like
[41:48.620 --> 41:52.580]  Sensibilities, I mean well, you know, maybe it's just job
[41:52.580 --> 41:57.380]  You know that Apple was founded with Jobs like sensibilities and next was founded, but it attracted people
[41:57.380 --> 42:02.020]  It's not just Steve Jobs, but it's you know, it said it attracted people who want
[42:03.140 --> 42:08.780]  The the file the folder names at the root level of the hard disk to be sensible. Yeah, right
[42:10.260 --> 42:13.580]  You know, it's not just technologists, right and
[42:14.380 --> 42:19.660]  to have like a graceful level and and and like the next idea of
[42:20.380 --> 42:22.260]  having
[42:22.260 --> 42:27.780]  System slash library slash all this stuff for the everything that affects all users
[42:30.100 --> 42:36.420]  And you shouldn't be messed with because it's the system level then a root level library folder that also affects all users
[42:36.620 --> 42:43.180]  So you could install fonts in there and then two users on the same computer would have access to the same fonts because they were
[42:43.180 --> 42:47.580]  in slash library slash fonts and then home slash
[42:48.420 --> 42:50.060]  library
[42:50.060 --> 42:54.100]  For stuff that's just for that user. What a graceful beautiful system
[42:54.220 --> 43:01.460]  So easily understood makes perfect sense, even the words they choose like system for the ones that you really shouldn't be messing with
[43:02.740 --> 43:04.740]  It couldn't think of a better word for it
[43:05.380 --> 43:11.320]  You know, what a great Apple like sensibility it made it was all felt very Apple like when it became Mac OS X
[43:12.460 --> 43:16.120]  It with the extension of their dependence on file name extensions, which I yeah. Yeah
[43:16.120 --> 43:18.880]  Oh won't get into here. I'll wait for
[43:19.760 --> 43:21.980]  John Syracuse to return this should come back. Yeah
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  anyway
[43:26.160 --> 43:28.160]  Windows doesn't have that
[43:30.200 --> 43:36.320]  You're in review, where do you want to start? Yes. I mean we started last year coming off the performance
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.820]  The performance issues like that that sort of dominated the holidays
[43:41.820 --> 43:45.620]  Is where people were talking about the iPhones being slowed down?
[43:47.420 --> 43:50.540]  That was last year boy that seems like a long time ago that was holiday
[43:50.540 --> 43:53.260]  That's why none of us had a holiday last year, right? All right. All right
[43:53.260 --> 43:57.420]  I got some reason I had that is two years ago, but now that you mention it. Yeah, that was last year
[43:57.420 --> 43:59.420]  so that that was the big gate was
[44:00.660 --> 44:04.980]  That Apple and then you know what the worst part is is it's kind of stuck with them, right?
[44:04.980 --> 44:08.220]  It's just one of those things that once it's out there
[44:08.220 --> 44:14.300]  You know this idea that Apple purpose purposefully slows your iPhone down so that you'll buy a new iPhone
[44:14.700 --> 44:20.100]  Yes, when in fact what they were doing was slowing your iPhone down so that it would continue to function at all
[44:20.500 --> 44:25.560]  Yeah, it wouldn't spike and it wouldn't turn off the bat. It wouldn't overcharge the battery and turn off the the phone
[44:27.340 --> 44:33.320]  You know and I think I recall you and I were of similar mind that there that the mistake they made wasn't the throttling the
[44:33.320 --> 44:39.900]  Mistake they made was the lack of transparency and that they didn't say they didn't present an alert
[44:39.900 --> 44:47.120]  You know and and I've been on this for years that a big problem with modern Apple is the silent failures, you know
[44:47.120 --> 44:48.140]  and
[44:48.140 --> 44:50.700]  You know say what you want about the old
[44:51.440 --> 44:54.700]  Classic era, you know when something would go wrong and you'd get an air
[44:54.700 --> 45:01.220]  It's something hopefully you'd get something with a nice human description of what went wrong, but a lot of times you'd get error negative
[45:01.760 --> 45:03.020]  69
[45:03.020 --> 45:08.140]  And at least you had something that you could search for right you
[45:08.900 --> 45:13.700]  You'd at least know and at least you'd recognize that the computer knows that something went wrong, right?
[45:13.700 --> 45:16.180]  You'd feel validated or vindicate or something, right?
[45:16.180 --> 45:18.060]  Like, you know just imagine printing, you know
[45:18.060 --> 45:24.260]  and you have a document and you've printed you've used this printer before and you hit command P and then you hit return and
[45:24.660 --> 45:28.340]  and to see something and then the dialogue disappears and
[45:28.340 --> 45:34.380]  And nothing ever comes out of your printer. Yeah, right and they're not that your computer doesn't say anything and the printer doesn't say anything
[45:34.860 --> 45:36.860]  like that is really that's
[45:37.340 --> 45:39.860]  it just it's harder to fix and
[45:40.740 --> 45:42.740]  it is
[45:43.820 --> 45:48.700]  Unsatisfying like it's frustrating if you get an error that says, you know
[45:48.700 --> 45:53.340]  I don't know something's wrong with the printer driver or something, you know, but whatever it's frustrating
[45:53.340 --> 45:58.780]  But at least you have something that you know where to start the silent failure is very very frustrating
[45:59.580 --> 46:01.540]  and
[46:01.540 --> 46:03.820]  silent throttling of your
[46:05.220 --> 46:10.340]  Performance is similarly frustrating right like you can tell your iPhone is slower
[46:11.300 --> 46:13.140]  But you don't know why
[46:13.140 --> 46:18.120]  It's it's frustrating. And I think the worst part is that people's guess as to why is
[46:18.120 --> 46:22.880]  Raw was wrong. I don't think people people guessed exactly at the reason
[46:22.880 --> 46:29.360]  I think people guessed that it was sort of like and especially people who aren't most iPhone users aren't longtime Mac users
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.440]  I think you know most people their experience with computers is with Windows and Windows rots over time
[46:34.640 --> 46:37.580]  You know you use a Windows computer for a couple of years
[46:37.580 --> 46:44.360]  I don't know if it's still true, but at least you know for a long time. Yeah, right it it's it gets slower because
[46:44.360 --> 46:47.360]  Also accumulation all that cruft. Yeah, right
[46:48.200 --> 46:50.040]  That's just what happens, you know
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.640]  Whereas the actual answer is the opposite like this people were just immediately assuming that Apple was slowing down your phone to try to trick
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.360]  You into buying a new phone where Apple was slowing down your phone to try to make that phone last as long as possible
[47:00.360 --> 47:01.880]  So you wouldn't have to go
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.840]  Right and the solution that if you could take it if you took it in and got a replacement battery
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.560]  would cost a lot less than a new phone and would restore the phone to its
[47:12.560 --> 47:14.560]  peak performance
[47:14.900 --> 47:16.020]  because
[47:16.020 --> 47:20.620]  That was the whole thing. The whole problem was that the battery would would you know over time?
[47:20.620 --> 47:22.620]  It's it's the nature of all batteries
[47:22.980 --> 47:24.980]  Or at least all lithium-ion batteries
[47:26.420 --> 47:34.040]  You know that once they deteriorate they deteriorate inevitably and when they deteriorate to a certain level they can no longer sustain the
[47:34.140 --> 47:39.480]  Performance that's necessary for the peak performance of the hypothetical peak performance of the system
[47:39.480 --> 47:45.360]  Yep, absolutely. Well, my thing is that if you if if something changed like Apple likes to just manage everything
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.280]  They don't they believe they should be doing all this
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.360]  You shouldn't have to worry about it
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.320]  But when a state changes people are gonna notice it if they have no information
[47:51.660 --> 47:56.760]  They're gonna think the worst and I always thought that Apple should just let the phone fail once if it was going to let
[47:56.760 --> 47:59.620]  It fail once and when it comes back up say your phone has been
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.000]  Your phone is now under performance managing if you don't like for more information or to turn it off go to settings then you'd have
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.040]  Exactly what they ended up shipping later in the year. Yeah. Well and your battery is at 78 percent. Yeah, or whatever, you know
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.640]  And therefore it's in performance throttling and you know, yeah exactly
[48:18.180 --> 48:23.480]  Because throttling became like a dirty word and but throttling has always been necessary with chips because they're in a constrained space
[48:23.480 --> 48:28.960]  They're hot and they've always had to carefully manage them to make sure they didn't overheat to make sure all sorts of other things didn't
[48:28.960 --> 48:31.220]  Happen to them throttling is what you do with chips
[48:31.220 --> 48:36.420]  But it became this super dirty word, right? Totally because and you know in the old days, you know
[48:37.620 --> 48:39.460]  15 20 more years ago
[48:39.460 --> 48:44.900]  You turn on you power up a computer and the CPU would run at whatever its clock speed is and that's yeah
[48:44.900 --> 48:52.040]  That was it, you know, so if it was a 266 megahertz computer it ran at 266 megahertz and that was it
[48:52.700 --> 48:57.700]  Then we started getting liquid-cooled computers doesn't work like that anymore and it couldn't work like that anymore
[48:58.380 --> 48:59.600]  unless
[48:59.600 --> 49:02.760]  We had ridiculously slow, you know computers like
[49:04.220 --> 49:06.580]  ginormous well ventilated computers, right exactly
[49:09.260 --> 49:13.060]  Yeah, I guess I had to have played out over the last year I don't know I
[49:13.580 --> 49:15.380]  Seems like it's you know
[49:15.380 --> 49:19.120]  It seems like it's a non-issue other than the fact that there's still this vague
[49:19.380 --> 49:23.340]  Misconception that people need you know people that Apple does this on purpose. Yeah
[49:23.340 --> 49:29.540]  I mean I was listening to some big mainstream podcasts and they were talking about that in exactly those terms, which was heart-rending
[49:29.580 --> 49:32.100]  but I think the only thing we've seen lately was a
[49:32.220 --> 49:37.420]  couple people couldn't get a they waited till like the literally the last minute to like New Year's Day almost and they couldn't get
[49:37.420 --> 49:40.740]  An appointment at an Apple store and we're super angry. They're gonna have to pay 20 bucks more
[49:41.380 --> 49:44.940]  next week because they didn't make an appointment. Oh, right because of the
[49:45.700 --> 49:52.120]  The program that Apple started. Yeah, you know to replace these batteries at a substantially lower price. Yeah
[49:52.120 --> 49:53.440]  All right
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.560]  There was a long wait when they first announced it and then and I guess there was a backlog at the end of it
[49:58.560 --> 50:00.720]  I took mine in I made an appointment
[50:00.720 --> 50:03.940]  It took them in they swapped them out took about an hour and then I left and they were great
[50:04.320 --> 50:10.120]  Yeah, I probably should have I don't know why I didn't because I keep all my old iPhones, but I don't really use them
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  But why not?
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.360]  Well, so what's funny is that I checked because I always buy the book the plus and the non plus version for the last few
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.200]  Years anyway, but I've only ever used the plus one. So those were at like 80% 79%
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.120]  The normal ones were at 100% battery health because they just never used them for long enough to damage it
[50:29.800 --> 50:36.020]  I guess the other, you know year in review aspect of this is the promise
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.240]  back in June that I a big focus of iOS 12 was
[50:42.360 --> 50:44.880]  Performance. Yeah, including performance on
[50:44.880 --> 50:52.800]  All going back to all of the systems that iOS 12 supports, you know, I think that was Federighi's bit on the stage
[50:54.200 --> 51:00.880]  and I think it I think there was you know, a fair amount of skepticism on that front because a
[51:01.400 --> 51:03.720]  Side B of the coin that Apple slows down
[51:04.440 --> 51:10.620]  iPhones to get you to buy them is the specific theory that they the way they do it is by
[51:10.620 --> 51:14.300]  programming these slowdowns into the new versions of iOS
[51:14.700 --> 51:20.540]  Right. It's it's hilarious because every year Apple doesn't give you every feature and they're withholding features to get you to upgrade
[51:20.700 --> 51:24.220]  So you demand those features and then you feel like your iPhone is slow
[51:24.220 --> 51:28.740]  So they're they're adding extra features to slow down your iPhone to get you to upgrade right?
[51:28.740 --> 51:33.000]  So those things are always true. So the credibility bridge that Federighi and Apple needed to
[51:33.940 --> 51:35.300]  to
[51:35.300 --> 51:38.480]  federal the the gap they needed to bridge with that is
[51:38.480 --> 51:41.960]  Not only were they saying we're gonna make it faster on
[51:42.560 --> 51:44.560]  older devices
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.480]  Than iOS 11 that
[51:48.400 --> 51:51.240]  People already suspected that they were gonna try to make it slower
[51:51.600 --> 51:55.920]  Right, like no we're not so they've been saying that for years and I didn't really believe them anymore
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.200]  Like the iOS 9 was supposed to make it faster iOS 10 was supposed to make it faster
[52:00.600 --> 52:06.640]  But damned if they didn't do it. Yeah, I haven't seen it. Yeah. I really haven't seen anybody even dispute it
[52:06.640 --> 52:08.720]  I know ours Technica had a story, you know
[52:08.720 --> 52:14.600]  Where they when iOS 12 first came out and they installed it on a bunch of older devices that still supports and you know
[52:14.600 --> 52:17.960]  Their conclusion was yeah, this is this is better, you know, even in beta
[52:17.960 --> 52:23.320]  It was significant when iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 you could see was apparent that it was that was running better
[52:23.320 --> 52:23.800]  Yes
[52:23.800 --> 52:29.080]  I remember and I specifically remember that because and the reason a lot of it popped up right away at
[52:29.440 --> 52:35.400]  WWDC is a lot of people install it on older devices. That's what they bring with them to WWDC to put the first
[52:35.400 --> 52:37.560]  You know daredevil beta on
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.240]  No, I would have to say that's a real highlight for Apple of this year
[52:43.520 --> 52:46.480]  Yeah, and they maintained it through the release because some people were kind of skeptical
[52:46.480 --> 52:50.320]  Yeah, the beta is good. But is the release gonna be good and no it was great through the release
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.160]  And I'm reminded of
[52:54.840 --> 52:56.560]  And I don't know if it's still the case
[52:56.560 --> 53:02.000]  I wonder because I haven't seen anybody talk about it lately, but I'm reminded of the
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.920]  The WebKit policy. I don't know if Don Melton
[53:06.480 --> 53:09.880]  Instituted it what but from the very earliest days before WebKit
[53:09.880 --> 53:11.200]  Yeah, I think before, you know
[53:11.200 --> 53:15.520]  while it was a secret project within Apple before it even shipped they had a policy that
[53:16.040 --> 53:20.840]  You couldn't check any and you couldn't check anything into WebKit that that slowed down
[53:20.840 --> 53:24.080]  You know, they had like zero regression zero regressions performance wise
[53:24.200 --> 53:29.320]  So every every time you made a change to WebKit you would have to run, you know
[53:29.320 --> 53:33.360]  There's some kind of benchmark they had for you know, showing the performance of it
[53:33.360 --> 53:37.040]  And you were not allowed to check anything in that slowed anything down
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.960]  Yeah with the idea and I think largely informed by Melton's experience at Mozilla
[53:43.600 --> 53:48.400]  That you engineers would say well, you know, we've got now we support
[53:49.240 --> 53:55.780]  Blank, you know, whatever new web features and you say well this whoa, this really slowed everything down now
[53:55.780 --> 53:59.440]  They're like, well, we'll fix that later. Yeah, right and
[54:01.080 --> 54:07.400]  You know, it turned out it didn't happen that way so there are no regression policy and you know
[54:07.840 --> 54:13.160]  Can you prove that you need that policy to keep a web rendering engine fast?
[54:13.160 --> 54:18.520]  You know, of course not of course in theory you could check something in that is slow and fix it later
[54:18.520 --> 54:21.960]  You could there's there's absolutely no computer science
[54:22.560 --> 54:24.560]  Principle that would say that can't be done
[54:24.560 --> 54:28.780]  It's more of a human nature problem not a scientific problem
[54:28.780 --> 54:34.500]  Right, but I'm reminded of that with you know with iOS and I'd sort of like to see Apple
[54:34.500 --> 54:37.900]  Hopefully there it wasn't like a one-off with iOS 12, you know
[54:37.900 --> 54:43.860]  And I think that that the lack of something like that is sort of how they got into that situation in the first place
[54:44.580 --> 54:49.580]  Where it's interesting because they in order to get this they took a lot of like
[54:49.580 --> 54:54.780]  a list engineers people who work on the core functionality for UI kit and
[54:55.180 --> 54:57.340]  springboard and instead of them making new features
[54:57.340 --> 55:01.860]  which is what they do any other year they had them work on making everything from a lot of auto layout to
[55:02.420 --> 55:08.140]  Collections to all of those things much more performant, but now this year they're gonna have to go back to working on
[55:08.500 --> 55:09.960]  Well on new features again
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.520]  So I'm hoping Apple has a system where they're gonna bring other guys in underneath them
[55:13.660 --> 55:15.940]  To sort of take care of all this stuff going forward
[55:15.940 --> 55:21.220]  well, I hopefully the answer I you know the answer to me would be something similar to a webkit type policy where if you're
[55:21.220 --> 55:22.900]  working on a new feature and
[55:22.900 --> 55:29.320]  It should be and and you know a new feature for iOS 13 and there's a list of here's the devices
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.320]  We're planning for this OS to support
[55:31.320 --> 55:37.340]  It should be tested on the lowest of those devices from the get-go and it should be acceptable use of you
[55:38.060 --> 55:44.800]  Acceptably usable on the lowest device before you it's accepted as okay. This is going to be part of iOS 13
[55:44.800 --> 55:51.000]  yeah, and that's sort of my concern here because they they they've had a performance team for years and performance team is one of those few
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.840]  Teams like security which can take your code away and say no
[55:53.840 --> 55:55.360]  We're not you're not gonna get away with this
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.680]  This has got to work better and they've also had
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.080]  Engineers who carry older devices because their families use older devices and they don't want which is also why that whole thing was bullshit
[56:03.080 --> 56:09.080]  about Apple slowing down devices their moms and their sisters and their brothers and their kids use those devices and they don't want to give
[56:09.080 --> 56:09.760]  Them a bad experience
[56:09.760 --> 56:15.280]  but then you'd get down to crunch time and you'd have to ship and it's that one time a year and just anything that
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.960]  Wasn't a keynote headline temple feature sort of fell by the wayside
[56:19.960 --> 56:26.200]  But this year performance was the number one headline feature so it couldn't and I just I want to make sure that happens every year
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.120]  Yeah, well and I really do think the way to do it is to make it, you know
[56:30.120 --> 56:31.000]  Make sure it's running
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.520]  Well on the lowest common lowest device from the get-go and don't assume that you're gonna be able to fix it in July
[56:37.520 --> 56:39.360]  I
[56:39.360 --> 56:41.360]  Yes
[56:41.360 --> 56:43.360]  We shall see I don't know
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.440]  So anyway, I think iOS 12 was a big big hit of the year I think I think it's been a very good release
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.160]  What else you want to use I have this organized I have this note organized by product line
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.480]  I don't know if we should go chronological or by product line. I say probably yeah, you perfect. Yeah, I have Mac first
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.880]  So you look great. Thank God you adjusted this with all the lakes
[57:08.600 --> 57:10.000]  I
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.720]  Can't keep them straight. There's so many and I feel like every time I go to sleep I wake up and there's another one
[57:15.360 --> 57:21.000]  You know what? I can I tell you something? So for example, here's what we have in the show notes from the Mac Mac hardware this
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.240]  year
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.000]  So we have no no no I'm ax and no
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.600]  The Mac Pro hasn't shipped yet
[57:29.600 --> 57:36.340]  Although we were told later this year that the Mac Pro would be a 2019 thing. Yeah, thanks to Matthew Panzerina's
[57:37.300 --> 57:39.140]  report earlier in the year
[57:39.140 --> 57:41.340]  So it's all portables and the Mac mini
[57:41.700 --> 57:48.900]  We had the MacBook Pro coffee lake in July new new updates to all the MacBook Pros except for the MacBook Pro escape the one
[57:48.900 --> 57:50.900]  without a touch bar
[57:51.140 --> 57:54.280]  The MacBook Air came out in October with amber lake
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.040]  Mac mini coffee lake in October and then MacBook Pro
[58:00.280 --> 58:04.160]  With the Vega Pro in November. That's that's a graphic card update. Yes
[58:05.160 --> 58:10.280]  I believe I don't think that the coffee lake. I don't think the CPUs got even got speed bumped, right?
[58:10.280 --> 58:13.640]  It was just new graphic card options. Yeah, if you stayed the same
[58:13.640 --> 58:17.680]  It was just a two higher-end Vega Pro the people that mobile Vega graphics cards. Yeah
[58:18.800 --> 58:19.960]  I
[58:19.960 --> 58:26.360]  Will say this I thought it was interesting while I was shopping for Jonas's gaming PC and I read a bunch of really good
[58:26.360 --> 58:31.760]  You know thoroughly written reviews with benchmarks from actual games. I was fascinated
[58:31.760 --> 58:35.960]  I mean, I kind of knew that the GPU is by far the most important thing for performance on games
[58:36.040 --> 58:43.160]  But I was kind of shocked at at at some of the benchmarks how almost identical they were between like core
[58:43.160 --> 58:46.360]  i7 and a significantly more expensive core i9
[58:46.360 --> 58:52.400]  but if they had the same graphics card the performance of the game was identical or or so close to identical that it
[58:53.600 --> 58:59.600]  Human eye wouldn't notice you'd really need to fire up the the actual frame rate thing, you know and look at the actual numbers
[58:59.600 --> 59:02.280]  I thought that was fascinating just how how
[59:03.160 --> 59:08.120]  Almost not inessential. I know CPU isn't completely inessential, but that it's it's so
[59:08.640 --> 59:10.760]  Bound so much more than CPU bound these days
[59:10.760 --> 59:17.800]  Yeah, but that you know that Apple and you know Apple shipping a graphic graphics only update to the MacBook Pro shows that it's true in
[59:17.960 --> 59:24.280]  The non gaming world too, you know that it's I think we all know that Apple doesn't lightheartedly do speed bumps anymore
[59:27.280 --> 59:33.480]  But here's the frustrating here's the frustrating thing like what what is better coffee Lake or amber Lake I guess coffee Lake, right?
[59:33.760 --> 59:37.800]  Well, so this is a super frustrating thing. So previously there wasn't any of this BS
[59:37.800 --> 59:41.240]  It was like Broadwell and Haswell and there was supposed to be Skylake and cannon Lake
[59:41.360 --> 59:43.720]  They just couldn't get their 10 nanometer process done
[59:43.720 --> 59:48.680]  So then they went from Skylake to Kaby Lake which was yet another architecture tweak and optimization
[59:48.680 --> 59:51.560]  They call it now and then from Kaby Lake to coffee Lake
[59:51.720 --> 59:59.880]  but instead of previously they had these M series m3 m5 m7 and they decided to rename the m5 and the m7 to i5 and
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:05.400]  i7 which sounded like the the bigger processors and was all super confusing and now they give them their own name
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:11.000]  So all that amber Lake is last year. Those were just the Kaby Lakes that were in the 12 12 inch MacBook
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.440]  they didn't have any different name, but now they're classifying those sort of super low power chips as
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.840]  a different lake all together and then you have like ice lake and
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.640]  Whiskey Lake because they want to call something else like the server ones have to have a different name now
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.720]  But how are they how are you supposed to know which ones are better than the other see one of the things that I liked
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.680]  About the Nvidia's line of graphics card as I shopped for them. Is that if the number is higher it's better
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.960]  It's that simple. So like really can coffee like are both eighth generation
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.400]  It's amber Lake is meant for the more portable lower power of computers and coffee Lake is meant for the read the usual computers
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400]  Yeah, but you can get an eighth generation
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.720]  CPU that's better than some of the ninth generation ones. Yeah, just being nice entries are a refresh
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:57.000]  I think those are what those are because there's Kaby Lake refresh as well and it's coffee like
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.840]  There's no it's a mess. There's no way to look at the names and decide which one's better than the other
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.280]  There's no way to look at the generation numbers
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.280]  I mean, it's you know in theory new generations are better overall
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.280]  But it doesn't necessarily mean that this one from the ninth generation is better than that one from the eighth generation
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.640]  It's it's really really for a human
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:17.760]  No
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.200]  Like if you go to a Nantec or a door TV or some of like the youtuber or blog channels that only that only focus
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.200]  On chips, they know all the part numbers
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.160]  There's no way to figure it out from the name. Yes, right you you you can't you know
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.560]  Whereas with the Nvidia graphics cards on the PC, you really can you can just figure out? Okay, if they're human readable
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.000]  Yeah
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.520]  1070 is cheaper and not as powerful as a 1080 and the 2080 is better than the 1080 and the
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.000]  2080 TI and if you know TI's titanium, you know, well and you look at the price
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.840]  Well, obviously it's better you can seriously, you know, yes, just looking at at the names
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.080]  You can figure out which one's better than than than other ones, you know
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.160]  Yeah, just put numbers on that goddamn things and make the numbers go higher
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.160]  So like what is yeah, I mean they do it's still it's still like a now
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.760]  it's m3 i5 i7 i9 and then you have amber lake on the lower end coffee lake on the
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.760]  Normal end. Yeah. Well anyway
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.620]  Mac the Mac portable lineup has been completely refreshed this year with the exception of the non touch bar
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:26.360]  MacBook Pro 13 inch MacBook Pro and the 12 inch only got a color like the gold. Oh, right
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:32.400]  That's right of gold was right and the 12 inch right and that is get amber lake. They got they get they're still on KV Lake. I
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.600]  Feel I still feel good about the future of the 12 inch MacBook
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:44.320]  because I feel like they're not it they're not going to switch the smallest ever, you know,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840]  cutest ever
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.300]  MacBook to be the the the new MacBook Air size
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.640]  Like I think that that size, you know in the fact that it's still there and people are still buying it
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.120]  It's there's demand for it. I just think that Intel screwed them
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.040]  Honestly, yeah, I mean there's two problems one is the Intel problem
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.400]  The other one is that they marketed themselves into a corner because the MacBook Air was never a low priced Mac
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.760]  It was right. I think was a 1799 when the first one came out 1299 when the second one came out now
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.960]  It's 1199 but because for a while it dropped down to 999 people expect it to be the low price
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.640]  MacBook so not just the lightest but also the lowest price in a normal world
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.280]  This would be the MacBook and then if you wanted to pay extra for the ultralight you'd get the MacBook the 12-inch and if
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.020]  You wanted to pay extra for the pro version you'd get that and this would be the baseline
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:35.960]  But because of that weird marketing inversion now, everyone is just confused about why they're named those things
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:42.460]  Yeah, the MacBook Air no longer means thin and light the air now means that's the one I want. Yes
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:49.300]  Yeah, it really does because it's a little it's good enough and it's cheaper and you know and I
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.340]  Like the wedge shape. There you go. It's the everyday computer everyday Mac for everyone most right?
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:58.620]  It's really what what the air has come to mean, you know, and you know, it is what it is
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.860]  But I think that it's it's not worth overthinking that yeah
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.480]  The state of the MacBook lineup overall I
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.940]  think there's I
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.140]  I
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.100]  Think it's a decent year for the MacBook
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:21.020]  But I still feel like like the keyboard situation is a significant thing and I do think that you know
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:26.000]  What are we six months after the third generation keyboards with the membrane started shipping?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.760]  I think that's enough time that it certainly suggests that the membrane solves the
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:38.900]  Pieces of dust under the keys can get them stuck problem because it does not seem that does not seem to be the problem that
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.540]  It was before it was a significant problem before significant enough that Apple launched the repair program
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  which you know is a
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.580]  Explicit acknowledgement that yeah, this is this is Apple
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.100]  This is a real problem and we'll you know
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:55.380]  We'll do our best to make it right for the people affected by it and the third generation keyboards don't seem to have it
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.080]  Yeah
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.820]  2016 one seems to be the worst it trended down in 2017. Then it turned it weird that way down in 2018
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.980]  Here's my fundamental problem though with Apple's lineup as it stands today. I
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.780]  I don't I think I and I do realize that there are some fans of these keyboards
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:17.180]  I do realize that but I feel like the number of people who think this is not my favorite keyboard a
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.820]  ever and be
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.660]  on the market today
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.980]  across laptops
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.700]  is
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:34.380]  far outweighs the number of people who consider the third generation MacBook keyboard their favorite or and or the best on the market today and
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.500]  To me, I think Apple
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:43.700]  The the ever since the first power books has been up there as arguably
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:51.100]  This is the best slash favorite keyboard and the laptop market today and it's of course not ever in your keyboards
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.220]  Do a whole show on keyboards, of course
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:01.820]  It's super subjective and of course, there are people who love the ThinkPad keyboard keyboards and that there are differences
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.360]  You're never gonna have one keyboard that everybody agrees. This is the best
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.300]  This is my favorite
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:11.700]  But I feel there are way too few people way too many people who don't think this is an improvement over
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.700]  the previous
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:18.020]  Keyboards before the butterfly switch and I think that's the biggest problem. It is the biggest problem
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.420]  I I've gone a record saying I love these keyboards
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.100]  I vastly prefer them to the previous generation keyboards
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.060]  But there are people who really hate them and that that shouldn't happen
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.260]  Like no neither of us had a problem with the previous generation one
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.960]  I was fine with it the people who hate this one were fine with it
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.820]  And when you have a single vendor making a product you cannot have that product be divisive
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:42.540]  yeah, and when you buy a premium product, there are certain things that
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.460]  You don't have to be nice when you buy a premium car
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:52.860]  The steering wheel has to feel nice and the it has to feel good when you push the pedals that the interface the actual
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.340]  Parts that your body. Yeah touches
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:59.740]  Matter they have to be satisfying they matter more than other things
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.500]  you know, like
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.140]  you know like the the window what's the the
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.700]  The sunscreen above your eyes in the car
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.660]  All right
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:14.600]  If that flips down and doesn't have the best feel you'd be annoyed if you spend a lot of money on like a BMW or something
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.860]  And it didn't have a great feel but how often do you flip that thing down?
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:22.220]  Yeah, but like the steering wheel he has to feel great the shift. Yeah, it has to it has to be perfect
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.220]  right the keyboard on a
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.820]  MacBook has to be great and I honestly
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:34.620]  Oh, even though I feel like this third generation thing is better solution. It's the best version of this design ever
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.940]  It's not great and I feel like it's a fundamental failing on Apple's part
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.660]  And I really really hope weird though because like the touch bar
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.940]  There are people deep inside Apple who were absolutely convinced that they nailed it with this, right?
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.820]  I I can't help but think that they wouldn't have shipped it
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:54.900]  Otherwise, you know them and I know they remember we went to the event and they were so happy like
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.900]  They think what you can't wait till you see it like they had these big grins on their face
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:05.220]  Like they were really gonna surprise us with something spectacular. Yeah, I you know, I will say I'm still my personal
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.020]  MacBook is still a 2014 13-inch MacBook Pro and
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.220]  Ultimately, the number one reason is the keyboard honestly
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:18.600]  I and I really really I used the new one as a review unit for you know
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.940]  Like six weeks and did everything on it, you know did didn't use my iMac or anything just used it and I got used to
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:31.140]  It I mean I could definitely live with it and you know in the hypothetical future where they stick with something basically like this
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.220]  I will switch eventually, you know, and that yeah, you know, but it's
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.660]  it's not as good and it's yeah, I don't know I
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.500]  Like I said, I like this better and I still want them to change it because it's not just about me
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.380]  it's about everyone who uses a Mac and I realize I'm
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:53.740]  I thought at the far end of the spectrum on how much I care about the feel of keyboards
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:01.380]  But it's you know, it really is a fundamental aspect of why people buy a
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.820]  Notebook computer in the first place
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:09.420]  It's your connection to the machine that that's the that there is the one thing that is connecting you to what you are doing
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:12.660]  Yeah, it really it is, you know and you know
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.200]  I'm having a bad game controller. Just can't do it
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.480]  Right, and so we don't you know, there are no touch screens on the Mac
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.480]  and so the touch actually is it's entirely through the
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:33.700]  Keyboard and the trackpad and conversely the trackpad to me. The new trackpads are the best they've ever made and Apple famously is it to me?
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.800]  Is well known for making the best trackpads in in the industry and I think that's still true
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.220]  I think the force touch trackpad is a
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.940]  Just perfect. I think it's tremendous. I love
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.160]  the fact that I think that the the
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:58.240]  The fake or haptic feedback, you know, the fake clip set of lie. Yeah using haptic feedback
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.920]  instead of an actual as
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.120]  What was her name on stage?
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.720]  She introduced the new MacBook Air and called it a seesaw. Oh
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.400]  Oh, I'm blanking on her name Laura, but I don't think that was it
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:17.580]  Yeah, but you know the old seesaw we're using an actual lever to make an actual click meant that at the top of the trackpad
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.740]  It was much less clicky and harder to click than at the bottom of the trackpad
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.720]  Whereas the new one is equally clicky everywhere and the clicks feel great. It is
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.680]  It's actually hard to believe it's not a real click. It's so good. Yeah
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.160]  Yeah, and when you turn it off and it goes dead you just like you think it is wrong
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:40.120]  Yeah, it is. It instantly triggers a part of your brain that says this is broken this your reptile brain just thinks it's broken, right?
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.280]  Because if you've ever had like a laptop with it where the trackpad is broken
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.800]  That's what it feels like and it's like yeah. Oh and this is you know, that's not an easy repair
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:55.400]  Yeah, and we used to like at least I used to think that Windows laptop like Windows trackpads were horrible and it bothers me
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.480]  Deeply that people think the MacBook keyboard is horrible in the same way. Yeah
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.660]  So they do a great job on trackpad, but I feel like they've got a they've got a re
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.980]  We commit themselves to making the world's best laptop keyboard
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.540]  I think that if they had an opportunity like when they go to the new design because there's got to be a new design coming
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:18.020]  with face ID and with like very, you know, very small bezels and I think they have an opportunity there to redefine the keyboard again and
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.300]  Just find something that works better for everybody. I
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.420]  Wonder I do wonder how much and again, I'm not familiar
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.580]  I guess I could go to I fix it and sort of familiarize myself with it, but I do wonder
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:33.940]  how much smaller the internals of a future a
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.540]  Whatever, you know arm-based
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.380]  Apple chip MacBook lineup could be than what they have now
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.100]  Right because obviously the reason they want to make they wanted to make I mean, obviously
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.840]  How did they get into the situation with the keyboard? It's obvious. It's about thinness, right?
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.840]  They wanted to make the computer thinner
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.780]  but they still need to maintain minimum battery life and they still have all these components that need to go in there and and
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:06.060]  You know, however many ports they get away do away with the ports that they keep do take up some amount of space and therefore
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:10.160]  They're left with less room for a keyboard with more
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.400]  Travel right because the travel takes up
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.480]  space
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:21.100]  Microsoft and Google managed to give better travel on keyboard. Yeah, look every bit as thin to me. Yep, and you know
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.100]  You know say what you want about the slate
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.100]  the
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:33.360]  Slate tablet. Yeah, their keyboard feels better than apples. Yeah, even with those stupid round keys, which are a gimmick that they shouldn't
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:41.500]  But just in terms of clickiness, it feels better, you know, and I I don't know I guarantee I've I absolutely would wager
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:45.700]  That people who've tried both would agree that Microsoft makes a better feeling keyboard
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:52.840]  Right now than Apple and it that's what this reminds me of like the keyboard reminds me of the Mac Pro the cylinder Mac Pro
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.540]  Where somebody had an idea that this could be the future that they were solving real problems
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.020]  They were making these more stable more uniform
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:04.100]  Wider keys and that this was a direction and it just turned out to not be the direction
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.340]  And the same way they're making a new Mac Pro
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.660]  Refigured out this computer this great word
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.060]  I mean
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:15.820]  But my my hope is that basically as Apple continues to get better at making computers smaller and smaller
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.740]  I mean and you know
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.960]  The watch is the perfect example of that that that they can make a completely performant MacBook Pro
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:27.440]  With such a tiny computer that that the base of it really only needs
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:35.240]  room for keyboard and trackpad that the keyboard and trackpad can use as much space as they want, you know to be as
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.160]  Clicky as and pleasant feeling
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.800]  As necessary because the computer parts are so tiny that they don't really take up keyboard in that space, right?
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.040]  Because you wouldn't need a t2 chip that would all be built into the to the Apple chip, right?
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.000]  All right. I mean look at how thin the damn iPad pros are. I know it's like a piece of paper, right?
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.300]  and surely a significant amount of the depth that's there is
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:07.040]  For the display, yeah display plus battery is pretty much I think all you have in terms of depth in that thing, right?
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.200]  So if the display was on a hinge like on a MacBook, imagine how small the computer part would be of iPad Pro based
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:20.480]  MacBook Pro. Yeah, I mean I it's you know fascinating and you know, including the battery, right? Yeah
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.240]  alright, and nobody wing is
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.880]  Nobody complains about the battery life of an iPad Pro. No, no, not at all
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.020]  I mean, I guess the battery life would be a little worse because Mac OS
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.920]  Consumes more battery life than iPad
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.240]  iOS does but still basically it's it's clearly
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.440]  15 inch device like 13 inch device you have a lot of room
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.720]  it's clear that from a hardware perspective Apple could make a
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.840]  tremendous I
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.560]  Arm based
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.420]  MacBooks, it's entirely a software issue. It's just efficiency to be like they wouldn't right now
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.840]  They're using Intel generic chipset and that's got to support Microsoft and a whole bunch of other stuff
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.760]  They're not gonna put any DirectX baggage right in an Apple chip. All that kind of stuff is gonna go away, right?
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.320]  So anyway
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.880]  I just hope that they take whatever space they can to make the keyboard if they need more space to make the keyboard better
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.920]  Take more space to make the keyboard better. That's a big hope for the future
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.020]  Mac mini, I don't know what else to say about that. I'm glad they did it
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:20.680]  It's you know
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:28.760]  certainly one difference between us talking in late 2018 versus late 2017 is at least we've answered the question of whether Apple is
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:36.060]  You know whether the Mac mini is doomed or not, right? It is. Yes, most definitely not doomed. It seemingly has a bright future
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720]  yeah, and it's curious because
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.280]  That that is like I think the worst-selling Mac
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.120]  I mean, it's tied for the Mac Pro not in the people don't love it
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.320]  Not that it's a great machine, but just in terms of volume, right?
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.580]  it's all MacBooks and then it's all iMacs and then it's you know, Mac Pro and Mac mini and
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.260]  Apple
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.760]  Some people argue that Apple should be getting rid of the computers
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.360]  They don't sell very much of but Apple really invested in it
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.280]  And I know some people were super upset because they it's not an entry-level computer anymore
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.880]  It's not the four hundred and ninety nine dollar cheapest Mac you can buy now. It's it's it's aimed squarely at server side
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.720]  Developer side and more pro use but they still made a pretty a pretty cool little box out of that thing
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.280]  Yeah, very much. So
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.080]  They don't still sell old Mac minis. Do they they just got rid of think so. Yeah, that was so old
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.680]  Yeah, but that would have been interesting still sell the MacBook Air there
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:34.200]  That's when you love in my book here. I think that for the people who want to do something super low
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.200]  Performance wise, you know, like if you just wanted to do like what?
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:46.660]  What I was talking about getting a Raspberry Pi to do and you just want to have a headless server in your home running. Yeah
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.020]  You know serving as a media server running Plex or you know
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.800]  Any of that type stuff that really isn't CPU intensive because everything's already
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.100]  Transcoded to where you want it to be and it's just more or less putting bits on the internet on the Ethernet
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:07.140]  And so, you know even $800 would be overkill or way overkill
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.260]  I still think that market if you really want it to be running Mac OS X
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:15.500]  I think that market is sort of well served by the eBay market
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.780]  Yeah, I mean it would be nice if Apple had something in that lineup
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:25.540]  But I kind of see why they don't because it really would be so different than these new Mac minis and it would be confusing
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:31.220]  Why there's this one that's 400 jumps to 800 or whatever and they also said that people who are entry-level now
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.980]  They they aren't the same people who were buying these computers ten years ago
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:39.980]  They want the screen and they want the trackpad and they want the keyboard and they're buying MacBook Airs. They're not buying Mac minis anymore. Yeah
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:47.660]  But that was good so, you know, yeah and we've got the promise of a Mac Pro for 2019
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:52.860]  Yep, so I guess before we leave the Mac we can look ahead and try to guess when that might be
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:59.200]  yeah, and we still need the updates for the iMac and the 12-inch MacBook if they're gonna do that and iMac seems like like
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.600]  I'm surprised we didn't get coffee like iMacs
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:01.900]  I mean
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:07.740]  Maybe it wasn't a huge deal in terms of how much new performance Intel offered or maybe they're still resource constrained
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.740]  They just don't have enough people to because I think some people think it's just like Intel announces a new chip
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.340]  It should automatically be in the Mac
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.860]  But it takes a while for the specific versions that Apple to use to come out like sometimes months and months and months and then
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:23.980]  Apple works with Intel to do things like power nap and all these different features and to integrate it with the t2 and all this
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.820]  Other stuff so it takes engineering hours to get that done and they might just not have had them
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.020]  Yeah, and I have the distinct impression that sometimes they're working on it
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:37.460]  And while they're doing that with a specific thing in mind because they're building this intricate
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.740]  That's entire system integrated system that depends on all of this
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:43.340]  Intel's
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:50.220]  scheduled changes and the one that they were waiting for for the system is now behind this other one and you can't just plop it in
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:55.540]  Like, you know that happened a couple of years ago and they had to ship the 21.5 with an older chip because it just Intel
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:00.780]  Didn't have it ready. All right. I think it happens more often than you think and I think it's you know, I
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.840]  Truly and firmly believe, you know the answer to the question of why did it take so long to ship the
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.560]  The retina MacBook Air and that's the reason that what they were planning to ship
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.400]  They couldn't ship and I think it's also maybe why they only have one CPU option in the MacBook Air
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.120]  Like I kind of like it as a simplicity thing
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.400]  And I love the fact that when you shop for a new iPad Pro, you don't have to pick a CPU config
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.120]  Trust me coming from just buying a gaming PC it
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.100]  You know, I to me I actually think that the to it where the two areas where it's most interesting would be
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.700]  The gaming PC world where you can pick anything, right? You've got a
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.240]  literally, maybe
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.500]  Dozens and dozens of CPU and GPU options and types of RAM and you can pick the type of motherboard you can pick it all
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:59.020]  Right or the Apple route where they make decisions for you and you just pick how much storage you want and that's it
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:03.700]  Oh, no, I think you're like the but I do m3 is sorry
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:09.780]  Well, I just think that that the MacBook Air in particular exemplifies that there's only one there is no CPU upgrade option
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:14.700]  And when you look at it like the m3, which they do do in the 12-inch MacBook, it's just anemic
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.500]  It's it's so bad compared to the m5 version and I think Intel intentionally cripples the chip, too
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.700]  I don't think the chip has to be that bad
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.380]  I think they do it because of their skews and then the the
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:28.500]  The i7 version was probably thermally beyond me Apple was to your point
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.060]  Apple was betting on 10 nanometer Intel chips
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.500]  right to fit into all of these new computers and now all
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:39.260]  Everything from the MacBook Pro to the MacBook Air are running chips that are much bigger and hotter than Apple anticipated
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.020]  yeah, I I don't know this specifically I I
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:45.140]  have been told
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:50.340]  Basically that the answer to why the MacBook Air took as long as it did was Intel. So that's the short version
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.940]  I think like two years later two years later two and three years late now
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:00.380]  I think these slightly longer version is that they were banking on 10 nanometer chips and Intel hasn't gotten it and
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:06.660]  It left Apple in the lurch. I really do and I really definitely I think the MacBook Air
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:14.380]  So your argument just a couple minutes ago that but with the Mac mini selling and probably the lowest quantities of any Mac
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.740]  There's the question of why Apple should care at all
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:22.820]  Whereas the MacBook Air is and remains the most popular Mac. Yes. So if they're gonna make Macs at all, of course
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.420]  They're not going to leave that one lagging. I
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.540]  don't think anybody at Apple involved in it was anything other than
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:39.360]  If both furious and and embarrassed at yes that the delay it took to get a retina MacBook Air out
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.540]  I I think they took it seriously up at the very highest levels of the company
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.420]  And they never say it like in the briefings
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.860]  They will never tell you they are nothing but cordial employed until when you talk to them, right?
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:55.740]  You can just feel this right because they're they're professionals and they're not gonna throw anybody under the bus and they you know
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:01.260]  Up and up until the point when they switch to their own chips and can put up a graph comparing
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.940]  the price price per the the
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:10.740]  Performance per watt of what they're going to compared to what they're leaving behind and even then they won't slag. I
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.420]  I
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:16.820]  Don't know that I think they'll they'll do it in a way where they're slagging the chip and not the company
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:23.820]  Yeah, it'll be performance performance per watt, right? Right as it was with the PC. I just linked to it a couple weeks ago
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:28.900]  I linked to Steve Jobs's introduction of the Intel transition at WWDC
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.780]  2006 I think or maybe 2005 and
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:40.340]  And it's remarkable because if the thing that's most remarkable is that word-for-word what he's saying
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:46.060]  I think is what the argument Apple will make when they switch from Intel to ARM chips
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:50.140]  I did a video re-editing that over an armed transition and it works perfectly
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.140]  Oh, let me get a link to that
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.740]  Put a link to that in the note and I will make sure it gets in the show notes
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:03.180]  Yeah, it's absolutely, you know, and it would including graphs that show the performance per watt
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:09.340]  And then the argument it's like ah, it's just so Steve Jobs like man. This guy was great
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.340]  He was like we have we have ideas for devices
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:20.380]  That we think you'll love and we can't make them based on the power PC wrote the chips coming in the power PC roadmap
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:24.380]  Yeah, and we can make them with the ones on the Intel roadmap. There it is
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.740]  We can make the but we have ideas for future devices
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.660]  That would be great
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:35.660]  You're gonna love them, but we need to switch to our chips from these chips to make them real. It's a great presentation
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:41.180]  Oh, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable how short some of his things were like it's like he announced like
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.500]  complete
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.780]  architecture
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.460]  architecture transition that was going to up, you know
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:53.100]  Upheave all hardware and all software for the entire platform and it took like five minutes
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:59.540]  Yeah, and even he was even funny about like Mac OS has been leaving a secret double life right Google Maps into the building
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.140]  Alright, he circled the building. We've had it running in here all along
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:07.260]  Oh, and then the great the the greatest part is it he's like, oh by the way this whole keynote so far
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.860]  Yeah, it's been running on an Intel Mac right here. Here it is. Because of course it was just so perfect
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:21.180]  So 2019 Mac should be a big year, right? It's like it's good. It's pretty good year for the mobile
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:25.460]  You know the the MacBook lineup, but you know, I feel like the Mac Pro is coming
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.860]  We have no idea what it is other than it should be a monster
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.580]  graphically
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:37.620]  But no, you know it nothing is leaked out of that project
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.580]  IMAX are need of an update. I think we need an answer to
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.680]  Hey, how frequently are iMac Pro great device a very popular super successful every you know
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.760]  Did you know it is what everybody was hoping it would be?
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.000]  But how often are they gonna update it, right?
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Was it a one-off like they focus some attention on a Pro iMac and came out with something that looked cool and performed great
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.120]  And then you know, it's that's it. We're done. We're done with that one
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.440]  or even just looking like I was trying to figure out what Intel chip came out because those are still running Xeon Skylake because
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.440]  There was no Xeon KB Lake yet and we're already on coffee Lake on the desktop version
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.080]  I figure out what the hell chip they'd even put in that to update it, right?
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.680]  So that I think that's you know, very much in need of an update. It would be
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.420]  It would be interesting if they updated it alongside the Mac Pro
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.400]  Yeah, and then explained, you know, I think they could you know
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.620]  I hopefully they would it would be interesting to me because they could do a significant update to the iMac Pro and then
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.200]  Unveiled the Mac Pro and then explain
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.280]  Why they see a need for both to exist. All right, here's the new iMac Pro. We've had it
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.640]  It's you know, it's over a year old. It's been great if people are using it for X Y & Z
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.440]  Now here's the Mac Pro
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.000]  Here's why we made this even though the iMac Pro is is great for these other things, right?
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.120]  Because I feel like you need they need to answer that question that Mac Pro needs to answer
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:06.360]  Why does it exist in a world where the Mac Pro exists and gets updated?
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.720]  Semi-regularly and when they put it next to the whatever that new products, I feel like the expectational debt on that new Pro
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.600]  Display is ridiculous. Like you look on the web and people are saying oh, is it gonna be OLED?
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.840]  Is it gonna be 8k like what is that gonna do with that display?
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.600]  That is just gonna be ridiculous unless it's something concrete
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.120]  Well, I like it. I did one thing to look in at the gaming PC world and trying to get Jonas a 4k display
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.560]  That would work for gaming. I realized that iMac display doesn't have refresh rates that are good for gaming
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.760]  Now and that's part of the thing but price wise the fact that you can get a really beautiful
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.280]  5k display in an iMac with you know HDR and and yeah
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800]  Tremendous color response
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.520]  And 4k displays for PCs are
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.000]  More expensive than the base model iMacs. I mean it just shows that you know it
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.680]  it it's different needs and you know, but it's
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.560]  Boy that that you know the display you get with your iMac is a hell of a bargain in my yeah
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560]  I'm what I can see on the market
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.920]  Yeah, even if you just look at the LG 5k display, which is essentially the same panel, right?
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.240]  You know a thousand bucks worth of display right there, right?
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:29.840]  It's you know, it's truly, you know, and so yeah the expectations for a standalone Pro display from Apple are well
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.520]  Hi. Yeah, and then you got to put the iMac Pro next to that and it's got to hold up. So right
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.680]  Yeah, we'll see
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.280]  And
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.120]  What do we expect for the Mac books I
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.440]  You know, do we expect a new MacBook Pro design next year like something significantly different?
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.880]  Not just a speed bump or is that too soon?
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.700]  It feels like face ID has got to be coming to the Mac at some point because it just makes so much sense
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  but the problem with the face ID coming to the Mac that I see is that
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:08.620]  part of the newest generation of Mac books the modern generation of all Mac books is that they've gone to this new thinner top panel and
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.620]  then it that is
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:16.220]  Great in every single way in terms of you know, how light it is how thin it is
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:22.980]  And just how easy it is to tilt it because it's so light and it has a tremendously improved hinge
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.780]  Even though the old hinge was probably better than anything else on the market
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:32.500]  The new hinge is like the most unheralded genius part of physical engineering in these Mac books
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:41.100]  But the downside is it's so thin that a it doesn't have the Apple logo backlighting anymore and
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:46.180]  B it means that because it's so thin there's no room for a good camera
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:51.940]  And so the you know, like the FaceTime camera that's in it right now is really kind of a turd of a camera
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.940]  It's 480p. It's
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.260]  Yeah, right, yeah, it is like something from 15 years ago
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:07.080]  Like I think even the original eyesight camera was 720p, you know, the one that looked like a little canister of film
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:14.920]  So, you know, there's there's laws of physics involved there of how thin can they make a sensor array that does
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:21.460]  Even if it you know, I can theory I could imagine they could do a face ID sensor that works up to their standards
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.820]  But still doesn't allow for a really great camera, you know
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.420]  part of it, right
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:33.700]  But yeah, ultimately it really really it once you get used to face ID
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:37.140]  It's really tough in the same way that we were all craving touch ID on our Macs
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:40.180]  for a couple of years
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:46.900]  It's kind of like weak sauce like here you go you have touch ID on your new MacBook now, but you don't even want it
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:51.860]  I want face ID. Yeah, but that's totally it like it. We finally came to the MacBook Air like what is it?
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:54.200]  Five years after it came to the iPhone, right?
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.460]  So, I don't know hopefully I would guess I don't know
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.340]  And it just makes sense because you want to get that technology across as many as your products of your products as possible
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.340]  Yeah, we need
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.800]  We need an answer to what's the update to the 12-inch MacBook?
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.380]  Is that waiting for the switch to arm or are they going you know?
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:17.180]  You know, and I guess that's the other big question is yeah
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:24.220]  This is this the year when they announced the arm transition at WWDC because I can only imagine that that would be a WWDC
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.540]  Announcement but then it's funny too because we all sort of expect them to do this
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:32.340]  There are some reports with sources, you know
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:38.580]  Gurman familiar with the people who write the situation, you know, the Gurman has said that they're working on it
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.060]  Of course, they have it working in theory, right? Of course. There's a secret lab running
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.140]  a Mac Oh Mac OS 10 or Mac OS whatever we call it these days
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.300]  Marklar in the closet for what like three four five years before we saw it, right?
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:57.900]  No, they never stopped, you know, they never do, you know, according to the jobs and it makes sense, you know based on next
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.180]  next steps
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:06.040]  Cross-platform nature they had it cross compiling all along and you hear stories about the arm the arm
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.980]  MacBooks and the iOS laptops going back four or five six years still which is when they launched the a4 chip
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:16.260]  So I'm guessing it's gonna be similar to the same. There's a way that speech fits so well. Yeah to this day
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:23.420]  But it's funny it it, you know in terms of like, oh this could be an interesting year
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.020]  Is it's funny to think of them maybe?
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.300]  hypothetically in March or April
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:37.700]  Unveiling they could you know unveil new Mac this new long-awaited Mac Pro and updates to these Intel based high-end
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:41.620]  Workstations and then months later say we're moving away from Intel
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.540]  You know
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:46.180]  What's the answer to that like in the past two?
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:52.740]  Transitions from 68k to power PC and then from power PC to Intel they were complete transitions, you know
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:59.580]  And it was within you know a year to year and a half all all Macs move from the old
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.940]  architecture to the new architecture and
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:07.340]  In theory one way around this is that maybe the Mac it will remain
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:14.320]  Intel and arm and it'll be Intel based on the desktop and arm based on the portables
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:19.780]  And there's no reason not to do that. Really. They're already hybrids like they're using the t2
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:25.260]  I've not just for security but they're using it for the HEVC and code decode because Intel simply can't keep up with what they're doing
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:30.140]  On arm and that's what makes it so much faster than other computers and you can you can see sort of a tipping point
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:34.740]  Where you have an Intel chip with an ARM coprocessor and then you have an ARM chip with an Intel coprocessor
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:41.220]  Just to handle backwards compatibility and some of the higher-end stuff that they like some of maybe the Xeon stuff or some of the stuff
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:45.180]  They need on a pro workstation. Yeah, so I'm not saying I would bet on that but I
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:49.400]  Wouldn't be surprised if that's the answer to how do they spend all this time?
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:57.220]  Working on a brand new Mac Pro architecture based on Intel technology and then at the same time
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:04.500]  The announced this major switch away from Intel and I wouldn't be surprised if it's just a
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:10.180]  Portable versus desktop dichotomy and for at least for the foreseeable future in the next few years
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.540]  It just stays that way and you don't nobody users don't have to worry about it
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:18.300]  you don't have to know every app just ships as a fat app with
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.260]  you know both Xcode just spits out both versions and
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:27.800]  You know when you're on a MacBook it runs the arm and it when you're on a desktop it runs the Intel
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.540]  That's also just assuming that
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:33.840]  Suruji hasn't figured out a way to run multiple arm cores in a way that just blows you out of the water
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.640]  Right, but on the I don't expect though that the Mac Pro that they've been working on would be that I mean
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:44.360]  Yeah, it would be if they if it were that would be the shock of a shock of a lifetime
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.760]  Another great presentation right if it's all along it has been you know that they never had any
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.720]  Intention of the new Mac Pro being Intel based if it was always
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.640]  You know some kind of 18 core arm thing it would be damn cool. I don't expect that but
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.920]  One of these few companies like you've no one's having these specular discussions about what Dell's next right no workstation is gonna be right
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.000]  No, so it's for HP or whatever
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:15.120]  And then you know, yeah, that's the Mac
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.120]  I
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.160]  What else is on my list here I got the
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.600]  Got the iPad. Yeah, so the was there a regular iPad update this year
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:32.040]  Yeah, there was the added pencil support to the 9.7 inch at the March education event. That's right, right in Chicago
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.880]  Yeah, right and but it was a little weird in hindsight like the whole thing. We're like
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.920]  It didn't really work with the Apple pencil. It only worked or does it work with them?
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.000]  Yeah, it works with the Apple pencil with the new crayon
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.460]  But the crayon doesn't work on the iPad Pro. No
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.120]  The crown uses is really different technology
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.240]  That's really meant for education to let teachers just throw a bunch of them out at students
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.480]  I have them willy-nilly pick them up and use them, right?
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:01.640]  So the the 9.7 inch iPad does work with Apple pencil, but it also works with the crayon
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.700]  But the crayon only works with the iPad. Yes
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:11.680]  Nice update I don't know, you know, I don't know how well it is, you know, it's like the conversation as you know
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.240]  this year has been dominated by the new iPad pros because
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.820]  And the enthusiast community it's by far the more interesting device, but it's you know
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:27.120]  It it truly the the 9.7 inch iPad truly is Apple's computer that is priced for
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.240]  People who you know think a thousand dollars is too much, right?
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.080]  It's amazing
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.480]  That's one of the things like all the price complaints that we've been getting this year and you know
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.080]  I can certainly
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.680]  sympathize with a lot of them Apple has also been pushing some of their best technologies down to really like the
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:46.440]  The pencil on a $350 iPad that you could often find on sale for like 80 bucks less than that
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.820]  Takes a lot of it takes a lot of the stink out of that price curve. All right, it doesn't I don't know, you know, obviously
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:59.780]  They wanted us to think of it as a solution for the education market. I mean they held the event at a school. Yeah
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.680]  whether they've done anything to stem the title wave of
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:12.040]  The k-12 education market going all Chromebook all Google. I don't know
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.960]  I'm not close enough to judge that but I'm not sure that they have and no, I don't think they've done anything
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.360]  I think like I don't think Apple institutionally equipped
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:24.400]  I mean a lot of people want them to do it because they want the same level of privacy and education
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.080]  That Apple is delivering to the consumer sector
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.200]  But I think it's the same as enterprise was 20 years ago where they just never stopped the onslaught of Microsoft
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:37.400]  It's just that the company's not built that way. But what they've done in education that I really like this year
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.260]  it's just all of they spent hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in courses like
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:47.720]  everyone can code everyone can create all the today at Apple stuff the field trips the
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:54.000]  Hour of code the summer camps. They just give that away to anybody. That's the own Apple stuff
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.840]  You can just go to an Apple store and learn all that stuff and it's a fundamentally different education model than Google and Microsoft
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:07.600]  And it's not about the classroom. It's about direct to children learning, but it's still a pretty amazing investment on Apple's part. Yeah
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.920]  iPad Pro on the other hand different market. Yep
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.320]  it's probably in my opinion the
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.320]  The Apple hardware device of the year. Yeah, I'm trying to think
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.080]  Think would be a close because of all the cool health stuff would be the the other one for me. But yeah
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.480]  Yeah, I don't know though that the watch is
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:38.920]  Well, maybe it is as much better as the iPad Pro is over the previous. I've been 64-bit the ECG
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.440]  There's just a lot in there. I think too, but those two definitely stand way above the rest for me
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.420]  Well, let me take a break and thank our next sponsor
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  and it's our good friends at
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:58.520]  Squarespace look Squarespace sponsors this show on a very regular basis and the reason that they keep sponsoring is simple people keep signing up
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.840]  for Squarespace
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.840]  Who listen to the show?
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.440]  Like I told you last episode the idea isn't that hey
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.860]  Maybe today the day you're listening to this episode you want to start a new website and you're gonna go
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.240]  Drop pause the show and go start a website on Squarespace
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.040]  the idea is
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.720]  You listen to me tell you how could they are and then when you do need a new website
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.800]  And maybe you do need one soon, you know, it's New Year's people do New Year's resolutions
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.960]  maybe you want to raise money maybe one of your resolutions is to start a new website or
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.240]  Replace an old one with a new one
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.000]  My recommendation is that you start by just giving put 30 minutes into it. Maybe an hour
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.100]  Maybe that 30 minutes turns into an hour because you keep going
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.680]  Started at Squarespace and see how far you can go. It really is all in one
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:49.960]  Web hosting web design you pick great templates. They're all professionally designed
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:57.080]  They all scale from your phone to a giant 27-inch display huge variety and they're all customizable completely
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.640]  And you do the customization right there in the browser through drag-and-drop and a human, you know non
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.280]  coding interface
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:12.360]  You don't need to know HTML or CSS or JavaScript or anything like that to get all the cool functionality if you do
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:19.840]  Know things like HTML CSS and JavaScript you can definitely get in there and modify the stuff manually if you want to
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.120]  But you don't have to it's just like buying a car
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.200]  You don't have to open the hood, but if you want to open the hood you can open the hood
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.100]  high performance
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:35.000]  Great analytics and a terrific analytic interface domain name registration. You name it when it comes to hosting a website
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.720]  E-commerce you want to set up a store set up at Squarespace and they handle
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.200]  Everything for making it easy for you to add, you know SKUs and have items, you know
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.400]  catalog of things to sell
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:53.620]  Options for what what what type of options there are for the things you're selling and then they handle all the credit card stuff
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.600]  Really everything you'd want to do on a website you can do it Squarespace
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.720]  Keep it in mind next time you need a new website including if you're building one for the new year

[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.240]  My thanks to Squarespace for their continuing sponsorship of the talk show
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.240]  You
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.840]  What else about iPad I guess we can't we can't stop talking about iPad without talking about the
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:47.080]  to me, maybe the debate of the year, which is the dichotomy between the brilliance of the iPad Pro hardware and
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.920]  The limitations of iOS 12 as a
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:59.160]  A workstation OS for for for work. Yeah
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.260]  I mean we could obviously do a whole show on this we can't but probably have
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:10.400]  But I really do feel like there is something about this year's hardware and
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:18.080]  Maybe the meager improvements of iOS 12 on the iPad Pro front in terms of features
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:25.760]  That really sort of brought this to a head that the hardware has gotten ever better. It is undeniably to me the best
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:33.920]  Portable computing hardware anybody's ever made and the software is to me frustrating frustratingly limited
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.980]  I think it's a little bit nuanced because this was not the software that was supposed to ship with it
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:42.040]  We you know in order to get all those performance improvements with iOS 12
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:48.440]  Roughly half of the features were pushed back to iOS 13 including the new springboard and and a bunch of other stuff
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.360]  That might have made a lot more sense
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:56.200]  With this hardware any other year, but then also a lot of people's solution was like I just put finder on there
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.340]  Which is exactly the opposite right Apple Apple doesn't want to copy over like cut and paste Mac features
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:08.000]  They want to find the intent behind those features and implement in a way that makes sense for the future not the past
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.440]  Yeah, but it's tough. It is a it's a challenge and this to me
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:17.360]  The fact that it is difficult to solve these problems with without
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.120]  While keeping the iPad what it's great at at already and always has been right
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.600]  It it's a tough design challenge really tough it is, you know to me the most exciting
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.900]  Area of user interface design going on today
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.400]  But that's what Apple's always been good at is solving these problems
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.680]  They had some I mean the past was hard for them because I think in the Steve Jobs Scott Forrestal era
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.040]  There was a real feeling that iOS 6 was like the pinnacle and that iOS should never get more complicated
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.360]  It should remain an incredibly easy to use accessible operating system for everyone and if you don't like it get a Mac
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.580]  but then when Craig Federicki came on board he skews way nerdier and he started doing things like airdrop and
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:04.760]  continuity and extensibility and all of those things that made the operating system so much so much more powerful with a such bigger potential
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.200]  But they had so much to recover then they had to do the size classes
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.120]  They had to do this side
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:15.500]  But they had to build out a whole infrastructure the headless apps everything and that put them even further like years behind and now
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:18.920]  They still have to to your point. They have to catch up the software to where the hardware is
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:21.080]  yeah, and there's things that are as
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.840]  as pleasing as touch interface can be and as
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.660]  accessible as that makes it and I think it explains the great success that
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:37.820]  just regular people have using an iPad and thriving on it and getting more done and doing more than they ever did on a
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.220]  Mac or Windows machine because it is conceptually simpler and
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:45.020]  There is a sense
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:49.540]  I mean the Mac in particular goes out of the way out of its way to try to make it hard to
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:55.640]  Mess up your system by using it, right? But the iPad makes it impossible
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.540]  Really? Yeah, like you can't really do anything or install anything on your iPad that messes it up
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:07.060]  But there are inherent limitations like one that I key every time I try to use iOS on extended basis
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:10.760]  Like it really really bothers me now that they've added drag-and-drop
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:16.660]  Which in theory is better because it didn't have drag-and-drop and the Mac did and drag-and-drop is good
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:23.500]  but now that it has drag-and-drop when I hold my finger on a link in Safari and I want to get the
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:27.420]  Contextual menu with a bunch of options of things to do with the link
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:32.300]  I have to wait because yes when I first touch on it, it raises the link as a
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.140]  Drag-and-drop object. Yeah, whereas on the Mac it's overloaded
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.860]  The gestures are overloaded at this point, right?
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:43.580]  And it is an area like in terms of being conceptually simpler to touch is better
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.740]  but a
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.740]  mouse pointer with a click is
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:55.180]  Is more powerful because you don't have to wait for either right you put your mouse on the link and
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:59.140]  right click and the contextual moment menu opens instantly and
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:06.820]  When you put your mouse over the pointer and click and drag you drag the URL immediately
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:13.480]  There's no wait for either you can it conceptually can support both things as an instantaneous action. Whereas with touch
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:20.180]  one of them has to be something you wait for and I personally feel like they
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:26.780]  Maybe made it the wrong way that maybe the contextual menu should have opened first and then if you keep holding
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:30.540]  Then you can drag because we're in a world where there was pressure on my pad
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:35.140]  I'd be able to just touch it to have the contextual menu and then press that to do the drag-and-drop or vice versa, right?
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.540]  or maybe make the
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.700]  Contextual menu open right away, but at the top of it is a grippy strip where yeah
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:46.900]  You can use that to drag the link. I mean there's other ways to do it
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:51.420]  I mean again, I I can that's just those are just things off the top of my head, but the way things stand today
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:57.000]  It is frustrating to me every single time and it's not one of those things that I get used to
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.620]  It's one of those things where my frustration grows over time because I never want to wait for the computer and it's absolutely ridiculous
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:06.820]  That I'm waiting for the fastest Apple portable I've ever I've ever owned
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:12.420]  It's a far faster computer than my 2014 MacBook Pro and yet I'm waiting for it
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.420]  Just to give me a link to copy the URL
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.540]  And you shouldn't have to think about like how they should implement it
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.200]  I mean, this is a problem that we have and it's their job to fix these problems
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:24.420]  All right, and you know, I think that there's the sure I think the shortcut is a two-finger tap on a URL
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:28.840]  We'll open it in a new tab. Yeah, that's a good shortcut that I didn't know about for a while
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:33.260]  But sometimes links are only on one word and there's not enough room to two-finger tap on it
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.780]  You know, it's those things aren't that discoverable
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:39.780]  Well, it's not discoverable at all, but it's good to know but you literally can't you know
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:44.860]  Like one of the other inherent limitations of touches it requires significantly more space because your fingers are fat
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.940]  And if somebody just links on the word here
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:51.940]  Which is bad hyperlinking style frankly, but it happens
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:57.440]  There's no room for two fingers to touch it or you have to be so incredibly precise that you're waiting anyway
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.500]  Yeah, no, absolutely
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:05.180]  You want the instant state to be the the drag with you so many other again. It's just overloaded
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:08.060]  There's only unless you start drawing spells on the screen
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:11.060]  Let's do a whole bunch of different things which isn't human accessible at all
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:16.620]  there's only a limited amount of things that are really big juicy gestures if you just sink your fingers into and all of those like
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.780]  Just think how how many different things you're swiping up from the bottom of the screen to do
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:24.060]  We're swiping up from different corners of the screen and all of that stuff is now massively overloaded
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.820]  But it's not the worst idea in the world
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:31.180]  you know, like I've written a bunch recently in the last half of the last couple months about undo and how undo kind of is
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:37.020]  sucks on iOS, you know the fact that the standard interface thing for undo is still shake to undo is
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.020]  a
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.340]  Undiscoverable B makes people look silly and seed is
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:47.180]  Theoretically a little dangerous, you know, like it certainly isn't
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.860]  Certainly has accessibility problems
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:54.100]  Like it's a great gag, but it's a usability feature, right?
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:58.060]  And it's like if you search Twitter and stuff like that, you can find people every day who are discovering
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.060]  That that's how you undo and they can't believe it
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:04.900]  and you know drawing apps have come up with a sort of
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:09.540]  well, even Apple supports it where you're in the notes when you're in the
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.800]  Markup mode. There's a little sort of backward-looking arrow that you can tap to do it
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.360]  But that's only when you're drawing, you know
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:22.940]  whereas on the Mac undo is a solved problem command Z edit menu undo has been there since 1984 and
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.620]  They've you know
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.740]  They work in every single context for every type of app and every type of action
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:37.020]  You know other vendors have solved this like you just swipe backwards a little across the keyboard because the keyboard is not real
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:41.340]  It's you can do anything you want on it swipe backwards on the keyboard it undoes swipe for is on the keyboard redos
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:45.180]  There's all these different things that can implement it. Yeah, and you know, it doesn't have to be
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:50.300]  You know the fact that it could there could be shortcuts for it, you know that there aren't
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.780]  Discoverable doesn't mean you shouldn't use them
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:57.460]  There should be something that's discoverable and there should be there could be shortcuts that are more convenient, you know
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.520]  Like the procreate double finger
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:07.640]  Yeah, right. That's and which is sort of widely adopted. What is a two finger tap? Yep. Yeah two finger tap to undo
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.840]  But again, there's sort of an overloading, you know
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.220]  There's only so many ways you can tap and you know
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:18.700]  Like I just said before Apple has used two finger tap in Safari to mean open the link in a new tab
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:19.500]  Yeah, right
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.540]  And so it's kind of weird
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:26.080]  It would be like if command Z opened a new tab in Safari like no command we're hovering over a link
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:32.660]  Yeah, didn't if you weren't hovering over like like undo sort of needs to be universal and you know again
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.860]  I've mentioned many times before that, you know, the Newton gets a bad rap, but the Newton had it down
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.860]  You took the pen. Yeah, and you scribbled
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:41.640]  Up and down up and down up and down and that was undo
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:44.700]  Yeah, is it side to side? I forget which way I don't know
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:50.300]  But there was like a little back and forth motion you could make and then had a nice little poof animation where it would
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:54.300]  Uh, I guess that was delete. I don't know. Maybe that wasn't undo. Maybe did like a Z for undo
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:50:01.820]  I'm sorry people who remember the Newton vividly, but there was a standard undo and there was an undo button built into the thing underneath screen
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:06.460]  That's how important undo was on the Newton. I guess the scribble was how you deleted shit
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:09.820]  Now I got to get my yeah
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.260]  Please don't write in
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:19.220]  Yeah, but anyway Newton had system-wide undo had system-wide delete and you know the gestures, you know
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:23.480]  I don't know. I feel like anyway 2019 looking forward to it on the iPad
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:28.120]  I really really really really really will be disappointed if there aren't major
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:33.560]  structural interface conceptual interface changes that effectively make
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:37.180]  iOS on iPad more of an iPad OS
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.940]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean to your point about the zero regression
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:45.580]  the only way to have consistent progress with iPad is if you have a separate team like there's an
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:51.200]  Apple watch team and an Apple TV team and they get their own segments at WWDC and that means they have to have something to
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.540]  Present but there's nothing for iPad. So we have years where there's almost nothing for iPad
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:51:00.720]  But if they had their own team and their own segment, they had their own tent poles every year if you get something for iPad
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.620]  Yeah, and you know, there is nothing wrong
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:10.460]  I also don't think there's anything wrong with the fact that maybe even a majority almost certainly a majority of iPad happy iPad users
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:15.440]  Are literally using the iPad as a big iPhone and there's nothing wrong with that
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:19.620]  in fact, that's I think that's that's the main reason why the iPad is sold in the
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:24.700]  Aggregate quantities that it has and there's no reason that that should be law
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:29.140]  you know for the people who really want to use it in a very simple way with one app at a time and a
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:33.740]  Way to go home and then tap another app and then what you know, the app takes the whole screen
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:35.980]  That's great
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:44.060]  but I it just needs to scale to power usage in the way that I have the Mac did write the Mac it could be used and
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:47.820]  You know if anything to some of the simplicity of the Mac has been lost
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:54.080]  You know that the there's a lot of stuff going on in a default finder window, you know as opposed to
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:59.520]  You know system 6 era the Mac could be used in a very simple way
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:07.100]  back then and yet supported all sorts of things that you could do while holding down keys on the keyboard and
[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:11.640]  Installing third-party software that supported extremely
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:18.360]  Advanced power use, you know for advanced users. It's scaled directly from simplicity
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:23.760]  Not being familiar with the mouse to being a power user with one hand on the keyboard one hand and a mouse at all times
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.520]  I have family members who seriously only use their iPhone to play music take photographs and answer the phone and maybe text and that's it
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.760]  And they don't know or care
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:36.480]  But anything on that device and it's wonderful because they can do that and I can use Siri shortcuts and we don't get in each
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:40.200]  Other's way. Yeah, exactly, you know Siri shortcuts is probably
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.940]  One of the highlights of the year for me for iOS
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:49.520]  I still don't use it as much as I probably should although I have a couple it's it's like
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:56.300]  With Apple script and keyboard maestro. I make my own things on the Mac. Whereas on Siri shortcuts
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.580]  I'm using shortcuts made by others. Yes
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:05.060]  Not because I can't but because I mean Syracuse I talked about this on ATP a few episodes ago
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:12.980]  but it's like if you are a programmer it feels like you're it's very frustrating to go into the limitations of shortcuts for making something a
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.260]  depth or in depth but
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.620]  And you know
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:23.460]  Like I've said before like I think I said in a recent episode like automator is similar where you have these steps that you stack
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.600]  Visually, but when I use automator
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:32.860]  It's effectively like just one thing and then I have like a pearl pearl or apple skirt program in the second step
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:36.260]  and it's just a way to make a service where it takes the selection as input and
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:42.900]  Replaces the selection as output and everything I'm creating is in the middle step, which is either written in pearl or apple script
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:45.460]  And there is no step like that
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:49.040]  Like that's what I kind of want for shortcuts is and I know that that language would be JavaScript
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.140]  In the iOS world and I'm fine with that
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:54.140]  I mean, I don't it's not my favorite language, but I could live with it
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:57.380]  But I kind of want there to be a JavaScript step that you can make
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:00.180]  Just to you know
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:05.100]  Program if you want a program, but anyway, it's been a very it's been a success
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.580]  and I think it's some of the things people are making with Siri shortcuts are
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:16.140]  Almost shocking to me how powerful they are and app like the experience can be. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's been great
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:20.220]  And it's only the first that's the first iteration and I think I know you had it in your notes
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.460]  And I don't know when you want to talk about it
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:27.660]  But just Apple seems to have suddenly started taking all of that stuff far more seriously this year than they have in previous years
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:34.620]  Well, like what stuff like the AI though just make yeah making Siri and making the voice interface
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:40.380]  Part of iOS almost like an equal starting to build it back up to being an equal citizen. Well, let's hold on that thought
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:46.340]  Let's talk. Let's go through watch an iPhone first. Yeah, I don't want to give short shrift to the watch. I
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:52.580]  Didn't buy a watch series for though just because I already have the series 3 and
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:59.940]  As much as I like the series 4 for what and when I wear my Apple watch doesn't seem like a buy a new one
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:05.180]  Every year thing and maybe if I were spying the aluminum models, I would but I bought this space black stainless steel one
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:07.180]  Yeah the year before
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.380]  And on
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:15.100]  While I think the new watch hardware is clearly better-looking. That was really the gist of my entire review
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:21.700]  I actually think that the watch faces the classic watch faces look better on the old Apple watch and only the new
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:26.580]  watch faces look best on the new Apple watch and I like I like the I
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.860]  Still like of all the faces. I like utility the best and I think utility looks best on the old Apple watch
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:33.620]  Yeah, no, that's fair
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:38.060]  I mean, they're finally starting to add back some of the missing complications like messages and mail to the new watch face
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:43.860]  Yeah, which was which is a big improvement for me. Yeah, and I wonder I actually have to fire
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.300]  I still have the review you know
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:49.740]  I gotta send that back but I want to fire it up with the latest version of watch OS on it and see if they've
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.940]  Also fixed it to me was a sign that they were a little
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.060]  Late is that a lot of the area a lot of the watch faces?
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:02.860]  I have this thing set to use bold font everywhere, which isn't even an accessibility thing for my eyes
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.820]  I just think it looks better, but it was all the new watch faces
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:11.340]  They didn't use the bold font anywhere and all the complications. It was like they didn't get around to supporting supporting that
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:16.020]  It's like the thin version of San Francisco everywhere. Yeah, I don't know if they fixed that. Let's take a look
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:18.780]  But I do think it's I think it's a remarkable
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:24.260]  I think it's I think it's also interesting that the watch is the only other hardware that is clearly on an annual cycle
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:28.540]  Compared to the phone. Everybody knows the phone is on an annual cycle. Everybody knows that the phone is
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:35.980]  by the books at least 65% of Apple's profits, but you can make the argument that because like you have to have a phone to
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:37.540]  get a watch and
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.740]  How much of Apple's services business goes through people who have a phone that it's arguably
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.180]  You know, maybe 75 or 80 percent of Apple's business, you know
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:52.100]  That at least at all if it's not directly through iPhone sales, it is things that rely upon the iPhone
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:55.620]  Yes, everybody knows the iPhone, you know, and that's why the iPhone is on a religious
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:00.900]  annual schedule, you know, I I would be shocked as shit if in
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:07.680]  Early September next year there is not an Apple event on a Tuesday or Wednesday where they introduce brand new iPhones
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:11.580]  But it's interesting to me that the watch is seemingly on that same schedule
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:17.700]  Yeah, I think it's just it's so early as a product like in the early days of iPad that there's just so much they can
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:23.820]  Iterate that they're just they're doing those iterations. Yeah, and one rule, you know, I don't know if you know
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:29.380]  There will come day eventually, I mean who knows how many years from now
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:32.180]  I mean, it's hard to imagine, you know, it certainly isn't the foreseeable future
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:35.140]  But there will come a day when there's no longer an annual iPhone every year
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:40.400]  I mean, I don't know if it's a 20 iPod member, right? It was you know, all of a sudden there isn't an iPod
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.220]  I mean
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:47.460]  But I do think though that with the watch it follows, you know, one thing I know you've heard it
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:50.400]  I've heard it we talked to people at Apple and one thing
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.940]  That they are very serious about is they don't want to make changes just to make changes. Yes
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:00.140]  They only want to make changes where they can provide meaningful improvement to the product
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:08.260]  You know, and so why doesn't why does the iPhone 7 look so much like the iPhone 6 even though it was two years after?
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:09.660]  Mm-hmm
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.740]  Because they weren't ready to make something that was meaningfully better, you know
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:17.520]  And then they you know, then there was the iPhone 10 and yeah. All right here. Here's our meaningfully better
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:23.000]  Yeah, and I think they are improving so much and it's so
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:28.740]  Underestimated outside the Apple media community just how good Apple is
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:35.080]  Uniquely at making ever ever smaller tinier computers and the watch exemplifies that right the first
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:41.640]  Evident this year because Qualcomm had their huge event and they were gonna show off their competing chip and their first watch chip was a rehash
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:47.400]  Of their old phone chip and this year's watch chip was a rehash of that old phone chip with like a coprocessor on it
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:51.820]  And it struck me at just how far behind everyone else is at making wearable silicon
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:56.800]  Yeah, it's you know, and and how quickly Apple's gotten better at it, right?
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.640]  It's yeah, it is, you know, the first one was underpowered
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:04.360]  But it was probably the right time to ship it right like it was at the thermal limit of the casing of that device
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.360]  At the time right and it had you know
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.800]  And it had you know
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:14.880]  The worst it had significantly worse battery life than you get now like I regularly go days now where I you know
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:19.160]  Put my Apple watch on in the morning wear it all day go to bed and keep it on and wake up
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:22.000]  Yeah, and it's still at 49% and I'm like, well, that's good
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.120]  Because if I just have 24 hours in it, it's 49 hours. I can wear it all day and put it on charger tonight
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.680]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know what you would have had to do with the original Apple watch to do that
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:35.000]  I mean stay completely motionless
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.760]  Keep keep your hand
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:43.820]  Keep your hand over the display. I mean, yeah, you know the power consumption that speed, you know, I mean
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:51.160]  It's pretty remarkable and as you mentioned a bit ago the the way that they're moving pushing forward
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:57.660]  With the health monitoring stuff is you know, I think clearly the tip of the iceberg so far
[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:03.180]  But it's great like my I bought them for my family members, you know
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:09.340]  Cuz especially because of the fall detection and because of the the hell the heart rate monitor, but my friend Georgia
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.500]  She was she was home
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:15.980]  She was walking down the stairs and she fell and she fell hard and it went off and her husband hurt her
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:19.180]  She fell so hard her husband hurt her and rushed downstairs to get her
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:22.340]  But if she'd been home alone that watch was like saying are you okay?
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:26.540]  We're gonna start calling 911 and she was so happy that that feature existed in that moment
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:29.360]  Yeah, I haven't heard I've you seen any stories that have
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:32.020]  you know, we've
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:37.540]  the stories that I've seen over the years are people who've been in car crashes and have you you know been pinned behind the
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:41.860]  Wheel and have used the call 911 feature of the watch to get help
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:48.420]  When if not for that feature they you know couldn't reach their phone or you know could you know?
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:50.420]  Literally could only reach the wrist or whatever
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.940]  You know, thankfully
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:55.180]  Thankfully, it's the type of thing. You don't want to see a lot of those stories
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:58.900]  You don't want to see people totally hurt, but I haven't seen anybody saved by a fall yet
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.300]  I did see a story of somebody who got one and it
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.020]  the
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:10.260]  The irregular heartbeat thing. Yes was or when that feet it wasn't when they got the watch. It was when the feature CG
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:13.180]  Yeah, yeah, and the feature didn't ship until a couple of weeks ago
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:18.660]  As promised, you know, they did say it would ship late in the year and it did ship late in here
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:22.980]  I did see the I saw the story about the one guy he was getting he was it was like going off for him
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:27.740]  And he thought it was buggy and he his wife wife put the watch on and it didn't go off and then he put the watch
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:30.020]  Back on and it went off again and she was like shit
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.020]  I guess I got to go to the doctor and he went to the doctor and the doctor was like, yeah
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:35.300]  You good thing you came in, you know, you got like a real problem
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.740]  You should buy some apples talk that thing to save your life. Yeah
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:43.300]  So I haven't seen any stories about the fall detection yet, but I'm sure it'll happen
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.620]  It's you know, yeah, and I have seen reports. I've anecdote the anecdotal reports
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:51.620]  I've seen are like your friend George's where it's people who've fallen and they weren't significantly hurt
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:57.660]  But the fault detection worked exactly as you'd want it to yeah. Yeah, or she was hurt
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.660]  But her case again, her husband was there. She didn't need the watch
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:02.420]  But otherwise, she'd been alone. She would have really needed that feature. Yeah
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:09.100]  Anyway, good year for Apple watch. Yeah, I would expect another one though, you know another and another annual update
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:15.740]  I feel like that they're still really really pushing ahead and there's so many ways to improve in that product. Yeah, absolutely
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:21.100]  We got to go fast. We're running short on time and we still got iPhone to talk about. I
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:27.180]  Really butchered this by spending so much time talking about a keyboard but no
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:34.260]  You know, what is there to say about the iPhone 10s 10s max 10 hour that we haven't before
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:36.680]  I mean, I think it's a good year for the iPhone
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:43.660]  I think the the this year's scanned last if last year scandal was the battery thought rattling this year's is the
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:50.380]  Even earlier than usual claims that sales are underwhelming, you know, yes in past years
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:55.620]  that's always seemed like a January thing and now it was like an early December thing and I think it is
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:00.300]  Well, we'll see but I think it's nonsense to frankly
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:03.640]  Yeah, I mean there's two like there's two ways to think about it one
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:06.540]  Is that you know people like you people like me have been talking about?
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:12.320]  You know bringing up the old Jim Cramer clips and all those things that show just how utter bullshit it is and that they have
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.460]  to go even harder at the rumors to move the market because I still think a lot of it is just pure market manipulation and
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:22.620]  Just trying to get people to shortly to lower to sell shares so they can short them and make a lot of money and then
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:24.620]  Apple reports its earnings and they can make it all back
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:29.700]  And I think that's probably criminal. I don't know why it's never been investigated. Sounds criminal to me, but
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:33.780]  Or you know that this is another case where the iPhone 10
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.700]  And I think you mentioned this too
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:43.500]  the iPhone 8 was comforting the iPhone 10 was enticing and people either stuck with the iPhone 8 or bought the iPhone 10 and
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.960]  There's no iPhone 10s supercycle
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:51.480]  You know the they pulled upgrades forward or people are gonna stick with the old version and this is gonna be just a normal iPhone
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:53.480]  Year, yeah
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:04:01.340]  But it's it seems crazy that people are so willing to bite on this when it's there there there is no
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:08.380]  There seemingly is no boy who cried wolf factor to the fact that this has happened years in a row and has never panned out
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:11.980]  And then each time it's it's as though it had never happened again, right?
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:17.740]  Like I don't know what makes this annual cycle of Apple has severely cut
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:23.380]  you know the supplies orders from somebody in Asia and
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:26.820]  It's you know
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:31.500]  Just suggesting that this is the year where people stop buying the new iPhones and
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:37.460]  And then it never pans out but it's it's you know, I mean the whole stock market is a mess at the time
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:42.340]  But at this time but Apple's stock has to take in a serious hit and again, I've said this before
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.180]  I'm not really I'm not really in this for the finance angle
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:49.460]  I'm not people don't don't listen to the show or follow me for my advice on Apple stock
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.740]  You know, I'm mostly interested in their products
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:05:00.140]  but where this affects the products is it affects retention because the Apple stock is a you know a
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:05.660]  Huge motivation for people to continue work, you know, it's it's important to the people who are there
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:08.700]  It can act as a draw for people who they want to hire
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.980]  and so like a significant hit to Apple stock and you know
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:18.540]  it's like a butterfly flapping its wings and China eventually lead to a
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:22.880]  a decrease in the quality of Apple's products if it becomes a retention problem
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:27.220]  Because the stock is is suppressed or depressed for me
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:33.140]  It's like we live in an era where where words like fake news are being weaponized and they're being used to destroy legitimate
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:39.380]  Reporting and I think that the only answer to that is to be even better in your reporting and we keep seeing these terrible
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:44.020]  Apple supply chain reports, but also Bloomberg's big hack, which it's like months later now
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:47.500]  And they say we've done complete audit and they've still not said anything about it
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:52.620]  And to me that just that just destroys the credibility of something that requires that credibility more than ever
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:56.100]  And I think that's that's a tragedy. Yeah, and you know, that's
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:01.140]  There they seem to me clearly to be hoping that we just forget about that story
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:06.140]  And I don't think we should and I think at this point and again, it's not entirely fair
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:10.060]  but I mean at this point when when other reporters come out with stories at
[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:14.780]  From Bloomberg about Apple it it has to it's you know
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:19.740]  Has to be mentioned alongside that this is the publication that printed a completely a seemingly discredited
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:25.040]  Jaw-breaking story about Apple, you know that and other publications in these situations
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.740]  They've done their own internal audits and they've published their results and Bloomberg seems to have no willingness to do that, right?
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:35.940]  They really they really don't you know that and it's they're they're handling this very poorly in my opinion
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:38.920]  And I don't think it's going to work. I don't think people are just going to forget about it
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:43.140]  No, it's gonna take that all that like you said gonna take their reporting for the foreseeable future. Yeah
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:45.260]  What else do you see the?
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:51.580]  What's that DX o mark came out with their rankings like right before Christmas
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:55.360]  Yeah, it's about the trash lot
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:55.860]  Yeah
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:07:01.820]  It was like right before Christmas DX o mark who comes out with these camera ranking phone camera rank ends every year and I've been calling
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:06.740]  Bullshit on them for years whether Apple comes out on top or somebody else comes out on top
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:12.300]  It's not about whether the iPhone is the top-ranked camera or not. It's that you it just makes no sense
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.620]  to say that the iPhone X s camera is a
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:20.380]  97 and the pixel 3 is a 93 that doesn't make any sense
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:25.200]  It does not make any sense to assign one numeric integer value to a camera
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:32.000]  and if anything as time goes on and the cameras in our phones are less about the
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:35.020]  physical camera the lens the sensor and
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:42.780]  More about the computational photography that happens after the photons hit the sensor after going through the lens
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:47.340]  The idea of signing an integer to that is is ridiculous
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:53.260]  I mean one of the big I mean that's really really what the difference between the pixel 3 and the iPhone X s camera are
[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:58.400]  It's really not about the physical cameras. It's about what the systems do with the image afterwards
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:04.060]  What they sharpen what they do to certain color tones and stuff like that
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:07.540]  It's very highly subjective and it's it's ridiculous
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:11.420]  But the worst part is that they're also a consulting company, which they don't discuss
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:16.140]  but like apparently this year Google didn't pay the usual consulting fees which get some early access and
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:20.460]  Advice on how to do better on the things so they didn't get a good mark and they put it out late
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:26.400]  It's not to me. You just you can't you can't you could never talk about this company again, if that's the situation
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:33.140]  Well, I don't know but last year when the pixel came out on top a lot of pixel fans did crow about the DXO marks
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:35.340]  Yeah, this year the pixel 3 came out
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.020]  significantly low
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:44.520]  The iPhone X s and X R and a couple of other Android phones and I don't I don't hear anybody talking about it
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:47.700]  No again, I think it's bullshit. I think it's complete bullshit
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:52.100]  But I think it's the lesson to be learned is that everybody should treat this company is bullshit. Yeah
[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:54.940]  I think it's all very similar
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:09:04.460]  Oh god, we're running short but I don't really have much else to say about the iPhone X s and X R
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:06.620]  I think it's a good year. I think the X R is
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:09.660]  Is a great product
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:14.820]  People are concerned. I guess the thing that people are concerned about is the way that Apple is promoting the X R as a
[02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:17.260]  $449 device
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:23.440]  Yeah with an asterisk and then the asterisk leads to a footnote that says with a trade-in of an iPhone 7 or something
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:29.700]  You know like to get it for four hundred forty nine dollars. You have to trade in an iPhone that has still has significant
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:34.860]  Resale value which makes sense because if you don't trade anything and it's a seven hundred fifty dollar phone
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:40.980]  So I get it but for years they were saying it was a hundred ninety nine dollar phone asterisk with a
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:46.680]  24 month contract. So yeah, right and I think has changed, you know, I get it that in some ways
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:49.560]  We'd like Apple to be above that sort of shenanigans
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:56.640]  But it's really hard when everybody else is selling things with prices that have asterisks for various reasons
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:04.660]  I mean the whole car industry in last ten years has switched from telling you how much cars cost to how much how much it
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:08.940]  Cost per month to lease them like yeah, absolutely. They used to tell you in the car commercials
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:14.660]  You know here this card, you know, the new Mercedes c-class starts at forty seven thousand dollars or something now
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:20.780]  It is entirely about monthly lease prices. Um, you know, it is what it is
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:25.900]  It's you know, and you know and in terms of being well, they should be above it all Apple has always
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:33.820]  I mean, I don't even I don't know when they haven't been a 99 pricer, right? Everything is for 99 799
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:38.260]  I mean if we really want to hold them to the highest regards they should be pricing these things, you know
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:41.540]  They should say that it's seven hundred fifty dollars not seven hundred forty nine dollars
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:46.620]  It's a human trait where we're always we're always very careful how we want other people to use their money
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:49.020]  And we don't care at all about how we use ours right now
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:52.580]  Like we don't hold ourselves to these standards, but Apple, you know, they better do a lot of stuff
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:58.060]  That's just not in their best interest because we happen to think so right but and I you know, I'll say that and I
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:06.660]  I've been tinkering this year on my writing with with adding the extra dollar and saying that it's eight hundred or fourteen hundred instead of
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:12.740]  1399 yeah, it gets complicated though because there's times when you really do want to be precise and so it's hard to mix and match
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:20.100]  But I will say this if I took a job at Apple and my job was to set the prices for products
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:25.660]  That's my entire job, but I was going to be measured by you know, how well sales were I would price him at 799
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:30.660]  Yeah, 1399 I used to work in product marketing and you do that because that's how humans work
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:32.620]  That's literally how our brains work, right?
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:37.420]  So, you know, I don't think it's great that the a 10r is being advertised at 449 asterisk
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:43.420]  But I'm not I'm not aghast at it and I certainly don't take it in any way as a sign that the 10r
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:47.380]  Was selling poorly. I I think that was I think this was the plan all along
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:53.640]  I think that that part of the reason part of the idea of having the iPhone 10 are
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:57.580]  look so much like the iPhone 10s and 10s max and
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:02.300]  Hmm, right, you know my my when there was rumors first came up. My question was well
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:07.140]  How are they gonna sell these higher-end ones, you know, if this is so good. Yeah
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:11.300]  And you know, I think the answer is that they were gonna market it this way
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.460]  You know that it's it's it's very it's the 10r is being
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.660]  Marketed this way because the 10r is the one that's meant to sell to people who are concerned about things like this
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:21.660]  You know most price conscious
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.580]  You know, it is what it is
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:27.580]  I think people look at it both ways to like you could think Oh apples desperate
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:28.880]  So they're doing all these sales tactics
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:33.540]  but you can also say Apple really wants to crush it with this phone and has always wanted to crush it with this phone and
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:37.500]  They were always gonna do anything they could to sell as many of these phones as possible. Yeah
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:41.300]  Alright, I'm gonna take a third break right here. Thank our third sponsor
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:45.380]  our final sponsor of the year at the talk show is
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:48.860]  OmniFocus from the Omni group
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:53.180]  Accomplished more every day with the trusted gold standard to do app
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:58.140]  It's been on Apple's app stores since day one. The Omni group has been developing for Apple's platforms
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:04.140]  Since the dawn of time they are one of the great independent Mac developers with the highest standards for UI
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:06.940]  code quality software quality
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:11.300]  approachability for new users depth for power users
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:17.100]  OmniFocus is available for Mac for iOS
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:24.100]  For iOS, it's a universal app for both iPhone and iPad. Of course Apple watch and brand-new OmniFocus
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:29.340]  For the web is in public beta and it's coming soon out of public beta, but you can use it right now
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:33.980]  So that means you can access OmniFocus from any computer anywhere in the world with web access
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:41.040]  Which pretty much means any computer now you can trust it because all of the syncing between devices is encrypted
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.040]  There's no way to sync without encryption
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.740]  You can use Omni's own servers for convenience. You can trust them, too
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:53.060]  But if you want you can even host on your own web dev server if you would prefer to have complete control
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:55.540]  over everything including your sync data
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:59.380]  What's new in OmniFocus 3? Well, my favorite new feature is tags
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:03.380]  Tag, I love tags tags are my favorite way of organizing stuff
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:05.620]  But with tags what you can do is of course
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:10.180]  You're going to organize by product projects and the to do app and of course OmniFocus has always supported them
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:13.520]  But now with tags you can tag things. Let's just say
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:20.980]  Email, that means you can go to your email tag and see all of your tasks across all of your projects in OmniFocus
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:25.220]  That are tagged email and just go through them all at once while you're going through emails that are overdue
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:32.660]  Other views forecast view that lets you plan ahead for today tomorrow two days from now with calendar events in line
[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:37.860]  Most powerful of all our custom perspectives that's in the pro version of OmniFocus
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.700]  It's a powerful way to view your data any way you need
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:47.420]  Now, let me tell you a little bit more about the Omni group. They offer world-class tech support even by telephone
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:53.500]  Their tech support staff. It's not outsourced. It's a core part of their team right there in their headquarters in Seattle
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.580]  They work side by side with the engineers who make the apps the designers who design them
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:04.720]  They are intimately familiar with everything Omni folk and every Omni group app including OmniFocus
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:10.260]  So if you ever need help, you'll be able to get it. They also have seriously world-class
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:13.420]  documentation really really great
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.100]  Documentation. So if you're a self learner you want to just learn the app by yourself truly great stuff. I
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:22.740]  Could tell you a lot more
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:26.220]  But they can do it a lot better. Just go to OmniFocus calm and
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.420]  Right at the top. They've got a one-minute video showing you everything new in OmniFocus 3
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:34.940]  I scroll down the page and they have just a terrific illustrated guide
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:37.060]  to
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:41.780]  Just how you get started with the OmniFocus system and they have so many great convenient features
[02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:46.260]  They make it so easy to add stuff to your inbox. So that's the idea pops in your head
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:51.020]  You've got a convenient way to just dash off that task. Have it show up in your inbox
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:56.700]  Sort it out later. And of course they support Siri so you don't even need to type you can just talk to Siri
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.320]  Tell your new idea and there it is in your inbox in OmniFocus
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:05.800]  Look, it's a new year. It's a great time to get organized
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:11.520]  If you're dissatisfied in any way with the way that you organize your to-do's your tasks your projects something like that
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.360]  Check out OmniFocus get the Mac app from their website
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:21.960]  It's got a 14-day free trial two full weeks where you can use everything free of charge just to see if it suits your needs
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.920]  My thanks to the Omni group. It's a great great app. Please check it out
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.920]  at OmniFocus dot-com
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:35.280]  All right speed round. Yes other products home pod. Yeah, I think it's you know
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.320]  I think it's interesting that somebody came out with I think there was a credible company that came out with a thing
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:44.900]  That's like ranked the top selling thing devices you speak to and home pod was way down on the list
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:49.440]  But then they ranked the ones that cost like 250 or more and it was at the top of the list
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:53.960]  Yeah, so the question is obviously, you know, it costs 350 bucks
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:56.080]  I mean, I know you can get it at a discount. I
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:59.760]  Don't know if it's been a disappointment to Apple or not
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:06.460]  Surely they knew that they were going to sell far fewer of them than Apple sells of I mean Amazon sells of $60 echo dots
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.800]  You know, I'm happy with mine, but I will say this
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:17.000]  I'm still we have two in the kitchen and I'm still frustrated with how often they get out of sync and
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:22.100]  Yeah need to be unplugged from the wall and plug back in to get them back to working
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:28.240]  yeah, like mine was I just couldn't get mine to respond today and then I tapped it and said turn on Siri and it said
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.220]  Siri's already on and then it just kept working from that and it's like what we on a coffee break
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:35.760]  Yeah, and sometimes in addition to being out of sync in terms of playing music or only one, you know
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.940]  Music will only play out of one instead of playing out of both and again
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:42.220]  The easiest way to fix it seems to be to unplug them both plug them back in
[02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:44.260]  The other thing is they seem to lose
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:46.860]  Track of our every once in a while
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:52.820]  They seem to lose track of our home kit stuff and it's like I say to turn open the shades and it's like working on it
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:54.860]  Yeah, yeah, I'm trying totally
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:59.860]  I think I think the home pod was a huge wake-up call for Apple's executives because they didn't have to deal with Siri
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:05.580]  For years and they didn't have to deal with airplay and the problems with Apple audio for years and this product gave them nowhere to
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:09.420]  Hide and now, you know that probably led to a lot of the stuff we saw change over the year
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:15.660]  Yeah air pods nothing new this year still my fail still my very favorite product in the last handful of years
[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:20.020]  Yeah from air pods forward still my very favorite Apple product and I've still got my first one
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:22.380]  They still have a tremendous tremendous battery life. I
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:29.180]  Don't know. It's probably lost some kind of battery life since then but I still seemingly almost never have to charge them
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.380]  I just think to do it every once in a while. I'm the same
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:34.380]  I still have the original ones that we got right after
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:40.380]  We have to give ours back like the preview that prototype whatever they were not prototype the pre-release ones back
[02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:42.260]  I bought a set I've been using them and
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:46.460]  they're so good that I can see the Apple watch taking over a lot of iPhone stuff over the years and
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:50.260]  Air pods taking on a lot of the Apple watch stuff like with all the health sensors in them
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:54.940]  Streaming Apple music streaming podcasts all that kind of stuff without even having to wear a watch anymore. Yeah
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:56.980]  air power
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:58.980]  Yeah
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:05.400]  December 30th now December 29th as we speak today. I'm starting to get the feeling we may not see it in 2018
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.680]  Yeah be interesting
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:13.740]  I'm my most interesting thing with that is whether the lack of a second version of air pods is really being held up by air
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:18.420]  Power because they don't want to ship the second version until they have the case that you can just rest on the air power
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:20.420]  So we'll see what happens
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:24.340]  I still wouldn't be surprised if air power just never never ships
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:29.180]  Would you have said something if you were Apple before the end of the year? No word. You've not said any no
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:29.540]  No
[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:34.660]  Well because I'd well unless they've made the decision that it's never going to ship in which case they should have announced it yesterday on
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:38.180]  A Friday at the end of the year because they said they said it's not good
[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:40.460]  We meant to ship it at the end of the year. We're not gonna make it
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:43.300]  We'll have it for you next year. Yeah, they haven't done that with air pods
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:47.680]  I think that they're still I I don't have any inside information on this
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:52.420]  But the fact that they haven't said anything makes me think that that we're never going to ship
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:55.240]  This is still on the table, but that they haven't made that decision yet
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:59.100]  And then what you know and then they could just announce it say look there's a bunch of cheap powered ones that are great
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.920]  It's it's the third party market has turned out better than we expected
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:03.920]  Yeah
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:06.040]  There we go
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:08.640]  All right last but not least it's
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.120]  To me maybe the biggest news of the year at Apple. I I think it was the hiring of
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.720]  John gianne andrea from yeah, which I believe they hired him in May
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:27.080]  He was the head of search and AI I think at Google at least search, but I think AI as well. Yeah
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:31.720]  And I think most people would agree that Google is the leading institution
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:37.040]  commercial or otherwise in in the field of search and AI
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:41.040]  Which are not necessarily related right you could it's in theory
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:44.080]  You could be the greatest search company in world not be that great. I or vice versa
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:52.640]  Recently was promoted to a senior VP level at Apple. I said last week with Jason. I was sort of surprised
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:53.920]  He wasn't a senior VP to start
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:57.320]  But I almost feel like maybe it was just like let's see if this works if you're a good fit for Apple
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:02.400]  It was nebulous. Like I think it was chief or something. Yeah, like vice president. Yeah, I can't help
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:06.880]  I don't know if it's cuz that John John Brownlee situation years ago before they hired Angela aren'ts
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.340]  But you know got the promotion he's obviously here to stay. I think it's been honestly anecdotally
[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:15.360]  I think it's already been a great year for Siri. I think Siri is actually
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  continuing getting better
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:23.160]  I think that the signaling to the to the industry in other words of
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:24.480]  professional
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:27.120]  engineers and computer scientists who work in the field is
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:33.440]  Maybe the most important aspect of that right that there was this gut feeling in the world of AI that Apple is not a good
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:39.600]  Company to work for for this that they weren't even in the race anymore. Yeah, they don't take it seriously and it you know in
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.640]  You can make good money from Google or other companies. You could go to Amazon
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:48.840]  It's not like you know Apple has good money to offer you to make a very nice salary
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:55.080]  But there's other companies that could offer you an equally nice salary and you could do world-leading work
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:58.300]  Right. So why go to Apple and do stuff? That's not
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:04.400]  Not looked happily upon and you don't get to publish your papers and stuff like that
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.920]  I think that the fact I think that the signaling that they've done by hiring him
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:14.480]  I don't like calling him Jade apparently every because his last name is a bit of a mouthful. Everybody calls him JG
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:21.320]  Personally, I don't really care for that. Yeah, you know, there's other JG's out there. I'm not sure
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.760]  Yeah
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:29.200]  But I am versus the Siri team was run by by Tom Gruber until just recently like you're all mixed up in this job
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:31.720]  No relation. I will say
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:33.720]  No relation to Tom Gruber
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:39.400]  But I honestly feel like that might be the single biggest news of the year at Apple even though it's behind the scenes
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.400]  It's inside baseball
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:47.400]  but because I really do feel like it's the area where Apple has always been furthest behind and
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.400]  I feel like they're catching up and I feel like yeah
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:55.520]  It's a big reason why and you putting him on the board feels like when they put John Suruji on the board
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:00.560]  Like they understood the importance of silicon to the company and now they understand the importance of AI to all the future products
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.280]  They're doing from the autonomous technologies to everything else. Yeah. Well, I mean small correction. It's not the board, right?
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:11.560]  The board is the executive team executive team people with the senior vice president title. Yeah
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.120]  But I really do and I again I wrote this and I'm say it again
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:23.160]  You know the Apple sort of has a boy who cried wolf problem with Siri and AI and it's not that about lying
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.040]  It's about not working, you know
[02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:26.320]  Yeah
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:30.300]  And it's like, you know in a way that the boy who cried wolf told a couple of lies and people stop believing them
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:34.600]  Siri people tried it and it worked like crap or worked ridiculously
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.400]  and
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:38.040]  Then they stopped trying, you know
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:41.640]  And I feel like series already gotten better and people aren't trying it enough
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.280]  And the advantage Apple has is that any time you buy a new phone or you upgrade your operating system?
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:50.280]  They can put Siri right into the setup buddy and it can do something for you
[02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.480]  And if they can make it rock-solid and they can make it do something delightful for you
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:58.080]  During that first runner or first upgrade experience. They have a chance to hook you back into it
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:02.680]  They just got to make sure that it is rock solid and there is something super cool with it in whatever version they want to
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.960]  Really push it work before. Yeah, and the other thing that I think they've done and I don't think this is entirely because of hiring
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:12.860]  Jan and Drea, I think this was already in the works before that. It wasn't like he instituted
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:14.920]  I think they were already thinking this way but that they've
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:23.520]  Started making they've made Siri a thing that they roll out improvements and updates to on a regular basis. Yeah, and it's not it's off their
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.120]  tentpole
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:27.640]  WWDC, you know
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:33.840]  Get everything you can into an update that ships in September and then we'll see you next September with more improvements
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.280]  You know, it's I think it's something that is more continuously updated. Yeah
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:43.360]  As long as times are better and I know there's some people who've been testing stuff like that
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:49.240]  I know Gene Munster had to report out with a bunch of questions they asked but even just the response times for some things are
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:55.160]  getting much faster and way more conversational like I just asked today about what time a
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.360]  Football game was on tomorrow and the response was so fast
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.200]  It was as though I was you know
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.520]  It was very very close to the speed as which I asked a friend who I knew knew the answer who was right in the
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.520]  Room with me would have said Oh 4 30 tomorrow
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:10.640]  And the truth is you know
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.840]  This is still the very beginning like anyone who says that out that Amazon or Google has this wrapped up. It's not true yet
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.200]  Not like I would just rewall
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.200]  I'm rewatching all the Marvel movies before
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:25.080]  Avengers Endgame comes out and I was watching Iron Man 2 where he's working with Jarvis to build something and until I could literally say
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:27.560]  Okay, save this audio file wrap it up
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:30.680]  Send it to jelly do all of the things that I want to do with the computer with my voice
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:36.560]  No one has won this yet and there's still tremendous opportunities here. Yeah, I think it's so early days. It's ridiculous
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:42.600]  and I feel like the early days are lasting longer than the early days of the PC industry because I went very very quickly from
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.480]  like the Apple one in
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.840]  1977 or whatever to the Mac in 1984 like those seven years were blur
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:56.600]  Whereas I feel like the AI is so much more complicated and the end result of what's actually a good
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  AI system is so rich and
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.360]  That it's you know, it is still early days
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:08.000]  They're not the fact that you know, they spent five years six years behind is not insurmountable. No, it means it means nothing
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.800]  We're still in the Xerox part days and someone someone still has to ship the Mac. Yeah, I totally agree
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.760]  All right. I feel like that's a wrap. I feel like that's 2018 this show
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:21.720]  It was the capper. This is the last part in the last the last thing in the entire Apple year
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:23.600]  Is this episode of the talk show?
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.760]  Perfect. I thank you. I hope you have a happy new year. Thank you. You too, John. Talk to you next year
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:32.280]  Maybe I'll see you soon. I don't know. Maybe we'll have an Apple event in January. Okay, perfect
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:47.280]  Um, anyway, have a great new year. You too. You too.
