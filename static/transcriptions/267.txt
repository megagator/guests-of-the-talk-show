[00:00.000 --> 00:08.320]  the world series has unified our country around around one central theme which is booing and
[00:08.320 --> 00:14.320]  heckling donald trump right did you did you uh watch that yesterday it's a it's a beautiful
[00:14.320 --> 00:19.760]  moment that we can all share together um so without the kids you take the kids and at the
[00:19.760 --> 00:27.040]  seventh inning stretch you all stand up and you boo the president this was it was an interesting
[00:27.040 --> 00:34.960]  thing and for those of you who aren't i mean there's so much real stuff going on with the
[00:34.960 --> 00:42.400]  world politics and u.s politics and trump and it's you know it's in in normal times
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.480]  it would be a fun thing to just talk about but i'm gonna do it anyway but i realized that his
[00:48.480 --> 00:52.720]  reception at a baseball game is not important in the grand scheme of things and that there
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.760]  are many things that are important but this is not a political podcast so let's just focus this
[00:57.760 --> 01:03.280]  is perfect perfect territory for us to cover this is a nonsense podcast sure so why don't
[01:04.240 --> 01:11.200]  why don't we talk about the nonsense um so trump was in a bad position in a couple of ways on this
[01:11.200 --> 01:16.240]  because it's like a couple of things had to happen for this but the one the first and foremost the
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.640]  fact that the nationals the washington nationals are in the world series which was unlikely
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.920]  they they were a wild card team so they had to win a one-game playoff just to make the regular
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.120]  playoffs and then they had to beat some really good teams to get here they were certainly not
[01:31.120 --> 01:38.800]  favored against the dodgers uh and you know here they are but it's sort of traditional for the u.s
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.120]  president to throw out like the first pitch usually on opening day like at april 1st or
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.240]  something like that but but trump doesn't do that even though trump claims that that as a young man
[01:48.240 --> 01:57.360]  he was the best player in new york state uh and if you believe that right he went from probably
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.480]  being you know you know like looking at him swing a golf club he probably was you know an adequate
[02:02.480 --> 02:12.960]  at least high school baseball player uh you know by now now 50 some years later he's the best he
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.440]  was the best player in sure right right and yet somehow didn't play professional baseball um uh
[02:19.440 --> 02:25.040]  he has even said in so many words that he doesn't want to throw out a pitch at a world series because
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.720]  they would make him wear what he calls quote heavy body armor and that it would make him look too
[02:30.720 --> 02:37.600]  heavy and then funny enough in the new york times the new york times which usually if anything bends
[02:37.600 --> 02:46.480]  over backwards to play it straight and avoid you know denigrating him in a in news coverage
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.200]  i believe it or not conservative listeners out there you know they really do i mean it drives
[02:51.200 --> 02:57.200]  liberals nuts almost uh not even almost uh but they said that they paraphrased him as saying it
[02:57.200 --> 03:04.800]  would make him look quote fat which is the word not the word he used but other other presidents
[03:04.800 --> 03:10.560]  have had to wear the bulletproof vest underneath the jacket uh george bush or the younger george
[03:10.560 --> 03:17.600]  bush in particular you know famously threw out a pitch at yankee stadium shortly after in the
[03:17.600 --> 03:26.000]  2001 world series which was in the aftermath of of 9 11 and threw a strike you know and he was
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.560]  really worried about it because he i i would imagine he had it's a long way it is a long way
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.520]  and you know i imagine that those bullet professors are pretty constricting for emotion
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.480]  like yeah sure baseball yeah yeah i would imagine and you know and if you don't like i guess they
[03:42.480 --> 03:45.840]  would probably try you out there and they have you do a couple of you think they would do that
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.960]  right have a few practice throws yeah i think i remember reading with bush that he threw a couple
[03:50.960 --> 03:57.120]  in the uh there's usually like there's like batting cages and and areas where players can
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.880]  warm up inside the stadium uh and so i i threw a couple pitches yeah so not on the mound right
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.160]  but i think it's you know it's a very different as one could imagine throwing a couple of warm-up
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.920]  pitches in a basement at the stadium uh it's very different than throwing it in front of
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.520]  60 000 screaming fans at the world series with an audience of millions watching around the world
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.080]  yeah uh well at least bush bush wasn't getting booed so you know no you know unanimous cheers
[04:26.080 --> 04:31.440]  for for president bush at the time because it was a sure a time of unity uh as it should have been
[04:31.440 --> 04:40.000]  but uh uh obama you know obama didn't didn't throw out pitches in times like the aftermath of 9 11 it
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.520]  you know you could consider obama's appearances at sporting events to be you know relatively normal
[04:45.520 --> 04:51.840]  presidential visits or yeah first pitches sort of sort of unremarkable unremarkable other than
[04:51.840 --> 04:58.240]  the fact that barack obama although quite a basketball player uh is obviously never obviously
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.360]  never played baseball because he if you ever look at the video of it he really doesn't know how to
[05:03.360 --> 05:08.960]  throw a ball no i've not seen it which is odd you because usually i could see being a total
[05:08.960 --> 05:12.880]  non-athlete and not not really knowing how to throw a baseball that's you know certainly one
[05:12.880 --> 05:18.720]  thing but it's a bit unusual to me for someone to be good at one ball sport like basketball and
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.120]  really really look like a fish out of water throwing a baseball but who cares right you're
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.280]  not it doesn't count for the score it's the president of the united states and i would
[05:27.280 --> 05:33.280]  cheer for any president it's not part of the game that would be funny if it were what and like
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.200]  throwing out the first pitch they should really be throwing out the first pitch
[05:38.560 --> 05:45.840]  just screw this handing handing a dinger to the through the or a ball more likely a ball yeah or
[05:45.840 --> 05:52.240]  a hit by pitch like why maybe they shouldn't they should not well although you know it's probably
[05:52.240 --> 05:59.120]  not going to be very hard yeah uh but anyway so i guess i should explain that for our our uh
[05:59.120 --> 06:06.320]  our listeners who aren't even familiar with the ceremonial first pitch so uh i think at most at
[06:06.320 --> 06:11.360]  all professional baseball games there's usually uh a ceremonial first pitch where it doesn't
[06:11.360 --> 06:17.760]  count for the score but they'll bring out uh some local this yeah usually usually yeah so usually
[06:17.760 --> 06:24.720]  it's a local but you know it could be you know so a a youngster who just won a science fair project
[06:24.720 --> 06:30.160]  or national you know if the kid in your area wins the spelling bee or something like that they'll
[06:30.160 --> 06:37.520]  bring them out and let everybody cheer uh but the president often does this on opening day trump
[06:37.520 --> 06:44.240]  has never done it on opening day and uh the president's often there's a long history of
[06:44.240 --> 06:53.760]  presidents being baseball fans in particular uh nixon was a baseball nut uh uh ronald reagan
[06:53.760 --> 06:59.200]  had spent time as a radio announcer for baseball games during his early professional career as a
[06:59.200 --> 07:10.080]  broadcaster bill clinton i think was a baseball fan uh uh george w bush george hw bush the original
[07:10.080 --> 07:16.640]  george bush as i like to call him was uh unlike donald trump actually was an elite baseball player
[07:16.640 --> 07:21.600]  he played on the yale team and i think he played in a national college champion i forget if they
[07:21.600 --> 07:26.800]  won the college championship but they he didn't just play for yale yale was actually very good
[07:26.800 --> 07:35.760]  uh like right before world war ii uh very good baseball player george w bush uh owned the texas
[07:35.760 --> 07:44.480]  rangers and in my opinion still does right still owns the goddamn texas rangers and yet every time
[07:44.480 --> 07:49.440]  me or my friends or my listeners edit the wikipedia page for the texas rangers just
[07:49.440 --> 07:56.080]  put down that george w bush is the owner of the team it gets edited out and i'm not telling you
[07:56.080 --> 08:00.960]  the people listening to this podcast to go edit the wikipedia page for the texas rangers to list
[08:00.960 --> 08:09.120]  george w bush as the team owner but you could and it wouldn't bother me but you know it's not even
[08:09.120 --> 08:14.720]  even i still think he owns the team frankly if you can you can't convince me otherwise but it's
[08:14.720 --> 08:19.840]  undisputed that he previously owned at least part of the team literally owned a baseball team yeah
[08:19.840 --> 08:25.280]  and he showed he was a he was went to a lot of those games oh absolutely and uh still still goes
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.600]  to some of them oh yeah and he was there he did for years i don't watch much baseball anymore yeah
[08:29.600 --> 08:37.200]  it sucks but uh well they stayed you were on back in in april and they were tearing it up i know and
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.000]  and then you know that that ended it right there and then i think they might have had the worst
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.080]  record in baseball after that they started out as like the hottest since i was on this show
[08:46.080 --> 08:52.560]  since i was on this show so now i think we're doing a reset so maybe they'll probably start
[08:52.560 --> 08:56.960]  the year off again great yeah so anyway the washington nationals there that washington the
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.000]  city of washington is nuts for the team they're they're there they haven't had a championship team
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.600]  and i don't know i think the last time a professional baseball team was in the world
[09:07.600 --> 09:15.280]  series in washington was 1933 and and franklin delano roosevelt threw out a pitch uh now part
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.800]  of the reason they have a long drought is that the team moved to uh what was then back back in
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.040]  old time days the washington senators although they're apparently their nickname i didn't know
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.280]  this until this week was the nationals people referred to the washington senators as the
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.400]  nationals and that's i guess where they got this name from anyway they moved to minnesota and
[09:34.400 --> 09:40.160]  became the twins i believe right is that i don't know i don't know that could be as made up i'm
[09:40.160 --> 09:43.520]  willing to believe that sure it could be as made up as anything i'm pretty sure well they went
[09:43.520 --> 09:51.120]  somewhere uh and so there was a decades-long drought where there was no team in the washington
[09:51.120 --> 09:58.960]  dc city and i guess they had to sort of adopt the nearby baltimore oriel's as their uh the team of
[09:58.960 --> 10:04.480]  the you know the local team yeah that's that's when i lived i lived in the dc area and that's
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.520]  who we went to see yeah which you know we of course was the only the only game in town but um
[10:09.520 --> 10:16.880]  right even went to the old what was it national field national park uh soldier field no soldier
[10:16.880 --> 10:25.040]  field chicago yeah right i knew that well anyway trump effectively once they made it to the world
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.600]  series and it's such a big deal he kind of had to come he really should have thrown out a pitch but
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.520]  if he threw out that pitch everybody knew what was going to happen he's going to get booed
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.640]  vociferously uh i'm not even quite sure why that is now i i do know it almost it really
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.600]  is almost defies belief that in the 2016 election in the city of washington he got four percent of
[10:47.600 --> 10:55.520]  the vote i mean however popular he is nationwide you know well he's just general in in metropolitan
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.400]  areas in general i think he's not very well liked uh and i wonder i wonder what he would what kind
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.440]  of reception he would have gotten in houston i i had to have would have had to have been warmer
[11:05.440 --> 11:10.160]  or at least mixed right there would have been only so anyway what happened is he did show up but he
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.640]  didn't throw out the first pitch and the what the the washington nationals kind of stuck it to him
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.080]  a little and so well the owner wouldn't have him in this box right the owner asked that he not
[11:20.080 --> 11:28.080]  have to ask him to be in the box right it is it is the the ways of just diplomacy are so weird and
[11:28.080 --> 11:34.160]  you know but that's what you said is exactly right so the owner didn't want to say i don't want you
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.960]  in my box so the owner went to the league and said i don't want to be put in a position
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.440]  of being asked if he could be in my box you know we'll get him another luxury box we'll get him
[11:45.440 --> 11:51.360]  his own box yeah we're gonna kick somebody else out of their box which i wonder about that too
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.520]  like where'd that box come from you would think that you know a luxury box for the world series
[11:57.520 --> 12:01.920]  like did did somebody have to be some terrible company probably donated it some you know some
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.240]  you know like tobacco or gun company probably donated it yeah or maybe somebody who doesn't
[12:08.240 --> 12:12.320]  even like trump just did it for the team you know and they were like hey if you'll give up we know
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.320]  you've got this we've got this box but they get the secret service wants him in this one they
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.800]  think you know the the line you know the i'm sure the secret service had some sort of say yeah right
[12:22.800 --> 12:29.600]  it wasn't yeah it wasn't dead center right probably but they also they invited it they
[12:29.600 --> 12:35.200]  invited a chef i forget his name jose something uh to throw out the first pitch instead of trump
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.160]  for the game five and he's a vocal critic of trump so they invited a guy who's a critic of trump to
[12:42.160 --> 12:45.680]  throw out the first pitch he didn't show up trumped in his entourage did not show up until
[12:45.680 --> 12:51.040]  the third inning so they missed the opening pitch and then they they put them up on the
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.360]  scoreboard in between innings and a pa announcer said ladies and gentlemen the president of the
[12:55.360 --> 13:05.360]  united states is here and it was ugly yeah i got really ugly they they booed very loudly
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.360]  somebody said some reporter said i don't know how they measured i don't know if this is bs or not
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.920]  that it was over 100 decibels and there's video of it and it's like he's on tv too and you could
[13:15.920 --> 13:23.120]  see that he you know like always he's captivated by a television so he sees that he's on tv and
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.760]  he's smiling like it gives his wife like a nudge like hey look we're on tv and then they're they're
[13:27.760 --> 13:33.840]  real happy and he's like waving at the tv even though that's not where the camera is uh and then
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.360]  it really is it really does seem you know the booze start and it really does seem like he it
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.080]  really did seem to get to him i i maybe i'm reading into this maybe his expression definitely changed
[13:44.080 --> 13:51.200]  there it it's like the way to play it clearly is to not acknowledge the booze in just you know
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.800]  right uh but it really seemed to get him down because it yeah it might you know he might i
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.960]  i'm sure he knew he was going to get booed that there were that there would be boos i'm not quite
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.920]  sure he realized are you sure i'm not well who knows with this are we sure that he doesn't really
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.960]  think he's super popular well he he like maybe he has no idea that his handlers never let him go
[14:12.960 --> 14:20.080]  to a yes neutral right thing like he he doesn't even realize that that the only places he ever
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.080]  goes are rallies filled with his uh supporters because he doesn't even go to like the kennedy
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.560]  awards and and i don't even think he would get booed at a thing like that it's like a black tie
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.160]  an annual black tie event in washington and the president stop didn't they stop doing those press
[14:36.160 --> 14:42.320]  the press thing the uh press dinner yeah uh or did they just do it this they think they did it
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.880]  they did it this year without him right well yeah he has never attended that the white house
[14:46.880 --> 14:53.840]  correspondence dinner the way that's it that's right yeah uh unbelievable so he gets they make
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.840]  jokes they yeah yeah they make jokes that they're not their expense and that was you know i well
[14:59.840 --> 15:06.480]  anyway you're going to go into the the 2012 one where obama or 2011 one exactly whenever whenever
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.080]  it was i don't remember what it was somebody on those ones somebody on twitter today josh josh
[15:10.080 --> 15:15.760]  marshall from tpm was tweeting about that and uh somebody tweeted back that it's effectively his
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.840]  superhero villain origin story right because what happened for those of you who don't know you can
[15:21.840 --> 15:28.320]  google it and it's kind of heartbreaking you know in hindsight but in in 2011 or 2012 i forget but
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.720]  barack obama was speaking at this white house correspondence dinner which is like a roast and
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.080]  you know it's supposed to get up there and you have to effectively do like stand up and uh had
[15:38.080 --> 15:44.080]  a whole bit ripping into trump who was in attendance making fun of him for having supported
[15:44.080 --> 15:50.880]  that uh theory that barack obama's birth certificate was forged and he was actually born in kenya and
[15:50.880 --> 15:57.600]  therefore ineligible to be the president ridiculous conspiracy theory uh really really laid into trump
[15:57.600 --> 16:04.080]  i mean really laid into him and it was very funny and apparently infuriated trump and a lot of
[16:04.080 --> 16:08.880]  people think might have been the the deciding moment that made him stop saying every four
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.920]  years he'd run for president which is something he had done since like 1988 and actually do it
[16:15.200 --> 16:23.840]  and so has jokes on us right right i know instead of going back and killing hitler going back
[16:25.280 --> 16:27.760]  telling obama not to tell those jokes yeah
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.040]  or like going back and instead of killing hitler i just you know
[16:33.040 --> 16:34.240]  giving him a couple zingers
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.320]  i didn't want to mess with history too much so i didn't kill hitler
[16:42.320 --> 16:48.480]  but i gotta tell you i really got some some good guts in it i had a whole section on the mustache
[16:48.480 --> 17:01.280]  alone that haircut come with a free bowl of soup oh man uh so anyway that was the
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.920]  highlight of the world series for me he really got he really got it oh and they had some chance
[17:05.920 --> 17:11.440]  too they broke into oh that's right yeah they broke into lock him up lock him up which and
[17:11.440 --> 17:17.760]  there's been a lot of talk about that since then yeah that's that was about how uncivil it is yeah
[17:18.320 --> 17:27.280]  well you know i just can't be bothered to care you know it's funny though you see like you say
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.000]  like so like the cities themselves overwhelmingly i didn't know how this would play out i don't know
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  how like i don't know who goes to world series games you know like it would occur to me that
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.760]  there might be fans of the nationals not just who live in the city or in the metro area but
[17:41.760 --> 17:47.440]  it might come from quite far away in region you know there might i i wasn't sure that it that the
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.040]  crowd would be overwhelmingly against him you know yeah like you know that the people who are against
[17:53.040 --> 17:57.840]  them are going to boo but i thought maybe there'd be a lot of other people who it seems like there's
[17:57.840 --> 18:03.440]  probably a number of people from northern virginia who go and because it's right there right and
[18:04.160 --> 18:10.880]  a lot of those people are conservative yeah but apparently not or apparently they just
[18:11.440 --> 18:18.080]  you know kept their mouth shut but it was quite a thing to see uh i would imagine like i don't
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.000]  remember it and it wasn't as contentious but i would imagine that there were certainly like if
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.760]  you know somebody like barack obama comes out to throw a pitch there's going to be some people who
[18:25.760 --> 18:31.760]  boo and there's going to be some people who cheer but i don't think the boos are really gonna it's
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.080]  not going to be like it was last night no there really is quite a thing when you think about it
[18:36.080 --> 18:43.440]  that he never goes somewhere where it's uh just like any famously you know even though he's from
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.040]  new york he never goes back to new york i mean i guess he was there for like the un meeting or
[18:47.040 --> 18:52.800]  whatever but he never appears in public yeah um and it's just new york hates him hates him even
[18:52.800 --> 18:59.360]  more yeah i think so too and i think new york new yorkers are meaner and no yeah right they'll
[18:59.360 --> 19:03.920]  throw batteries at you i mean they literally call it a bronx cheer i mean they've named
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.760]  they've named it after well the batteries that's a philly thing come on yeah true yeah
[19:09.760 --> 19:16.080]  bulletproof vests they don't make battery proof vests
[19:18.560 --> 19:25.040]  battery proof vests oh man she get on that yeah so he came late left early but uh really really
[19:25.040 --> 19:30.000]  laid into him i don't know i don't i don't read this tweets uh my wife for some reason does my
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.440]  wife likes to get in there once a day oh she's like just is that how she gets she doesn't drink
[19:35.440 --> 19:43.040]  coffee yeah yeah it's it's just like it's like a once a day maintenance task like to see what's
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.720]  going on boiling yeah uh i can't i can't look at him i can't i can't even hear him talk on tv
[19:48.720 --> 19:55.440]  no there's a lot of people are like that i yeah and so i'll wait for other people to i don't have
[19:55.440 --> 20:00.480]  blocks up on his tweets so i wait for other people to like retweet or something that's the thing i
[20:00.480 --> 20:05.920]  do and i still get you know because people screenshot it yeah i didn't want to see that
[20:07.440 --> 20:11.920]  he tweeted the other night i guess in preparation for his morning announcement that they killed the
[20:13.120 --> 20:18.800]  uh the terrorist guy the isis guy they all he tweeted he couldn't help himself he tweeted uh
[20:18.800 --> 20:25.440]  something amazing just happened an exclamation mark and then he went to bed like you can't do
[20:25.440 --> 20:30.160]  that as the president of the united states like he's you know what i mean like put aside all this
[20:30.160 --> 20:34.960]  other stuff like how do you not you know and then he had one up too i couldn't believe it i honestly
[20:34.960 --> 20:40.560]  god couldn't believe it is that it he eventually did delete this one but for hours at least half
[20:40.560 --> 20:48.400]  a day he had up a tweet that consisted of four periods and that was it just dot dot dot dot
[20:49.040 --> 20:54.400]  and that was the entire tweet and again hey we've all you know sometimes you know i don't know what
[20:54.400 --> 20:57.680]  he's you know i guess he always tweets from his phone but you know you can fat finger the return
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.440]  button on the keyboard and you know every once in a while you're doing something and some of
[21:01.440 --> 21:08.240]  these apps hit return it gives you a new line and sometimes it sends right some chats so you know
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.240]  you can hit return on a tweet before you're done and maybe have it go out there and then you just
[21:12.240 --> 21:16.720]  oh any quick you know you go and delete it of course right like how do you yeah how does it
[21:16.720 --> 21:22.640]  stay up for hours on it well it's like any rational anyway like why am i arguing about
[21:22.640 --> 21:28.560]  yeah why am i arguing against this there's no point i was just you i think would with other
[21:28.560 --> 21:35.760]  presidents while twitter has been around so it's mostly obama probably um yeah entirely right it
[21:35.760 --> 21:40.720]  yeah yeah that's right yeah it is entirely i was thinking of 2012 but yeah no it was it was 2008
[21:40.720 --> 21:44.800]  well i guess although i guess george is probably a team running that whole that whole thing you
[21:44.800 --> 21:53.440]  know i mean that stuff all that stuff was probably talked about yeah and vetted and crafted before it
[21:53.440 --> 22:06.640]  was published yeah we you know none of it was coming from obama's id uh i feel bad i feel bad
[22:06.640 --> 22:14.640]  for the guy he got booed so sad sad yeah yeah god can you imagine if obama went somewhere
[22:14.640 --> 22:20.720]  and got booed that loudly the tweets that would come out of this jackass celebrating it yeah
[22:21.840 --> 22:25.600]  like you just know it bothered him and you knew he kind of knew it was going to happen and i think
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.280]  it was worse than he expected and like the lock him up chance there was another one like impeach
[22:31.280 --> 22:38.240]  trump impeach trump uh that's that's that's good work good i i say bravo to the to the to the fans
[22:38.240 --> 22:46.960]  of the washington nationals yeah me too uh anyway i mean they're gonna lose but you know which brings
[22:46.960 --> 22:54.320]  us to squarespace hey uh look you guys know squarespace i always say you even know the phrase

[23:02.720 --> 23:07.760]  what people keep signing up and using the code because this is the sort of thing what are the
[23:07.760 --> 23:14.160]  odds that right now at the end of october 2019 that you dear listener of the talk show that you
[23:14.160 --> 23:20.000]  need a new website right now well probably pretty pretty low but there's a chance that you'll need
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.760]  one in a couple months or maybe longer than that all i do is want to remind you that the next time

[23:44.160 --> 23:50.960]  sizes and that make every website it's it's you can customize so much in squarespace but one thing
[23:50.960 --> 23:55.440]  you really can't do is you can't mess it up there's no way to go and and start clicking around
[23:55.440 --> 24:00.480]  these templates and and futz it up and end up with an ugly looking website every website published

[25:13.440 --> 25:18.240]  it take 20 i'm just not sure yeah i don't know if i could talk about him for 45 minutes and not go
[25:18.240 --> 25:26.320]  crazy uh uh i do hope i hope the nationals come back and win i'm rooting for him uh i always root
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.520]  against whoever beats the yankees so the astros beat the yankees again so i have to root for the
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.840]  nationals it'd be good for the city though i do it's funny i do the opposite
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.320]  you hold a parade for the team that beats the yankees whether they go on to win or lose the
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.920]  world series yeah you still get her although you know i do not have a lot of love for the
[25:47.920 --> 25:55.120]  astros obviously because they moved into our division and have you know completely completely
[25:55.120 --> 26:01.520]  owned the mariners throughout their history simultaneous with the move went from a historic
[26:01.520 --> 26:09.120]  sad sack team to the best team in baseball over the last five years right that's a tough division
[26:09.120 --> 26:12.880]  they were like even when but even when they were bad they were always like they always beat the
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.760]  mariners we would go we would like we would have you having a great year and we go to houston we
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.560]  lost three in a row in houston right because they did have when they first started this process
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.080]  like uh you know the the the organization that's built this team they they were like we're gonna
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.120]  we gotta start over and they did have a historically bad season they lost lost 100 games
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.320]  uh and you're saying even then they they'd go in and get well yeah and then maybe it's my
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.240]  imagination but i i have a feeling that if i checked that they would have a strong winning
[26:42.240 --> 26:47.600]  record against the mariners throughout their you know from the you know whenever these teams were
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.120]  founded sometime in the 70s right yeah so the big news we got big news today just dropped out of
[26:53.120 --> 26:59.120]  nowhere yeah unexpectedly on uh on a monday well yeah sort of i mean you know right now
[26:59.120 --> 27:05.520]  unexpectedly but uh they were rumored to come right yeah air pods pro and they're even that's
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.640]  even the name and they're so i believe unless i'm wrong that this is the first time apple has
[27:10.640 --> 27:20.240]  adopted my uh beloved plural with an s and then an adjective construction which is grammatically
[27:20.240 --> 27:28.480]  correct for things like your uh mothers-in-law or uh holes in one a talented golfer might have
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.240]  hit three holes in attorneys general attorneys general is a famous one because you're not a
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.720]  general you you are an attorney and you're generally speaking i guess i'm still not quite
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.800]  sure of that i know you're not a general i'm not quite sure where the phrase attorney general when
[27:44.800 --> 27:51.920]  came from but because general is an adjective describing the attorney who you are your multiple
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.280]  several of you getting together for cocktails would be attorneys general uh and now we have
[27:57.280 --> 28:04.720]  air pods pro i like it it can be a i realized today there was yeah it could be a bit of a
[28:04.720 --> 28:12.400]  mouthful though it was yeah air pods pro earbuds and it's like now there's two like i wanted to say
[28:12.400 --> 28:18.000]  that that i was like talking about the tips you know that there's like three adjustable size tips
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.160]  you can have with them and it just seems funny when you go plural adjective plural uh but i'm
[28:24.160 --> 28:32.560]  not saying it's a bad name i like it and but you can you could say air pod before i guess you could
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.160]  still say air pod pro for one of them you know like if you take one out of your ear it is an
[28:38.160 --> 28:45.680]  air pod pro in your hand i guess i don't know yeah because they don't do that with the iphone pro
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.760]  right or any other pro no they don't then they go out of their way so it must be like pants
[28:51.760 --> 28:57.600]  yeah it's a little bit like pants and they they hit you know i go out of my way i have my quirks
[28:57.600 --> 29:05.360]  in my writing style i like to say iphones you know like the iphone's eight yeah but like the
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.080]  backstory people often ask about that and and one of the reasons that i adopted that style
[29:11.760 --> 29:17.120]  especially like in the headlines and stuff is that like let's say i'm reviewing the iphone
[29:17.120 --> 29:24.480]  the iphone eight and eight plus you can't it's hard to pluralize that just by adding an s
[29:24.480 --> 29:31.520]  because if you just add an s and just type iphone space eight lowercase s
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.640]  you've suddenly invented the iphone you know right exactly s in particular is hard to do it
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.920]  like that because it they've you know in their native never come out with an 8s although maybe
[29:43.920 --> 29:48.800]  that's what they'll call the the thing that's coming out in march but there was no 8s but
[29:48.800 --> 29:55.760]  there could have been we didn't know and there was a 6s and a 5s and did they have a 7s or no
[29:55.760 --> 30:03.120]  they just went right from seven no they went 78 you know you know and they did have the 10s though
[30:03.120 --> 30:10.400]  so the iphone x the big capital x you couldn't pluralize that with an s either because it would
[30:10.400 --> 30:14.960]  it would look like a 10s which you thought well they're never going to name it that because they're
[30:14.960 --> 30:19.280]  not going to put two letters next to each other and expect you to say one as a roman numeral
[30:19.280 --> 30:22.800]  and the other one as a letter and so of course they did exactly that
[30:25.360 --> 30:32.240]  the other thing you could do and it is against in my opinion i i guess as in all such things there's
[30:32.240 --> 30:41.760]  no decider in chief but it is sometimes it's a common error people make the typographical
[30:41.760 --> 30:46.320]  error where they'll they'll use an apostrophe s to pluralize something when all you had to do is
[30:46.320 --> 30:54.240]  add an s and it further confuses people and it's a common typo that everybody makes myself included
[30:54.240 --> 31:02.640]  where you type it apostrophe s when you mean just its and or vice versa i tried to make i tried to
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.360]  even coin a term for that years ago i called it an itso but that didn't really that that didn't
[31:07.360 --> 31:14.400]  catch on nearly as well as markdown i've tried two things in my life i invented a text formatting
[31:14.400 --> 31:20.160]  language you got one i got nothing and i tried to make it so a thing although every once in a
[31:20.160 --> 31:28.480]  while when i commit an itso and and use the wrong it's uh every once in a while a kind reader will
[31:28.480 --> 31:33.760]  report it to me later by email or twitter or something and call it an itso and then that's
[31:33.760 --> 31:37.520]  when i wish i had like a button to hit to just send a t-shirt to somebody i would like to send
[31:37.520 --> 31:43.760]  the daring fireball t-shirt to anybody who calls it and it's so uh but anyway you could but i am
[31:43.760 --> 31:49.920]  not a fan of the apostrophe s for plural i i'm a fan of it when it's like like how would you spell
[31:49.920 --> 32:00.080]  mind your p's and q's would you just i would avoid i would avoid saying that i would say it but i
[32:00.080 --> 32:10.480]  wouldn't type it so um wow yeah i mean i would i would probably large p small s yeah but that
[32:10.480 --> 32:15.600]  kind of looks like a small photoshop you know but in that instance it's not iphones so well like
[32:15.600 --> 32:20.240]  it would i don't think anyone's gonna think that i invented the iphone even the stodgy new york
[32:20.240 --> 32:26.240]  times manual of style and usage which i have a copy of uh and often defer to when i when i have
[32:26.240 --> 32:32.320]  a question about such a thing i believe their policy is that when you're talking about individual
[32:32.320 --> 32:39.520]  letters or numbers you you pluralize them by adding apostrophe s yeah um so you could do that
[32:39.520 --> 32:45.360]  but i it isn't great it doesn't look great yeah it's and i know that it's it's it's used
[32:45.360 --> 32:54.400]  i just don't like it i'm a stickler for that and the other thing the um i like uh in a sentence
[32:54.400 --> 32:58.880]  where you're quoting something i don't want to put the period inside the quotes oh yeah i don't like
[32:58.880 --> 33:03.840]  that yeah unless the period was in the original quoted material yes so i do that that's one of
[33:03.840 --> 33:07.920]  those things where it's like i've been writing daring fireball for long enough where it's like
[33:08.640 --> 33:14.480]  people have given up on telling me about that like kind and i do appreciate it i so many people do
[33:14.480 --> 33:21.600]  you get this too i i'm sure you do like it's such a thing online where somehow it we as a culture
[33:21.600 --> 33:27.280]  have made it a shameful thing to tell people about their typographic errors or spelling mistakes
[33:28.080 --> 33:32.960]  and that somehow in the internet that you're not supposed to correct people's
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.920]  mistakes and in some context yes you could definitely see how that's considered rude like
[33:37.920 --> 33:41.920]  if you're in like a thread or something like that you don't just and on twitter it's like
[33:41.920 --> 33:47.440]  you can't fix it so right yeah telling some telling somebody about a typo is just being mean
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.480]  right but so many times when people report my my spelling errors or typographic mistakes they
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.840]  begin by apologizing and i always write back if i if i write back you know no apology necessary i
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.720]  love typo reports and i would love to hear about the same one a hundred times then never hear about
[34:02.720 --> 34:09.920]  it at all because all hundred people thought well i'm sure somebody else i'm sure a dozen other
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.640]  people have have told them about it already you don't respond to chris pepper anymore did you no
[34:14.640 --> 34:20.480]  every once in a while i have to you know again i love him he always sends something so it's like
[34:20.480 --> 34:24.800]  i would be spending my entire day responding to chris pepper if i responded yeah like my way of
[34:24.800 --> 34:30.240]  thanking him typically is just to fix the mistake and just assume it assume that he'll notice and
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.440]  then everyone's in a while i i just break down and i i do send him a little heartfelt thank you
[34:35.440 --> 34:38.880]  just to let him know you know like hey i know i know i don't thank you every time but
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.560]  good god you catch these fast yeah he is and he's he's almost always every once in a while
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.800]  i quibble with something that he sends me and i don't agree with it and i don't change it but
[34:48.800 --> 34:57.280]  he's usually even in those instances correct yeah yeah yeah even when i disagree yeah i'm being
[34:57.280 --> 35:05.280]  stubborn obstinate yeah so you can't just well you could use apostrophes but many people would
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.840]  many people would report it as a typo even if i did it deliberately i don't want that email and
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.360]  i don't think it looks good so i i use the qt construction the iphone's 8 and i also like the
[35:15.360 --> 35:23.760]  way that that it when i say it though typically what i mean is both sizes so if i say the uh
[35:24.960 --> 35:30.320]  the iphone's 11 well the iphone 11 is a little bit even tougher because then it sort of
[35:30.320 --> 35:38.560]  it encompasses both the regular iphone 11 and the 11 pro and the 11 pro max so you could say
[35:38.560 --> 35:44.800]  the iphone's 11 pro just to mean the pro and pro max so i don't know but anyway you can tie yourself
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.560]  up in a knot very easily apple goes out of its way often to avoid pluralizing i saw in one of
[35:50.560 --> 35:56.640]  the footnotes for the air pods pro they had a footnote they like when they talk about battery
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.680]  life they always include a footnote to talk about their methodology and they said in the footnote
[36:03.680 --> 36:13.280]  that they tested them using iphone 11 pro max units which is the sort of thing that uh
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.840]  they're probably like one half of one i mean i don't know how many people even read the
[36:17.840 --> 36:23.440]  footnote so you're already in like one percent territory but uh whoever it is out there at apple
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.160]  who who who coined that phrase i know that whoever it was thought very long and hard about it
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.800]  because they know they could say iphone they used more than one you know they were testing
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.640]  it wasn't like hey let's figure out the battery life for these things we'll test them with one
[36:38.640 --> 36:47.440]  iphone right so they used several iphone 11 pro maxes but they can't call them iphone 11 pro maxes
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.040]  because apple won't pluralize it that way right so they called them units they also can't call
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.920]  them oh yeah yeah yeah i do that i shove another word in there yeah yeah and once you once you've
[37:00.720 --> 37:04.240]  it's the sort of thing where like you and i run into it because we're writing about this stuff
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.880]  all the time and hopefully the people reading it don't notice it but then one it's one of those
[37:08.880 --> 37:15.120]  things where when you're inside baseball just to go back to the baseball uh you notice it in other
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.280]  people's sentences and footnotes and you're like oh i see what you had to do there yeah it's one
[37:21.280 --> 37:24.560]  of those things where you and you know you sympathize it's like the way that writers
[37:24.560 --> 37:28.800]  always sympathize with each other because you know that whoever wrote that got stuck there
[37:29.600 --> 37:35.680]  like that wasn't something that that wasn't when the juices were flowing that is like uh you stop
[37:35.680 --> 37:38.960]  you take your hands off the keyboard and you really start thinking about this and you start
[37:38.960 --> 37:46.400]  weighing your options do i call them devices do i call them units anyway still haven't talked about
[37:46.400 --> 37:53.200]  the actual airpods i will often just re completely rephrase a sentence in order to avoid a tricky
[37:53.200 --> 38:01.840]  yep yep yep grammatical conundrum and sometimes you can tell that a sentence was you know like
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.160]  you know this isn't the most obvious way to put the sentence together so you know they you could
[38:06.160 --> 38:15.440]  tell when a sentence was jiggered around just to just to get out of a plural but so anyway these
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.400]  things were rumored all year i think uh you know people have been talking about these i don't know
[38:20.400 --> 38:24.640]  how they leaked but they you know obviously leaked in advance the fact that they're noise canceling
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.960]  uh and that they would be you know yeah the pictures leaked you know the little
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.080]  diagram of them uh drawing of them leaked a couple months ago or something yeah and i think
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.400]  the case leaked too and it is a weird looking case it is sort of like well not weird i i haven't seen
[38:42.400 --> 38:48.000]  one in person yet obviously but uh although they're having uh press briefings tomorrow which
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.400]  i think i'm allowed to say i'm going up to new york tomorrow so that's on tuesday uh they're
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.400]  doing press briefings but i didn't even find out about this till till sunday night it's like that's
[38:56.400 --> 39:03.360]  how that's how how uh snap of the fingers this whole thing was uh there it was like sunday night
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.720]  john are you free on tuesday afternoon we have a new product announcement and then all of a sudden
[39:06.720 --> 39:14.240]  i wake up monday morning and the air pods are out um so the case is like squatter it's yeah
[39:14.240 --> 39:23.040]  because the the air the new air pod pro pods what a night is it really well yeah this that's the
[39:23.040 --> 39:29.040]  difference in podcasting and writing the actual buds you put in your ear up and back up and edit
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.840]  that in addition to the fact that they have like a rubber tip or not even like a rubber tip they
[39:33.840 --> 39:39.840]  have rubber tips um the the what would you call it the rod that comes down out of your ear is
[39:39.840 --> 39:47.920]  significantly shorter than than the existing uh air pod buds uh so they could make the case a little
[39:48.480 --> 39:53.840]  shorter but they also had to make the case wider sort of like you know sort of reminds me of the
[39:53.840 --> 40:01.600]  fat nano the way that you remember the old fat nano sure uh you know it's a sort of squatter case
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.600]  because the these buds with you know the buds are bigger because they go into your ear
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.600]  um so that case had to be wider it's interesting that it's but it has more volume though
[40:13.760 --> 40:17.680]  yeah yeah and because these are headphones i should be clear about what i'm saying is
[40:17.680 --> 40:25.440]  the case has the case volume wise is larger right in the previous generation of air pods the case
[40:25.440 --> 40:26.560]  um
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.360]  uh so what i don't know what do you think about well the colors are fantastic aren't you don't
[40:35.360 --> 40:40.240]  you think i made fun i don't know if you caught up on there i right before i did do this site
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.800]  that's why i mentioned it i i did think i was like didn't i just read it like over the weekend
[40:44.800 --> 40:50.640]  and in fact it was over the weekend uh there was some chinese language source and you know
[40:50.640 --> 40:54.560]  like i hope it doesn't come across that i'm slagging on mac rumors mac rumors by the you
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.200]  know the the part of the original idea for the whole site was that they would just publish all
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.120]  the rumors that come across you know and point you know link to all the rumors they're not
[41:03.120 --> 41:08.240]  vouching for it they're just saying the chinese language site said they were going to come in eight
[41:08.240 --> 41:14.240]  colors and then there was i guess that i don't know that seemed ridiculous and they even said
[41:14.240 --> 41:17.840]  that there might be some translation issues here because it was originally in written in chinese
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.480]  but they definitely seemed to suggest that there would be black you know ones to match all the
[41:22.480 --> 41:29.040]  iphone colors or at least the iphone pro colors so there'd be like a like a a gold tope sort of
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.840]  thing gold doesn't really translate to plastic very well so that that seemed like a red flag
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.520]  to me over the weekend that yeah this doesn't seem right uh black seems like the obvious choice for a
[41:39.520 --> 41:44.400]  second color of airplane yeah and they've so we that has been rumored for quite some time right
[41:44.400 --> 41:51.040]  and it just has never arrived just uh an awful lot of people just like the color black i think
[41:51.040 --> 41:58.000]  an awful lot of people would prefer that they're they'd be slightly less conspicuous you know
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.120]  right it's just i mean yeah i agree with people who say that air pods look goofy they i think they
[42:03.120 --> 42:08.240]  do look goofy i think they're a terrific device but they look goofy in your ears i see i don't
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.480]  see that i i was just talking i forget who was on the show recently i've never understood that
[42:13.040 --> 42:18.640]  because they look exactly like the classic wired earbuds that apple's saying about missing the
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.560]  wires is makes them look odd but doesn't it seem like it's the like taking away it looks like a
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.200]  little cigarette buds sticking out but sticking out of your ear yeah but right dear you're old
[42:29.200 --> 42:36.080]  enough i mean do you do you remember when tv remote controls were wired oh yeah they there
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.400]  was only like a very brief period of time my family never even owned one but my uncle i still
[42:40.400 --> 42:49.120]  have that yeah but for those of you so what you want you don't lose the remote for decades for
[42:49.120 --> 42:53.600]  those of you who don't who never lived through it the only way to change the channel on a tv was to
[42:53.600 --> 42:59.920]  go up to the tv and and turn a dial it was a real dial and there and there are always i don't know
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.400]  why this was there were always two dials and the second dial didn't do anything and it had a lot
[43:04.400 --> 43:12.080]  more numbers no well no it was it was uhf right but it never worked it for me it depended it
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.280]  depended on where you were i mean every once in a while if you were in in a major metropolitan area
[43:17.280 --> 43:23.520]  i think you could get a uhf station so you'd you'd move the the top dial to the uhf setting right
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.280]  which would then produce the bottom one instead of being like having the that clicky turn thing
[43:29.280 --> 43:35.760]  would just be like sort of freeform like a volume dial and then you'd you know you'd get um the
[43:35.760 --> 43:45.280]  local community college or whatever uh yeah between two ferns from but that was 1968 you
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.400]  literally had to get up and go to the tv and turn a dial to change the channel um i remember playing
[43:50.400 --> 43:55.760]  with the uhf thing because i i i would get hopelessly bored because it would be like you
[43:55.760 --> 44:00.560]  know yeah the same 11 channels and every day you know i'm watching are you gonna watch heckle and
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.720]  heckle and jekyll again you're homesick and are you gonna watch heckle and jekyll again no right
[44:04.720 --> 44:13.280]  it's another episode of mccale's navy and i've seen it already uh you know there was a character
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.840]  named grueber on on mccale's navy no i did not remember that yeah it was not it was it was sort
[44:17.840 --> 44:23.120]  of a second tier character it wasn't it wasn't ernest borgnine you know like the commandant but
[44:23.120 --> 44:31.680]  one of the one of the one of the guys in mccale's crew was named grueber and i believe uh uh inside
[44:31.680 --> 44:37.840]  inside family baseball uh i don't i don't believe he had another name he was only referred to by his
[44:37.840 --> 44:42.560]  last name and whereas the other characters on the show either had first names or nicknames or
[44:42.560 --> 44:48.560]  something and it was it's my belief that there's something inherent about the surname grueber that
[44:48.560 --> 44:54.720]  lends itself to people being referred to as grueber like i've talked to this with my cousins on my
[44:54.720 --> 45:00.960]  dad's side and all three they're three boys and uh well they're grown men now but you know all
[45:00.960 --> 45:07.280]  of them were referred to as grueber by their pals and uh i think there's something inherent to it
[45:07.280 --> 45:17.760]  but anyway that's uh this week in famous groupers you need a jingle for that we could just borrow
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.120]  the mccale's navy theme song yeah sure why at this point why not anyway i'd get hopelessly bored and
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.240]  i think let me try those extra channels again and i'd go to the uhf and i'd start twisting and
[45:28.240 --> 45:33.840]  nothing absolutely nothing but then another month would go by and i'd try it again but anyway yeah
[45:33.840 --> 45:37.680]  but you had to you had to it was a combination thing right it was like a it was like a magic
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.360]  spell because you had to do you had to move the dial and you also had to move the antenna
[45:41.360 --> 45:48.000]  at the same time and that wasn't gonna happen because we so uh i have not we have not had cable
[45:48.000 --> 45:58.720]  in the house in my god a long time uh eight years probably at least and um and my father-in-law is
[45:58.720 --> 46:04.560]  now um living with us and has wanted to watch some sporting events which i have um like i said i've
[46:04.560 --> 46:11.440]  been avoiding because my favorite team is not very good and uh and so we've had to like figure out a
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.120]  way to watch some of these sporting events and we have a we have an antenna we have a digital
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.200]  antenna and and so i have recently been reintroduced to the process of having to
[46:23.200 --> 46:30.240]  reposition the aerial in order to really pick up the stations yeah that's it's quite it's a
[46:30.240 --> 46:38.000]  it's nostalgic and really super annoying i i was the sort of kid who who would mess with stuff i
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.480]  wasn't supposed to mess with if i thought i could figure it out but dealing with the antenna
[46:43.120 --> 46:50.640]  no it was never even tempting because my parents home uh has like a almost bizarrely sloped roof
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.120]  like who thought that was a good like i don't see how anybody ever went up there
[46:55.120 --> 47:01.040]  and did any roofing work without sliding right off to their death uh you know so that was it
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.200]  that would be you had an antenna on the roof we had an antenna on the roof yeah i think growing
[47:05.200 --> 47:09.680]  up that's what i had too but this is this is just like a thing you know connected by a cable to the
[47:09.680 --> 47:16.640]  tv to the hdtv right now we had it up on the roof and and there were times like i like maybe it it
[47:16.640 --> 47:21.520]  you know just like in pop culture history like where all of a sudden we wouldn't get any channels
[47:21.520 --> 47:27.360]  and maybe like a storm blew it off or i guess it never blew off but but you know something
[47:27.360 --> 47:30.560]  and my dad would have to go up there once in a while to adjust it and it was always
[47:31.280 --> 47:38.960]  uh it was always a real a real uh a real production because my mom would be yelling
[47:38.960 --> 47:46.880]  at him that he's going to kill himself don't be careful you know uh if you like yeah just if you
[47:46.880 --> 47:52.000]  remember george going to war if you remember george castanzo's parents and seinfeld that's really
[47:53.360 --> 47:55.600]  very close to my my parents relationship
[47:59.120 --> 48:05.920]  and it's like my dad is a very genial uh one of the nicest guys you'd ever meet everybody who
[48:05.920 --> 48:15.120]  knows him loves him he truly is a very much more so than me uh a very kind friendly human being
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.800]  um but he could get you know and as a younger man he had more of a temper and you know nobody
[48:20.800 --> 48:26.320]  nobody who has to get up on a roof to do anything when you're the oh yeah nobody's in a good mood
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.040]  if you have to get up on the roof yeah and so he's already in a bad mood sure it didn't happen
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.200]  all the time but then there's my mom yelling at him bob you're gonna kill yourself very helpful
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.720]  right or she'd you know like he'd want to fix it because he wants to watch tv right now and
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.040]  she'd be like wait till tomorrow in the daytime you'll you can't see at night but he you know
[48:47.040 --> 48:50.080]  he's a man he wants to watch tv right now so he's gonna go fix it
[48:52.560 --> 48:56.800]  so anyway they invented everybody realized that getting up walking across the room and flipping
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.920]  a dial by on the tv set was you know terrible everybody could imagine wouldn't it be great if
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.080]  we could change channels from right here well the first remote controls were uh were wired there'd
[49:08.080 --> 49:13.520]  be a wire going from your tv over yeah on cable running from the tv to your couch yeah i'm sure
[49:13.520 --> 49:19.680]  nobody ever tripped over it uh you know yeah my grand my grandfather had one like that uh
[49:20.880 --> 49:24.880]  what an invention that's what we didn't we didn't have one we never had one like that but uh i'm
[49:24.880 --> 49:30.000]  trying to remember if we even i don't even think we had a no no we actually know we did yeah we had
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.960]  a black and white with a with a channel changer and the way that it worked it would literally
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.800]  you know of course it would literally change the dial it would move it had to you know you hit this
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.720]  button like this kajunk this big metal thing and it would send an ir signal and i'm assuming it was
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.960]  i think it was ir yeah but i don't you know maybe we're all getting like hand cancer and it would
[49:53.760 --> 50:01.280]  physically move the the dial on the tv i guess i would have to yeah yeah yeah because otherwise
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.200]  it would be on the wrong station yeah and the dial actually like changed the frequency that it
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.320]  was listening to yeah because it was a real day that tv had a real dial i mean i think a lot of
[50:10.320 --> 50:16.160]  them had like push buttons and then like a like a you know like a clock counter sort of thing yep
[50:17.280 --> 50:21.680]  for that station for what station it was on yeah and i remember my uncle had a remote control at
[50:21.680 --> 50:26.880]  one point that was wireless and but it had buttons that like kind of they were like radio buttons
[50:26.880 --> 50:30.320]  you know what i mean so if you you were on channel eight like it wasn't like you would type in
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.520]  eight you know because there still were only 13 channels yeah they just had a button for each
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.040]  channel and when you pressed channel eight if you were had been watching channel six six would
[50:41.760 --> 50:47.760]  depress when you pressed eight yeah yeah people don't even remember radio buttons anymore
[50:48.400 --> 50:55.040]  i have a bit of a quandary because i need to i want to set up my father-in-law to have a tv in
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.320]  to have a tv in his in his room and be able to watch stuff like through the apple tv on his own
[51:00.320 --> 51:07.520]  but i know there's no way he's going to be able to use that remote all right oh man so i guess
[51:07.520 --> 51:15.440]  i'm going to i think the best solution is the harmony um but i'm also like i'm also thinking
[51:15.440 --> 51:22.880]  about using getting a just like a uh a controller game controller yeah maybe i'm not sure if that
[51:22.880 --> 51:27.760]  will do everything i've never even thought about that like maybe just i know that you can do it but
[51:27.760 --> 51:33.120]  just using a just buying another remote and putting my apple tv remote in in the drawer
[51:34.880 --> 51:38.480]  uh is that the sort of thing i don't want to pry in your family life john but is that the sort of
[51:38.480 --> 51:45.600]  thing where this was something you dreaded i i would imagine dreading it if my father-in-law
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.280]  moved in and i get along very well with with both my father and mother-in-law to be honest i i've
[51:51.280 --> 51:58.480]  one of the things that's very fortunate about my life is uh amy's mom and dad uh both you know
[51:58.480 --> 52:03.680]  seem to seem to like me quite a bit uh good relationship with both but if he moved in
[52:04.800 --> 52:11.920]  and i had to explain to him that i don't get i don't get yeah i think he's a little he's a
[52:11.920 --> 52:16.720]  little put off by that you know he's very easy going i mean you know i make dinner and anything
[52:16.720 --> 52:22.480]  that i make he's just like oh this is fantastic um so it's been it's been actually very nice and
[52:22.480 --> 52:26.720]  he has taught he used to be i think did i explain this on this show i've explained it on several
[52:26.720 --> 52:34.320]  other shows but he was a grand he was a well not a grandmaster he was a chess master um and in 1962
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.040]  or something beat bobby fisher get the hell out i never heard this yeah get the hell out of here
[52:39.040 --> 52:42.720]  yeah it was one of those games where fisher was going around playing like 10 different people at
[52:42.720 --> 52:48.240]  the same time um but he he he he so he made his move and fisher came back around and looked at
[52:48.240 --> 52:53.440]  the board and just knocked his king over it's like wow that's and he said he had to run after
[52:53.440 --> 52:57.440]  him to get him to sign the card because he was just like fisher moved on he was like
[52:58.800 --> 53:03.040]  once and you lose some you're not getting away from this so easily there yeah right right you
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.360]  gotta sign this card and he's noted in some some books someplace and it's one of those you know
[53:07.360 --> 53:10.720]  with chess it's like you can practically go back and see every single game but there's a site
[53:10.720 --> 53:16.080]  someplace where you can see the moves of the yeah of the game um that was fantastic but anyway he
[53:16.080 --> 53:22.560]  don't he's been very very congenial about the whole thing and um but the but it but i think
[53:22.560 --> 53:27.280]  i think there was an expression of his face you know we're like we don't have cable it's like
[53:28.240 --> 53:32.480]  what the hell like you have every other electronic device in this house and you don't have cable what
[53:32.480 --> 53:38.960]  what what is going on here it was like you know it was like we we said we were mena knights or
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.840]  something right you've got more iphones than you have people in the house way more right way more
[53:45.840 --> 53:51.360]  but somehow you don't have like i feel like i could explain to my dad or to my father-in-law
[53:51.360 --> 53:56.640]  that we don't have a landline and my dad knows that we don't we and you know in my house do not
[53:56.640 --> 54:04.880]  have a landline phone service um and and the jump to everybody just has their own cell phone and
[54:04.880 --> 54:11.360]  their own number and you just call that way and you know my dad in fact does not have a cell phone
[54:11.360 --> 54:21.280]  my mom does my dad doesn't because uh he he probably would use it but it's he's he just
[54:21.280 --> 54:28.000]  doesn't want to pay for it uh but he you know if he had to move in and we told him now you you know
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.640]  here here just take this and now you have a cell phone that's your phone number he could get it you
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.840]  know like and he uses an ipad so he did he'd get the interface and the basic concepts are kind of
[54:37.840 --> 54:45.280]  the same right like you just you have a number you dial the number and then that phone rings and when
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.400]  if the other person picks up then you talk right so the landline experience and the cell phone
[54:50.400 --> 54:57.120]  only experience are pretty comparable but not having cable tv is sort of a you got to explain
[54:57.120 --> 55:03.120]  it and again it wouldn't be that i would dread it because i would think ah no you know my father-in-law
[55:03.120 --> 55:10.080]  hates me anymore even more i i just wouldn't look forward to explaining it right yeah like i feel
[55:10.080 --> 55:15.280]  like people of that generation expect you to be able to turn a tv on and with it was particularly
[55:15.280 --> 55:22.720]  bad when you're explaining it you know as a game is starting and you're like hey let's watch the
[55:22.720 --> 55:30.480]  football game oh we can't watch the football game because we refuse to pay for cable instead i'm
[55:30.480 --> 55:37.280]  going to pay for 27 different streaming services do you have any of those things uh you don't have
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.120]  it you say you don't have the sort of thing like a youtube tv or the playstation view i think they
[55:43.120 --> 55:49.200]  call it where you get like it's sort of like getting cable service you know like you get like
[55:49.200 --> 55:56.400]  a bunch of i have not looked into the playstation thing i wouldn't i uh probably wouldn't buy a
[55:56.400 --> 56:03.840]  youtube streaming service um i mean i've seen that they have tv they have a tv thing but i consider
[56:03.840 --> 56:11.520]  that sort of like buying cable so it is it you know and you might save some money it's but it
[56:11.520 --> 56:18.400]  still is yeah it's just it hopefully it's you know helping overall just because it's sort of breaking
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.800]  the monopoly of local cable companies that you have an option but yeah well in here in takoma
[56:24.800 --> 56:31.360]  we have a local um we have the town has cable at least for the time being they're actually
[56:31.360 --> 56:35.680]  it's going through this whole um reorganization thing which is i don't want to go into at this
[56:35.680 --> 56:40.480]  point but um the town set of cable so we get internet through the town and um you can also
[56:40.480 --> 56:45.200]  get tv and and that's just through that you you're like right it's like the like paying your water
[56:45.200 --> 56:50.560]  bill um sort of i mean it's a different you don't pay it at the same yeah i mean you don't pay it at
[56:50.560 --> 56:56.720]  the same but you're not paying it to a for-profit corporation right yeah somehow well the internet
[56:56.720 --> 57:01.520]  with the internet part they contract out um to two different right now it's just two different
[57:01.520 --> 57:04.720]  i think when they started out it was more but now it's gone down to two and i think they're
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.200]  actually going to go down to one um and a lot of people are concerned that it's eventually
[57:09.200 --> 57:15.760]  because that's going to lead them to selling the cable business uh oh i'm laughing because i live
[57:15.760 --> 57:23.280]  in philadelphia yeah yeah right literally cable town right it's okay forget it john it's cable
[57:23.280 --> 57:29.520]  town like the odds of the city of philadelphia ever providing oh yeah no there's no way
[57:32.240 --> 57:38.240]  and i know like comcast you know for those of you who don't know comcast which is a giant media
[57:38.240 --> 57:44.320]  conglomerate that owns way more other media conglomerates than you can even keep track of
[57:44.320 --> 57:50.240]  they probably just bought another thing while we're talking uh but they own among other things
[57:50.240 --> 57:57.200]  all of nbc they own universal i guess they call it nbc universal now uh but it's all owned by
[57:57.200 --> 58:03.680]  comcast what i'm feeling when i'm feeling particularly um but i don't know loathsome
[58:03.680 --> 58:09.360]  in a bad mood or whatever i remind people that gritty is owned by comcast is he because they
[58:09.360 --> 58:15.440]  they own the fly because they own the team right all right i think yeah i'm pretty sure they own
[58:15.440 --> 58:21.840]  that team and everybody loves gritty and i love gritty too but you know sorry he's a registered
[58:21.840 --> 58:28.400]  trademark of the comcast corporation well and it's and it it's pretty you know to go back to
[58:28.400 --> 58:36.160]  baseball they uh they don't own the phillies but they own the phillies tv rights uh and so if you
[58:36.160 --> 58:43.280]  ever wonder why you can't watch your local team on the mlb at bat app it's because that situation
[58:43.280 --> 58:49.440]  is it's not true in every city but it's true in a lot of cities where the the the people who have
[58:49.440 --> 58:54.480]  a say in whether or not they you would be allowed to watch your local team in this app on stream
[58:54.480 --> 59:02.000]  over the internet which you would pay for is it's determined by the cable company which requires you
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.960]  to have a cable subscription to do it like they don't even let you the thing that doesn't make
[59:06.960 --> 59:11.120]  sense about it is of course everybody knows baseball telecasts have ads between the innings
[59:11.120 --> 59:17.040]  it's it's really sort of a it's like the only sport where the ads are actually the ad breaks
[59:17.040 --> 59:22.720]  are actually natural and they kind of extend them in the playoffs but in the regular season
[59:22.720 --> 59:28.080]  they don't it doesn't delay the game at all you know it's one of the beautiful things about
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.640]  televised baseball uh but they don't even do that they don't even show the ads because they don't
[59:34.640 --> 59:38.080]  really care about the ads they just want to make sure everybody who cares about baseball
[59:38.080 --> 59:45.120]  in philadelphia has a cable subscription great definitely what a digression look out for number
[59:45.120 --> 59:50.560]  one what this is an all-time great digression on this podcast because this is all related to
[59:50.560 --> 59:58.000]  whether or not air pods look silly with or without wires i was trying to remember how we got into
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.320]  this and i couldn't i usually i'm usually the first one to forget how a digression started but
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.280]  i've somehow still had this in mind and and that and i've been trying to tie it together with some
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:12.000]  kind of joke about cord cutters cable cutters what do they call them oh yeah right yeah sure
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.240]  because you get you and i always wonder like are there anybody is there anybody out there
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.000]  i have always wondered this and this is why i've been wanting to make this observation for 10
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.680]  minutes now is you know that the way that air pods have become this uh status symbol for some bizarre
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.240]  people you know that you're you know you're somehow showing off if you have air pods and
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:38.320]  that it's a sign that you're cool or or whatever which is very alien to me and i just wonder how
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.480]  many people there's got to be some people who've done it i mean like teenagers or something who've
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.600]  just taken like the old air pods and cut cords yeah and then like made it look like they have air
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.560]  pods which obviously wouldn't work at all so they've just got them in there it's like merlin
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:58.560]  holding his wallet up to his ear pretty much exactly except harder to tell right at least
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.040]  if you'd see merlin holding his wallet up to his ear if you really look at it you're going to see
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:09.040]  that that's a that's a wallet whereas well you can really look i mean i think if you really like
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.120]  you'd notice i mean you'd have to get really close but you'd have to get really uncomfortably close
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:20.960]  what are you doing well i'm sorry i just wanted to see i'm on the phone i'm on the phone no you're
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.200]  not but you could you imagine going up to somebody really close to the ear and they're like what are
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.680]  you doing and then you had to tell them i just wanted to see if you really had air pods or if
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.360]  you just cut the cords off an old pair of uh well so the new ones it'll be easier to tell yeah they
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.480]  do look a little different they won't look they don't like anything i mean you know they look
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:46.960]  quite a bit not like the uh yeah the ear pods no uh do you have air pods oh yeah i saw i have two
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.480]  i still have my original ones and i have the second generation one of the things that blew
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.480]  me away today was uh dan moran uh a mutual friend co-host of uh what how many podcasts you do with
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:07.360]  dan i do two that's a lot rebound and biff biff is the one you guys talk about superheroes yes
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:15.600]  is that is guy english on that the guy english is on yes yeah uh i miss guy english you just
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:23.520]  saw guy english i didn't that is true he was he did come and go out to dinner with me and my wife
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.480]  about a week and a half ago we had a delightful time took him to hopson more recently i mean i
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.240]  talked to him every week but you've seen him more recently than i have yeah i took him to hopson
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:43.120]  uh he had a great time um uh where what the hell now now i've lost the thread but you're
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.840]  going to talk about dan's weird ears oh yeah well yeah yeah so dan had been uh he wrote today that
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:57.680]  he uh was really looking forward to the uh the three sizes of little rubber tips uh because he
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:04.560]  heretofore had still not purchased airpods which i found very you know but he may it's it's because
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:11.280]  he has unusual ears or something like that well so this is the thing about airpods is that there's
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:17.440]  half the world thinks the other half's ears are weird and the other half thinks that has ears
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.440]  are weird because they either either fit you or they don't fit you and they fit me great and
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.120]  earbuds have always fit me really well yeah and i've always i've always liked earpods fine you
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.280]  know as far as wired headphones go and i'm not like super audio quality concerned yeah i'm only
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:42.320]  mildly audio quality concerned and when i got airpods it was like this is perfect yeah yeah
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.840]  but they don't they don't work for him because he's his ears are different and there's a lot of
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.440]  people like that yeah i know uh marco armand has never really uh been happy with any kind yeah it's
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.600]  just it has to do it's just you know just shape shapes yeah i remember i remember when they when
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.400]  they debuted airpods i believe it was in the johnny i've narrated video that he talked about
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.800]  the fact that they spent uh some gazillion dollars you know 3d modeling the inner shape of thousands
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:17.760]  of people's ears of multiple uh you know just not dance women men and children and young people and
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.320]  old people and you know also as many ears as they could scan they scanned them and tried to find
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.480]  this shape that was uh would fit as many of them comfortably as possible and i remember then
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:35.280]  getting them and then looking at them and looking at the old wire ones right next to them and really
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.560]  i mean you get really really close to them i couldn't see a damn bit of difference in the
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.240]  shape of the thing that goes in your ear but i know of several people i i can't name them off
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.400]  the top of my head so call fake news if you want but i i maybe jow kit i forget daniel jow kit
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.960]  friend of the show um i could be somebody else but i know a couple people who who claim that
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.800]  the old wired ones never fit them right would always be falling out and that they therefore
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.040]  were terrified to buy air pods because they assumed they would fall out as well and when
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.920]  you know obviously air pods falling out are a more expensive and b they're wireless you know they
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:17.200]  could go anywhere right whereas a wired one falling out well it's still just dangling
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:23.120]  connected to the to the cord yeah but who then tried air pods like at an apple store or something
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.760]  and lo and behold they actually fit so there is some difference i don't know it's like somehow
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:34.000]  because it's just a lot of people have speculated just it is just the cord right but right that the
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.600]  cord actually weighs down the thing in your ear and pulls it out but they claimed i do remember
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.280]  apple claiming that they 3d modeled it on some kind of you know to some kind of way to find the
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.320]  shape that fit as many ears as possible but even so that doesn't fit all ears yeah my concern is
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.160]  that apple will now switch to this design which i don't like because i never like the ones that
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:00.000]  are like plugs in your ears yeah i've never i've had a number of those and they've never worked
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.800]  well for me and even when i get noise canceling ones i have to get the over the ear style because
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:11.760]  i can't deal with those uh i had so i so i you know much much as they have gone to large phones
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:17.360]  against my wishes i have a slight concern that they're going to go to ear plug type
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:25.600]  i forget if they're noise canceling or not or if it's just the fact that they plug your
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:32.960]  ear but i think they were noise canceling i had a pair of sure in ear yeah i've had those
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.440]  and i maybe you got them when i were no i think they were noise canceling i think they were too
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:43.440]  and i got them in the goodie bag for being a speaker at macworld expo i think that's where
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.600]  i got them too and i think we're in the little like round case yeah yep and they were black
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:56.160]  yeah yep yeah so we got gray but anyway well i don't know dark enough whatever uh and i
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.480]  remember getting them and there's all sorts of stuff in that goodie bag it was it was really
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.280]  it was really quite a racket i mean that was really that was the time that was of the brief
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.360]  the brief moment in time that i caught that wave and then and then it went away i mean hey that
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.920]  shows how long ago it was because macworld expo feels like feels like i was a kid when i went to
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:22.000]  macworld expo you were but i went there i did a couple of times i spoke i remember the one time
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.600]  i did it was a really good talk it was like and it was going to become like an annual tradition
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.480]  it was like gruber's list it was like my top 10 issues surrounding apple i mean and specifically
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.040]  i think number two i didn't want to make it number one but it was like because it just seemed to i
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.720]  didn't know how to fit it in so i think i put it in like number two or number three was like
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.680]  steve jobs's health you know that he's singularly important to the company yeah uh yeah yeah just
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.240]  so that you know that just tells you how how long ago it was that it was it was not just when steve
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.200]  jobs was around but when it was still sort of a well what if something happened to steve jobs
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.680]  um but anyway the goodie bag included all this other i don't who knows about much other stuff
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.720]  but they they had these sure ear pods ear buds whatever you want to call them they're noise
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.880]  canceling and uh i like it was like i'm not gonna like those i hate that anything that goes in my
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.320]  ear but i guess i'll try them and i like googled i was like i wonder how much these are i bet they're
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.120]  like 80 or 90 bucks and i like googled them and they were like 300 or something i was like holy
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.800]  hell this like i better double check before i throw any of this stuff out this is amazing they
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.600]  were like 300 headphones uh and i wound up loving them i i date i never liked things that go in my
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.440]  ear that like that and it sealed up but these shores really did um yeah i tried those for a
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.320]  while and they didn't work well enough for me um so i gave them to karen and she enjoyed them but
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.400]  i didn't that worked for me that was one of the ones that i referenced it today where i've had
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.320]  other that was one of the ones i've had but i had few others in the years since where there were
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.560]  earbuds that had multiple options for the rubber part that would go in your ear
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.920]  and with the shore ones i was like oh and the shore ones weren't just three sizes they were
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.320]  like like you had like yeah there's like six of them or something they had their own case
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.480]  different types of material yeah different types of material very different shapes they even had
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.320]  it was like there was a case for the headphones and there was like a case for the extra nubbins
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.800]  or whatever you call them uh i just put the ones i was like i don't even know where to start this
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.800]  seems like a lot of work and this is the sort of thing that's going to drive me nuts this is this
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.800]  is where i'm not going to say i'm ocd but this is where i'm on the spectrum of ocd is it's like
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.560]  indecisiveness right like i i'm gonna it's gonna torment me for the rest of my life that i maybe
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.800]  picked the wrong ones but i put just put the default ones in my ear i was like huh these sound
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.720]  these are a more comfortable than i thought and then i was like these are really comfortable
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.560]  and i kind of liked them and so i never even tried the other ones because i was like i was afraid to
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.080]  but i wound up i used those as my airplane headphones for years and years and years
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.960]  and really always enjoyed them uh and i forget why i get i guess i gave them up
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.240]  i gave them up to get what to go wireless a couple years ago because
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.800]  it's a little known fact but uh people a lot of people most people didn't notice but the
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:17.200]  the iphone uh got rid of the headphone jack are you sure i think i would have read about that i
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.560]  am absolutely are you well you would have thought it would have been a bigger deal but
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.400]  i would i would have thought that would have been on the verge
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.760]  you'd think it would be they're very very consumer focused you think he's a very smart guy he doesn't
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.440]  miss much i would think that he would have written about it well as far as i know he did he never
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.880]  commented so i switched i switched to wireless ones years ago and i got a pair of the bows uh
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.720]  over the ear ones uh anyways i'm curious how these air pods are going to work i i'm i'm not
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.520]  as skeptical as i would have been if i hadn't had that very positive experience with the shores for
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.000]  for years and years that maybe i will like these i don't know and i think what's interesting about
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.920]  where you talked about the nubbins so supposedly the these will use sound to figure out if you're
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:10.800]  wearing the right yeah that's what dan links yeah it's so there's some kind of way in software i i
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.600]  don't know where this is i guess it's in it's probably one of those things i'm sure that'll
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:21.440]  be ios only and won't make it to the mac uh but there i guess in settings somewhere there will
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:27.360]  be some kind of way that you can uh it's unclear i guess i'll find out tomorrow when i go up for
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.840]  this uh media briefing like okay so there's a test but how do you get to it is in the settings
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.280]  app do you just your ear tip fit test ear tips yeah ear tip fit test that sounds like one of
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.560]  those things that you say like a tongue twister to get ready to go on a podcast here yeah it's
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:54.000]  pluralized ears tip fears god damn plurals this would all be so much easier if you if we as a
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.240]  species only had one ear right in the front of our head yeah we're right in the forehead right
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:07.680]  that's the obvious you don't have to be all right yeah yeah because everything else is taken right
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.000]  we only have one mouth right where you are you know well maybe we would have two mouths if we
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.080]  only had one ear yeah there's probably a planet somewhere where everybody has all the species all
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.000]  the their equivalent of mammals everybody has two mouths you know because what happens what happens
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.720]  if if you know you you get a toothache into one mouth well you have your other mouth to keep going
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.440]  star trek yeah star trek always went like crazy i always thought they were going they were really
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:36.720]  going out all out on designing an alien when they would put like nostrils someplace other than where
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  a human nostril would be it's like all the aliens were just people with bumpy foreheads right right
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.240]  but then occasionally they'd put like nostrils like you know in between the eyebrows or yeah yeah
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.240]  no totally yeah we're up on the forehead like what if instead of making a ridged forehead
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.040]  we put a nose it would be another be another mouth or an ear up there yeah
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.920]  uh they never call me i are you looking forward to the picard full of ideas
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:15.520]  what looking forward to what the picard i i am um oh man talk about aggression how can i not
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.920]  chris here's the next hour of the show all right hold that thought let me tell you about our next
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.560]  sponsor it's our good friends it's another classic we're going we're going deep in the classic
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.320]  sponsors of the talk show fracture look everybody takes and shares photos online
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:39.040]  but very few of those photos end up printed and even fewer end up on display you can focus on the
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.320]  moments that mean the most in your life by turning your favorite digital memories into a meaningful
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:51.440]  photo decor fracture prints are made by printing directly on glass so they don't you send them your
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:57.040]  photo you sign up they don't print them on paper and then glue the paper to a piece of glass or
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:04.160]  something like that they literally have some kind of moon man technology that prints full color
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.440]  very vivid totally solid it's not like you know like stained glass where you can see through it
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:16.240]  solid print right on the piece of glass it looks amazing it looks fantastic looks better than
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.760]  any printed on paper behind a piece of glass print that i've ever seen super high quality it makes it
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:31.120]  look like it's right on the surface and they ship them in a way that the entire piece of glass edge
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.360]  to edge corner to corner you don't need to put it in a frame it doesn't have a frame it's just
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.440]  a piece of glass that you can hang on the wall and everything you need to hang it comes in the box
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.880]  package that ships to you from fracture right there so if you want to hang it on a wall or
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.480]  put it on your mantle prop it up on your desk or something like that everything you need to do
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.520]  like that is all in the box it's all included and you just get this amazing edge to edge display
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.960]  with no border no frame all you see is the photograph it is a fantastic effect it goes
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.360]  with any decor people notice it when you have fracture prints hanging in your house
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.080]  people who don't listen to my podcast and haven't heard about fracture before they will comment
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.600]  they'll come up and they'll say what is that how did you how did you make that picture and then
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.080]  they think maybe because you're a clever computer person who listens to shows like this they might
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.000]  think that you know some kind of trick that they can't do turns out all you did is go to fracture
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.560]  and send them pictures right from your phone anybody could do it super easy
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:35.440]  uh they're a green company operating a carbon neutral factory right down in florida
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.400]  gainesville florida you can go to fracture.me that's their website you get a special discount
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:47.120]  on your first order and don't forget to pick the name of this show the talk show in their one
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.200]  question survey after checkout where they ask where'd you hear a fracture just tell them you
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.320]  heard about it on the talk show fantastic gift idea by the way it's late october i'm not going
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.400]  to tell you to put up your christmas decorations halloween hasn't even happened yet technically
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.240]  but it's getting close fantastic it's the greatest gift idea find think of every single person in
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:15.600]  your family who would like to see pictures of you or your kids or your pets or even just trips that
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.840]  you've took together something like that anybody who could you could give a picture to send them
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.160]  a fracture for the holidays oh it's the easiest thing in the world and it's my favorite thing
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.400]  about sending fractures as a gift idea is as long as you keep taking more pictures next year
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.320]  you can do it again and again you could be the guy or the gal who that's your thing every christmas
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.000]  is you give you know your parents or your grandparents or whoever it is give them a
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.080]  picture every year something like that you can just do it over and over again people won't get
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.880]  tired of it fantastic gift idea go ahead and do it now get it out of the way because they get into
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.920]  december and they get backlogged behind christmas and the other holidays uh so don't forget the
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.760]  don't forget to go to fractured at me and don't forget to tell them you came from the talk show
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.320]  i love that company i could talk about them yeah they and they have great and very friendly
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.080]  customer support they really do they're very friendly people and because i i i wanted to make
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.440]  sure um that they could do a black and white ah um and um so i contacted them and you know and
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.600]  she did not call me dummy but she could have easily because it was right there on the website
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.880]  but she pointed me to like the section where they had examples of like like it's not the most
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:29.520]  ridiculous question but you it generally is it generally it's sort of like if you buy a color
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.240]  television can you watch a black and white movie it's black and white are two of the colors
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:43.120]  in the spectrum see now you're saying dummy yeah i guess i am that's fair
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.440]  uh so what were we talking about we were going to go off on a terrific aside there uh paccard
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.760]  oh yeah card you want to talk about the card well you know you know who the show is talking about
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.720]  we should maybe talk about the reviews for apple tv plus oh yeah well let's save the file is away
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:09.520]  for the the third segment of the show uh let's stick to airpods for now uh airpods pro uh
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.800]  one color you can get get them whatever color you want white rumored to have come in black and
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.800]  midnight green just like the other phones didn't come in that why do you think they don't make
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.960]  colored ipods my theory as i spoused on my website earlier today is is that it they sort of see them
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:31.120]  as a branding thing that there's sort of an iconic look that dates back to the ad campaign for ipods
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.200]  that lasted for years years and years and years those silhouette ipods that are coming out of
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.840]  people listening to music and dancing um it was a very long-running ad campaign and i feel like
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.000]  today's airpods still sort of carry on that like you see people walking down the street wearing
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.720]  white things sticking out of their ears and you just know they're airpods and that would be
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.840]  diluted even if they just added one more color like black it would dilute that to some degree
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  yeah even even though other companies make i mean and for years have made a lot of money
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:12.320]  i mean for years have made white right wired headphones and other companies now make white
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:19.520]  air you know knock off airpods basically right um it reminds you of apple yeah even if you're
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.840]  seeing someone who's not actually wearing their headphones yeah and for some reason
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.920]  nobody's really come out with airpods that really look like airpods you know like where it's you
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.680]  know like the google ones or look like uh no name brand yeah yeah no name brand has really come out
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:41.520]  with anything that really follows that that that that rod sticking out of a thing pointing down
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.960]  design there's you know all sorts of different designs that people have come out with for their
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:52.640]  wireless earbuds but nobody's really copied that yet whether they did it out of you know deference
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.960]  like pride like we're not going to copy this iconic design or whether there's some kind of
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.360]  technical reason that apple has you know an ability to make them like that and and put the
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:08.320]  battery in that little rod that others technically haven't been able to copy i don't know but uh
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.720]  yeah i would think the battery technology would be hard to do you know for for us for a regular
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:18.080]  company to duplicate anyway i you know maybe the most the major companies could probably do it yeah
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:25.600]  but and maybe it's just too shameless i don't know you know like if samsung galaxy note 11 came out
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:31.440]  with i never bothered them before i that's what i think i was like i'm just kind of samsung is this
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.520]  whole segment here i've been thinking about samsung why hasn't samsung made something that
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.360]  looks as much like air pods as they possibly can i don't know but i it kind of sucks if you think
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.320]  about it that way though in a way because it's sort of like it they're not always they're not
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.640]  white and only white for our benefit it's sort of for apple's benefit as a branding yeah
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:59.840]  right like so for the people who you know wish that they made black ones uh you know sort of
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:09.600]  sucks and i assume i mean they we think that there will be ar glasses coming sometime and i would
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.120]  assume that because that is something that is more front and center on the face that it would
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:20.160]  assuming that these things are real right that they would be more fashion well look at what
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:24.720]  they've done with the watch and and you'd be able yeah i mean but but still yeah but still
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:31.920]  i'm trying to figure i'm trying to think of how they would look so that you can still make them
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.840]  your own statement and then it would also say hey these are from apple yeah it's a fat i can
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:45.520]  you know and that's a product that we know is in the works um but so far has no leaks of hardware
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:51.920]  um so i yeah i i've been thinking about that too because i know and i know there was a rumor
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.200]  i think it was ming chi quo all the rumors are ming chi quo really well all the good ones
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.120]  oh yeah all the ones from the supply chain but he you know he's he came out a couple weeks ago
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.040]  a week or two ago and said yeah the glasses or goggles or whatever the hell they are coming out
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.480]  he has no idea no idea what they look like and i find stuff like that fascinating that you know
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:16.800]  he he's confident enough in his source that he's you know willing to put his reputation on the line
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.600]  by saying definitively that apple's currently not planning to come out with them in 2020
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:30.080]  but has no idea really what they look like or what they do really but i've been thinking about that
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.640]  like and i you know this is a good aside really because it's like there's different ways to do
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:41.600]  glasses like the the biggest yeah that's it there's a vast variety of glasses well and the
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.600]  biggest thing would be is this something you're supposed to wear all day like what which is what
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.560]  the idea behind google glass was that these this is something you would wake up in the morning and
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:57.280]  put on and then you walk around all day with these things on and you yeah you would go to dinner so
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.040]  you mean from like a functional standpoint right from a functional standpoint as opposed to like
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.080]  i'm talking about style or is it is it more like air pods where it is a thing that you would wear
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:12.640]  temporarily you know like you don't to do something i'm sure that i'm sure that there's
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:18.320]  some kids who wear their air pods all day but i think there are people yeah i mean i you know
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.600]  we went out to lunch on sunday and um for dim sum and there were i saw several people wearing
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:31.760]  air pods at the restaurant while they were dining just like one in there one in there yeah so i you
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.800]  know but is but that's my thought is maybe that these don't think of it as google glass think of
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.520]  it as something more like air pods for your eyes and that you'd put them on maybe you're going for
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.240]  a walk or a run or something and you'd put them on while you're going and then you could see your
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.480]  text messages or something floating in front of you but you wouldn't wear them all day and they
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:56.560]  wouldn't be a replacement for prescription glasses i i don't know it's just you know there's a lot
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.200]  it's just very common the watch was a little bit like this but the the idea of apple branded
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.400]  glasses has way more questions like that like but if they're not a replacement for prescription
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.800]  glasses how does somebody who needs glasses wear them right they kind of have to be right like they
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.960]  kind of have to be something that you could buy and then and then how is that going to work like
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.240]  you go to apple.com to pre-order them and then what you have to take them to your optician to
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.280]  to get lenses put in yeah yeah and there's just a lot of questions everybody's just like oh yeah
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.440]  apple's all in on ar and they're going to come out with glasses but it's like there's a lot of
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:38.320]  big fundamental questions surrounding a product like that i that i don't know how they square
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:43.440]  that circle and and the fashion angle is one too where it's like okay so now everybody half
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:51.280]  the people in north america that i know all wear the same watch but right from the get-go
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:59.280]  i mean if anything they had they might have had more variety of watch bands at the original apple
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.840]  watch than they do now uh or at least as many i mean they oh yeah very very consciously even
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.000]  right from the beginning day one uh they were like we have a zillion different watch straps
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.040]  to choose from of different styles and materials you know rubber and leather and metal bracelets
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:24.240]  and milanese and now they've got the the velcro ones um and all sorts of different colors and
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:30.320]  they change them up every six months uh so that's a big part of how they pulled this off like
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.960]  i and i really firmly believe that if there were only like white you know like a space gray
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:45.360]  watch with a black band and a regular aluminum one with a white band and that's it i don't think the
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:51.520]  apple watch would have taken off i i literally think that the the configurability the ease of
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.720]  and and how easy it is it's a genius physical mechanism that they invented i think it's i think
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:04.160]  it's crazy that we dealt with the those fiddly little prongs and watches prior to the invention
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:10.800]  of the apple watch we dealt with those things free forever 100 years right it's like the easiest
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.960]  to change watch strap i've ever seen and i'm you know a bit of a watch nerd is nowhere near as easy
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.800]  to change as the apple watch one yeah uh and i've done it you know because i have a you know a couple
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:27.280]  of uh mechanical watches and i've changed the straps on them and it's terrifying they could
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.920]  shoot across the road right and there's a little they think they're literally called spring bars
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:38.960]  and they do shoot across the room and so you'll never find it again yeah but you could scratch
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.200]  it you know you have to use a tool that you if it's you know most watches are made of material
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.960]  even like stainless steel that could be easily scratched you know you don't want to do it but
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.520]  you feel like an income poop taking it into you know somebody else you know like a yeah like i
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.440]  wouldn't open the case of a watch if it you know is a battery open battery uh uh you know like a
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.800]  quartz watch with a replaceable battery if it was waterproof i wouldn't trust myself to do it i'd
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.680]  me either yeah so back i haven't had a watch with a replaceable quartz battery in a very long time
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.240]  but when i did i always took it to a a jeweler because i live here in a city where there's tons
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.880]  of tons of professional jewelers where you can take a watch but to change a strap i wouldn't do
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.920]  that i feel like an income poop but i trust i'd do it myself but it's a pain in the butt anyway
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.480]  that's a huge part of the apple watch success i don't see how that quite translates to glass
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:32.240]  translates to glasses right like that everybody has the same sort of front facing frames but
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.920]  you get to pick that the side pieces that go over your ear you know that does it right that doesn't
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.480]  seem right either right yeah because that's the most the front part is the most important part
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.200]  right and so i don't see it i don't know i i'm looking forward to seeing what it's all about but
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.120]  when i think about it as something you would wear all day it just seems less and less likely because
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.120]  i just don't see how they would make glasses that everyone would want to wear without looking
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:03.920]  like you've joined some kind of sports team you know like welcome to the team everybody
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:11.120]  wears the same glasses you know it just seems very very strange i don't know i can't wait to see how
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.280]  to do it but then you know compare and contrast the variety of watch straps that apple alone
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:23.200]  offers let alone the fact that third parties are easily able to get the uh you know to to make
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.120]  their own watch straps for the apple watch uh with air pods which are white and only white there you
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.680]  go that was the but that was funny because i switched sizes when i got the apple watch five
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:42.080]  the series five and needed to get all new bands but i don't think i ever would have done that in
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.080]  the past like when i got a new watch i would just wear the band that it came with for you know
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.160]  15 years or whatever until it fell apart and then i'd go grudgingly go to the mall and buy a new band
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.800]  right um but because it's you know i can change the band so easily i was like oh i gotta get i
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.520]  gotta get new bands so i got you know i got the one that it came with and then i got two other
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.200]  bands to go with it yeah so you dropped down in size you went to yeah yeah to the 40 millimeter
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:16.240]  yeah yeah i stuck with the with the big boy watch yeah yeah but it's a close call i mean this is
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.680]  perfect for me and and yeah i didn't want to go bigger definitely yeah i'm curious i would be
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:28.960]  curious to know how the size the the uh the sales break down on that because you figure most women
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:35.760]  are gonna buy the 40 millimeter yeah um because their wrists are you know smaller uh and you know
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.280]  I would say another thing that's never changed with apple watches they've never labeled them as
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:45.280]  men's and women's it's always just been two sizes and you know then both you know can be dressed up
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:52.480]  in very different ways depending simply on the strap um there has to be more people it has to
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:57.440]  since they increase the size with series four it has to be more more people buying 40 than ever
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.280]  before because i would think so because there's an i know an awful lot of men just just on the
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:07.360]  podcast i listened to switched to the 40 millimeter yeah yeah i would think that they would they could
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.960]  find room for you know another 30 36 you know yeah i would think so too yeah but maybe you
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:22.800]  know it's already there's already enough sku's i don't know yeah uh what else on the airpods so
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:28.880]  we've got the the nubbins we've got the nubbin test the ears fit wow jesus what is it the ears
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:36.720]  fit something ear tip fit test ears ears tip no you forgot the plural job i made that part up
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.160]  i guess they could have could have been ear tips fit test though again somebody at apple probably
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.240]  really put some thought into that but looking forward to see how that works it sounds to me
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:56.000]  like that fit test is a lot like a very an ear canal sized version of what home pods do
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.200]  in a room room test yeah right where they it's like it's it plays sound and then there's a
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:07.840]  microphone pointing into your ear so in addition to the microphone that picks up outside noise
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:13.280]  for the noise cancellation and you know so you can make phone calls and talk to your earpods
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.440]  they now have a microphone the new ones have a microphone inside that points into your ear
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:28.080]  so that they can dynamically adjust to sound better which really uh is it's kind of amazing
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:38.160]  there's an interesting feature i i i sort of feel like it's my job mostly to complain about apple
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:45.520]  that's you know that's what we do but and i do feel like in a large sense that they've
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:50.560]  you know there's we could i could do hours and hours and hours talking about it and in fact have
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.600]  if you listen to the back episodes of the show you read my website but that the trend in my
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.120]  opinion has moved too much across all of apple's products but like especially with the mac in
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:09.920]  particular towards uh encapsulating too much and it's like well we'll just make this simpler but
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:14.320]  it's like they've made it too simple and now that there's no way to do power user things
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:21.520]  um but sometimes encapsulating the whole thing is exactly the right thing to do like the way that to
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:30.800]  get home pods to do their fancy uh adjust their acoustic output based on the acoustics of the room
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.640]  that they're in and readjust as soon as the accelerometer in the device can tell that it's
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.560]  being picked up and moved and then oh i i've been moved so i need to recalibrate but doesn't go into
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:48.320]  a test mode where it plays weird sounds it just plays whatever you told it to play and initially
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:55.120]  just sort of listens and to see how it it itself sounds and adjusts dynamically and you don't have
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.920]  to do anything there's no buttons there's nothing to do there is no mode to enter you don't have to
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.800]  enter a mode it just does it automatically that to me is apple at its best that's something that
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:10.320]  encapsulating all the complexity and just don't worry about it just put it in your ear and we'll
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:15.280]  adjust we're using a little hidden microphone to see if it can i mean it it i'd be interested to
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.040]  see if it can recommend which ones i think that would be pretty wild like i think it would be able
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:27.680]  to say nah these are not quite right but yeah if it could say try this one i wonder if part of this
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:34.800]  you know so they apparently snap on and snap off i wonder if there's something like physical it
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  wouldn't be electronic but it's maybe some kind of way that it knows which size is on
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.080]  like yeah like would you would your airpods pro know that you have the medium tips in
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.600]  mm-hmm and then say hey why don't you try the larger ones and you're like i i don't know where
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.440]  they are i lost them when i opened the box i wonder how much replacement tips are going to cost
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.680]  150 dollars oh there's a just the tip joke just the tips joke in there
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.880]  welcome to the apple store what would you like just just the tips just the tips
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.880]  i what do you why do you think that they didn't announce these at the event last month
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.920]  yeah i don't know i mean you speculated because they weren't quite ready right and that maybe
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:27.600]  they're gun shy because of the air power because of the air power yeah you know although you know
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:35.440]  i mean air power was well it wasn't really close right it couldn't have been but they but i think
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.600]  it's like a different situation i mean these things were very close to shipping yeah i mean
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.560]  you know they're here we are i think it's about seven weeks later eight at the most right it's
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.560]  seven or eight weeks later and here they are and you can pre-order them and they're going to start
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.640]  shipping in two days so at that point they're going to be shipping in two days and they're
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:04.160]  at that closeness it seems to me that they should that that's within the realm of being 99.8
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.120]  certain i'm gonna i'm gonna guess it's because they didn't want to affect sales of existing
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:16.640]  air pods okay so a couple people on twitter point suggested that to me as well but yeah that that i
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:23.040]  would buy if these were replacements for air pods as we know them if these are the new air pods for
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:30.560]  160 dollars and now when you buy our pods this is what you get but they're 250 not 160 dollars yeah
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.400]  and so it and i you know i still think it could change people's buying though i mean you know
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.840]  particularly if you're i mean apple seems i guess exists apple seems by buying it by a
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.800]  christmas present now right apple seems patient enough to me though that that if these are going
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.400]  to affect and and presumably they are going to affect sales of the other air pods that there
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:01.840]  will clearly be some number n people who would have bought regular air pods if they were still
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:09.520]  the only air pods but who will instead buy air pods pro because they want the noise cancellation
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.920]  or whatever you know whatever else it seems to me that however big that number is of people who
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:22.480]  would have bought them in between september the 10th or whatever day that event was and today
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.800]  that apple is a patient enough company to say okay we'll let you wait you know that's fine with us
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:35.440]  because you're going to be spending 90 more dollars yeah so i don't know about that maybe
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.720]  i i don't know it seemed i mean in general i would say that they tend to try to announce things
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.080]  within like a week or so of things being available available yeah yeah and there are and it doesn't
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.960]  obviously it doesn't matter when it's a new category right because the only other you know
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.240]  you're only stealing sales from other companies so that's fine so yeah so maybe in theory they
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.480]  were really hoping that they would be ready to ship by the end of september and they could have
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.640]  announced them on stage but because they weren't now they they just don't want to get it they just
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:14.560]  don't want to do that yeah and they you know like and they were like the iphone 10 shipped
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:24.640]  before the iphone 8 is that the way it worked but then the next year the the 10 are shipped later
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.160]  than no i guess i wonder if they have people who come in and buy both at the same time
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:38.800]  both the airpods and the airpod pro no by by an iphone and airpods oh yeah maybe and and then and
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:43.600]  they thought well you know if like you're the kind of person who wants airpods pro you're going to
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.240]  delay your iphone purchase until they come out and they didn't want to they didn't want to set back
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:54.720]  the initial quarter sales of the new iphones of the new iphone oh i like that theory john i like
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:02.240]  you can have that yeah that's for you i like that theory all right now i remember it's just so
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:08.320]  nobody sends in a correction uh with the original iphone 10 the 10 shipped later than the iphone 8
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:17.760]  and i almost suspect i almost suspect that they wanted it that way because if they shipped the 10
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.800]  and the 8 at the same time all of the reviews would have been entirely about the 10 and the
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:28.560]  any attention so they shipped the 8 first so that it would it would get reviewed as fairly as
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.560]  possible and even so most of the reviews i remember noting at the time they still all
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.640]  mentioned the iphone 10 which was then coming later and then the iphone 10 shipped then the
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:44.400]  next year the 10s and the 10s max shipped first and the 10r shipped later and that might have
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:50.320]  been a delay that might not have been on purpose or strategic to you know to stagger the reviews
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:57.040]  but maybe it was because the you know in my opinion and most other people who reviewed them
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:04.240]  is opinion that the 10s or the 10r was so good that that for an awful lot of people it was it
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:11.200]  was the right phone for them even not even looking at the price yeah and they you know kind of wanted
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.800]  to get as many of the thousand dollar phone sales as they could but anyway they've so they've done
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.720]  that in in with other things other than airpower where they held the event and one of the big
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:30.560]  announcements wasn't coming until weeks into october um i don't know it's very very strange
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.640]  well not very strange but it's it's curious yeah there's not obviously there's a lot of
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.880]  there's a lot of thought that goes on and it's tough to armchair quarterback all that
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.080]  uh anything else on the airpods pro i don't think so yeah you're gonna upgrade or no you're gonna
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.320]  stick with what you know like like i said i don't like the i don't like the plugs the earplug thing
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.040]  so i'm i'm good i wonder how they're gonna do the the the things in the store i don't know what what
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.520]  did they do now like i know i don't know i wondered that too because you know like if you
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:05.280]  wanted to come in and try them on they're they can't they can't reuse them and they can't burn
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:11.120]  one yeah every time somebody wants to try it on i still remember very vividly being just like i
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:18.960]  blown away by by what they were doing but then realizing well they kind of have to do that was
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.320]  that at the when they introduced the original airpods i don't know what was that three years
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:34.320]  ago uh yeah at in the hands-on area for the press after the event they they would they'd
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.720]  they'd come out with a tray of them it was like like being at a cocktail party i honest to god
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:46.080]  like somebody would come out with a tray of airpods like hors d'oeuvres you know and and you'd you
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.600]  you couldn't just pick them up and and yourself because you know then you'd walk off with them
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:58.160]  um but you you would find a helpful apple person and they would say would you like to try airpods
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.120]  and you'd say yes and then they would have this tray and then they would take a pair and let you
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.920]  try them and then i guess they were already paired with like their you know like a demo iphone and
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.440]  they play a couple of songs and ask you what you think and then you could like double tap to try
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.800]  all the stuff and then you would say oh that's interesting and then you'd hand them back to them
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:26.000]  and then they would put them on another tray of this already used airpods and there was a non-stop
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:33.680]  shuffle of apple apple employees bringing out fresh trays and taking away the tribes they were
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.680]  just going in the back and turning around and coming back that was the joke everybody was
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.840]  joking about that dude they're just walking behind that door and then just turning around
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.560]  uh i i don't i wonder what they do in the stores i i don't know i actually don't know the answer
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.120]  to this question i would think that idea but you can't like dummy ones don't really
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.360]  help because you can't hear anything right right you can feel the fit but it doesn't that's not
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:06.160]  enough yeah hmm yeah i don't know well we'll find out maybe with these they can just do the tips
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.880]  and they'll just go through thousands and thousands of tips a day i don't know i guess
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.480]  yeah i guess that's true that would be cheaper for sure i don't know we'll find out i'll file
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.040]  that away for future follow-up all right let me take another break here thank our third and final

[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:25.120]  name airpods pro i feel like that's sort of like oh you thought pro maybe wasn't applicable to the
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:34.640]  iphone hold our beer yeah it's a little odd isn't it you want to argue about about whether these are
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.240]  professional noise cancellation a pro feature like maybe it's it's like i've been saying for a while
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:47.200]  it's apple parlance for higher end yeah it really is and you know and sometimes it does mean
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.720]  professional the mac pro literally should not be purchased or even the iMac pro should not be
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:59.680]  purchased by anybody who doesn't really have a professional need for what it does above a non-pro
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.040]  mac uh although i do wonder how many people have bought iMac pros because they're space gray
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:12.640]  like i don't really need an i'm sure there are some but damn that keyboard you can get the
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.800]  keyboard though can't you yeah i think you can now but when they first came out you couldn't but it's
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:23.760]  no it's also a better looking iMac if you prefer space grade to regular right aluminum those are
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:31.280]  really pro macbook pros used to be really really pro but now you know time for the last three years
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.920]  yeah not so much they're just sort of like the regular macbooks and it's the macbook air that's
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.880]  different because it's like thinner and lighter that the only way to get a 15-inch laptop from
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:46.000]  apple is to get a macbook pro so if you want a bigger display which is a very good choice
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:53.200]  which is a very uh normal thing to desire right bigger displays are better and if you're you know
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:58.240]  willing to trade the extra weight and size in your backpack or whatever you carry it around in
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:07.440]  uh for a bigger display your only option is a macbook pro with airpods it just it i i don't
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  think there'll ever be a better example of apple using the word pro to mean higher end or deluxe or
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.920]  premium or plus or whatever you want to call it yeah it's funny i mean and they tried it
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:26.000]  well the addition was just like that was not that was not the same but yeah well there was
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.960]  no functionality difference well they still have addition they still call like the titanium and the
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.400]  ceramic ones edition right which is not a bad word i think the original i i think it's very
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.400]  cleverly used and i think now that the materials are like hundreds of dollars more expensive as
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:51.280]  opposed to 15 to 20 000 more expensive uh i think it works pretty well i've got the the titanium one
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.720]  i bought the uh the titanium yeah it's nice looking i mean yeah i like it uh i was gonna
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.200]  talk to renee about it last week because i know he got one too but uh i like it a lot of my short
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:09.280]  review of the titanium series 5 apple watch is that i like it a lot and i i can you lift your
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:15.760]  wrist what i didn't go to that event yeah uh it's heavier it's heavier though right no because i had
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.480]  stainless steel before oh okay i always had the my but i thought it was heavy i thought it was
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.440]  heavier than the stainless no no it's right okay it's almost exactly mathematically in between the
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.160]  weight of aluminum and stainless steel ones oh so i got i got it backwards yeah okay okay yeah
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:36.960]  titanium is lighter than steel um i wasn't at that event in september so i didn't see it and the first
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.840]  thing i was like oh how's that titanium look i texted to panzerino and he said it has a delorean
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.440]  look to it and i cannot put it better than that it's like it's just off the cusp me badgering him
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.160]  while he was in the hands-on area after the event uh that's exactly what it looks like has sort of
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.520]  an 80s brushed i mean it's funny because the delorean famously was made out of stainless steel
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:03.440]  um and this is made out of titanium in the state they do have stainless steel watches but they're
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:09.280]  polished not brushed um anyway i like it a lot i would like to get a silver one but i you know
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.120]  one that just looks silver but i don't feel like the aluminum silver looks good enough i think the
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.960]  black aluminum silver looks better and i'm not paying i'm not paying that much i mean because
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:24.080]  i'm gonna buy these probably every couple of years and i just i'm not gonna pay eight hundred
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.640]  dollars every two years to to get a watch when i you know i used to pay seventy dollars every
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:35.680]  two decades right so now you're calling me a dummy which i i have to admit i i feel like that's you
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:42.000]  know i don't buy i've i've had three apple watches i've bought all of the odd numbered ones that
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.560]  wasn't necessarily a strategic choice um it's just that series three was the first one that i felt
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:55.200]  was a compelling upgrade over my original yeah yeah well i got this i had the zero and then i
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.120]  got the three and then the five yeah i guess i did have the zero well the one is weird because
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:06.000]  the one came out with the two you know so what we call the zero is what i had um then i skipped
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.400]  i skipped a generation then i bought a three then i skipped the four and i just bought a five
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:18.800]  yeah that's what i'm doing yeah but um cheaper miss the other girl uh what else so the uh the
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.880]  apple tv plus shows you were gonna say came out and the reviews yeah many of the reviews are not
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:31.920]  great uh for for set for half of the shows anyway so the uh the ones that i saw mostly seemed to
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:39.680]  think that for all mankind and dickinson were pretty were pretty good yeah and then c and the
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:46.560]  morning show or not yeah although the av the av club was much more favorable to the morning show
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:52.800]  and gave it a b plus hmm yeah i saw the hollywood reporters review of the morning show and they
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.560]  they seemed to indicate it was a very interesting review i haven't linked to it yet but it was an
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.120]  interesting way to do a review where they talked about that if you know what to look for in a tv
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.720]  show you can see the seams and it's you know maybe a spot where the lighting is different because it
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.520]  was a shot they had to pick up a shot weeks later uh we were like we're missing a shot and they
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.440]  didn't get the lighting right or you pick up a shot where they call it adr i forget what it
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.920]  stands for but like where a line of dialogue is sort of adjusted after the fact because they have
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:27.600]  to explain a plot point or something like that and they suggested that there's an awful lot of seams
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:34.560]  in the first two episodes of the morning show and now is that seeing what they want to see because
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.440]  they're the hollywood reporter and they know the backstory the backstory is that the original
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:46.800]  showrunner uh of the show got forced out and a new one was brought in and it was already in
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:53.520]  production and it led to a messy legal fight with the the i don't know what guild it is but one of
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.760]  the you know whatever the the professional organization who media mediates such disputes
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:04.960]  over credits which is a huge deal in hollywood you know like i always say like once you know this
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.240]  you'll see it's usually a sign of a movie that is not going to be good is if the screenwriting credit
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:16.800]  has five names and and some of that's been passed around right well and some of them the thing to
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:22.000]  look for is some of the names are separated by the word a and d and some of them are separated
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  by ampersands in the same title card it's not a mistake it actually in the writer's guild of
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.520]  america there is i don't even know what it is i forget the difference like i think the ampersand
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:39.680]  is for like two people who work together work together and then and and and these other guys
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:47.600]  came in later and threw out their script and rewrote it or they threw out large enough portions
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:53.040]  that they got to put their name in i'm pretty sure ampersand ties you together and and is
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:59.360]  a separation of teams and the sign of a dispute of some sort um but i could be getting it backwards
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:04.160]  it doesn't matter but once you know that when you see an opening of a movie and there's a written by
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:09.600]  a screenplay by with four names some ampersand some get up and walk out yeah it's probably going
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:13.440]  to be messy but anyway there seemed like there was a lot that according to them there's a lot
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:19.360]  of that with the first two episodes of the morning show where it seems uneven and unsure of what what
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:25.040]  the vibe it's going for is so anyway i'm looking forward to that show anyway but that one i'm not
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.640]  i'm just not i was never interested in it's not the kind of thing that i generally watch
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:34.320]  i'm you know from the beginning i was interested in for all mankind and then i wasn't super
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:39.360]  impressed by the first trailer but then this later one i really liked and for some reason i
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:45.200]  didn't i mean i i for some reason i found dickinson very interesting
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:52.240]  and i don't know why i just thought it was weird looking yeah and thought yeah i'll try that too
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.680]  the i'll try all of them my wife is my wife is not a fan of period pieces and the further
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:02.960]  further back in time something goes the more likely she is to reject it before we even begin
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:08.560]  watching it so i feel like i feel like for all mankind is a definite maybe because the 60s aren't
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:14.720]  that long ago yeah whereas anything like like a sherlock holmes type thing like victorian
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.280]  forget it like she won't even she's she's just and she just she'll just purposely fall asleep
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.760]  yeah i should i showed it to karen and karen is a big into sewing her own clothes and um
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.040]  um and looked at the outfits and was just like and the music and thought she was she was right
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:37.200]  there so she's looking forward to that yeah uh do we know do we even know yet i like are they
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.880]  going to do a netflix and show them all at once or are they going to spit these out that's the
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:47.680]  yeah they're dropped all at once which some people said might have been a mistake but right
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:55.120]  you don't know i mean because i don't know that i guess the idea that you could retool after
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:01.520]  people have seen a couple of episodes but most of these things are shot well enough in advance that
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.400]  yeah it's not like it's not that easy to just go back like you know if you watch a season of
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:15.040]  television from you know that's a 20 episode run yes the tail end of that they haven't they haven't
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.360]  shot but they probably shot the first half and i think most of these are like 10 episodes or
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.840]  something right yeah i think 10 is sort of like the new standard season so these are all you know
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.720]  these would have been shot even if it was even if they were releasing every weekend between now and
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.960]  right you know january or whatever yeah i'm curious to see how the sign-up thing goes you
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:38.000]  know because i've bought a new iphone already so i should be getting a free year but i'm looking
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.320]  at that today i was thinking i haven't bought any fun anything i should maybe i should buy something
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.680]  uh yeah it'd be weird you know what they want me to think right yeah don't be an idiot don't
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:57.440]  be an idiot and spend five dollars a month to see these shows spend a thousand the apple tv is the
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:03.760]  cheapest thing just get another apple tv uh all right that's all i had on my agenda for the show
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:10.000]  anything else there's always more to talk about but yes it's no there's no use talking more about
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.120]  apple tv plus when five days from now i just i just hope the president goes to more baseball
