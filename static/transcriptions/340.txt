[00:00.000 --> 00:01.760]  Hey, welcome to the talk show.
[00:01.760 --> 00:05.000]  I have a very special episode with two first-time guests,
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.940]  two of the people who have started
[00:07.940 --> 00:09.640]  the new photo sharing site, Glass.
[00:09.640 --> 00:12.720]  I have Tom Watson and Daniel Agee.
[00:12.720 --> 00:15.040]  And before I get to them, I want to tell you
[00:15.040 --> 00:19.420]  about our first sponsors, our good friends at Squarespace.
[00:19.420 --> 00:22.440]  Hey, Squarespace is the all-in-one platform
[00:22.440 --> 00:24.860]  for building your brand and growing your business online.
[00:24.860 --> 00:26.760]  You can stand out with a beautiful website,
[00:26.760 --> 00:30.880]  engage with your audience, and sell anything, your products,
[00:30.880 --> 00:34.000]  the content you create, even your time,
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.160]  any sort of website that you need
[00:36.160 --> 00:37.480]  to represent yourself online.
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.440]  You can build with Squarespace, and they've
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.240]  got built-in features to support what you need to do.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.720]  They've even got member areas.
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.920]  They make it easy for creators to monetize
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.040]  their content and expertise in a way that fits their brand.
[00:50.040 --> 00:52.920]  And with these member areas, you can unlock new revenue streams
[00:52.920 --> 00:55.000]  for your business and free up time in your schedule
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.640]  by selling access to gated content,
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.920]  like exclusive videos, online courses, or newsletters,
[01:02.920 --> 01:05.640]  just to the people who pay to become members.
[01:05.640 --> 01:08.520]  They've got online stores that you can set up.
[01:08.520 --> 01:10.640]  Whether you sell physical or digital products,
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.680]  they can help you with everything
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.960]  you need to start selling online.
[01:14.960 --> 01:17.320]  Email campaigns, it's not just websites.
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.240]  You can stand out in any inbox with Squarespace's email
[01:20.240 --> 01:23.060]  campaigns, and you can collect email subscribers
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.880]  and convert them into loyal customers.
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.620]  You can start with an email template,
[01:27.620 --> 01:29.200]  customize it as much as you want,
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.600]  just like you can with Squarespace websites.
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.300]  It's just as easy to get a really beautiful newsletter
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.820]  going as it is to build a website.
[01:37.820 --> 01:40.560]  Head to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:40.560 --> 01:44.180]  You get a 30-day free trial for all of the features, no limits.
[01:44.180 --> 01:46.760]  And when you're ready to launch after your 30-day free trial
[01:46.760 --> 01:48.720]  is offered, just remember that offer code,
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.760]  just plain talk show, all one word.
[01:51.760 --> 01:54.760]  And with that code, squarespace.com slash talk show,
[01:54.760 --> 01:56.600]  you'll save 10% off your first purchase,
[01:56.600 --> 01:59.280]  even if you prepay for an entire year.
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.280]  Now onto the show with welcome Tom Watson and Daniel Agee.
[02:04.480 --> 02:05.320]  Say hello.
[02:07.120 --> 02:08.640]  Great to be here.
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.540]  Nice to, I was listening to your intro and thinking,
[02:12.540 --> 02:14.520]  man, I guess we need to get on Squarespace.
[02:14.520 --> 02:16.860]  That's something we need to do apparently.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.880]  So you just have so much enthusiasm for it.
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.020]  We need member areas, yeah.
[02:22.020 --> 02:24.880]  All right, for those who don't know,
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.540]  I linked to Glass back in August when you guys launched.
[02:29.540 --> 02:31.040]  I believe that's, I think that's right
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.960]  when you launched publicly, but tell people what,
[02:34.960 --> 02:36.920]  and the website, let's just get it out of the way
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.120]  for people who are curious and want to start looking at it
[02:39.120 --> 02:42.420]  as we talk, is at glass.photo,
[02:42.420 --> 02:45.520]  which is one of the coolest ways
[02:45.520 --> 02:49.820]  of using these new modern TLDs for domains.
[02:49.820 --> 02:51.420]  Pretty good URL.
[02:51.420 --> 02:52.940]  Tell people what Glass is.
[02:52.940 --> 02:54.000]  I'll start, why not?
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.400]  So Glass is a photo sharing app for photography enthusiasts.
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.520]  It's simple, it's great, it's straightforward,
[03:00.520 --> 03:02.520]  and it's a member-driven community.
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.920]  So instead of people signing up for a product
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.400]  and just becoming the product through whatever means,
[03:10.400 --> 03:12.720]  ads, whatnot, you just sign up,
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.480]  you have a monthly membership fee,
[03:15.480 --> 03:18.000]  and you get to be part of a wonderful photography community.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.280]  It's pretty straightforward.
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.040]  It seems novel in 2022,
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.160]  but to us it seems very obvious and straightforward.
[03:26.160 --> 03:28.000]  I don't think there's much more to it than that.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.040]  Daniel, maybe you have a fancier marketing spin on that one,
[03:31.040 --> 03:33.260]  but I think it's really as simple as that.
[03:33.260 --> 03:35.280]  Do you remember Flickr back in the day?
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.440]  What if you paid for it?
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.320]  It didn't get sold to Yahoo,
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.280]  and there were users actively using it
[03:42.280 --> 03:45.240]  and a team behind it actively developing it,
[03:45.240 --> 03:47.880]  and increasing its use.
[03:47.880 --> 03:50.440]  Like, the features are coming out every month
[03:50.440 --> 03:52.960]  instead of every three years,
[03:52.960 --> 03:55.600]  and we don't track anything at all.
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.480]  As the head of marketing for Glass,
[03:57.480 --> 03:59.240]  that makes my job very hard.
[03:59.240 --> 04:02.640]  I hate it, but it's how things should be.
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.040]  It's not a novel concept to just pay money for a service.
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.600]  And yet here we are, 2022, paying for a service.
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.600]  I know this sounds, it almost sounds trite
[04:15.880 --> 04:20.160]  to describe Glass even more basically,
[04:20.160 --> 04:24.700]  but I think it's important and fascinating to me, right?
[04:24.700 --> 04:27.660]  Like, if you have a Glass account, like I do,
[04:27.660 --> 04:32.660]  at Gruber on Glass, and when I decide to add a photo,
[04:33.200 --> 04:35.320]  I just pick a photo, I post a photo,
[04:35.320 --> 04:39.400]  I can write like the first caption to describe what it is,
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.320]  and then I post it, and then for people who have chosen
[04:43.320 --> 04:46.760]  other fellow Glass users who have chosen to follow me,
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.760]  they get on their first tab of their Glass app,
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.120]  they get a chronological feed of the photos
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.120]  posted by the people whom they choose to follow.
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.440]  And there are other features,
[05:02.440 --> 05:05.080]  but at a very high level, that's it, right?
[05:05.080 --> 05:06.720]  What's gonna pop into people's minds
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.040]  when I describe that, they're gonna say,
[05:08.040 --> 05:11.040]  that sounds like the original Instagram.
[05:11.040 --> 05:13.960]  Like, Instagram, it's the elephant in the room
[05:13.960 --> 05:15.640]  when we talk about Glass, like,
[05:15.640 --> 05:19.000]  you can't not talk about Instagram,
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.720]  or at least Instagram of 2011.
[05:22.720 --> 05:25.720]  Yeah, I mean, we can talk at length about it.
[05:25.720 --> 05:28.160]  Daniel would love to talk about Instagram more.
[05:28.160 --> 05:33.160]  I mean, I think we, you know, when I set out to do Glass,
[05:33.160 --> 05:38.120]  and I've been talking to Daniel about Glass since 2013,
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.520]  is that right, Daniel?
[05:39.520 --> 05:40.360]  I'm trying to like-
[05:40.360 --> 05:42.720]  Yeah, it's been almost nine years this April.
[05:43.560 --> 05:48.480]  Yeah, and I was working at Facebook when we bought Glass,
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.200]  when I was there, we Facebook bought Glass,
[05:51.200 --> 05:52.480]  or not Glass, sorry, Instagram.
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.880]  Wow, that was just terrible.
[05:53.880 --> 05:54.960]  Yeah, when they bought Instagram,
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.000]  because that would be a terrible thing.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.640]  I do not want to get bought by anyone,
[05:57.640 --> 05:59.000]  that's to be clear, that's,
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.440]  but I was watching that and thinking,
[06:00.440 --> 06:02.600]  wow, I remember what happened with Flickr,
[06:02.600 --> 06:07.560]  and what would become, like, what Instagram would become,
[06:07.560 --> 06:10.160]  and I just, I didn't want to see that happen.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.400]  But it was inevitable, so I was like,
[06:11.400 --> 06:12.640]  well, how do we make something else?
[06:12.640 --> 06:13.640]  What could be done?
[06:13.640 --> 06:16.120]  And so I, in 2013, I started, you know,
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.560]  I'm a product designer by trade,
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.600]  and so I was like, I started making mocks and comps
[06:21.600 --> 06:24.880]  of different ways to, to like,
[06:24.880 --> 06:26.200]  do something really interesting,
[06:26.200 --> 06:28.080]  and inevitably things take time,
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.280]  and I didn't really get around to it,
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.480]  didn't have the right co-founder,
[06:30.480 --> 06:33.520]  until I found Staphon, who's not on this,
[06:33.520 --> 06:35.680]  but he's our, the engineering co-founder
[06:35.680 --> 06:37.920]  does all the backend work for Glass,
[06:37.920 --> 06:40.480]  and it just, he was excited about it,
[06:40.480 --> 06:42.640]  and Daniel obviously wanted to get involved,
[06:42.640 --> 06:44.640]  but as like, head of marketing community,
[06:44.640 --> 06:46.400]  we needed to build the thing first,
[06:47.400 --> 06:49.360]  and you know, it just kind of spiraled from there.
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.040]  And yeah, sure, there's Instagram,
[06:51.040 --> 06:53.240]  and it's a whole thing, but maybe, yeah,
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.560]  I guess what you're saying, John,
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.520]  when you were talking about it is that,
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.800]  Instagram of 2011, 2012, and yes,
[06:58.800 --> 07:00.720]  there's definitely some interest there,
[07:00.720 --> 07:03.360]  but there's like the community that we want to create,
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.360]  and that's like Flickr, circa 2007, eight, maybe,
[07:10.720 --> 07:12.840]  where we felt like those were really a golden age
[07:12.840 --> 07:14.520]  of like photographers coming together,
[07:14.520 --> 07:17.840]  and really being like positive towards each other
[07:17.840 --> 07:19.120]  in their work online,
[07:19.120 --> 07:22.360]  and we felt like we needed to do a different model with it,
[07:22.360 --> 07:26.360]  and that model had to be not taking on venture capital,
[07:26.360 --> 07:27.700]  not trying to go to the moon,
[07:27.700 --> 07:30.440]  but really just building an indie product
[07:30.440 --> 07:33.440]  that is focused on this one community,
[07:33.440 --> 07:35.360]  and to build it as big as we can
[07:35.360 --> 07:37.640]  to support the efforts that we want to do.
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.120]  Yeah, photographers have had
[07:40.120 --> 07:42.200]  a pretty raw deal on the internet.
[07:42.200 --> 07:44.560]  Multiple times they have been
[07:44.560 --> 07:47.960]  the driving creative factor behind a platform,
[07:47.960 --> 07:51.600]  and then they scale that platform because of their work,
[07:51.600 --> 07:54.720]  and then that platform pivots to video,
[07:54.720 --> 07:57.760]  or to full-screen video, or to become a shopping app,
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.520]  or to track every single thing you do across the internet,
[08:01.520 --> 08:03.200]  or to give teens eating disorders,
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.920]  or to, that's not what photographers want,
[08:05.920 --> 08:08.400]  that's not what users want, that's not what people want.
[08:08.400 --> 08:10.560]  Like we just want to be able to connect
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.260]  with people we care about,
[08:12.260 --> 08:14.800]  and whose work inspires us on the internet,
[08:14.800 --> 08:17.620]  and that shouldn't be this hard in 2022.
[08:17.620 --> 08:22.620]  The path for Instagram, from what it originally was,
[08:24.940 --> 08:27.620]  which was a lot like the description of Glass Today,
[08:27.620 --> 08:30.500]  where you just, you as a user pick photos,
[08:30.500 --> 08:32.620]  still photos to share,
[08:32.620 --> 08:34.700]  and the people who choose to follow you
[08:34.700 --> 08:36.460]  see them in chronological order,
[08:36.460 --> 08:39.240]  and you yourself see in your feed
[08:39.240 --> 08:41.700]  the photos in chronological order
[08:41.700 --> 08:44.220]  of the people you chose to follow.
[08:44.220 --> 08:49.040]  The path from there to what Instagram is today,
[08:49.040 --> 08:54.040]  or even within just a few years of what it became,
[08:55.940 --> 08:58.260]  I've been critical, I think I'm pretty well known
[08:58.260 --> 09:01.460]  at this time as a pretty vocal critic of Facebook
[09:01.460 --> 09:02.820]  for a lot of reasons.
[09:02.820 --> 09:04.940]  Just a little bit, John, just a tiny bit.
[09:04.940 --> 09:07.860]  But I'm gonna try to be a little diplomatic here,
[09:07.860 --> 09:10.860]  because in some ways I'm almost sympathetic
[09:10.860 --> 09:15.860]  to, not necessarily, I'm not gonna quite say inevitable,
[09:16.740 --> 09:18.100]  because there's always choices,
[09:18.100 --> 09:19.680]  and that's too much of an excuse.
[09:19.680 --> 09:24.460]  But given that Instagram was VC-driven,
[09:24.460 --> 09:29.460]  and had raised money, and then chose to sell to Facebook,
[09:29.780 --> 09:32.780]  which famously, I forget exactly what year they sold,
[09:32.780 --> 09:35.740]  was it 2013, or thereabouts?
[09:35.740 --> 09:36.700]  It was 2012.
[09:36.700 --> 09:37.540]  2012.
[09:37.540 --> 09:38.360]  It's 2012.
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.360]  Which was, in hindsight, very early in Instagram's life,
[09:44.020 --> 09:46.180]  overall, but they grew quickly,
[09:46.180 --> 09:48.220]  they sold for a billion dollars,
[09:48.220 --> 09:53.220]  and it's almost like the Dr. Evil joke in Austin Powers,
[09:54.860 --> 09:59.580]  where Dr. Evil, who's been frozen for 30 years,
[09:59.580 --> 10:04.580]  comes up with a mastermind plan to take over the world,
[10:04.620 --> 10:06.420]  and tells the leaders of the world
[10:06.420 --> 10:09.620]  that he wants one million dollars,
[10:09.620 --> 10:11.980]  and everybody laughs, and he's, what?
[10:11.980 --> 10:13.700]  And his henchmen have to tell him
[10:13.700 --> 10:16.620]  that that's just not that much money anymore.
[10:16.620 --> 10:20.940]  Because it was, like the consensus was,
[10:20.940 --> 10:25.300]  an awful lot of pundits looked at Facebook buying Instagram
[10:25.300 --> 10:29.700]  for one billion dollars as the height of folly,
[10:29.700 --> 10:32.860]  and in hindsight, now, it is seen as
[10:32.860 --> 10:37.220]  one of the great acquisition bargains of all time, right?
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.660]  Like, whatever Instagram.
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.620]  It ranks right up there with YouTube.
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.700]  Yeah, it's right up there with YouTube.
[10:41.700 --> 10:44.500]  YouTube, or Apple buying Next,
[10:44.500 --> 10:47.180]  which is different, because it was more of a cult.
[10:47.180 --> 10:48.020]  Absolutely.
[10:48.020 --> 10:50.980]  It's up there as a famously prescient acquisition.
[10:50.980 --> 10:53.740]  When they bought WhatsApp a few years later,
[10:53.740 --> 10:55.660]  I think it was 50 billion dollars,
[10:55.660 --> 10:59.420]  and I don't know if WhatsApp is worth more than Instagram,
[10:59.420 --> 11:02.220]  but it certainly isn't worth 50 times more,
[11:02.220 --> 11:05.740]  and it just shows, it's just the changing times.
[11:05.740 --> 11:07.700]  But these are crazy numbers, right?
[11:07.700 --> 11:11.380]  Like, I'm not, as a normal person,
[11:11.380 --> 11:14.140]  I just don't even get 50 billion dollars.
[11:14.140 --> 11:15.500]  It's mind-boggling.
[11:15.500 --> 11:18.580]  You just lose track of how much money that is.
[11:18.580 --> 11:22.180]  But given it, to me, it's almost inevitable
[11:22.180 --> 11:24.700]  that given the sums of money that are involved,
[11:24.700 --> 11:28.020]  and the intentions that Facebook might have had,
[11:28.020 --> 11:30.700]  even if, in some alternate universe,
[11:30.700 --> 11:33.180]  Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars,
[11:33.180 --> 11:37.740]  and in the subsequent years had guided it
[11:37.740 --> 11:41.780]  in a way that, for lack of a better focus group,
[11:41.780 --> 11:44.940]  the three of us would have found more appealing,
[11:44.940 --> 11:47.740]  it still would have gone somewhat in this direction.
[11:47.740 --> 11:50.620]  I think it was inevitable for Facebook to steer it
[11:50.620 --> 11:55.620]  in a way where engagement was a higher priority
[11:55.620 --> 12:00.620]  than other positive descriptions of Instagram, of yours.
[12:02.140 --> 12:04.860]  Do you agree or disagree?
[12:04.860 --> 12:06.380]  I agree in a lot of ways.
[12:06.380 --> 12:10.500]  I think Facebook's focus is entirely on growth.
[12:10.500 --> 12:11.620]  Like, it needs to grow.
[12:11.620 --> 12:13.780]  It's all about, it's venture capital,
[12:13.780 --> 12:16.500]  growth at all costs, expansion.
[12:16.500 --> 12:18.500]  That's like, incredibly important
[12:18.500 --> 12:20.620]  to its business and its model,
[12:20.620 --> 12:23.420]  and that's why it's focused on,
[12:23.420 --> 12:25.820]  it's shifting its, every product decision
[12:25.820 --> 12:28.220]  gets focused through that lens,
[12:28.220 --> 12:29.700]  and that involves engagement.
[12:29.700 --> 12:32.980]  Right now, it's focused heavily on YouTube and TikTok,
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.300]  because that's where the growth is,
[12:34.300 --> 12:36.660]  and it sees those as competitors,
[12:36.660 --> 12:39.660]  and so they need to focus their efforts on that,
[12:39.660 --> 12:41.460]  and not necessarily on the photographers
[12:41.460 --> 12:43.980]  that started it, for example.
[12:43.980 --> 12:47.740]  That's not a critical group anymore.
[12:47.740 --> 12:51.100]  I mean, the photos are great, and they want to share them,
[12:51.100 --> 12:54.540]  but now video is more engaging, and TikTok's algorithms
[12:54.540 --> 12:58.580]  are more engaging, and so they need to focus that direction.
[12:58.580 --> 13:03.100]  Like with Glass, we needed to focus on a different direction,
[13:03.100 --> 13:05.980]  which just so happened to be a neglected group of people,
[13:05.980 --> 13:08.860]  and they're very unhappy with Instagram, which is great.
[13:08.860 --> 13:10.660]  It's great for us, because there's an audience
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.020]  that wants to come check us out and see what we're up to,
[13:14.020 --> 13:15.540]  but, you know, I think that's where the lens is.
[13:15.540 --> 13:17.300]  I mean, Daniel, wouldn't you agree?
[13:17.300 --> 13:23.460]  Yeah, sure. I think I feel bad talking about Instagram
[13:23.460 --> 13:25.340]  in this way, when what we're really talking about
[13:25.340 --> 13:28.940]  is how we funded this version of the internet, right?
[13:28.940 --> 13:32.980]  Like, the wonderful, beautiful internet
[13:32.980 --> 13:34.300]  doesn't really exist anymore,
[13:34.300 --> 13:37.380]  and when it does, it's hard to come by, right?
[13:37.380 --> 13:39.820]  Like, it's hard to find a newsletter,
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.820]  and, you know, you can track it back to Google killing
[13:42.820 --> 13:45.380]  Google Reader, you can track it back to Facebook,
[13:45.380 --> 13:52.340]  you know, harvesting data, lying to newsrooms,
[13:52.340 --> 13:54.940]  and having, you know, like, inflating their video numbers
[13:54.940 --> 13:58.580]  so everyone pivoted to a thing that didn't exist,
[13:58.580 --> 14:00.420]  and, you know, we had mass layoffs.
[14:00.420 --> 14:02.540]  You can point it to Sinclair
[14:02.540 --> 14:05.940]  buying up, you know, every single newspaper
[14:05.940 --> 14:08.780]  and TV station in America, right?
[14:08.780 --> 14:10.580]  Like, there are so many decisions
[14:10.580 --> 14:11.780]  that were made along the way
[14:11.780 --> 14:14.740]  that has made funding something on the internet
[14:14.740 --> 14:16.180]  pretty terrible, right?
[14:16.180 --> 14:20.540]  Like, it requires you selling a big piece of your company
[14:20.540 --> 14:22.620]  to people that just want you to grow, grow, grow,
[14:22.620 --> 14:24.220]  want your data so they can sell it
[14:24.220 --> 14:25.740]  to their other investments, right?
[14:25.740 --> 14:30.540]  Like, the onslaught of information
[14:30.540 --> 14:32.940]  on how to build a company for a founder
[14:32.940 --> 14:35.540]  is pretty dire right now, right?
[14:35.540 --> 14:37.620]  And, like, the people that you are building for
[14:37.620 --> 14:38.940]  end up being your investors
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.820]  and not the people who use your product,
[14:40.820 --> 14:42.940]  not your members, not your community,
[14:42.940 --> 14:48.540]  and you just lose so much soul and joy
[14:48.540 --> 14:50.540]  on what the internet used to be.
[14:50.540 --> 14:53.340]  And, like, I feel like the, you know,
[14:53.340 --> 14:55.740]  like the Simpsons' old man yells at Cloud
[14:55.740 --> 14:58.940]  in, you know, my mid, early 30s.
[14:58.940 --> 15:02.940]  But, like, God, I miss the old internet so much.
[15:02.940 --> 15:06.140]  And so far, the only places that I've seen it
[15:06.140 --> 15:10.540]  easily replicated is in paid communities
[15:10.540 --> 15:13.340]  because when you're paying to be a part of something,
[15:13.340 --> 15:14.540]  you care more, right?
[15:14.540 --> 15:18.140]  Like, we've been around just over six months now.
[15:18.140 --> 15:21.340]  We launched in the middle of August,
[15:21.340 --> 15:23.140]  so we're at six and a half months.
[15:23.140 --> 15:24.340]  In that six and a half months,
[15:24.340 --> 15:27.540]  we have had to remove three spam accounts
[15:27.540 --> 15:33.340]  and one abusive comment on Glass, right?
[15:33.340 --> 15:36.740]  Like, we have thousands and thousands of users.
[15:36.740 --> 15:38.540]  We have thousands and thousands of posts.
[15:38.540 --> 15:40.740]  We have tens of thousands of comments,
[15:40.740 --> 15:42.940]  and we've had to remove a handful.
[15:42.940 --> 15:45.540]  Like, I can still count on both hands
[15:45.540 --> 15:48.940]  how many posts or comments we've had to remove.
[15:48.940 --> 15:50.940]  And, like, that's huge.
[15:50.940 --> 15:55.940]  That is, like, such a mind-boggling number to me
[15:55.940 --> 15:57.740]  that it has stayed this small.
[15:57.740 --> 15:59.540]  And it's because we have things like
[15:59.540 --> 16:00.740]  a community code of conduct.
[16:00.740 --> 16:04.540]  We have, you know, a very direct,
[16:04.540 --> 16:10.140]  no hate speech and no white supremacy on the platform.
[16:10.140 --> 16:12.140]  We have a paid service.
[16:12.140 --> 16:15.140]  We use Apple ID only, so that means it's your name.
[16:15.140 --> 16:17.140]  And, like, if you get banned,
[16:17.140 --> 16:19.140]  you can't just go create another Apple ID
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.540]  that's tied to your name and come on in.
[16:21.540 --> 16:24.140]  And, like, those things matter.
[16:24.140 --> 16:25.540]  Whew! It just pays off.
[16:25.540 --> 16:27.140]  And so, like, there's, you know, like,
[16:27.140 --> 16:29.540]  you find joy like that when you're subscribing
[16:29.540 --> 16:31.140]  to certain people's sub stacks.
[16:31.140 --> 16:33.140]  And, you know, you can find a community
[16:33.140 --> 16:37.140]  in the discussion threads that people write on sub stack.
[16:37.140 --> 16:39.140]  You can find it in weird little newsletters,
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.140]  weird little internet.
[16:40.140 --> 16:44.140]  But, like, it's so hard to find that sense of joy
[16:44.140 --> 16:48.140]  because engagement algorithms are fueled by the opposite, right?
[16:48.140 --> 16:53.140]  They're fueled by anger and rage and otherism and racism.
[16:53.140 --> 16:56.140]  And then we just end up here.
[16:56.140 --> 16:59.140]  God, that's sad.
[16:59.140 --> 17:03.140]  One of my obsessions with everything is,
[17:03.140 --> 17:05.140]  and it's been this way,
[17:05.140 --> 17:07.140]  it's just the way my brain is wired,
[17:07.140 --> 17:11.140]  but I've always been sort of obsessed with form,
[17:11.140 --> 17:13.140]  especially of, like, media.
[17:13.140 --> 17:17.140]  And I think it's easy to get lost
[17:17.140 --> 17:21.140]  and you just sort of stop thinking about it
[17:21.140 --> 17:23.140]  because you get used to it.
[17:23.140 --> 17:25.140]  And it's one of those many ways
[17:25.140 --> 17:27.140]  that the whole internet getting worse
[17:27.140 --> 17:29.140]  has been a slow-boiling frog thing,
[17:29.140 --> 17:31.140]  and now we're all just like,
[17:31.140 --> 17:34.140]  well, it's fine that we're sitting in boiling water.
[17:34.140 --> 17:38.140]  But it's a fundamental difference with,
[17:38.140 --> 17:41.140]  and people complain endlessly about,
[17:41.140 --> 17:43.140]  certainly Instagram, Twitter,
[17:43.140 --> 17:47.140]  just about anything going away from chronological feeds
[17:47.140 --> 17:52.140]  to algorithm-generated feeds.
[17:52.140 --> 17:55.140]  And it's like people say that,
[17:55.140 --> 17:57.140]  and you know what they mean,
[17:57.140 --> 18:00.140]  and it's just sort of, it comes across as sort of,
[18:00.140 --> 18:02.140]  well, wah-wah, you're old.
[18:02.140 --> 18:04.140]  If you're talking about chronological feeds,
[18:04.140 --> 18:06.140]  you're old and you're complaining about a world
[18:06.140 --> 18:08.140]  that's passed us by.
[18:08.140 --> 18:10.140]  But if you stop and pause and think about it,
[18:10.140 --> 18:13.140]  to me, as an experience,
[18:13.140 --> 18:16.140]  thinking about it as a person who's used these things,
[18:16.140 --> 18:18.140]  the experience of using something
[18:18.140 --> 18:22.140]  with a chronological feed versus an infinite feed
[18:22.140 --> 18:27.140]  generated by algorithms is way more profound
[18:27.140 --> 18:32.140]  than you would think given how much people talk about it,
[18:32.140 --> 18:35.140]  because to me, the defining characteristic
[18:35.140 --> 18:37.140]  of a chronological feed
[18:37.140 --> 18:42.140]  for something like a photo-sharing site like Glass is now,
[18:42.140 --> 18:45.140]  and I think about Instagram all the time
[18:45.140 --> 18:47.140]  while I'm using Glass for this reason,
[18:47.140 --> 18:50.140]  which is that I think, hey, let me check Glass today,
[18:50.140 --> 18:53.140]  and I open the app, and I go to my feed,
[18:53.140 --> 18:56.140]  and new photos come in, and I start looking at them,
[18:56.140 --> 18:59.140]  and I scroll down, and I don't follow,
[18:59.140 --> 19:01.140]  I don't know, I'm not quite sure how many people I follow,
[19:01.140 --> 19:03.140]  but it's probably a few dozen.
[19:03.140 --> 19:05.140]  It's not many.
[19:05.140 --> 19:08.140]  And then, you know, within a very short amount of time,
[19:08.140 --> 19:12.140]  I get to one from yesterday or the day before,
[19:12.140 --> 19:14.140]  a photo that I had seen before,
[19:14.140 --> 19:16.140]  and as soon as I recognize it,
[19:16.140 --> 19:19.140]  oh, I've seen that one from so-and-so,
[19:19.140 --> 19:24.140]  then I know with certainty I'm caught up.
[19:24.140 --> 19:28.140]  That's it, I'm done, and I can leave Glass
[19:28.140 --> 19:31.140]  and wait to come back in a day or two
[19:31.140 --> 19:34.140]  when I'm interested in knowing if there's no photos,
[19:34.140 --> 19:38.140]  and my mind is, it's that,
[19:38.140 --> 19:43.140]  like that feeling of checking an item off a checklist, right?
[19:43.140 --> 19:46.140]  Like, it's satisfying to so many people, right?
[19:46.140 --> 19:48.140]  Even if you've got four errands to run,
[19:48.140 --> 19:51.140]  I find it so satisfying to write them down,
[19:51.140 --> 19:54.140]  one, two, three, four, and go out,
[19:54.140 --> 19:56.140]  and as I'm doing them, cross them off,
[19:56.140 --> 19:59.140]  and it's like, with an infinite feed,
[19:59.140 --> 20:03.140]  you never catch up, and I think it's like
[20:03.140 --> 20:07.140]  the human mind is just not hooked up to deal with that.
[20:07.140 --> 20:11.140]  It is a very strange thing that you now never get
[20:11.140 --> 20:14.140]  to the end of your Instagram or Twitter feed.
[20:14.140 --> 20:16.140]  There's never an end.
[20:16.140 --> 20:19.140]  No matter how far you scroll, more things load,
[20:19.140 --> 20:24.140]  and I honestly think that the infinite scroll
[20:24.140 --> 20:29.140]  is more pernicious to the human psyche
[20:29.140 --> 20:32.140]  than we talk about.
[20:32.140 --> 20:33.140]  I'm curious what you guys think about that.
[20:33.140 --> 20:35.140]  Right, how do you feel?
[20:35.140 --> 20:37.140]  Well, I mean, going back to opening up
[20:37.140 --> 20:39.140]  Glass versus Instagram, right?
[20:39.140 --> 20:42.140]  How do you feel when you're doing it?
[20:42.140 --> 20:45.140]  One of the things that Tom spent a lot of time on
[20:45.140 --> 20:47.140]  was the main feed design.
[20:47.140 --> 20:49.140]  We don't have any names.
[20:49.140 --> 20:51.140]  Everything's hidden behind gestures.
[20:51.140 --> 20:54.140]  You have to tap in to see more information and to comment.
[20:54.140 --> 20:58.140]  You have to tap in to use our version of a like button.
[20:58.140 --> 21:02.140]  So to use the product, you have to be a little bit
[21:02.140 --> 21:04.140]  more intentional than you normally would
[21:04.140 --> 21:06.140]  when you're just scrolling, double tapping, scrolling,
[21:06.140 --> 21:10.140]  double tapping, scrolling forever until you're dead.
[21:10.140 --> 21:12.140]  So how does that feel for you?
[21:12.140 --> 21:14.140]  How does your brain feel as you're checking off that list
[21:14.140 --> 21:17.140]  and like in the actual activity, right?
[21:17.140 --> 21:18.140]  Because that's a big thing.
[21:18.140 --> 21:20.140]  How you feel when you're using Glass
[21:20.140 --> 21:24.140]  is so notably, for me, calmer, right?
[21:24.140 --> 21:27.140]  Like it's calmer, it feels better.
[21:27.140 --> 21:29.140]  It doesn't feel like your brain is on fire
[21:29.140 --> 21:31.140]  like opening up Twitter or Instagram does.
[21:31.140 --> 21:36.140]  There's just like, God, just nice things looking at you, right?
[21:36.140 --> 21:38.140]  Like I'm not trying to be sold a linen jacket
[21:38.140 --> 21:42.140]  or a piece of furniture or some faceless thing
[21:42.140 --> 21:44.140]  coming from an Amazon store.
[21:44.140 --> 21:47.140]  I'm just enjoying a photo.
[21:47.140 --> 21:49.140]  Tom?
[21:49.140 --> 21:51.140]  Yeah, I mean, I was gonna jump in and say,
[21:51.140 --> 21:52.140]  I mean, there's a lot to that.
[21:52.140 --> 21:55.140]  I mean, the chronological feed,
[21:55.140 --> 21:58.140]  I was at Facebook when, it's funny,
[21:58.140 --> 22:00.140]  Adam Mosseri, who's now the head of Instagram,
[22:00.140 --> 22:05.140]  was working on the, it was called Most Recent
[22:05.140 --> 22:08.140]  and Picked For You, I believe is what it was.
[22:08.140 --> 22:09.140]  And there was a switch between it
[22:09.140 --> 22:12.140]  and like designed to tie yourself in knots
[22:12.140 --> 22:17.140]  to try to like have the default be the algorithmic feed
[22:17.140 --> 22:19.140]  but still allow people to get to that chronological feed.
[22:19.140 --> 22:22.140]  The issue is it's just less engaging.
[22:22.140 --> 22:24.140]  And the nice part about having a different set
[22:24.140 --> 22:28.140]  of priorities for Glass is that we don't have
[22:28.140 --> 22:31.140]  to have you always on it hooked
[22:31.140 --> 22:35.140]  and constantly coming back to this infinite feed,
[22:35.140 --> 22:37.140]  but we just want you to feel good.
[22:37.140 --> 22:41.140]  We want you to, it's not about getting eyes for advertisers.
[22:41.140 --> 22:44.140]  It's about making you feel good about the product
[22:44.140 --> 22:47.140]  and then listening to our customers and our members
[22:47.140 --> 22:50.140]  and then doing and building a better product for them.
[22:50.140 --> 22:52.140]  And it took a long time to get to this point
[22:52.140 --> 22:55.140]  because we launched six months ago,
[22:55.140 --> 22:58.140]  but we've been working on Glass since 2019.
[22:58.140 --> 22:59.140]  It was the end of 2019.
[22:59.140 --> 23:02.140]  It's almost, I almost want to call it like a pandemic app
[23:02.140 --> 23:05.140]  because we started in kind of more in earnest
[23:05.140 --> 23:08.140]  as the pandemic happened, but we've just been working on it.
[23:08.140 --> 23:10.140]  You know, it was nights and weekends and on the side
[23:10.140 --> 23:12.140]  until we could really get it to this point.
[23:12.140 --> 23:15.140]  And it just, it gives us that freedom to do these things
[23:15.140 --> 23:18.140]  and to have a different set of priorities.
[23:18.140 --> 23:21.140]  And it lets us prioritize things like the algorithmic feed.
[23:21.140 --> 23:23.140]  It lets us prioritize your photos,
[23:23.140 --> 23:26.140]  like higher resolution, better quality photos
[23:26.140 --> 23:28.140]  because we have the membership.
[23:28.140 --> 23:31.140]  Like we can have a feed that's calm like that
[23:31.140 --> 23:35.140]  and we can, you know, so much of, I think a member posted
[23:35.140 --> 23:40.140]  on Twitter, like a comparison between the Instagram photo
[23:40.140 --> 23:43.140]  and then a Glass, what it looks like on Glass.
[23:43.140 --> 23:45.140]  And I commented like, oh, well, there's not,
[23:45.140 --> 23:47.140]  there's not room for all these engaging buttons, you know,
[23:47.140 --> 23:49.140]  and they need those buttons and they need the light counts.
[23:49.140 --> 23:53.140]  They need all that stuff in order to keep the system going.
[23:53.140 --> 23:56.140]  I've worked on these platforms for many years.
[23:56.140 --> 24:00.140]  After Facebook, I went to Pinterest and you know,
[24:00.140 --> 24:03.140]  it's, you see these, I know that the tension is there.
[24:03.140 --> 24:05.140]  I mean, people want to make great products
[24:05.140 --> 24:06.140]  with these companies.
[24:06.140 --> 24:08.140]  It's not that, it's just the way the model works
[24:08.140 --> 24:10.140]  and the way the business works,
[24:10.140 --> 24:11.140]  that you need to have those things.
[24:11.140 --> 24:13.140]  And so trying something with a different business model
[24:13.140 --> 24:15.140]  allows us the freedom to do these things,
[24:15.140 --> 24:17.140]  which have a different set of priorities.
[24:20.140 --> 24:24.140]  If, just to go back to the infinite feed, right?
[24:24.140 --> 24:28.140]  And in traditional media, if it's print,
[24:28.140 --> 24:30.140]  it's impossible, right?
[24:30.140 --> 24:32.140]  It's literally physically impossible
[24:32.140 --> 24:35.140]  to buy a magazine that never ends, right?
[24:35.140 --> 24:37.140]  So if you, let's say you're hopping on a train
[24:37.140 --> 24:40.140]  to take a 90 minute ride from Philly to New York
[24:40.140 --> 24:44.140]  and I buy a magazine for the trip,
[24:44.140 --> 24:47.140]  it's, I can flip through the magazine
[24:47.140 --> 24:49.140]  and as I flip through page by page,
[24:49.140 --> 24:52.140]  I spot articles I might want to read
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.140]  and maybe ads that I want to look at as I flip through
[24:56.140 --> 24:58.140]  and then I get to the end of the magazine
[24:58.140 --> 25:00.140]  and I know with certainty I'm done
[25:00.140 --> 25:05.140]  and I can throw the magazine away and that's it.
[25:05.140 --> 25:09.140]  TV was sort of the first infinite feed, especially cable.
[25:09.140 --> 25:12.140]  Like, and it's like, we can talk about the way
[25:12.140 --> 25:14.140]  that at least when I was young,
[25:14.140 --> 25:17.140]  you know, how odd it sounds in hindsight
[25:17.140 --> 25:20.140]  that we only, you know, most people only had like
[25:20.140 --> 25:25.140]  10 channels and they would like sign off at one in the morning
[25:25.140 --> 25:27.140]  and play the national anthem
[25:27.140 --> 25:29.140]  and then they'd just broadcast static
[25:29.140 --> 25:31.140]  until they started up with the local news
[25:31.140 --> 25:34.140]  at six in the morning or something like that.
[25:34.140 --> 25:37.140]  But cable runs 24 hours a day
[25:37.140 --> 25:40.140]  and when you know, when you think about the fact
[25:40.140 --> 25:44.140]  that what they really want after you've watched
[25:44.140 --> 25:48.140]  some show on CNN or, you know, any channel
[25:48.140 --> 25:53.140]  at eight o'clock p.m. and at 8.30 that show is over,
[25:53.140 --> 25:56.140]  the way they deal with the transition to the next show
[25:56.140 --> 26:00.140]  is always something to sort of keep you watching, right?
[26:00.140 --> 26:03.140]  Like the hope is, you know, if we'll give you some sort of,
[26:03.140 --> 26:06.140]  if it's like live talking heads on a sports or news channel,
[26:06.140 --> 26:09.140]  the two hosts talk to each other briefly
[26:09.140 --> 26:11.140]  as they hand off from one show to another.
[26:11.140 --> 26:15.140]  And if you think about are the programmers and producers
[26:15.140 --> 26:18.140]  and directors of these shows trying to get people
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.140]  who tuned in to the eight o'clock show to keep watching,
[26:20.140 --> 26:22.140]  please, please, please watch the 8.30 show
[26:22.140 --> 26:24.140]  and then at nine o'clock they're gonna do the same thing
[26:24.140 --> 26:25.140]  for the next show.
[26:25.140 --> 26:28.140]  TV is sort of an infinite feat
[26:28.140 --> 26:32.140]  and everybody knows other people who are,
[26:32.140 --> 26:35.140]  they just like to have TV on in the background.
[26:35.140 --> 26:36.140]  I'm the opposite.
[26:36.140 --> 26:40.140]  I can't concentrate with the TV on at all.
[26:40.140 --> 26:41.140]  But, you know, I get it.
[26:41.140 --> 26:43.140]  Some people just like the background noise.
[26:43.140 --> 26:44.140]  Everybody knows somebody in their family
[26:44.140 --> 26:48.140]  who just leaves their favorite TV news channel on
[26:48.140 --> 26:51.140]  in the background all day long.
[26:51.140 --> 26:56.140]  But it's also limited in a way that the internet isn't
[26:56.140 --> 27:00.140]  where it's such a passive medium, right?
[27:00.140 --> 27:02.140]  In Marshall McLuhan's famous words,
[27:02.140 --> 27:05.140]  TV is, I think he describes it as cool, not warm
[27:05.140 --> 27:07.140]  because everybody sort of zombies out.
[27:07.140 --> 27:09.140]  Whereas social media, you drive it.
[27:09.140 --> 27:12.140]  You're the one whose thumb is on the screen
[27:12.140 --> 27:14.140]  doing the scrolling, right?
[27:14.140 --> 27:19.140]  Nobody talks about doom watching TV.
[27:19.140 --> 27:23.140]  It's doom scrolling Twitter and Instagram and et cetera
[27:23.140 --> 27:26.140]  when things are bad.
[27:26.140 --> 27:30.140]  And it all comes down to the limiting issue
[27:30.140 --> 27:34.140]  and it's obvious, but I really think it's worth delving into.
[27:34.140 --> 27:39.140]  The commodity that everybody is fighting over
[27:39.140 --> 27:41.140]  and has long been fighting over
[27:41.140 --> 27:46.140]  because it's clearly limited is human attention
[27:46.140 --> 27:48.140]  in the aggregate.
[27:48.140 --> 27:53.140]  And you wind up with two different extremes
[27:53.140 --> 27:56.140]  and they're so different, I think,
[27:56.140 --> 28:01.140]  where Instagram at this point is clearly trying to take up
[28:01.140 --> 28:06.140]  absolutely as much of each user's time each day as possible.
[28:06.140 --> 28:11.140]  Keep them looking at Instagram for as long as they can
[28:11.140 --> 28:15.140]  with the most interactions, likes on photos and comments
[28:15.140 --> 28:18.140]  and as Tom, I believe, just said,
[28:18.140 --> 28:22.140]  all the various buttons underneath.
[28:22.140 --> 28:23.140]  A lot of buttons.
[28:23.140 --> 28:24.140]  A lot of buttons.
[28:24.140 --> 28:29.140]  And watch some stories and please now, please, please,
[28:29.140 --> 28:31.140]  oh my God, watch some reels.
[28:31.140 --> 28:34.140]  Can we pay you to make a reel?
[28:34.140 --> 28:37.140]  And the opposite with something like Glass
[28:37.140 --> 28:41.140]  and again, it's literally the format of my site,
[28:41.140 --> 28:44.140]  Daring Fireball, which is chronologically ordered
[28:44.140 --> 28:47.140]  and if you read it either by RSS
[28:47.140 --> 28:50.140]  or by visiting daringfireball.net's homepage
[28:50.140 --> 28:53.140]  on the internet, you can start scrolling down
[28:53.140 --> 28:56.140]  and when you first encounter a post
[28:56.140 --> 28:58.140]  that you remember having read already,
[28:58.140 --> 28:59.140]  you know you're done.
[28:59.140 --> 29:00.140]  There's nothing else there.
[29:00.140 --> 29:04.140]  I don't put anything else there to say more like this
[29:04.140 --> 29:06.140]  and when you scroll to the bottom,
[29:06.140 --> 29:08.140]  it doesn't just load more content
[29:08.140 --> 29:11.140]  and it doesn't direct you to other sites.
[29:11.140 --> 29:15.140]  It is sort of a, like my hyper focus
[29:15.140 --> 29:19.140]  on my readers' attention is to value it so much
[29:19.140 --> 29:22.140]  but not because I want to take it from them
[29:22.140 --> 29:26.140]  but because I want them to feel like every second
[29:26.140 --> 29:29.140]  that they've been kind enough to pay to me
[29:29.140 --> 29:32.140]  by coming to my website, I would like to make sure
[29:32.140 --> 29:37.140]  they don't spend any more time than they wanted to.
[29:37.140 --> 29:40.140]  Exactly, yeah.
[29:40.140 --> 29:42.140]  And like, man, weird.
[29:42.140 --> 29:47.140]  It's like, it feels like such a moral and ethical decision
[29:47.140 --> 29:49.140]  but it's also a business decision, right?
[29:49.140 --> 29:54.140]  Like you and Glass are leaving so much money on the table.
[29:54.140 --> 29:55.140]  Don't tell.
[29:55.140 --> 29:58.140]  Like we could, no, like there's a.
[29:58.140 --> 30:02.140]  I know, it's don't tell my wife though.
[30:02.140 --> 30:03.140]  Right, exactly.
[30:03.140 --> 30:05.140]  Like we got to keep this a secret.
[30:05.140 --> 30:08.140]  There's so much more money in algorithms
[30:08.140 --> 30:13.140]  and just endless advertising but like it feels bad
[30:13.140 --> 30:15.140]  and you know, like would you have the audience
[30:15.140 --> 30:17.140]  that you have today if that existed?
[30:17.140 --> 30:19.140]  No, would you have a bigger bank account?
[30:19.140 --> 30:21.140]  Probably but like is that trade-off worth it?
[30:21.140 --> 30:23.140]  Once you reach a sustainable level,
[30:23.140 --> 30:25.140]  it's like what's the point of this?
[30:25.140 --> 30:27.140]  Why am I doing this?
[30:27.140 --> 30:28.140]  Why are we building this?
[30:28.140 --> 30:30.140]  Why are we writing this?
[30:30.140 --> 30:33.140]  And you know, that was a question we had to ask ourselves
[30:33.140 --> 30:35.140]  and when it was, you know, like push came to shove,
[30:35.140 --> 30:38.140]  we care about our users, we care about photographers
[30:38.140 --> 30:40.140]  and we care about how our brains feel
[30:40.140 --> 30:42.140]  when we use our product.
[30:42.140 --> 30:46.140]  And like that, I don't know, that matters.
[30:46.140 --> 30:49.140]  I mean, Jon, I think I've, you know,
[30:49.140 --> 30:51.140]  I've followed Daring Fireball for a long time
[30:51.140 --> 30:54.140]  and I think, Jon, I think you said you wanted to write
[30:54.140 --> 30:56.140]  Daring Fireball for yourself, I think, right?
[30:56.140 --> 30:58.140]  You wanted to be.
[30:58.140 --> 30:59.140]  Yeah.
[30:59.140 --> 31:01.140]  Yeah, like this is who I am.
[31:01.140 --> 31:02.140]  I'm a Mac nerd.
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.140]  I love this.
[31:03.140 --> 31:04.140]  I want to read all about this stuff.
[31:04.140 --> 31:06.140]  This is who I am.
[31:06.140 --> 31:08.140]  And I think a lot of what we're trying to do with Glass
[31:08.140 --> 31:10.140]  is that it's like we want to enjoy using this product.
[31:10.140 --> 31:11.140]  We want to love working on it
[31:11.140 --> 31:13.140]  and we want to do it for photographers.
[31:13.140 --> 31:15.140]  And like I'm a much better at building products
[31:15.140 --> 31:17.140]  than I am as a photographer,
[31:17.140 --> 31:20.140]  but I love building products for photographers.
[31:20.140 --> 31:22.140]  It's been something I've done a long time.
[31:22.140 --> 31:27.140]  You even linked to a project I did, I mean, shoot, years ago.
[31:27.140 --> 31:29.140]  I mean, forever ago, a couple of them
[31:29.140 --> 31:31.140]  and I'm thankful for both of them.
[31:31.140 --> 31:34.140]  But like it was just a man of passion of mine
[31:34.140 --> 31:36.140]  to work on this stuff.
[31:36.140 --> 31:38.140]  Which was that?
[31:38.140 --> 31:40.140]  What was the old product I linked to?
[31:40.140 --> 31:43.140]  I think you told me this before, but I forgot.
[31:43.140 --> 31:44.140]  No, it's okay.
[31:44.140 --> 31:45.140]  There's two.
[31:45.140 --> 31:46.140]  One, this was early.
[31:46.140 --> 31:48.140]  I was actually living in Japan at the time,
[31:48.140 --> 31:51.140]  but I worked on a content management system
[31:51.140 --> 31:53.140]  and it was one of the first people to use menu.
[31:53.140 --> 31:55.140]  It was called Manuscript and I used Markdown
[31:55.140 --> 31:57.140]  and it was like the Perl script version of it.
[31:57.140 --> 31:59.140]  And you were like, it was a PHP content management system.
[31:59.140 --> 32:02.140]  It was terrible, no one used it, but I was young
[32:02.140 --> 32:04.140]  and you wrote me back and you're like,
[32:04.140 --> 32:08.140]  you should really use the PHP version of it
[32:08.140 --> 32:10.140]  and I really should have, but whatever.
[32:10.140 --> 32:12.140]  And then the other one was,
[32:12.140 --> 32:17.140]  I made this old Flickr importing site
[32:17.140 --> 32:20.140]  that was a way to buy prints from photographers
[32:20.140 --> 32:22.140]  and it was called Level and Tap
[32:22.140 --> 32:24.140]  and it was like a print sharing service
[32:24.140 --> 32:26.140]  and you could print photos from photographers
[32:26.140 --> 32:28.140]  and it was like 2009.
[32:28.140 --> 32:31.140]  I think the other one was maybe 2004.
[32:31.140 --> 32:33.140]  I mean, I don't remember when you made Markdown,
[32:33.140 --> 32:37.140]  but these things are forever ago now.
[32:37.140 --> 32:39.140]  But you know, they've been around the internet
[32:39.140 --> 32:40.140]  a long time building these things
[32:40.140 --> 32:42.140]  and we just wanted to build something we really loved.
[32:42.140 --> 32:47.140]  And you know, after working at these big companies,
[32:47.140 --> 32:49.140]  it just, I didn't want to leave the internet
[32:49.140 --> 32:51.140]  without working on something really,
[32:51.140 --> 32:54.140]  really meaningful to me and to Daniel
[32:54.140 --> 32:56.140]  and to Stéphane and others.
[32:56.140 --> 32:59.140]  And it's resonated and it's felt really good
[32:59.140 --> 33:01.140]  and we want to keep working on it.
[33:01.140 --> 33:03.140]  So yeah.
[33:03.140 --> 33:06.140]  Markdown was early 2004 when I first published it,
[33:06.140 --> 33:08.140]  but it's funny that you say that
[33:08.140 --> 33:11.140]  and I won't go on a long Markdown related digression,
[33:11.140 --> 33:14.140]  but one thing when people ask me historically about Markdown
[33:14.140 --> 33:17.140]  is that it's had a very weird to me,
[33:17.140 --> 33:19.140]  lifetime popularity wise
[33:19.140 --> 33:21.140]  where when I first went public with it,
[33:21.140 --> 33:25.140]  I was really pretty sure this was a great idea.
[33:25.140 --> 33:28.140]  Because at least I was so happy
[33:28.140 --> 33:31.140]  because I had unbeknownst to the world
[33:31.140 --> 33:33.140]  been writing everything.
[33:33.140 --> 33:36.140]  You know, I started doing Fireball in 2002,
[33:36.140 --> 33:39.140]  used to format all my posts in HTML
[33:39.140 --> 33:41.140]  and I started getting sick of that
[33:41.140 --> 33:46.140]  as I went and started having these little scripts I wrote
[33:46.140 --> 33:50.140]  to turn less and less raw HTML into HTML
[33:50.140 --> 33:52.140]  before I actually posted it.
[33:52.140 --> 33:54.140]  But then once I posted anything,
[33:54.140 --> 33:56.140]  any edits I had to make,
[33:56.140 --> 33:59.140]  I was looking, staring at raw HTML source code
[33:59.140 --> 34:01.140]  and I thought, this is for the birds.
[34:01.140 --> 34:03.140]  And secretly behind the scenes,
[34:03.140 --> 34:05.140]  as I was developing Markdown,
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.140]  I was dogfooding it,
[34:07.140 --> 34:10.140]  meaning I was writing all my posts
[34:10.140 --> 34:13.140]  in the prototypes of Markdown as it went.
[34:13.140 --> 34:16.140]  And then every time I'd make a syntax change,
[34:16.140 --> 34:20.140]  I'd have to go back and edit the last two months of posts
[34:20.140 --> 34:22.140]  because I changed the rules
[34:22.140 --> 34:24.140]  for what an asterisk meant
[34:24.140 --> 34:26.140]  or whatever the differences were.
[34:26.140 --> 34:29.140]  And then three months go by, four months go by,
[34:29.140 --> 34:31.140]  and it's more and more posts I've got to edit
[34:31.140 --> 34:33.140]  every time I make a change, but it was worth it.
[34:33.140 --> 34:36.140]  But by the time I went public, I thought, this is great.
[34:36.140 --> 34:39.140]  Aaron Swartz, who was like my top beta tester
[34:39.140 --> 34:43.140]  and muse and foil for bouncing these ideas off,
[34:43.140 --> 34:46.140]  was even more enthusiastic than me.
[34:46.140 --> 34:48.140]  And as soon as I went public with it,
[34:48.140 --> 34:52.140]  he sent more promotional things to other websites
[34:52.140 --> 34:55.140]  saying, you know, John Gruber has launched this thing,
[34:55.140 --> 34:57.140]  Markdown, it is a fantastic idea.
[34:57.140 --> 34:59.140]  He was 100% sure this was,
[34:59.140 --> 35:05.140]  I mean, it's a shame he passed away tragically.
[35:05.140 --> 35:09.140]  But he would be so happy, but also unsurprised
[35:09.140 --> 35:14.140]  by Markdown's almost absurd popularity today.
[35:14.140 --> 35:15.140]  But anyway, long story short,
[35:15.140 --> 35:17.140]  the first few years after I announced it,
[35:17.140 --> 35:21.140]  I was so, like, it was like sort of crickets chirping.
[35:21.140 --> 35:23.140]  And it was like, I can't believe this,
[35:23.140 --> 35:25.140]  I really thought this was going to take off.
[35:25.140 --> 35:29.140]  And then it did take off, but only years later,
[35:29.140 --> 35:32.140]  maybe like by, you know, it took like three or four years
[35:32.140 --> 35:33.140]  before it really started taking off.
[35:33.140 --> 35:36.140]  And then very, very quickly it became,
[35:36.140 --> 35:38.140]  in my opinion, too popular, where it's like,
[35:38.140 --> 35:40.140]  no, no, you shouldn't be using Markdown.
[35:40.140 --> 35:44.140]  This is way too nerdy for the users that you're targeting.
[35:44.140 --> 35:46.140]  You should just have a simple WYSIWYG thing.
[35:46.140 --> 35:48.140]  Let people hit Command-I and make it italic.
[35:48.140 --> 35:51.140]  This is too popular.
[35:51.140 --> 35:52.140]  It was a very strange thing.
[35:52.140 --> 35:54.140]  So I do remember that, and in the early years,
[35:54.140 --> 35:58.140]  it was unpopular enough that somebody could make a site
[35:58.140 --> 35:59.140]  and they were using Markdown,
[35:59.140 --> 36:01.140]  and I'd find out about it and know about it
[36:01.140 --> 36:03.140]  and be able to send them a note like,
[36:03.140 --> 36:04.140]  hey, you should use Michelle,
[36:04.140 --> 36:07.140]  Mikel Fortin's PHB Markdown.
[36:07.140 --> 36:09.140]  It would be better for you.
[36:09.140 --> 36:12.140]  Yep, that was the one, yep, I remember it.
[36:12.140 --> 36:13.140]  I'm thinking, oh yeah, I should do it.
[36:13.140 --> 36:18.140]  But it was 2004, so it was a long time ago,
[36:18.140 --> 36:21.140]  because I remember I was living in Japan in 2003 and 2004.
[36:21.140 --> 36:24.140]  But that makes you a very early adopter
[36:24.140 --> 36:26.140]  and somebody who recognized it.
[36:26.140 --> 36:28.140]  So it's great minds think alike.
[36:28.140 --> 36:30.140]  It's no doubt that I'm such a fan of glass.
[36:30.140 --> 36:33.140]  We obviously, our tastes are largely aligned.
[36:33.140 --> 36:34.140]  All right, let me take a break here
[36:34.140 --> 36:36.140]  and thank our next sponsor.
[36:36.140 --> 36:39.140]  It is, oh boy, it is one of my favorite sponsors.
[36:39.140 --> 36:41.140]  I am loaded up with their products.
[36:41.140 --> 36:45.140]  I swear, I never lie about this total coincidence,
[36:45.140 --> 36:49.140]  but I'm wearing so much stuff from Mack Weldon.
[36:49.140 --> 36:50.140]  It's no secret.
[36:50.140 --> 36:52.140]  We all want to look our best this spring, right?
[36:52.140 --> 36:53.140]  Mack Weldon is the expert
[36:53.140 --> 36:55.140]  when it comes to essential clothing
[36:55.140 --> 36:58.140]  that's perfect for the cold or the warm.
[36:58.140 --> 37:00.140]  Whether you want to upgrade your sweats collection
[37:00.140 --> 37:02.140]  or you need gear that stands up
[37:02.140 --> 37:04.140]  to the changing weather of spring,
[37:04.140 --> 37:06.140]  Mack Weldon has exactly what you're looking for.
[37:06.140 --> 37:08.140]  And if that's not convenient enough,
[37:08.140 --> 37:11.140]  let me tell you about Mack Weldon's daily wear system.
[37:11.140 --> 37:13.140]  All the clothes work together.
[37:13.140 --> 37:15.140]  They match for real.
[37:15.140 --> 37:17.140]  So whether you're headed to work, going for a run,
[37:17.140 --> 37:19.140]  or just hanging on the couch,
[37:19.140 --> 37:22.140]  getting dressed takes no effort at all.
[37:22.140 --> 37:23.140]  I collect their stuff.
[37:23.140 --> 37:24.140]  I like their socks.
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.140]  I like their underwear.
[37:26.140 --> 37:29.140]  I love their clothes, their warm knit stuff.
[37:29.140 --> 37:34.140]  When they say it's warm, it is so nice and warm.
[37:34.140 --> 37:35.140]  And they're not your average sweats.
[37:35.140 --> 37:38.140]  They are really, really high quality clothes
[37:38.140 --> 37:39.140]  that are really worth it.
[37:39.140 --> 37:40.140]  They last for years.
[37:40.140 --> 37:43.140]  Longtime listeners of the show know how long it's been,
[37:43.140 --> 37:46.140]  and Mack Weldon's been sponsoring this podcast.
[37:46.140 --> 37:50.140]  It is absolutely bizarre, given how much I wear their stuff,
[37:50.140 --> 37:52.140]  how I can't tell which of the stuff
[37:52.140 --> 37:54.140]  I just bought like a few months ago
[37:54.140 --> 37:55.140]  and which stuff I've been wearing
[37:55.140 --> 37:57.140]  for like four or five years.
[37:57.140 --> 37:59.140]  It really, really holds up over time.
[37:59.140 --> 38:02.140]  It is incredibly well-made stuff.
[38:02.140 --> 38:04.140]  Now, the new collection, man,
[38:04.140 --> 38:06.140]  it checks all my boxes, and I bet you'll agree.
[38:06.140 --> 38:08.140]  Their new Atlas jogger,
[38:08.140 --> 38:10.140]  their half-zip and full-zip jackets,
[38:10.140 --> 38:13.140]  they're built for success, rain or shine,
[38:13.140 --> 38:15.140]  with a comfortable water-resistant
[38:15.140 --> 38:17.140]  and eco-responsible fabric.
[38:17.140 --> 38:18.140]  They feel great.
[38:18.140 --> 38:19.140]  You're gonna love them.
[38:19.140 --> 38:22.140]  They do amazing stuff with the fabrics to keep stuff,
[38:22.140 --> 38:24.140]  you know, if they say it's water-resistant,
[38:24.140 --> 38:25.140]  it's water-resistant.
[38:25.140 --> 38:28.140]  And for anyone who's looking to step up their daily routine,
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.140]  don't miss these.
[38:29.140 --> 38:30.140]  Here's what you do.
[38:30.140 --> 38:31.140]  Check out Mack Weldon.

[38:38.140 --> 38:42.140]  slash the talk show pod.

[38:44.140 --> 38:46.140]  starting with this spot.
[38:46.140 --> 38:48.140]  The promo code, all one word,
[38:48.140 --> 38:50.140]  the talk show pod.
[38:50.140 --> 38:52.140]  And again, that's mackweldon.com
[38:52.140 --> 38:54.140]  slash the talk show pod.

[38:59.140 --> 39:03.140]  Find your perfect look for this spring.
[39:03.140 --> 39:05.140]  All right, one of the things I wanted to talk about
[39:05.140 --> 39:09.140]  is you guys, you mentioned it before,
[39:09.140 --> 39:11.140]  but one of the, well, at a higher level,
[39:11.140 --> 39:13.140]  I was gonna talk about sign in with Apple,
[39:13.140 --> 39:16.140]  but at a higher level, at least right now,
[39:16.140 --> 39:20.140]  on mobile, Glass is iOS only.
[39:20.140 --> 39:25.140]  It launched in August solely on iPhone,
[39:25.140 --> 39:28.140]  although you could run the app on iPad.
[39:28.140 --> 39:32.140]  And I think about two weeks ago,
[39:32.140 --> 39:36.140]  three weeks ago, you guys launched the iPad app.
[39:36.140 --> 39:38.140]  Is that the right timeline?
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.140]  Two weeks, yeah.
[39:40.140 --> 39:44.140]  And coincidentally, I'm glad
[39:44.140 --> 39:46.140]  I didn't have you on two weeks ago,
[39:46.140 --> 39:48.140]  but as we speak, now you've launched
[39:48.140 --> 39:51.140]  a web version at glass.photo
[39:51.140 --> 39:53.140]  that you can visit on the desktop.
[39:53.140 --> 39:57.140]  So right now it's iPhone, iPad, and web.
[39:57.140 --> 40:01.140]  And I would love to hear you guys talk about
[40:01.140 --> 40:04.140]  why you launched, or at least why it's still iOS only,
[40:04.140 --> 40:07.140]  whether you have plans to keep it iOS only,
[40:07.140 --> 40:11.140]  and how in the world did you do what seems impossible,
[40:11.140 --> 40:14.140]  given my experience with certain other products
[40:14.140 --> 40:17.140]  we've already talked about, to have an iPad?
[40:17.140 --> 40:22.140]  I thought making an iPad app was impossible.
[40:22.140 --> 40:24.140]  There's not a lot of users in iPad apps.
[40:24.140 --> 40:26.140]  That's what I've heard.
[40:26.140 --> 40:27.140]  That's the word around town.
[40:27.140 --> 40:29.140]  Not a lot of people use iPads.
[40:29.140 --> 40:32.140]  They just sell 20 million to nobody every year.
[40:32.140 --> 40:34.140]  iPad users go to hell.
[40:34.140 --> 40:36.140]  We don't need you.
[40:36.140 --> 40:38.140]  We do. We do need you.
[40:38.140 --> 40:42.140]  Yeah, so we launched on iOS originally,
[40:42.140 --> 40:46.140]  instead of Android, for the very obvious reason
[40:46.140 --> 40:49.140]  of we're iPhone users.
[40:49.140 --> 40:51.140]  It's not nefarious.
[40:51.140 --> 40:55.140]  Android cameras are wonderful now.
[40:55.140 --> 40:57.140]  Google Pixel takes wonderful photos.
[40:57.140 --> 40:59.140]  But we don't use them.
[40:59.140 --> 41:02.140]  We use iPhones, and we needed to build a product for us,
[41:02.140 --> 41:05.140]  and so we built it on iOS.
[41:05.140 --> 41:07.140]  The reason we didn't launch with an Android app
[41:07.140 --> 41:12.140]  or an iPad app was because it's really hard to build an app, y'all.
[41:12.140 --> 41:15.140]  It is just really hard and complicated.
[41:15.140 --> 41:17.140]  And so with such a small team,
[41:17.140 --> 41:22.140]  we had to pick an ecosystem and get started.
[41:22.140 --> 41:25.140]  So we picked iOS.
[41:25.140 --> 41:28.140]  And then when we launched with iOS,
[41:28.140 --> 41:31.140]  it was never going to just be iOS.
[41:31.140 --> 41:33.140]  iPad was our dream.
[41:33.140 --> 41:37.140]  I'm an iPad Pro-only user.
[41:37.140 --> 41:41.140]  That's the joy of being in marketing and community.
[41:41.140 --> 41:43.140]  You don't need to design anything in Figma.
[41:43.140 --> 41:46.140]  You can just use an iPad for everything.
[41:46.140 --> 41:48.140]  It is wonderful.
[41:48.140 --> 41:51.140]  And so every time Tom would send me a new build,
[41:51.140 --> 41:54.140]  I'd be like, hey, where's our iPad app?
[41:54.140 --> 41:56.140]  And he's like, it's coming one day.
[41:56.140 --> 41:58.140]  And then candidly, over Christmas break,
[41:58.140 --> 42:02.140]  our engineer just sat there and made it for fun.
[42:02.140 --> 42:07.140]  And that worked out wonderfully.
[42:07.140 --> 42:09.140]  I mean, we did do quite a bit of design work up front.
[42:09.140 --> 42:10.140]  Come on, now.
[42:10.140 --> 42:12.140]  But yeah, you did.
[42:12.140 --> 42:15.140]  But yeah, and the web is coming.
[42:15.140 --> 42:16.140]  So we're in the alpha stages.
[42:16.140 --> 42:18.140]  We sent you an early alpha.
[42:18.140 --> 42:19.140]  Ah, okay.
[42:19.140 --> 42:21.140]  Well, have I blabbed?
[42:21.140 --> 42:22.140]  Do we need to take this out?
[42:22.140 --> 42:25.140]  Have I blabbed a terrible secret that I wasn't supposed to say?
[42:25.140 --> 42:32.140]  No, no, we've totally announced we're not quite as important as Apple
[42:32.140 --> 42:34.140]  to keep everything hyper-secret until the release.
[42:34.140 --> 42:37.140]  We wanted our members to know that the alpha is coming.
[42:37.140 --> 42:40.140]  And we were actually testing it with a large number of our members
[42:40.140 --> 42:41.140]  to get things going.
[42:41.140 --> 42:45.140]  But yeah, we're hoping to launch in the next month, I would say.
[42:45.140 --> 42:48.140]  March would be great, maybe early April, depending.
[42:48.140 --> 42:51.140]  But it's going to be, you know, things take time.
[42:51.140 --> 42:53.140]  It's always, you know, it's a process.
[42:53.140 --> 42:58.140]  But yeah, I mean, it's been great to get these multiple platforms out there.
[42:58.140 --> 43:02.140]  And you mentioned signing with Apple or, I mean, I can talk about signing with Apple
[43:02.140 --> 43:05.140]  or we can talk about which other platforms we want to go to.
[43:05.140 --> 43:09.140]  But yeah, like Daniel covered, like, we love iPhones and iPads.
[43:09.140 --> 43:11.140]  And so we made it for that.
[43:11.140 --> 43:16.140]  And also our members, I mean, that was the most requested feature
[43:16.140 --> 43:19.140]  when we launched was an iPad app.
[43:19.140 --> 43:22.140]  It's followed right after with a web experience.
[43:22.140 --> 43:25.140]  And so we were like, okay, well, that's what we should be building for everyone.
[43:25.140 --> 43:27.140]  It's nice and easy.
[43:27.140 --> 43:30.140]  We have a great, if you go to feedback.glass.photo, we have all the members.
[43:30.140 --> 43:31.140]  They leave tons of feedback.
[43:31.140 --> 43:33.140]  Sean, you've given us great feedback.
[43:33.140 --> 43:36.140]  Like, it's how we prioritize stuff.
[43:36.140 --> 43:38.140]  I mean, it's really so simple.
[43:38.140 --> 43:41.140]  And we talk about it all the time, but like when your customer is the people
[43:41.140 --> 43:43.140]  who are paying you instead of advertisers,
[43:43.140 --> 43:45.140]  you can make very different product choices.
[43:45.140 --> 43:46.140]  It's really simple.
[43:46.140 --> 43:48.140]  Well, one of the things I'll just say, I mean,
[43:48.140 --> 43:51.140]  and people can go to your website and see screenshots and stuff,
[43:51.140 --> 43:53.140]  but here on the podcast, I'll just describe it.
[43:53.140 --> 44:00.140]  Like, the iPad version is not just a bigger version of the iPhone version.
[44:00.140 --> 44:04.140]  The iPhone version, given the nature of the iPhone as a small screen
[44:04.140 --> 44:08.140]  that has a very sort of extreme aspect ratio,
[44:08.140 --> 44:16.140]  is a vertical list of photos that you scroll down with one,
[44:16.140 --> 44:19.140]  effectively a one-column layout.
[44:19.140 --> 44:24.140]  Whereas on the iPad, because it's a different screen, closer to square,
[44:24.140 --> 44:29.140]  you guys take advantage of it by laying out the photos in a grid
[44:29.140 --> 44:32.140]  that fills the screen, but it's not just a single column.
[44:32.140 --> 44:36.140]  It is very, and when you rotate, you get a different layout
[44:36.140 --> 44:40.140]  because the orientation's different, and it's a long way of saying,
[44:40.140 --> 44:45.140]  you guys put some really serious design work into thinking about
[44:45.140 --> 44:47.140]  how would you lay this out for a bigger screen,
[44:47.140 --> 44:50.140]  as opposed to just making a bigger version.
[44:50.140 --> 44:57.140]  And we mentioned Adam Masseri at Instagram, and it's perennial.
[44:57.140 --> 44:59.140]  It popped up again just this week.
[44:59.140 --> 45:01.140]  I think it was Marques Brownlee.
[45:01.140 --> 45:04.140]  Yeah, Marques Brownlee posted a tweet that said,
[45:04.140 --> 45:08.140]  hey, it's 2022, and Instagram still has no iPad app,
[45:08.140 --> 45:11.140]  and Adam Masseri engaged with him, to his credit,
[45:11.140 --> 45:13.140]  right there in public, in Twitter,
[45:13.140 --> 45:19.140]  and sort of gave their company line, which is weird, right?
[45:19.140 --> 45:23.140]  Like, the way Marques posted that is perfect,
[45:23.140 --> 45:26.140]  because they can say what they want
[45:26.140 --> 45:31.140]  about why there's no iPad version of Instagram in 2022,
[45:31.140 --> 45:33.140]  lo these many years later.
[45:33.140 --> 45:37.140]  You know, at a company that is not running out of money,
[45:37.140 --> 45:40.140]  to say the least.
[45:40.140 --> 45:45.140]  But part of his thread is, he says, each surface adds overhead.
[45:45.140 --> 45:49.140]  We support iOS, Android, the web, and Instagram Lite,
[45:49.140 --> 45:52.140]  and Android is the largest.
[45:52.140 --> 45:56.140]  Two TikTok and YouTuber behemoths,
[45:56.140 --> 45:59.140]  and it's probably a word I'm mispronouncing, behemoths.
[45:59.140 --> 46:01.140]  I don't know how you pronounce it, but I know the word.
[46:01.140 --> 46:02.140]  Behemoths.
[46:02.140 --> 46:03.140]  Behemoths, that's right, behemoths.
[46:03.140 --> 46:05.140]  Where do I know that from a movie?
[46:05.140 --> 46:09.140]  Oh, Reservoir Dogs, right?
[46:09.140 --> 46:11.140]  The radio guy uses the word behemoth.
[46:11.140 --> 46:12.140]  There it is, yes, yes.
[46:12.140 --> 46:13.140]  Behemoth.
[46:13.140 --> 46:16.140]  Oh, man, live correction of my pronunciation,
[46:16.140 --> 46:17.140]  right here on the show.
[46:17.140 --> 46:20.140]  People share more in messages than they do to story or feed,
[46:20.140 --> 46:21.140]  so we need to adapt.
[46:21.140 --> 46:27.140]  So in two, he's more or less talking about their
[46:27.140 --> 46:31.140]  war over people's attention with TikTok and YouTube, right?
[46:31.140 --> 46:34.140]  And there they're already talking about the way that,
[46:34.140 --> 46:38.140]  for example, Instagram is, and he's been clear about this, right?
[46:38.140 --> 46:41.140]  To his credit, he's been kind of clear.
[46:41.140 --> 46:45.140]  He said explicitly late last year that Instagram is no longer
[46:45.140 --> 46:48.140]  a photo sharing site, at least alone, right?
[46:48.140 --> 46:50.140]  Sharing photos is one of many things that it does.
[46:50.140 --> 46:54.140]  And number two in his points here of why they haven't prioritized
[46:54.140 --> 46:58.140]  making an iPad version is they're too busy fighting with TikTok
[46:58.140 --> 47:02.140]  and YouTube over people's time for their attention.
[47:02.140 --> 47:05.140]  And then number three, we are leaner than you think,
[47:05.140 --> 47:08.140]  meaning, hey, you might think we're huge.
[47:08.140 --> 47:10.140]  Number three, let's start.
[47:10.140 --> 47:11.140]  I'm going to guess.
[47:11.140 --> 47:13.140]  Number three is a tough one for me.
[47:13.140 --> 47:14.140]  Number three is a tough one.
[47:14.140 --> 47:17.140]  It's a tough one to swallow because I'm just going to,
[47:17.140 --> 47:23.140]  I'm going to guess that no matter how surprisingly lean Instagram's
[47:23.140 --> 47:27.140]  iOS development team is, that it's not as lean as glasses.
[47:27.140 --> 47:31.140]  Our one, uh, we got, we got one.
[47:31.140 --> 47:38.140]  I'm just, won't someone please think of the poor small tiny Instagram
[47:38.140 --> 47:41.140]  up against the behemoths of YouTube and TikTok, please?
[47:41.140 --> 47:44.140]  Let's take a moment and think about Instagram.
[47:44.140 --> 47:49.140]  I am just, whew, I love how it goes from like reasonable
[47:49.140 --> 47:51.140]  and thoughtful and normal.
[47:51.140 --> 47:54.140]  And then like, ooh, now we're talking about like,
[47:54.140 --> 47:57.140]  oh, your business model and now we're talking about how you're
[47:57.140 --> 47:59.140]  four people in a garage.
[47:59.140 --> 48:00.140]  Great guys.
[48:00.140 --> 48:03.140]  Great.
[48:03.140 --> 48:07.140]  Oh, it, it's, there's got to be something else.
[48:07.140 --> 48:11.140]  And I still feel even with as open as Adam Masseri has started
[48:11.140 --> 48:15.140]  to try to be it seemingly over the last year or so about why
[48:15.140 --> 48:18.140]  they don't have an iPad app, there's got to be something else.
[48:18.140 --> 48:22.140]  And I know I've seen the spitball theory and if you want to,
[48:22.140 --> 48:27.140]  maybe it's not a bad guess to be as cynical as possible about what
[48:27.140 --> 48:29.140]  the explanation is or what some of the explanations is,
[48:29.140 --> 48:35.140]  but that there's something, something ad tech wise where they feel
[48:35.140 --> 48:39.140]  they make more money per minute spent while people are on their
[48:39.140 --> 48:43.140]  phones than on, uh, than they would on the iPad.
[48:43.140 --> 48:46.140]  And I don't know, they're a very data-driven company.
[48:46.140 --> 48:48.140]  Famously, they, I don't know if you've heard this,
[48:48.140 --> 48:53.140]  but they collect an awful lot of information about the, the inner,
[48:53.140 --> 48:57.140]  it's news to me, every single thing,
[48:57.140 --> 49:00.140]  every single person does in their app, they collect and study and
[49:00.140 --> 49:01.140]  analyze. But to me,
[49:01.140 --> 49:06.140]  it's almost like they can't quite know what the difference in usage
[49:06.140 --> 49:09.140]  is if they had an iPad app, because I, as far as I know,
[49:09.140 --> 49:14.140]  they've never secretly built an iPad app and done any kind of AB
[49:14.140 --> 49:18.140]  testing. It may be internally, I don't know,
[49:18.140 --> 49:20.140]  but it doesn't seem like publicly that's ever happened.
[49:20.140 --> 49:24.140]  That seems like the sort of thing that would be all over the web is the
[49:24.140 --> 49:28.140]  moment that it, it came out, you know, for some people, um,
[49:28.140 --> 49:33.140]  but that they have reason to believe that there's some reason that they
[49:33.140 --> 49:37.140]  really want people to use Instagram on their phone and only on their
[49:37.140 --> 49:42.140]  phone as much as possible. Do you guys think that?
[49:42.140 --> 49:44.140]  I don't know what that would be though.
[49:44.140 --> 49:48.140]  Like it makes sense that there's some thing they won't say,
[49:48.140 --> 49:50.140]  but I really, whenever I do think about it,
[49:50.140 --> 49:53.140]  and I thought about it a lot over the last couple of days,
[49:53.140 --> 49:54.140]  because by coincidence,
[49:54.140 --> 49:57.140]  he just had a Twitter thread talking about it after Marquez brought it up
[49:57.140 --> 50:01.140]  and you guys were coming on the show, but yet I'm still stuck.
[50:01.140 --> 50:05.140]  It's like playing wordle and you're on line four and you're looking at
[50:05.140 --> 50:08.140]  your first three guesses and you're like, well, there must,
[50:08.140 --> 50:09.140]  it must be a word,
[50:09.140 --> 50:12.140]  but damn if I can think of a word that fits this pattern,
[50:12.140 --> 50:17.140]  I still can't think of why they don't have some basically reasonable
[50:17.140 --> 50:21.140]  iPad app. Do you guys have an idea?
[50:21.140 --> 50:22.140]  Is there something?
[50:22.140 --> 50:24.140]  My favorite,
[50:24.140 --> 50:28.140]  the thing I heard back in the day and I just immediately believed without
[50:28.140 --> 50:33.140]  investigating it further is after
[50:33.140 --> 50:39.140]  Facebook bought Instagram and Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg had a beef,
[50:39.140 --> 50:42.140]  he just killed the thing and said, we're never putting it on iPad.
[50:42.140 --> 50:47.140]  And now there's just an angry avatar of Zuckerberg's
[50:47.140 --> 50:49.140]  face anytime someone brings up iPad.
[50:49.140 --> 50:50.140]  That's, that's the,
[50:50.140 --> 50:54.140]  what I heard like a decade ago and believed without looking into it any
[50:54.140 --> 50:56.140]  further. And that's why we don't have,
[50:56.140 --> 50:58.140]  it's just personal beef between billionaires.
[50:58.140 --> 50:59.140]  Oh, I like that.
[50:59.140 --> 51:03.140]  Yeah, like your answer makes way more sense,
[51:03.140 --> 51:06.140]  but I like the billionaire beef.
[51:06.140 --> 51:09.140]  Yeah, I mean, mine is,
[51:09.140 --> 51:11.140]  is much more boring.
[51:11.140 --> 51:16.140]  I, I think it's prioritization of resources like Adam saying the lean
[51:16.140 --> 51:17.140]  bit is a little rich,
[51:17.140 --> 51:22.140]  but the parts about like them going after the other companies and the
[51:22.140 --> 51:26.140]  iPad becoming less of a priority because they put all their
[51:26.140 --> 51:30.140]  team's resources behind all these new features and all this new stuff is,
[51:30.140 --> 51:32.140]  is the most likely scenario.
[51:32.140 --> 51:36.140]  Now I worked at Pinterest for almost five years and
[51:36.140 --> 51:40.140]  was responsible for a lot of the design work and we did have an iPad app and
[51:40.140 --> 51:43.140]  it was incredibly engaging when I was there.
[51:43.140 --> 51:45.140]  So people used it a ton.
[51:45.140 --> 51:49.140]  So I'm not sure why that wouldn't hold up because you know,
[51:49.140 --> 51:51.140]  it's like it was a very immersive experience,
[51:51.140 --> 51:53.140]  you know that product,
[51:53.140 --> 51:57.140]  but maybe because of the way Instagram's ad columns work and the way they would
[51:57.140 --> 51:58.140]  have to reconfigure stuff,
[51:58.140 --> 52:00.140]  it's a lot more work than it seems from the outside.
[52:00.140 --> 52:01.140]  And you know, those are,
[52:01.140 --> 52:05.140]  those are my best assumptions as to why I never heard about the personal
[52:05.140 --> 52:08.140]  billionaire beef theory that Daniel has when I was there.
[52:08.140 --> 52:10.140]  But you know, it's, it's fun.
[52:10.140 --> 52:13.140]  It's possible billionaires have beefs.
[52:13.140 --> 52:17.140]  But it does bring up an interesting point that I think happens a lot,
[52:17.140 --> 52:19.140]  especially when we're talking about Instagram,
[52:19.140 --> 52:23.140]  is that, excuse me,
[52:23.140 --> 52:28.140]  it feels like Instagram was never allowed to be what it wants to be, right?
[52:28.140 --> 52:32.140]  Like Instagram was built as Instagram and it was wonderful for a couple of
[52:32.140 --> 52:37.140]  years and then it got bought and then ads started appearing and then
[52:37.140 --> 52:42.140]  Snapchat became a thing and we had to add stories and like the product of
[52:42.140 --> 52:47.140]  Instagram and what Instagram was originally built to do and its obvious
[52:47.140 --> 52:52.140]  product roadmap forward were shifted drastically by the different needs of
[52:52.140 --> 52:57.140]  Facebook versus what would have made a profitable app for Instagram on its own,
[52:57.140 --> 53:02.140]  right? And so like now we have it becoming TikTok and we have it,
[53:02.140 --> 53:04.140]  you know, remember Instagram TV,
[53:04.140 --> 53:09.140]  when they put the TV icon where your notification icon was so you could get
[53:09.140 --> 53:14.140]  your monthly users up for Instagram TV, right? It's a shopping app.
[53:14.140 --> 53:18.140]  It's like it's never been allowed to be what it wants to be. It feels like,
[53:18.140 --> 53:20.140]  cause like as a product, it just wants to be a nice,
[53:20.140 --> 53:22.140]  fun place to share stuff with friends.
[53:22.140 --> 53:27.140]  And yet because of how the business model works for venture capital backed
[53:27.140 --> 53:30.140]  companies at this scale, you just need all the data.
[53:30.140 --> 53:33.140]  And so you just have to make it addictive and that's that, right?
[53:33.140 --> 53:38.140]  And it makes me sad. Oh God, it's so sad.
[53:38.140 --> 53:42.140]  We, we would talk about this, um, like an earnest internet.
[53:42.140 --> 53:47.140]  Daniel and I, we've had this conversations before and, and it's this like,
[53:47.140 --> 53:50.140]  we don't want to sound old or because we think there's a future in it and that,
[53:50.140 --> 53:55.140]  you know, glasses, uh, our attempt at showing a different way.
[53:55.140 --> 54:00.140]  Um, you know, making a scalable product like glass,
[54:00.140 --> 54:05.140]  uh, and even five, six years ago it was pretty difficult,
[54:05.140 --> 54:09.140]  but you know, and Amazon web services, you know, like scalable architecture,
[54:09.140 --> 54:12.140]  you can do it with a very small and lean team and you can do these independent
[54:12.140 --> 54:17.140]  things and we could build a better place for all of us and a more future
[54:17.140 --> 54:21.140]  forward looking place to spend our time. Uh, you know,
[54:21.140 --> 54:26.140]  I think I looked back and wasn't wild about my decade spent, you know,
[54:26.140 --> 54:29.140]  building social experiences on the internet and,
[54:29.140 --> 54:31.140]  but that was what I'm good at now.
[54:31.140 --> 54:34.140]  Like I spent a decade getting good at that and I wanted to figure out a way to
[54:34.140 --> 54:39.140]  design a product that felt really good and in that way and
[54:39.140 --> 54:43.140]  like to spend time on it and you'd feel good when you're done with it. I mean,
[54:43.140 --> 54:45.140]  and so it felt right to,
[54:45.140 --> 54:50.140]  to take a swing at it and glasses the result of that. And so that's
[54:50.140 --> 54:54.140]  where, yeah, a little over two years into building it and six months out,
[54:54.140 --> 54:56.140]  we're just, yeah. Anyway,
[54:56.140 --> 55:00.140]  uh, you guys, uh, I will put it in the show notes, but somebody, I know,
[55:00.140 --> 55:01.140]  I think it was Daniel,
[55:01.140 --> 55:05.140]  you mentioned somebody just had a side by side comparison of how photos look in
[55:05.140 --> 55:10.140]  glass versus Instagram and just how much more they're smaller because they
[55:10.140 --> 55:13.140]  have to make more room for stuff and there's just more extra buttons,
[55:13.140 --> 55:18.140]  but at least they're still sized right for the device.
[55:18.140 --> 55:22.140]  And, and I think they must know this,
[55:22.140 --> 55:26.140]  but it's like my wife, she loves her iPad pro.
[55:26.140 --> 55:30.140]  She still has an old Mac book pro that she uses, you know,
[55:30.140 --> 55:31.140]  when there's certain,
[55:31.140 --> 55:35.140]  still certain things that are a little bit better to do on a Mac and, you know,
[55:35.140 --> 55:38.140]  she'll use the Mac. She doesn't have a keyboard for her iPad.
[55:38.140 --> 55:41.140]  She literally only uses her iPad as, you know,
[55:41.140 --> 55:44.140]  something she pecks out on screen does, has no, has no interest,
[55:44.140 --> 55:48.140]  brave Bluetooth or a keyboard case. So she has to write a long, a long email.
[55:48.140 --> 55:51.140]  She'll go to her Mac book, but she loves her iPad and,
[55:51.140 --> 55:53.140]  and for day to day computing, you know,
[55:53.140 --> 55:58.140]  it's her primary device and she uses Instagram
[55:58.140 --> 56:00.140]  on her iPad. I see her doing it all the time.
[56:00.140 --> 56:05.140]  And it's that feature that they've had ever since they debuted it in 2011,
[56:05.140 --> 56:06.140]  the iPad,
[56:06.140 --> 56:10.140]  where you can run unchanged iPhone apps on the
[56:10.140 --> 56:15.140]  iPad and they either show up as a ridiculous little
[56:15.140 --> 56:20.140]  iPhone sized window surrounded by four inch black
[56:20.140 --> 56:23.140]  bezels, or there's like always been from the get go,
[56:23.140 --> 56:27.140]  still is a two X button that runs it at double the size to sort of,
[56:27.140 --> 56:32.140]  resize to fit the aspect ratio of the iPad.
[56:32.140 --> 56:34.140]  And that's, you know, how she, of course,
[56:34.140 --> 56:38.140]  that's how she runs Instagram. And I, you know, I'm not nosy.
[56:38.140 --> 56:40.140]  I don't, I don't look over her shoulder much,
[56:40.140 --> 56:43.140]  but I see her doing it and sometimes I see she's on Instagram.
[56:43.140 --> 56:48.140]  And even with my not so great vision
[56:48.140 --> 56:49.140]  as I age,
[56:49.140 --> 56:54.140]  I can tell just walking past her how grainy everything
[56:54.140 --> 56:59.140]  is by blowing it up to X. And I'm sure at Instagram
[56:59.140 --> 57:03.140]  scale, there are, I guess, tens of millions,
[57:03.140 --> 57:07.140]  maybe more users who use it, who do use Instagram on iPad.
[57:07.140 --> 57:10.140]  So where I'm going is no,
[57:10.140 --> 57:15.140]  they do not have a native Instagram app designed for the iPad,
[57:15.140 --> 57:18.140]  but people use Instagram on iPad.
[57:18.140 --> 57:21.140]  They must know that they do.
[57:21.140 --> 57:25.140]  And maybe it really is less people that fewer people than we think.
[57:25.140 --> 57:29.140]  I don't know, but it would drive me bonkers to be there.
[57:29.140 --> 57:30.140]  And, and again,
[57:30.140 --> 57:34.140]  I'm trying to be as diplomatic and as gracious to Instagram in this interview
[57:34.140 --> 57:39.140]  as I can be. They do care about design, right?
[57:39.140 --> 57:41.140]  Like it, it, Instagram is not,
[57:41.140 --> 57:46.140]  and it never has been a junky app and they have some really interesting
[57:46.140 --> 57:49.140]  interactions. They still do on iOS.
[57:49.140 --> 57:53.140]  They scroll really well, which is always a hard thing to do.
[57:53.140 --> 57:56.140]  It drives me. It's always been curious to me.
[57:56.140 --> 57:59.140]  I use a Pixel 4 for Android testing.
[57:59.140 --> 58:03.140]  It scrolls way better on iOS than Android, which I can't, again,
[58:03.140 --> 58:07.140]  like the way that Marquez points out that it's weird that in 2022,
[58:07.140 --> 58:09.140]  it's still a thing that they don't have an iPad app.
[58:09.140 --> 58:14.140]  I also find it weird that apps don't scroll as well in Android in 2022
[58:14.140 --> 58:17.140]  as they do on iOS, but they obviously care about things.
[58:17.140 --> 58:21.140]  That would drive me nuts to know that. And the other thing,
[58:21.140 --> 58:26.140]  and this is where having glass on iPad emphasizes something you know to
[58:26.140 --> 58:29.140]  be true, but when you see it, it's more profound than you think.
[58:29.140 --> 58:34.140]  Looking at photos bigger is nicer, right?
[58:34.140 --> 58:38.140]  It, it, it, when you see Om Malik,
[58:38.140 --> 58:40.140]  I know you guys did an interview or Tom,
[58:40.140 --> 58:43.140]  I think at least did an interview with Om months ago.
[58:43.140 --> 58:48.140]  He's a great photographer and he's really become interested in it.
[58:48.140 --> 58:50.140]  And he had a photo that was featured,
[58:50.140 --> 58:53.140]  I think recently by the Leica social media accounts.
[58:53.140 --> 58:56.140]  Oh, he went on a trip to Antarctica and just took this beautiful,
[58:56.140 --> 58:57.140]  beautiful photo.
[58:57.140 --> 59:00.140]  I could look at that one photo of a mountain in Antarctica,
[59:00.140 --> 59:01.140]  just like when you,
[59:01.140 --> 59:05.140]  when you're walking in a museum and a certain piece grabs you.
[59:05.140 --> 59:08.140]  And I think everybody knows this experience where you're kind of just,
[59:08.140 --> 59:09.140]  ah, nice, nice, nice.
[59:09.140 --> 59:14.140]  And then a piece grabs you and you just stare at it right for minutes and
[59:14.140 --> 59:17.140]  minutes. Like that's, that's part of the joy of going to a museum.
[59:17.140 --> 59:20.140]  It's nice to see it on the biggest screen you possibly can.
[59:20.140 --> 59:26.140]  And the iPad is, is so much nicer for that than the iPhone.
[59:26.140 --> 59:29.140]  Oh, it's by far my favorite way to experience it.
[59:29.140 --> 59:32.140]  The glass now, I mean, it's so immersive, it's so big. Um, I mean,
[59:32.140 --> 59:36.140]  I guess I'm getting a little biased now because I have a big IMAX sitting
[59:36.140 --> 59:39.140]  next to me where I'm using the web version and you get to see an even bigger,
[59:39.140 --> 59:42.140]  you know, it's like the bigger the screen, the more immersive it is.
[59:42.140 --> 59:45.140]  We have a, we're working on some ways to make it, you know,
[59:45.140 --> 59:48.140]  it can pinch better and get it even more immersive,
[59:48.140 --> 59:53.140]  put the priorities for it. But yeah, it's, it's, it's great. And you know, we,
[59:53.140 --> 59:56.140]  we do our best to make the UI as minimal as possible,
[59:56.140 --> 01:00:01.140]  get it out of the way photos get like as much pixels as we
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]  can possibly give them.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:07.140]  Um, we spent a lot of time like resizing the images to the proper viewports.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.140]  Um, so we, the way we like handle like you,
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.140]  we upload and we keep the full size image and we scale it appropriately to the
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.140]  viewport. So you get the highest resolution possible while maintaining bandwidth
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.140]  costs and storage costs for us. So like we can, can handle that stuff.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:27.140]  So it's a lot of like prioritization where it's like when you're at a scale
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:32.140]  that's like of Instagram, um, you have to, you can't,
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.140]  you have to optimize the images. You have to down sample them.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:38.140]  You have to like keep them smaller. You have to keep the quality lower. Um,
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:42.140]  and so we can do a lot of things that lets you really just experience the photo
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.140]  in a beautiful way.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.140]  And wouldn't it drive you nuts? I mean, it wasn't it, I,
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.140]  I can't help but think this and I know that, you know,
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.140]  I'm not trying to squeeze all of your future plans for Glass out of you.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.140]  I'm trying to respect your ability to keep some stuff secret.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:01.140]  I still feel a little guilty about blabbing about the web version.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.140]  No, you're fine. No, you're good.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.140]  But didn't having Glass out
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:13.140]  for a few months and knowing that people were firing up Glass
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:17.140]  for iPhone on their iPad and looking at things in an unoptimized fashion as,
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.140]  as somebody, a product designer who cares about the details and really driven by
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.140]  it. And, you know, it sounds to me like long story short,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:30.140]  you spent a lot of the last decade doing product design for, you know,
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.140]  working at Facebook and then working at Pinterest, these big, well-known,
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.140]  world famous, mega social sites of
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.140]  wouldn't you love to build something for yourself and let your own personal
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:49.140]  priorities and tastes be a higher priority than engagement
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.140]  and ad revenue and whatever other priorities you could put lower down.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:58.140]  It had to be a little more like, you know, Oh my God, we really, we got to,
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.140]  we got to get this iPad out because we,
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:05.140]  we really want to have people see these things as beautiful
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.140]  as they can, as we can make them.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.140]  Oh, I mean, I designed the very first version of Glass,
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.140]  both iOS and iPad, like I was the very beginning that grid existed from the
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.140]  beginning, but, uh, I just, I wanted it on the iPad.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:24.140]  We wanted to do it on the iPad and we started building it and we were like,
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.140]  Ooh, this is a lot. We have to do one at a time.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.140]  Like we just immediately realized we could build them in tandem and not have to
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:33.140]  wait another, you know, six or nine months to get it out.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:37.140]  And we just thought like, that's a tough call, but we prioritize it.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.140]  And yeah, I mean, of course it's why I started Glass in the first place.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.140]  It was like, okay, Bennett done these big scale things.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.140]  What's next? Like what can I do?
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.140]  I want to build something beautiful and I want to have the priorities be different.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.140]  And if I take on venture capital and start something with that in mind,
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.140]  it inevitably leads to a different outcome.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.140]  I even, I talked to Om about it early, you know, cause that's what Om does.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.140]  He's in venture capital and he's like, don't take anybody.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.140]  He was very explicit to us cause he's like, if you do,
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.140]  it changes the entire dynamic, right?
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.140]  Like he was, he was really supportive of us early on and that was great.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:16.140]  You know, he was like an early alpha tester and gave us lots of feedback.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.140]  He's a great photographer, like you said, and it was just really clear.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.140]  And so this was the way in which we could do this to be entirely member supported.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.140]  I remember like upcoming, you remember the upcoming website, right?
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.140]  Like, you know, they got bought and then they had to go away.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.140]  Like, you know, and they tried to come back.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.140]  It was Andy Bales.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:40.140]  And I forget who he co I know he had a co-founders and Leonard Len.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.140]  Yep. And they built a site where,
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.140]  where community events could be posted on a calendar like conferences.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:52.140]  And it was also at a time when there were more community events and I'm putting COVID aside,
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.140]  not even talking about it.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.140]  It just seems like I may again, maybe it's cause I'm old,
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:00.140]  but it just seems like too much stuff has become virtual as opposed to real,
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.140]  but it was up and then Yahoo bought it.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:12.140]  And root dot, dot, dot, right? It's, it's step three, step three,
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.140]  instead of enough information, instead of step three profit.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140]  Good. Now we can stop.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:23.140]  It's step three ruined it.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.140]  Let's be while we're going down memory lane.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.140]  I have it on my list of things. Let's get it out.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:33.140]  Let's let's talk about flicker and where flicker.
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.140]  They're still active. I don't want to act.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.140]  I don't want to talk about them in the past tense.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.140]  I still have an account. I'm glad they're still around, you know,
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:48.140]  and they went through the same Yahoo ringer upcoming did where they went into Yahoo and things did not go well.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.140]  And now they're back out of Yahoo.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:54.140]  I think it's smug, smug, smug, who bought them and is running them independently.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:05:00.140]  And there's some similarities there where flicker is not ad based.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:06.140]  I don't think I don't know. At least when I log in, I don't see ads and they have paid your member.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.140]  Yeah, they have paid or at least, you know, which I am a paid member.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:18.140]  So they were early on that. Hey, what if we monetize by having some users pay?
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:26.140]  But the truth is to be just to let's just say it as a relevant factor in people's day to day lives.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:34.140]  Flicker is not what it once was by far and clearly sort of Instagram came in and ate their cake on mobile.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:41.140]  Like flicker never became a phone thing. I know they have an app, but it just never became it.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:48.140]  To me, as a user, it was of the Web era of the 2000s. Right.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:57.140]  Like, you know, the early years of during Fireball, that 2003, four or five, six, seven period of.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:06.140]  When somebody would make a cool new thing, that cool new thing was a Web site and you'd go to flick, you know, you take out a vowel.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:11.140]  Get the dot com and have it and have the hitch be.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:19.140]  This is the thing. Oh, this is a place where you can post photos and then follow your friends and see their photos.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:25.140]  And it's like, oh, that sounds cool. And then you do it. But where do you think they got lost?
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:36.140]  It's always a bit of a mystery to me how something that was cool and fun and never to me made one catastrophic mistake or went bad in a certain way.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:42.140]  But it just sort of faded out of relevance. And I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts about that.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:55.140]  Right. Like Flickr is, oh, God, like formative years on the Internet for me. Right. Like it defined my photography style. I posted in so many stranger groups. Right.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:01.140]  Like just Internet strangers like complimenting my work and telling me where I'm doing things wrong and where I can do better.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:10.140]  It was wonderful. It defined me as a photographer. And, you know, like the team behind the original Flickr was exceptional.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:18.140]  Right. Like Heather Champ was their original community leader and she coined the term don't be creepy.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:29.140]  Right. Like everyone knows that guy. Don't be that guy as they're, you know, like put that just encoded in their user agreement from the beginning.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:37.140]  And like that was a huge inspiration for our own code of conduct and having a defined, you know, don't be creepy.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:49.140]  Don't be a white supremacist, no hate speech. Right. Like having that ingrained at the beginning, we launched with account reporting and blocking so we could know immediately.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:53.140]  Right. And you could delete your account on day one of Glass.
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:08:06.140]  You know, we prioritize those community features and it cost us development. Right. Like we we launched with features that we wanted and we launched without features that we wanted because we knew those were more important.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:15.140]  And so like talking about Flickr makes me, you know, like that was like my first love. Right. Like my first love on the Internet and then it just kind of went away.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:24.140]  Right. Like they missed the boat on phones. They had a really, really bad app. I remember using it on an iPad. At least they had an iPad app.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:31.140]  But like, you know, like the app didn't work great. They didn't allow things to be easily shared to other platforms.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:41.140]  And then the people left. Right. You know, like as soon as there's something cool and new that gets you eyeballs, you just kind of they kind of leave.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:47.140]  We've been very clear when we've been talking about Glass that Glass is a community, not a marketing channel.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:54.140]  Right. Like if you're coming as a photographer to try to build your business on Glass, you're going to have a hard time.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:09:06.140]  It's not that we don't want you to succeed, but like that's not what it's for. There's a it is built for sharing your work with other people who can help you improve and where you can find inspiration from.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:15.140]  Right. Like it's an inward thing, not an outward thing. And Flickr had a lot of those same vibes of like, this is about your own photography.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:23.140]  This is about coming in. This is about learning more. This is about growing as opposed to this is about making money.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:31.140]  I mean, and from my end, I think Flickr missed the boat because of their inability to pivot to mobile quickly and to make a really good app.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:42.140]  And then they lost they lost that mind share. And then Instagram just became the dominant player in what it was for photographers, how they grew their businesses.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.140]  It's, you know, it became this huge thing. And I was this is before, you know, Facebook purchased them.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:54.140]  And this was like 20 2010. That's kind of when Instagram came on the scene, you know, and then they got bought by Facebook in 2012.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.140]  And I think Flickr was just they're just, you know, slow.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:11.140]  And then I think they also maybe became slightly paralyzed by having kind of an existing product and having to make difficult choices to streamline that product and let some of the stuff go and like refocus and re.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:16.140]  And so they kind of kept building on it, you know, like products and get really overly bloated.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:20.140]  I mean, you know, I'm thinking of like Microsoft Ribbon UI.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:29.140]  Yeah. You know, like they would just like, you know, I think that that became a challenge for Flickr to deal with that and then having a great community and how to how to manage that.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:34.140]  I think it's difficult. You know, I had friends who work there, so I don't want to, you know.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:45.140]  Because it was a difficult it's difficult to manage that product, but I think, you know, some of the leadership changes, I think really just, you know, being purchased by Yahoo, maybe not having the resources they needed to do those things, maybe having a difficult time making those bets and choices and changes.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.140]  There's a lot of reasons that pile up, but I loved it, too.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.140]  I still have one of my closest friends I met through Flickr.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.140]  She's still my friend today.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:11:01.140]  And, you know, I think that's, you know, it's disappointing that those things like, you know, had to go away, although it still exists.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:15.140]  It's just not anything that it was. And so a lot of, you know, like why I built glass and why we built glass together is like this is to bring back those really positive vibes that stuff that happened there at that time.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.140]  I do think.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:29.140]  And Tom, I think as a product designer and experienced designer, really, I know that it's design, you know, we could do a giant entire episode about what designer means.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:50.140]  But, you know, when you think about things from the inside and how they should be like to me, one of the problems with Flickr always was even though the people were good, friendly people who clearly cared about design and really the founders like Stuart and Katarina and all the early employees who I knew, like Heather.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:59.140]  I know Heather personally, and they're good people who love to make fun, simple things that you'd say, oh, that's a little joyful little design.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:05.140]  But Flickr itself was always confusing in certain ways to me.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:12.140]  And there were like totally different ways to do batch editing where one of them was loaded up in.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:26.140]  It might have even been flash player at the time, there was certain, you know, and there was like two entirely different ways to do batch editing and different ways to make things like that you would think of as an album.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:43.140]  And I would get so confused, I'd be like, oh, I just came back from South by Southwest, and I have a whole bunch of photos I would like to share that, you know, these are all photos that, you know, group events and friends I see from all over the world who came to South by Southwest, I'd like to make a little album of 20 photos and share it.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:59.140]  And I'd be like, how the hell did I do that the last time? I just did it at Macworld a couple, you know, eight months ago. What the heck do I, how do I do it? And I'd get lost. And I feel like that complexity eventually caught up to them and really did catch up to them at the moment of mobile.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:20.140]  Right. And that's what I think is that the iPhone came out and they just, you know, it really, in hindsight, it just maps to me as the iPhone comes out in middle 2007 and Flickr's relevance started declining.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:35.140]  And it really picked up and you could detect it at the time around the iPhone 4, 4S 2010, 2011, when it became less of an oddity, like, hey, you have an iPhone, right?
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:43.140]  Which all of us who had iPhones in the early years remember what that was like, where you would just be in the grocery store and a random person would say, hey, is that an iPhone?
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:53.140]  Because I was doing my shopping list and I was like, yeah, they had no idea. It wasn't like somebody local who's like, you're John Gruber, the guy writes Darren Farr. They had no idea who I was. They were just like, hey, what do you think of the iPhone?
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:14:21.140]  But around that time where everybody started having an iPhone, their relevance went down. And I think back, it's a sign of great CEO leadership to be able to make a decision like Zuckerberg did to say, we have this thing. It's a runaway hit called Facebook that is designed as a website you go to on a PC or a Mac and load up in a browser window.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:33.140]  And we've got all these features that are basically, you know, roughly, you know, if you took like, if you were going to do your prototypes on paper, you could use like an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper, but it's the whole paper.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:47.140]  We're going to redesign this for something on a three and a half inch diagonal touchscreen and all of the other limits of a phone versus a browser, the slow internet of cellular, blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:15:00.140]  And they did it. And, you know, Bill Gates had a famous moment like that in 1997, where he wrote a company wide memo at Microsoft that they were going to stop everything. We're rebuilding the whole company around the internet.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:12.140]  And, you know, for people who weren't around at the time and paying attention to technology at the time, you could say, well, that seems ridiculous that it took until 1997 for Microsoft to do that.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:28.140]  But it really was true that up until that time, computer networks were like proprietary things, right? Like PC networks in the enterprise were like based on novel technology and becoming a novel certified engineer was a way to get a career in IT.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:39.140]  And the idea that everybody would just use this, this thing that was completely open source, what the hell is that? And there's no company that owns the rights to the HTTP spec.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:49.140]  And we're going to do it. And, you know, pivot the whole company from forget about proprietary networking, we're going to build for the web, we're going to make a popular web browser, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:59.140]  Apple had moments like that under Steve Jobs. Flickr never made that moment. They never had that. And I don't know if it was possible, right? But I think it definitely would have required them to cut a lot of features.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:04.140]  And it doesn't seem like they ever had that in them.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:23.140]  Yeah. And I think that's, you could point to that too. And I often like, I don't like personally, I'm not wild about the metaverse future or the change to meta, but I often wonder if, if that is like I've been, you know, I worked with Mark for four years and it was a small team.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:34.140]  I was like, there was only 10 designers when I was at Facebook when we started. So when I started and it was small and I was in charge of mobile, like it was just this little thing in the corner, right? Like it was, everybody had Blackberries when I started at Facebook.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:40.140]  So it was a, it was like 2009 and I was like, I got an iPhone cause I was like, I'm not having a Blackberry.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:52.140]  You just don't want, you know, like it was like, it was fine. But like, you know, I was, I was wrong plenty with you know, bringing my product ideas to Mark and him choosing a different one.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:59.140]  Uh, so I have no idea where that'll go, but we could be looking back and be like, well, yes, you look, they pivoted the whole company and that was the right call.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:13.140]  Uh, I just, I don't really want it to go that way in the internet. You know, like I'm just not wild about the metaverse, but that's just a personal thing. Not, not because it's might be where we're going and maybe I'm just old. So I haven't figured that out yet.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:23.140]  You've just cursed. I guarantee you now, the next time I have you guys on the show, we'll be talking about the new version of Glass for the Apple AR headset.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:28.140]  Oh, I know. And I'm going to be, I'm just, Oh, I know that it's coming.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.140]  God, do we have to do NFTs now? Like, come on.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:39.140]  No, no, we're not going there, but, but I'm still helpful. I've, I just wanted to mention, I put this in print.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:53.140]  It is my sincere hope. And I'm not saying that if they do use the M word that it means we're in trouble, but I have, I'm very optimistic that whenever Apple does have an event where they say, and here's our next thing, it's this headset for AR and VR.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.140]  I don't think they're going to use the word metaverse.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.140]  And I'm not saying, Oh yeah, they're going to kill it.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:04.140]  We're getting a new word and we're all going to use it immediately. It's going to be beautiful. I can't wait.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:13.140]  The new word, we still get fearful that there's going to be some AR headset and they're going to call it Glass or something like that.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:25.140]  And we, we, Daniel, every time there's an Apple event, we watch it and hold our, hold our breath because we just don't, you know, the reason it's called Glass is for the transparency of like what we're trying to do and all that.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.140]  But also the slang term that photographers use to call their lenses, they call it Glass.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:37.140]  So that's where it came from. And my hope was always that, you know, Google Glass really just poisoned the well for that word for anything related to AR VR.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:41.140]  But who knows? It felt like a good time.
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:47.140]  I like your odds. I like your odds that nobody else is going to want to use it.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:54.140]  And Apple certainly wouldn't because Google had sort of spoiled it and it was there for the taking for an entirely different concept, right?
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.140]  The app, it works perfectly.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:01.140]  Yeah, I think you get your odds are good. All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor and then we'll bring this show home.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.140]  And I want to tell you about this great company Trade Coffee.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:14.140]  Now, 90 percent of the coffee you could buy from the grocery store, even if you've got like a cool hipster grocery store, it's actually already stale.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:20.140]  You heard that right. The coffee, you know, and you think you love needs an upgrade. It is coffee is a produce.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:29.140]  It really is. Even after it's been roasted, you roast it and then it has a shelf life and that shelf life is not that long.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:40.140]  Instead of rebuying the same old, same old off the shelf, let Trade Coffee send you coffee that's freshly roasted and that you are literally guaranteed to love.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:46.140]  They sell the freshest roasted and ethically sourced beans from America's best independent roasters.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.140]  They ship it for free to you as frequently as you like.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:58.140]  You set the schedule for how much you want, how often, and you pick whether you want it in whole beans that you'll grind yourself or pre ground.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:11.140]  Whether you're a coffee nerd or you just want a better daily cup, Trade's real coffee experts taste test over 400 roasts and they use technology to match you to your ideal coffees based on your preferences and your brewing methods.
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.140]  They have a simple coffee quiz to get started.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:20.140]  They guarantee you will love your first bag. This is the guarantee they're talking about, or they will replace it for free.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:30.140]  They've been featured by sites like The New York Times, Wired, GQ, and they have already delivered over 5 million bags of coffee and their subscription is no hassle.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:38.140]  You can skip shipments like if you're going on vacation or something, change your frequency if you realize you're not getting enough or you're getting too much.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:44.140]  You can pace it out differently at any time and if you don't like it, you don't want it anymore.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:49.140]  If you're crazy enough to give up coffee, you can cancel at any time.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:56.140]  It's really great. I took their coffee quiz. It was simple, very easy, very easy for me. I have very strong taste and I make my coffee the same way.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:01.140]  I really recommend it if you're interested. It couldn't be an easier way to get started.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:10.140]  And for listeners of the talk show, right now they're offering a total of 20 bucks off your first three bags when you go to www.drinktrade.com.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:15.140]  That's their address. www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:21.140]  So to get started, just go to www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show. Take their simple, easy quiz.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:28.140]  It's not work. It's not like going to school. It is actually fun. It's a good way to know that you're getting the amount and type of coffee you like.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:33.140]  Start your journey to the perfect cup. That's once again, www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:39.140]  Get 20 bucks off your first three bags. My thanks to Trade Coffee.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:49.140]  Home stretch. I want to talk about the we've talked about the iOS only angle, which is one aspect that it limits the size of the market.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:55.140]  You know, if you're on Android right now, it's it's tough luck. I happen to notice I haven't written about it on Daring Fireball,
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:03.140]  but I subscribe to the print version of The New Yorker and I noticed their inside back cover of the most recent issue.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:11.140]  It was a house ad. I presumably they just went on sold. And so it's an ad for The New Yorker's own New Yorker app.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:19.140]  And it just says, get, you know, read all the articles and play games and puzzles on The New Yorker app.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:27.140]  And then on the bottom, it just says as the available on the app store button and then there's a QR code you can scan.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:31.140]  But it immediately jumped out to me. They don't have a button for the Play Store.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:37.140]  And I scanned the QR code even to see, does it take you to a picker where you can pick Android or iOS?
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:44.140]  And no, it's just the iOS version, which I thought was strange for something that you wouldn't think would be technically limited.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:50.140]  But it as much as some people and Adam Mosseri even pointed out Android is bigger.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:59.140]  But I suspect that Android, you know, that's sort of throwing shade at Apple in terms of its importance to Instagram.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:05.140]  Like they may have more users on Android, but I really doubt they think the Android audience is more important than their iOS audience.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.140]  It's different. And people don't we don't talk about it. We collectively don't talk about it.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:23.140]  But it it's not like a completely it's not even vaguely a random distribution of the interests and like artistic inclination, for example, of iOS and Android users.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:30.140]  Right. Like it's not surprising to me that Glass is iOS only.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:39.140]  It would be if with the exact same level of attention and the exact same design, as much as it makes sense, if it were Android only, that would seem odd to me.
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:50.140]  I've never because then all of a sudden I'd say it would be the first time in at this point, 15 years where I thought, wow, here's a cool thing for Android that I'm missing out on.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:56.140]  I'm not an Android user. That's that has never happened to me. I mean, I mean that without exaggeration.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:01.140]  And I say that it's like, well, of course, you know, John Gruber is a big fan of Apple's platforms.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:08.140]  But as a lifelong or at least my entire lifelong Apple computer user, going back to Apple to when I was growing up.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:16.140]  There were plenty of times when I was jealous, envious of things that were PC only, certainly games when I was more into games.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:25.140]  You know, you certainly can't be a lifelong Mac user who had any interest at video games in your life and not not have been jealous of the PC gaming market.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:37.140]  And, you know, in like the late 90s of, you know, when the Mac was in trouble and Apple was correctly described as beleaguered and the whole, you know, all right, Steve Jobs is back and we're going to build this new thing.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.140]  But it's going to take us four years to take what we bought from next and ship it.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.140]  And even when we do, it's going to be kind of slow and take a couple more years to really get good.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.140]  There were things like Napster that were Windows only.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:56.140]  And then it took months and months and then third parties who were unaffiliated with the actual Napster group.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.140]  There was a thing called Maxter that was a Mac Napster client.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.140]  And it was actually kind of fun and really well done and made by.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.140]  But you missed out on stuff.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.140]  You know, it wasn't true with the iPhone.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.140]  It's not really true.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:17.140]  And then the other factor is that you guys are using sign in with Apple as your one and only credential system so far.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:21.140]  And I'd love to hear your thinking behind that.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:40.140]  Because I think some people out there, let's face it, with some of the criticisms of the App Store and Apple's share that they take, there are some people who in today's world would think, launch a new thing iOS only and build on sign in with Apple as your identity.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.140]  And is it true?
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:42.140]  Are you guys for subscriptions?
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:47.140]  They all go through the App Store, correct?
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.140]  That's correct.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.140]  Right.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.140]  So talk about that.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:26:00.140]  Well, talk about that, because I think that's very it's a different perspective than a lot of people would come up with for something that launched in 2021.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:15.140]  Yeah, I think the well, we're very lean to borrow the like, but there's just not we had to choose what we could build and what we would we would have to do in building all of the sign in stuff up front.
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:19.140]  We could leverage Apple's tools, and that really was helpful for us.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.140]  Also, the timing of it.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:30.140]  I mean, like we were watching, you know, as base camp through some signals was like, you know, going through their whole thing with the new mail client.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.140]  I'm forgetting the name all of a sudden.
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:35.140]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, thank you.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:35.140]  Yes.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:42.140]  And you're watching that and then seeing the 15 percent, you know, go down to really open it up for us and allowed us to do it.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:53.140]  We don't like we're we're definitely wanting as we move to the Web, like to look into alternative methods for to logging in and signing in.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.140]  We're safe on my co founder and I we've been talking about it heavily and what we should do and like alternative payments.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:04.140]  But like launching with Apple, we wanted a premium experience for a premium product.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.140]  We knew that it's what we used.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:08.140]  It's what we were used to using.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.140]  What we know is what we love. We wanted an iPad app.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:16.140]  We wanted to play by the rules, you know, work well with Apple.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.140]  And so we went there first.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:31.140]  It didn't seem to make sense in 2021 to launch like our type of product as a Web product first and then bring it to the mobile experiences like it felt like it needed to be on a phone first.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.140]  Mobile first seemed extremely clear to us.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:38.140]  And so the logic just followed. Also, it's just what we could build.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.140]  Like we had an iOS engineer.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.140]  We didn't have an Android engineer, which don't have a team for it.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:47.140]  It's not to say that we wouldn't try to bring a product there to them at some point.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.140]  We have a lot of people who would like it to happen.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.140]  And I think we would like to.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:56.140]  It's just we don't have the expertise in house.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.140]  It's also an abuse factor, right?
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:10.140]  Like it is requiring to do Apple sign on only is is a massive load off of my mind and my plate because you are you right.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:12.140]  Like you sign up as yourself.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.140]  You have your credit card attached.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:17.140]  That's that we have our you know, the single sign on.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:21.140]  That's great. It's next to impossible to create more than one spam account.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.140]  It's next to impossible to abuse the system.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:30.140]  Create you know, we have a two week free trial at the beginning of every new member subscribing.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:38.140]  And like that two weeks could easily be filled with spam and then deleted if that was just email, right?
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:43.140]  Like a spam account could like I mentioned earlier that we've only removed like three accounts.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:49.140]  One of those accounts was a brand account who signed up and tried to follow the entire platform.
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:52.140]  Their user profile was their logo.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:59.140]  They had their link out to their new app and then they just tried to follow every single photographer on glass.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.140]  There's a fun little screen at the very end of glass.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:06.140]  If you follow all whatever it is like 10,000 15,000 accounts where it says you followed.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:19.140]  We need to do a better job of showing you people and like they were trying to find that screen that no one has seen because it's ridiculous to follow all of the thousands and thousands of accounts and we had to remove them.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.140]  Right. And that was it.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:24.140]  Then they were gone that you know, they didn't they didn't show back up.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:26.140]  We updated and released a quick policy around.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:29.140]  Hey, no brand accounts if you're trying to sell their photographers, right?
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:33.140]  Like if you're a photographer who operates under a brand, come on in, you're good to go.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:35.140]  But no brand accounts.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:39.140]  And since then we've had to remove zero brand accounts because it didn't work right.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:46.140]  Like we the the attention that they were trying to Gardner on our platform didn't work.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:54.140]  And that's huge. And I attribute that partially to having Apple only ID for our sign in.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.140]  I recall the first time that I mean the privacy angle from Apple to.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.140]  Oh, sorry, John.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.140]  No, no, go ahead. No, go ahead.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.140]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:11.140]  Oh, I just I thought that, you know, I mean, we were going to we wanted to sign with Apple because of the you know, also the privacy angle that aligned with our our goals as a company.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:14.140]  You know, like we we want to you know, we don't want to track your data.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.140]  We don't want it. So there's like, you know, Google sign in and Facebook sign in.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:25.140]  And, you know, we just we chose apples because of the platform we started on, but also just the privacy was was really important to us.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:30.140]  And, you know, people can sign up and it causes us headaches sometimes because, like, email addresses and connections.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:36.140]  But you have to hide when you sign in with Apple, you know, you could hide your email address, which we think is great, you know, to help prevent spam.
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:44.140]  And we like that ourselves. But, you know, it can be challenging as a platform because associating you with your account can be, you know, difficult.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.140]  But we thought the tradeoff was worth it.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:54.140]  You can see why identity is an incredibly tricky problem for any service.
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:31:09.140]  And whenever you talk whenever I talk to anybody who's been involved in running anything, you know, and talking to Heather back in the day about Flickr and, you know, and success brings in the undesirable elements.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:13.140]  Right. And so it's so easy to see.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:21.140]  And the other thing, too, is it seems like best practices are kind of hard to find.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:36.140]  And in a way, in some ways, having like Stack Overflow and you can just when you're writing a computer program and whatever your language is or, you know, and you run into a specific problem and you just go to your favorite search engine and search for it.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:47.140]  And you go to like Stack Overflow and you get an answer and you do it is so much more convenient than the old days of having these big phone book books from phone book books from O'Reilly.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:54.140]  But on the other hand, it was always kind of nice to have programming books where it's like JavaScript, the definitive guide.
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:32:00.140]  And it's like, well, if it's in JavaScript circa whatever the year was, it's documented in this book.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:03.140]  You know, it's it's you can like know it.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:12.140]  It's hard to find like the definitive guide to identity, you know, and all of the little things like, you know, how do you confirm an email address?
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:28.140]  What do you do? What's the best practice for sending someone a six digit code versus putting a button or doing both and sending them an email that says you can either click here and it'll log you in because now your email is confirmed.
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:32.140]  And how much do you let people do before they confirm their email?
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:46.140]  Like I've signed up with my good address at example dot com and I've created a password and now I'm in I've given you a email and password and you've sent a confirmation email address.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:56.140]  But a message to me and I eventually need to confirm it so you know that it actually I typed it right and I wasn't sending it to somebody against their will.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.140]  But at the meantime, what should I be allowed to do?
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:09.140]  It's the list is it would be a thick book to write like the definitive guide to best practices for identity on a mobile service or any service right now.
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:15.140]  So the appeal of sign in with Google, sign in with Twitter, sign in with Facebook, it's obvious.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:29.140]  And the downside I mean Apple spelled this out when they announced the sign in with Apple is the downside is it turns out those companies weren't just doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.140]  They were doing it as shocker.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:43.140]  No, they were doing it as part of they it was like it was like win win win for the people who wanted to you're making a service.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:50.140]  And if you let Google worry about and Facebook worry about the identity stuff, well, that's off your engineering team's plate.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:59.140]  Google and Facebook and Twitter collected information about the users who were doing this and where they were going and exactly how much time they were doing.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:06.140]  And the part that wasn't win win win was that users didn't necessarily come out totally win win.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:15.140]  Like on the one hand, it was a win in terms of convenience. Hey, I've already got a Facebook account and a Google account.
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.140]  Now, the only problem is I just have to choose which one to use for this service.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:21.140]  And I trust those companies to some degree.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:23.140]  Right. I know it sounds funny to trust Facebook.
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:25.140]  You know, they're not a fly by night company.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.140]  And so, you know, there's like a trust factor of I'm not creating a new password.
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:32.140]  I don't have a new password to manage.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:35.140]  But the flip side was the loss of privacy.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.140]  Right. And we're all talking about that now.
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:42.140]  And maybe we weren't really not even maybe we weren't 10 years ago.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:47.140]  That's right. Yeah. And I think that they're like saying it the way it is now.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:55.140]  And then, like, we could we thought we could trust Apple in this regard and that we could we could use their service for it.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:57.140]  And it would work well for.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:00.140]  Well, just to help us solve a lot of the problems.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:05.140]  John, do you know the service letterboxed? Yeah. We review services.
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:10.140]  I love them. I absolutely love them. Yeah.
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:19.140]  Yeah. And so, Matt Buchanan and I, we talked to him pretty regularly about this problem and kind of how they've dealt with it over the last.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:28.140]  You know, I think they're coming up on a decade now of being in service and they have a different set of problems because, you know, when they launched the freemium model was really popular.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.140]  And, you know, like so they have a free accounts and then you can, you know, become a pro member, which is great.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:36.140]  But it creates like a massive headache. And, you know, we we sometimes get criticized.
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:45.140]  We offer, you know, a two week trial and we've even extended it for for people, you know, if they need more time to like evaluate the service.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:48.140]  But they decrease it on a spam accounts. It creates a ton of headaches.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.140]  It creates so much work. And I talked to him about that.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:58.140]  And I think, like, you know, we we opted for it. You know, you're just a paid upfront membership.
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.140]  Like, I think, you know, I think that's the right approach for Glass.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:06.140]  It is something we considered heavily. We continue to debate it internally.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:10.140]  How to like, you know, continue to make sure we get enough growth, enough membership.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:18.140]  But we really feel like that authenticity you get by requiring a commitment of a small financial commitment.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:23.140]  It's, you know, 30 dollars a year. It's not a ton of money to become this member.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:27.140]  Like really changes the dynamic. And Daniel's talked about it a lot.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:34.140]  And I think I think that's where we see, like, some of the advantages that other platforms.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:40.140]  Like struggle with, and we hope that it can also be a model where you just, you know, you'd be part of this community.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:45.140]  It's it's worth a little bit of your money and time and you'll get a lot out of it.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:57.140]  A day or two after we launched the iPad app, I sent out a tweet about what 30 dollars a year buys you in a screenshot of our app privacy next to Instagram's app privacy.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:06.140]  Because the data linked to you on Glass is your contact info, your photos and your identifiers, which I'm assuming is just the contact info, Tom.
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.140]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:12.140]  Yeah, it's it's just it's like as little as we could do, but we have to like connect you to a few things.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.140]  Right. Yeah.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:20.140]  And then the data used to track you on Instagram is your contact info, your identifiers and other data.
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:33.140]  And the data linked to you is health and fitness, financial info, contact info, user content, browser history, usage data, diagnostics, purchases, location, contacts, search history, identifiers, sensitive info and other data.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.140]  What the shit? Right.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:45.140]  Like that is outrageous. And, you know, we have people that complain that we cost two dollars and 50 cents a month all the time.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:52.140]  But like I would pay three dollars to not have Instagram track me across the Internet happily.
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:57.140]  Right. Like if I could pay Facebook 100 bucks a year to forget me sold.
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:02.140]  Right. Like we are so cavalier with what we just give away.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.140]  And it's it's a bummer.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:09.140]  What are the prices for glass? I think it's changed since you launched it.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:20.140]  Yeah. So we launched with twenty nine ninety nine as our array we're launching, but it was originally going to be fifty dollars a year or five dollars a month.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:31.140]  But after we got a couple of months of data and, you know, finances in the bank, we realized that we could keep our year our year subscription at thirty dollars.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:36.140]  So it costs thirty dollars a month or that equivalent thirty dollars a year.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:40.140]  Right. Thirty dollars. Right. Right. With with a nice little bonus.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:44.140]  Right. And it's like the right level. We do this. I think we have very similar pricing.
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:58.140]  It might pay dithering podcast where it's, you know, five bucks a month and something less than five times twelve a year as a reward for people who are willing to commit to it to an annual schedule.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:09.140]  One of the things Flickr did, I think, great back in the day, shifting from a totally free I mean, maybe they had to because they couldn't just make say everybody has to pay all of a sudden because they started free.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:15.140]  But when they added Flickr pro accounts, they had features.
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:22.140]  It was like you could upload more photos or bigger photos and, you know, there were features for pro users.
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:31.140]  But the other thing they did is they put a pro badge on your avatar. And I don't I think it was kind of genius.
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:37.140]  And Flickr always had a bit of a community where people would comment on photos.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:48.140]  And I've you know, how many people signed up for Flickr just to get the badge as opposed to actually needing the pro features?
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:40:03.140]  I don't know. And I also think that part of it wasn't just ego and self serving and because Flickr never had that sort of influencer sort of mentality to the community at any level.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:09.140]  I think it was just that people had an affinity for the service and the company and wanted to support it.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:18.140]  And the fact that you got a badge to show that you're a supporter helped to do that. It wasn't just look at me, my, you know,
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:24.140]  Daring Fireball logo, you know, avatar now has a pro badge on it.
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:30.140]  And it wasn't anything like the weird way that people talk about blue checks on Twitter.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:41.140]  Right. Getting verified on Twitter and Instagram is this has this enormous cache that honestly I don't understand or get.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:45.140]  And even though my Twitter account is verified, I never asked for it or signed up for it.
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:51.140]  It was during that era after Matt Honan got hacked through his his Twitter account.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:56.140]  There must have been some list of people who were like Matt Honan and I was on it.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:05.140]  And it was like they realized journalists and people who are famous for doing stuff on the Internet were targets for having their accounts taken over.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:12.140]  And they verified me without me even asking for it. I'm not trying to be it sounded like a humble brag, but the Twitter pro badge wasn't like that.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:19.140]  It wasn't like people ever talked about it. But I can't help but think that it helped them that people had an affinity for the service.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:24.140]  And I'm just curious, like you mentioned it, you know, you guys do have a two week free trial.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:27.140]  But that is, to me, the the missing what if.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:36.140]  And it's almost it sounds like you don't really have plans to have like a free, a permanently free tier or, you know, like never saying I know never say never.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:43.140]  But it sounds not immediate, but I think we've considered, you know, how do we broaden it?
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:50.140]  Like, how can we a lot of photographers would love to have more people on glass to see their stuff and how can they love free accounts?
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:56.140]  But we go that we kind of spin around and loops as to what the value would be for the community and how does that really work?
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:59.140]  We never say never, but it's not on our immediate roadmap.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:03.140]  When you also go well, trade offs all the way down.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:17.140]  Yes, all the way down. And but it would be interesting. We've talked about pro accounts, you know, something that's like more, more features, more things that we could offer to those those members who really have a strong affinity towards.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:21.140]  We have some, you know, super fans and how can we do more for them?
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:26.140]  So we have that's something we'd like to really look into more.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:30.140]  Man, you really are just dragging out our whole roadmap out of us.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:38.140]  Well, I know that I'm only telling you what you already know and which I'm sure you've encountered yourselves.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:45.140]  But, you know, and it's not like I'm out here like John the Baptist proselytizing glass to every single person.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.140]  I mean, if you could be, that would be great. That would actually be really wonderful.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.140]  We would appreciate it.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:43:04.140]  But there comes a point, though, when you want to tell somebody who maybe is, you know, bemoans the loss of the Instagram they fell in love with 10 years ago and isn't as happy with where it is today.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:11.140]  And, you know, you could even don't even have to talk about features like stories and reels and just talk about how how many ads there are.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:21.140]  I counted the other day knowing that you guys are going to be on the show, and it was one out of every four posts in my timeline was a sponsored entry.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:30.140]  And I know that fame, you know, part of the reason they're so profitable is their sponsored entries are better than almost all ads on the web.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.140]  They are more relevant to me.
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:43.140]  And I've got, you know, I'm a watch nerd and eventually I go down a rabbit hole on Instagram of watches. And then, of course, for the next few weeks, I see ads for watches, but which aren't the worst ads to show me.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.140]  You know, it's not the worst, but it is.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:48.140]  It's so there's so many of them.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:55.140]  It's like one out of every four posts to me is just an absurd ratio.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:58.140]  But, you know, it's an incredible shopping app.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:02.140]  So it is a wonderful shopping experience.
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.140]  It's just not a really great place to share your photography.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:21.140]  You know, we talked about doing an ad campaign where we would buy ads on like Twitter or Instagram where it's like your photos deserve more than a shopping app or your photos deserve more than this dumpster fire.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:29.140]  Your photos deserve more than the revived Tumblr at WordPress. Your photos deserve more than a WordPress site. Right.
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:33.140]  Like and then we just couldn't bring ourselves to do it. Right.
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:40.140]  Like we couldn't bring ourselves to buy the advertising space on Instagram to tell people that this mattered more.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:45.140]  And like is that is that moral stand costing us users and growth?
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.140]  Absolutely. Right.
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:56.140]  Like but, you know, like it how you make these decisions across your brand and across your company matter.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:07.140]  You know, like it's one thing for us to say that we're all about privacy, but it's another to launch with account deletion on day one and Apple ID sign on.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:20.140]  It matters that we aren't feeding the machine that we think is, you know, like slowly killing the Internet and ourselves mentally right to try to get a couple more users.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:28.140]  Right. Like the hundreds of users that we would get from that ad campaign aren't worth what we would have to give up as a company.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:38.140]  Yeah, it's a trade off. You're very well aware of of when you tell people it's a paid service and yes, there's a two week free trial and you know, you can do it as much as you want.
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:43.140]  Get is get the full immersive experience of being on glass for two weeks before you're charged a penny.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:50.140]  And if you don't like it, it really is. Apple ensures that it is easy to say, you know, cancel this before I get charged.
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:46:01.140]  But you tell people that if they want to stick with it, they have to pay and there's a they don't want to say it because everybody is upset about the way Instagram has gone south and the number of ads.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:06.140]  On the flip side, there's a lot of people who are still like, I don't want to pay for a thing.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:09.140]  It doesn't matter how nice it is. It's you know, and it's natural, right?
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:20.140]  Like if you didn't have a limiting factor in your brain of at least thinking twice before any new subscription, you know, you you'd run out of money, right?
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:25.140]  Because there's subscriptions left and right. And so, of course, people have a natural.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:30.140]  OK, I mean, think twice before I subscribe to something. It seems like you guys are aware of that, though.
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:36.140]  And and, you know, yeah, we're trying to find the right trade off.
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:42.140]  I think it's just like, can we, you know, and, you know, we will we want to make more tools for photographers and more things.
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:46.140]  And so, like, as we grow, we can find other opportunities to explore it.
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:50.140]  But it's just, yeah, right now we have to.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:57.140]  We have to focus on, like, the paying membership and listening to them, and it resonates with a lot of members.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:01.140]  So, you know, we just we're yeah, you know, I don't have to be belaboring the point right now.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:06.140]  That's it's a good answer, you know. But all right. Last question is long, similar lines.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:23.140]  I wonder how much what your perception is of how much glass feels, looks, seems or maybe just is for semi-serious photographers and up.
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:27.140]  You know, you know, like where that line is.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:36.140]  I mean, you know, it's right there on the name, like the glass is comes from lingo that photographers use to talk about their lenses.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:43.140]  Whereas if you're talking about people who have ever bought a lens.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:49.140]  Right. It's a limited subset of the number of people who use those shoot photos.
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:57.140]  Right. Point and shoot cameras with built in lenses were always more popular than SLRs back when every camera was a dedicated camera.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:04.140]  And glass has to me decided it.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:13.140]  I think you're striking a very interesting balance of being very welcoming and not not coming across as camera nerd snobby.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:24.140]  But there is sort of a vibe that an awful lot of people on glass are are even if they're not professional, they're prosumer photographers.
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:32.140]  And I'm curious, you know what, how you guys see glass in that regard.
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:47.140]  One of my one of my favorite things that's happened on the platform is seeing people who join with their iPhones and then within a month or two post that they bought their first camera.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:55.140]  Right. Like where it just makes my heart explode with joy. I'm like the Grinch on Christmas through gross three sizes every time it happens.
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:04.140]  And so, you know, like there are people that join glass, look at the photos and go, oh, well, like, holy shit, these are way better than mine.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:10.140]  And like same feeling, y'all like I have that same imposter syndrome.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:15.140]  I was a professional photographer for years. And yet I'm still like, I don't I don't know.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.140]  Like my stuff isn't as good as some of these people. It's like that's the point.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:32.140]  Right. Like it is with how we've been trained to think of attention on the Internet as a competition and that there are only a limited set of eyeballs and there's only a limited set of information and money available.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:46.140]  Right. Like Instagram and the social web for the last decade has like really trapped us in this scarcity mindset around skill and joy and fun.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:49.140]  And like that, that's that's bullshit.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:58.140]  Right. Like we don't have to feel that way. And because of how we built glass, you know, like we launched as comment only.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.140]  We didn't have anything we call our likes, appreciations.
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:15.140]  But they came three months after launch because we wanted to set comments as a lower friction, lower value, more engagement thing.
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:20.140]  Because right now, right. You know, like on Twitter and on Instagram, like you don't really comment that much.
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:27.140]  It's you know, like you hit the fave button, you hit the heart button and you keep going or you you know, you retweet something.
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:34.140]  But like having a conversation and talking has become this higher value thing that you only do for a couple select few people.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:40.140]  And so because that was the only way that you could interact on the platform for the first three months,
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:47.140]  we set this really great groundwork of people sharing their work and commenting about it and asking questions.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.140]  And then this really wonderful thing happened where people just started sharing their knowledge.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:57.140]  Right. Like it's it's like chefs. Right. You know, like chefs have cookbooks.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:02.140]  You know, like Rene Redzepi, the head chef of Noma writes a cookbook every few years.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:14.140]  Best restaurant in the world. He's not worried about going out of business. Right. Like the technique that he has and the how he cooks the recipes and the context and the skill matters.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:17.140]  But that doesn't mean he can't share his recipes. He can't share his knowledge.
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:21.140]  And yet creatively, we get like so bogged down and like keep everything.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:27.140]  I remember in 2009 on Flickr, I asked a comment. I was like, hey, I really love this editing style.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:33.140]  How do you do it? And he just wouldn't answer. The guy was like, no, I'd rather keep that private.
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:38.140]  And then like six months later, he responded to the comment again and he was like, I don't know why I did that.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.140]  That was really weird of me. I'm just using VSCO filters, man. And I was like, what's VSCO?
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:53.140]  And then I learned about like VSCO's presets. You know, like having having that level of sharing is so weird and hard for photographers.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:52:03.140]  We think that, you know, if we share how we edit a photo or the, you know, metadata or the specifics of how we made a thing, it disappears.
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:09.140]  And now it's just not ours. And we like hoard it when like sharing it makes all of our work better. Right.
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:14.140]  Like the more that you share your work, the more that you share your technique, the better you're going to get.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:20.140]  And like seeing that happen on glass is mind-blowingly joyful. Right.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:27.140]  Like it just warms our hearts. And like, you know, that that has been our biggest signal for product market fit.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:33.140]  As we've been getting, you know, like as we've been reducing our churn and getting more subscribers, we've been like focusing on this.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:44.140]  But like the community health aspect that we're seeing with people sharing their knowledge like that and like recommending other photographers in the comments has been wonderful to see.
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:51.140]  I think it's fascinating. There's there's always a debate of whether you call them likes or loves or hearts or stars or favorites.
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:56.140]  Oh, my God. We called it. So we use we use the sparkle emoji.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:01.140]  And when I was talking to Tom about using that emoji, he was like, cool sparkles.
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:08.140]  I thought that was our internal company name. And it turns out everyone else on the team thought we were really going to call it sparkles.
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:15.140]  Like we were just going to launch with sparkles and like there was like internal debate, like I don't know if we can launch this feature that then I was like, why?
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.140]  Why are you pushing back on this? Like the name's dumb.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:21.140]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, it is. Oh, my God.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:26.140]  Yeah. We're not calling it sparkles. We're calling it appreciation. And then it was like, oh, that's great. Great, great, great.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:31.140]  It's such a good word. I guess this did happen. This did happen.
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:45.140]  I do think that's interesting. Clearly. I mean, I don't think anybody is going to be surprised to find out that three months in when when appreciations were added to the glass experience, there are no public appreciation counts.
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:54.140]  So like if I'm scrolling down and I hit I hit that photo I just spoke about with Ohm, which has a wonderful, wonderful thread of comments.
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:54:01.140]  But again, it's not like Instagram or a popular post has eleven hundred comments and say, how do you how could anybody even read that?
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:11.140]  Right. Like nobody reads all of that. You know, it's a couple of dozen comments talking about the kit that he used and, you know, the trip that he was on and the way that this photo makes them feel.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:17.140]  But there's no thing that says, you know, that this photo has so many, you know, five hundred appreciations or something like that.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:26.140]  It's it's just I if I appreciate it by hitting the sparkle button, Ohm finds out that John Gruber appreciated your photo.
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:30.140]  But that's it. It is private for him. And I don't think anybody would be surprised by that.
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:39.140]  And therefore, there's nothing to be gamified. Right. Which is clearly what has happened with with other sites.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:46.140]  Is there anything else that you guys want to put the hindsight? Anything else you want to bring up before before we call it a show?
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:57.140]  We should have talked about the iPad app and how we have it more than like the iPad app, everybody. Go download it. It's really great.
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:04.140]  There's your ad campaign, Glass, the photo, the photo sharing service with an iPad app.
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:19.140]  So we did that. We did an Apple in app event on the app store. And that was that was literally the copy. It was like, finally, you can enjoy a photo community on the iPad.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:31.140]  It was great. It was great. They let the finally in. Yeah. Yeah. Just use the code talk show for a month off.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:37.140]  Oh, that's a joke. But we should really do that. That's not a joke. Give me give me a minute.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:43.140]  Don't post this in like the next two minutes. And that that code will work. Everybody talk show free month.
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:50.140]  Use your iPad. It's great. We're not going to track you. We're not going to make your brain feel bad. It's just going to feel nice.
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:58.140]  It's going to feel like a nice little massage. Well, I don't have anything more. It's wonderful talking to you, John.
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:04.140]  Oh, well, thank you. You know, I would just like to thank you for your time. Of course.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:11.140]  This was, I thought, a very fun and insightful conversation. But thank you for making Glass, honestly, because I honestly feel the other thing.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:22.140]  And I know, Tom, you talked about how you had this idea nine years ago, you know, and then it takes six years before you crack open a text editor and start actually making the thing.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:31.140]  But I know that there's an untold number of people out there who've had it in their head, like as Instagram changed course and became something different to think eyes.
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:38.140]  You know, couldn't somebody make something, you know, that's just photo sharing and has these different things.
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:45.140]  And I'm just so glad that somebody did it. And it does it. It brings a bit of joy to me every single day.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:51.140]  It really does. And just just a little because, you know, it's not an infinite scroll.
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:53.140]  Well, we appreciate it.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:58.140]  Well, well, what I mean, it makes me that sounds dismissive that you're right.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:12.140]  It sounds like a backhanded compliment, but I mean it as as a front handed compliment, whatever the opposite is, where it also it there's no downsides to my love for Glass because it never it's never like, oh, what happened?
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:24.140]  Ninety minutes went through, went by and I just wasted it all infinite scrolling on Glass. Right. Like there's there are no tradeoffs to becoming a a Glass aficionado because you don't lose your time.
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:27.140]  Your your attention and privacy aren't abused.
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:44.140]  And all you do is see photos that make you happy and and perhaps, as we just talked about, teach you more about creating, composing, editing photographs that look more like the ones that you that you see that you like.
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:57.140]  We had a member a couple a couple of weeks ago in an email send that they they love that they don't lose time on Glass. They spend time on Glass. Right. Like like nothing about it is mindless.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:05.140]  It's all intentional. They're they're choosing to continue to look at photos. They're choosing to explore categories instead of just like, oh, shit.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:17.140]  Like I just where did those 45 minutes go? Well, and that was like a perfect way to distill it down. I was like, thank you for making my job easier by explaining this perfectly.
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:26.140]  You're great. That is absolutely perfect. Well, Daniel Agee and Tom Watson, thank you for your time. And everybody, of course, toss it out there.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:48.140]  Glass Dot Photo. What a domain name. Easy to remember.
