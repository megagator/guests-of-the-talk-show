[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  So what is the deal with Canadian Thanksgiving? I always forget and I should know because they
[00:03.760 --> 00:08.080]  used to always talk about it on the Letterman show because Paul Shaffer was Canadian and I should
[00:08.080 --> 00:13.440]  know this and I don't unfortunately. Yeah we have it in October when you have Columbus day because
[00:13.440 --> 00:18.560]  it freezes here so much earlier so we had to and I think we actually had Thanksgiving before America
[00:18.560 --> 00:24.720]  so we had to get all that stuff done before it just froze here and then you have Columbus day
[00:24.720 --> 00:28.960]  and we have nothing we should have like Jacques Cartier day to get revenge for yeah and the
[00:28.960 --> 00:36.960]  Columbus day thing is sort of turning into a you know yeah it's sort of a crap show yeah because
[00:36.960 --> 00:43.440]  you know Columbus you know it's a mixed bag you know historically what he did here in Philadelphia
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.560]  it's still a big deal though because we have a huge Italian community yeah it's a big big Italian
[00:48.560 --> 00:56.720]  you know South Philly is like a little Italy type you know part of town so the you know we even have
[00:56.720 --> 01:03.200]  there's a street we have Columbus boulevard big street uh it's funny because it's it's Delaware
[01:03.200 --> 01:07.280]  avenue it's a big street right by the Delaware river so it's right along the river you can you
[01:07.280 --> 01:13.200]  know you look over to your side and you see New Jersey um and then when they get when Delaware
[01:13.200 --> 01:20.400]  avenue gets to South Philly it just becomes Columbus boulevard it's it's very political
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.040]  but the weird thing about Canada is that we don't do Easter a month later when things you know
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.360]  unfreeze finally we do it at the same time and that just seems ill-advised I mean Passover is
[01:29.360 --> 01:32.880]  fine because the angel of death is on its own schedule nobody doesn't care about winter but
[01:32.880 --> 01:39.040]  Passover that bunny should be under the snow for another month yeah yeah and Amy's family is on
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.360]  her dad's side is Greek and then there's Greek Easter and that's different than regular Easter
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.760]  so we've got yeah Orthodox Christmas is different you would think if there's one thing the world
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.560]  could agree on it's like a holiday schedule especially when they got to make it up right
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.760]  right but no it is it is all over the place oh man I have got so much stuff to talk about um
[01:59.760 --> 02:06.480]  awesome but before we get to it I assume I either know this for a fact or I would be shocked if the
[02:06.480 --> 02:13.360]  answer is no but you you enjoy uh Lego correct yes absolutely all right I I am not by the way do you
[02:13.360 --> 02:20.080]  do you uh are you a strict um number one do you capitalize it when you write it I hate that I
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.200]  can't stand don't I think I think their word mark is capital but I don't yeah and well and at some
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.920]  point iOS started auto capping it like I guess to you know because that's what people do but it's
[02:29.920 --> 02:36.640]  not an acronym so yes I don't get it I also I like to say that I like to pluralize it as Legos
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.440]  and I know that there's some sticklers out there who would say that they are Lego bricks not
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.880]  not Legos this whole thing's like maths in England and math here but pants here and pant there you
[02:46.880 --> 02:53.760]  just nobody can agree on this stuff yeah but uh I do enjoy the Legos I've developed a terrible
[02:53.760 --> 02:59.440]  habit in recent years of half building some models and then running out of time because I've got you
[02:59.440 --> 03:03.760]  know like a trip or something something interrupts it's not like I lose interest it is like I'm you
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.880]  know it's a big thing so I've got like a half half built death star like from literally like six
[03:08.880 --> 03:14.400]  years ago I don't even know where because we moved I don't even know where it is yes and it was I I
[03:14.400 --> 03:21.040]  remember when we moved I had to you know the moving Lego models is awful it makes you just doubt ever
[03:21.040 --> 03:27.840]  getting into the the hobby it really yeah I had to question last year too why why would I ever
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.400]  buy these things and now we have a bunch of like broken slave one and broken a death star and I
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.360]  don't know what to do with them because like there's no way I can rebuild them right yeah
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.360]  it's like when they break they it is catastrophic because it's it's anyway you never find all the
[03:41.360 --> 03:50.640]  pieces so I've got the James Bond db9 car which is awesome and I love it but it's only half built
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.040]  because I ran out of I ran out of time yeah three months ago when it came out and I never got back
[03:55.040 --> 04:01.280]  into it but I also enjoy building like small Lego kits just you know ones that you can really knock
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.280]  out in like 45 minutes I find it therapeutic you know like the way some people you know like adult
[04:07.280 --> 04:14.800]  coloring books are a big thing you know there's other hobbies like that that people have that I
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.920]  you know just takes your mind off whatever it is you're you know normally I I enjoy the sensation
[04:19.920 --> 04:25.280]  of snapping Lego bricks together yeah but here's my question to you because I was doing one this
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.360]  morning do you ever get like I I hesitate to even mention this on there but sometimes I get a little
[04:31.360 --> 04:40.720]  OCD and I start wanting to put the bricks on the model where the the little Lego stamp on top of
[04:40.720 --> 04:46.880]  each peg that they're aligned with each other oh I've never thought of that but now I don't think
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.880]  I'm ever going to not be able to think of it and once it pops into my mind and I and it's like I
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.400]  like stop thinking that that is that way lies madness because you can't even because there
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.640]  are some pieces that have to go in a certain way and there's you know they're not like a square
[05:03.680 --> 05:06.960]  there's no way to put them with the you know the the little Lego thing
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.880]  oriented correctly or aligned with similar pieces you know but it's it like that way lies madness
[05:14.880 --> 05:19.200]  like I feel like that might be one way that I'll wind up in the you know loony bin
[05:19.200 --> 05:26.800]  yeah no yeah I have to quickly forget you've ever said that now
[05:28.480 --> 05:33.360]  I do like the Lego though man yeah we also we have we have like a veritable toy store
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.960]  of unopened Lego boxes yeah same in our base it's like that new Millennium Falcon I just I
[05:38.960 --> 05:42.560]  keep wanting it but I know I'll never finish building it my friend friend of the show Dave
[05:42.560 --> 05:51.200]  Whiskas has the Millennium Falcon he also has the db9 completely put together it is nice but it is
[05:51.200 --> 05:56.080]  that Millennium Falcon as nice as it is it is so super finicky so I was in his office you were in
[05:56.080 --> 06:04.000]  his office recently too it's so super finicky in terms of like it and it's cool that there's like
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.880]  this whole interior to the ship and you can get to it but like the way that you get to it by
[06:08.880 --> 06:15.120]  carefully lifting panels of the ship off it's like I don't know there's something it looks
[06:15.120 --> 06:20.080]  cool it is a magnificent model but it's so super finicky that I don't know that I I would like to
[06:20.080 --> 06:24.320]  have that and I just don't know where I'd put it when I finish building it exactly the same here
[06:24.960 --> 06:26.080]  absolutely same here
[06:26.080 --> 06:35.600]  let me might as well get started though yeah
[06:39.120 --> 06:45.520]  where to start I have I do this every time a new ipad comes out where I get into it and I write
[06:45.520 --> 06:51.440]  a review and it's you know like here's one week with the ipad you know pro or whatever but then
[06:51.440 --> 06:57.760]  it's like I get even more you know it takes longer than a week to really truly get into it like I
[06:57.760 --> 07:03.280]  you know I I've been obsessing over this ipad pro ever since it came out I bought myself by the way
[07:03.280 --> 07:09.840]  the 11 inch um Amy's got the the I it's another thing I'm so so I I've become super annoyed that
[07:09.840 --> 07:14.560]  apple calls it a 12.9 inch they should call it a 13 inch I don't know why they do that
[07:15.760 --> 07:19.120]  yeah why not round that up some stuff they round some stuff they don't that's the weird thing
[07:19.120 --> 07:25.120]  the consistency is a user-facing feature like in the old days when there was a 13 inch macbook air
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.920]  and an 11 inch macbook air 13 and 11 they sounded pretty different two inches diagonal they looked
[07:31.920 --> 07:38.960]  really different in person it made a lot of sense I think that calling it a 12.9 inch it sort of has
[07:38.960 --> 07:43.920]  like a psychological effect it's like that 12.99 pricing thing you know it kind of makes you feel
[07:43.920 --> 07:50.160]  it 12 ish inches but it's not 12 decisions it's 13. Yep it's but I think people will say that
[07:50.160 --> 07:55.760]  apple's cheating them out of a couple extra sub inches I guess that is one theory I have is that
[07:55.760 --> 08:01.200]  like so for example they're they're 13 inch laptops have always been 13.3 I believe every
[08:01.200 --> 08:07.760]  single one they've ever made is always or at least in recent you know last 15 20 years a 13 by 10 ones
[08:07.760 --> 08:13.520]  are all 13 by 13.3 uh and so you can round that down and nobody feels they're getting ripped off
[08:13.520 --> 08:21.200]  but if you round 12.9 1 2 inches up to 13 people will say you've you know you're you're where are
[08:21.200 --> 08:25.360]  my exchanges you're committing marketing fraud and I can see that and that might be the whole
[08:25.360 --> 08:29.920]  explanation why you know that they technically isn't all the way to 13 so they're not going to
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.320]  call it 13 but I think it's so much easier to think of it that way it feels more like that's
[08:36.320 --> 08:41.120]  that's the difference anyway I bought the 11 inch I'm convinced that that's the right size for me
[08:41.120 --> 08:46.400]  personally I it's and it is it is funny it is sort of like the watches have gotten harder to pick a
[08:46.400 --> 08:52.800]  size with the latest generation I feel like I've had so many discussions with friends about which
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.720]  iPad to get and there's I know there's a lot of people who are on the fence who were never on the
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.640]  fence before because that the old 12.9 inch pros were so big yeah and it's it was great for some
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.360]  people they loved it but if you didn't really need it you know for drawing or something like that
[09:07.360 --> 09:12.640]  it was such a bear to lug around that you know you didn't buy it whereas now
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.760]  it's tough decision rule of thumb has always been if I don't take if I don't want to have to take a
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.800]  laptop with me when I travel then I want a 12.9 inch iPad if I do want to or I have to take a
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.200]  laptop with me then I want the 11 inch because it's that old line that you've said so well
[09:27.200 --> 09:32.080]  the lightness of the of the iOS device lets the Mac be heavier so I can take a 15 inch MacBook Pro
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.480]  for when I need to do video but I want to take that with me everywhere so I can use it for video
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.280]  and then I have the super light 11 inch iPad for everything else yep as a rule of thumb I that that
[09:41.280 --> 09:46.080]  is it is a very complicated decision matrix and I feel like ultimately you've nailed it that is to
[09:46.080 --> 09:53.600]  me that's my advice to people is if you either only want an iPad to be your portable computer
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.760]  you know whether you are all in on the iOS lifestyle you don't even use a Mac anymore
[09:57.760 --> 10:03.920]  or if you have a like an iMac and when you out you want to use an iPad or even if you have a
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.320]  MacBook but sometimes you want to go on a trip where you don't even pack your MacBook it's a
[10:08.320 --> 10:13.600]  vacation you want to do less work you are only taking an iPad in those cases I think you want
[10:13.600 --> 10:19.760]  the 12.9 inch if you want to use it as your main computer for any serious stretch of time whereas
[10:19.760 --> 10:26.960]  the 11 inch to me is exactly as Steve Jobs described it when he introduced the first iPad
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.520]  in 2010 it is this in-between device in between a phone and a laptop that's what the iPad is in my
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.720]  life it is exactly I just and I just went down the rabbit hole of watching a bunch of old Steve Jobs
[10:40.720 --> 10:48.240]  product intros and it is crazy how that how his description of the where they were imagining this
[10:48.240 --> 10:54.800]  new tablet to be how it's like well for me that's exactly where it still is yeah and I know it's
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.240]  different for a lot of people and that's you know why we have podcasts talk about them no it's
[11:00.240 --> 11:03.680]  totally true and I think like the whole well you know it's not fair to tell people they have to
[11:03.680 --> 11:08.480]  choose you know some people should people shouldn't have to buy an iPad and a MacBook or something but
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.840]  some people are very happy with an iMac to do really Xeon or a Mac Pro to do like Xeon level
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.680]  work but when they but they also have to travel and so they have a MacBook as well and I think
[11:17.680 --> 11:23.520]  it's it's it's it's wrong to sort of say you have to you have to choose between these things you
[11:23.520 --> 11:28.160]  need everything according to your use case but for me it's it I'm very very confident that the
[11:28.160 --> 11:33.840]  11-inch is the right the right model for me what about you I have been using the 12.9 because
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.080]  that's the one that they gave me to review and I haven't bought I'm probably gonna buy the 11-inch
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.240]  one I haven't bought it yet I wanted to see how long I could survive just the idea that the
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.440]  bezels were gone and it was such it was so much smaller and it was almost like freedom going to
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.760]  the smaller version the 12.9 but I think now that I'm ready to buy my own I think I'm also going to
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.720]  go for the 11-inch so one of the interesting things to me about the 12 the new 12.9 inch with
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.280]  these greatly reduced bezels is that when you put it on top of like a new MacBook Air it is a very
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.360]  similar footprint yes and it's cool how much smaller it is than my old 13-inch MacBook Pro
[12:11.360 --> 12:18.480]  you know the one from four years ago but it is remarkable how similar it is in footprint and just
[12:18.480 --> 12:25.120]  basic heft to the MacBook Air they are very comparable machines as just closed devices in
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.000]  a backpack and I think one of the cool things about the iPad is that by having especially you
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.480]  know the 12.9 it still has the four to three aspect ratio and the 11-inch has a slightly
[12:34.480 --> 12:42.240]  different aspect ratio which doesn't actually work out to good numbers no but it's it's 4.3 ish it's
[12:42.240 --> 12:49.440]  certainly close a lot closer to 4.3 than 16 to 9 I find that that is very pleasant for a lot of the
[12:49.440 --> 12:58.640]  stuff I do on a laptop which is reading web pages scrolling through emails and by having a higher
[12:58.640 --> 13:04.720]  it's you know higher rather than wider that's to me a very neat screen it sort of makes me
[13:04.720 --> 13:12.560]  vaguely wish that Apple would go away from 16 to 9 laptop screens and go a little bit closer to 4.3
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.640]  yeah I think they're I think well they had some of them that was there was 16.9 and some there
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.200]  was 16.10 for a while but I think you're right because often on the stuff that we do it is the
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.960]  vertical height that matters yeah and I've gotten to a point where like I would just live on that
[13:24.960 --> 13:30.800]  iPad Pro if I didn't have to do Final Cut and if I if if Photoshop was in such muscle memory that
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.440]  it would it would it's just too inconvenient for me with my set in my own ways traditional
[13:35.440 --> 13:41.280]  computing mentality to learn something new on the iPad to do all this sort of graphic design stuff
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.600]  I would just live on that because it is so pleasant to use do you remember were you using
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.520]  a Mac back in the day this would probably be around like 1990 or so when it came out there
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.840]  was a company called radius that made displays third-party displays for Macs and they had one
[13:55.840 --> 14:03.360]  that rotated that yeah instead of being wide it was tall and it was like a 15-inch display
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.680]  which at the time was huge and you could rotate it sideways and I remember the I remember seeing it
[14:09.680 --> 14:15.280]  in Mac world you know the magazine or Mac user and and lusting after it but of course it was
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.080]  you know like I don't know two thousand dollars you know it was way out of my budget as a 19 year
[14:20.080 --> 14:27.440]  old but I coveted it greatly and one of my computer science professors had it and of course
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.600]  had it oriented up and down because he was looking at code and it was like unbelievable how much
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.200]  source code he could have on screen at one time it was like oh my god that is amazing like the
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.520]  only way like that you know on a normal display that you could look at that much source code at
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.320]  a time to sort of see like a you know a two-page algorithm or something and sort of try to get it
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.600]  into your head would be to print it out and put the paper you know next to each other I used to
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.520]  use that for Quark and later for InDesign because you can see a whole page of work that like when
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.120]  you were doing book design or document design you could see the whole page right right and and if
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.760]  you're doing you know most of the stuff you would do in page layout whether it's a newspaper or
[15:07.760 --> 15:13.280]  magazine is oriented in portrait not landscape and so having a portrait display was actually really
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.440]  useful which is great with the iPad because you literally just do turn it and it does that for you
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.800]  all right uh sort of went away I mean like with something like a 30-inch iMac you get that much
[15:22.800 --> 15:28.160]  horizontal like you really wouldn't I wouldn't want to turn that just side by side right fine
[15:28.160 --> 15:34.240]  but on a laptop I kind of miss it you know yeah I don't know that's but for me the thing that I love
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.440]  about then the reason I love buying this 11-inch iPad is that it's so much smaller footprint rise
[15:41.440 --> 15:48.320]  than even a MacBook Air even the new MacBook Air and so to me if I'm temporarily going to go and
[15:48.320 --> 15:53.600]  you know take something to a coffee shop and just work for an hour out of the house you know just
[15:53.600 --> 16:01.760]  to get a change in scenery taking this little 11-inch sliver of a device feels so remarkably
[16:01.760 --> 16:08.960]  and I'm a sucker for small machines I used to love the 11-inch air um still sort of pine for the
[16:08.960 --> 16:14.400]  iphone se size phone even though I I would yeah you know I I just wish it was out there I wish
[16:14.400 --> 16:20.800]  there was a new one but anyway it's so cool as a little laptop it is amazing which is funny because
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.680]  my the ceo of the company I work for he ordered the new MacBook Air and ended up returning it
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.160]  and getting the highest level I used to call it core m7 I think they pretend that it's nice
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.200]  it's an i7 now uh 12-inch MacBook because it is the tiniest MacBook and he wants to code so he
[16:37.200 --> 16:40.640]  and it's the same performance as the air so he was willing to pay the extra money just to have
[16:40.640 --> 16:45.760]  an even more portable MacBook yeah that's some you know people it's funny I uh so many people
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.120]  and I do think that the MacBook we're skipping all over the place but I do think the MacBook lineup
[16:51.120 --> 16:55.840]  as a whole as a family is a little weird right now because there's a couple of machines that
[16:55.840 --> 17:01.440]  are sorely in need of updates including the 12-inch MacBook yeah and the 13-inch MacBook
[17:01.440 --> 17:07.360]  escape the the pro without the touch bar um yeah all they did was gold for the 12-inch MacBook
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.520]  it's the only update we got this year yeah it's a new gold color yeah and I don't think that the
[17:11.520 --> 17:18.880]  13-inch MacBook Pro without the touch bar got touched at all um no and so that's it's a weird
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.720]  situation and I think it'll make a lot of sense once those machines do get updated um well I think
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.120]  it's the branding so like when the when the MacBook Air dropped to 999 they had the opportunity to
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.920]  change the name to just MacBook because it was the new entry-level computer but they probably thought
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.880]  there was so much equity in the Air name they kept it and then the 12-inch MacBook came out
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.040]  and the Air was cheaper than the MacBook and maybe they thought the MacBook would replace the Air the
[17:43.040 --> 17:48.560]  way the Air replaced the MacBook but it didn't so now your baseline Mac is the MacBook Air instead
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.240]  of the MacBook and if you're willing to spend a little bit more money for extra portability you
[17:52.240 --> 17:55.920]  get the MacBook 12-inch and when you spend a little bit extra money for the performance
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.120]  you get the Pro but people just expectations a normal person looking at it would think the MacBook
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.240]  was the base and not the MacBook Air yeah it's very strange um yeah and it's funny because like
[18:06.240 --> 18:12.240]  I said I was digging through old Steve Jobs product intros and I watched the Mac his original
[18:12.240 --> 18:20.080]  MacBook Air intro everybody remembers it because of the cool the the cool um conceit of saying hey
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.320]  it even fits in one of these which we've all seen you know and he shows like a little inner office
[18:24.320 --> 18:30.080]  mineral envelope and then he actually has one that of course is a perfect match it is exactly
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.360]  the one that he showed in the slide it's got the neat little you know red thread tied around the
[18:35.360 --> 18:42.560]  thing to seal it um what it's just amazing stagecraft really was um but it's so funny
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.760]  because again in terms of like hey this is exactly what we're talking about 10 years later he even
[18:47.760 --> 18:52.720]  said it's like he framed the whole introduction as everybody knows Apple makes the best notebooks in
[18:52.720 --> 18:59.040]  the world and everybody cheers because it's Mac world expo uh we've got MacBook and we've got
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.600]  MacBook Pro and it's so funny because they've gone back to those names they've got the product that's
[19:03.600 --> 19:11.760]  just called MacBook like in 2008 it was the white and black plastic ones polycarbonate if you want
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.280]  to be official um and then here we've got this MacBook Air that fits in between because it's
[19:17.280 --> 19:23.120]  sort of a premium product like a pro but it's also really really small way smaller than any
[19:23.120 --> 19:29.520]  of the other ones so you know uh the name made total sense and now the names make no sense but
[19:29.520 --> 19:38.080]  they would if they just would take an eraser just take an eraser erase the air off the MacBook Air
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.120]  and then write air on the 12-inch MacBook it would all make sense but I think you're right it's just
[19:43.120 --> 19:49.360]  everybody's it it the fact that it doesn't make sense it is what it is everybody has internalized
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.960]  that the MacBook Air it doesn't mean the air doesn't mean anything related to thinner light
[19:54.960 --> 20:01.520]  anymore it means it's the wedge shape $1,100 MacBook that most people buy and it has the
[20:02.080 --> 20:05.600]  and also has a connotation now of being the entry level because people are so used to being like
[20:05.600 --> 20:10.720]  none of them debuted at $9.99 I think the original debuted at $17.99 yeah it was very second one at
[20:10.720 --> 20:15.840]  $12.99 this is the cheapest debut MacBook Air ever but it's still way more than people's concept of
[20:15.840 --> 20:25.600]  the air being $9.99 yeah totally uh so I have been going nuts on the iPad I don't blame you
[20:26.400 --> 20:32.720]  absolutely and I've I've wasted uh let me let me try to tally this up how much money I've spent on
[20:32.720 --> 20:40.320]  keyboards in the last like 10 days is it more than smell that's the only metric maybe I don't know
[20:40.320 --> 20:45.520]  though I wouldn't want to bet on that um I didn't buy any expensive keyboards I've just been buying
[20:45.520 --> 20:53.360]  a lot I'm obsessed with trying to find a a the right keyboard for me to use out of that you know
[20:53.360 --> 21:00.800]  with the iPad and the smart folio keyboard case whatever they call it what the hell it's got a
[21:00.800 --> 21:09.040]  it's a mouthful now yeah it's got a smart keyboard folio all right is pretty good and as I've used it
[21:09.040 --> 21:14.320]  more and more since it came out I'm finding it better and better at you know like because the
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.040]  thing is I don't want to leave my iPad in it all the time that is the the big thing and that's why
[21:19.040 --> 21:26.560]  I definitely didn't like the old keyboard folio that much because it just seemed like such a pain
[21:26.560 --> 21:32.080]  to get it on and off it's like origami yeah and I never and I'd be like trying to attach it to the
[21:32.080 --> 21:41.200]  wrong side I get all mixed up spun around I was never a huge fan of it this one I'm the more I
[21:41.200 --> 21:48.080]  use it the more easily I'm getting it in and out for hand holding without anything on it and then
[21:48.080 --> 21:52.960]  popping it back in when I want to write something and I'm okay with the keys it's you know they are
[21:52.960 --> 21:59.200]  what they are and I'm also okay with the smaller keyboard on the 11 inch folio cover because the
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.760]  keys I actually use are full size you know the ones that they did it's not truly a full-size
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.280]  keyboard but all of the alphabetic keys are full size so close enough and I'm okay with having a
[22:11.280 --> 22:20.720]  small tab key or a tiny little half size backslash key who gives a crap yeah but I don't love taking
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.520]  it in and out and so I'm kind of obsessed trying to find like a bluetooth keyboard that I really
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.400]  like in terms and do I want to use the same one everywhere like even when I'm at home and I'm
[22:30.400 --> 22:33.920]  typing in the kitchen and do I want to use the same you know is it the same keyboard I want to
[22:33.920 --> 22:39.760]  take with me in a backpack when I go on a trip and so I've bought a lot of keyboards it's funny
[22:39.760 --> 22:44.320]  so my godson my not my 10 year old godson he doesn't like him forget the latest macbook
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.720]  keyboards he doesn't like any computer keyboard we ended up getting him that typewriter keyboard
[22:48.720 --> 22:54.720]  they made for the ipad that feels like an original metal arm and that he loves so we needed to find
[22:54.720 --> 22:59.840]  like the version of the apple extended keyboard to dock yeah they make someone needs to make that
[22:59.840 --> 23:05.440]  for the ipad for you yeah but I have I have the one that's snow you know that we always call it
[23:05.440 --> 23:11.200]  the snow keyboard the matias whatever it's called it's a bluetooth keyboard with supposedly apple
[23:11.200 --> 23:16.000]  extended keyboard to feel keys which don't feel anything like the apple extended keyboard too but
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.080]  they are mechanical and so they feel better than most keyboards uh you know and it's okay but it's
[23:22.080 --> 23:28.880]  so big it it's good to have it's possible as a kitchen keyboard it is not a good backpack
[23:28.880 --> 23:33.600]  keyboard because it's just too big it's why it would it you'd look like it's just preposterous
[23:33.600 --> 23:43.440]  to carry that around in your backpack um I'm gonna hold this thought because it's a long rant yeah
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.520]  I'm gonna take a break and I'm gonna thank our first sponsor and it is our friends at
[23:47.520 --> 23:57.120]  Tres Pontas now look these guys sell coffee and it's all sourced from a single family uh farm and
[24:01.120 --> 24:06.320]  it's single family estate coffee is what it is and it is fantastic
[24:08.480 --> 24:14.720]  it is a premium select coffee and it's really good and what you can do is you can get a
[24:14.720 --> 24:18.240]  subscription now you guys have heard me talk about this before I love having a subscription
[24:18.240 --> 24:24.000]  of coffee so that I just I never run out and you just pick whether you want it uh delivered
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.120]  every week do you want it every two weeks do you want it once a month how much do you need
[24:27.920 --> 24:33.680]  when you get coffee from Tres Pontas it is super super fresh it even comes with like a roasted on
[24:33.680 --> 24:40.240]  date the last batch I got I checked it was at my door delivered in a little box and I checked the
[24:40.240 --> 24:43.760]  date it was roasted two days before I don't even know how that's possible because it's not like
[24:43.760 --> 24:47.440]  because it's not like they're overnighting it I don't know they roast it they put it in
[24:47.440 --> 24:52.000]  two days later ding dong there it is at your door it's really really convenient it is excellent
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.760]  coffee uh this is a great gift idea though if you've got coffee lovers in your life get on
[24:57.760 --> 25:01.840]  try getting them think about getting a subscription to Tres Pontas coffee it is a
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.400]  tremendous gift idea uh we're right at that part of the year where you really got to start thinking
[25:06.400 --> 25:12.560]  about holiday gifts so I'm suggesting this suggest uh if you got a coffee lover in your life and you
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.760]  want to get them something cool uh look into getting them a subscription for a year to Tres
[25:17.760 --> 25:24.160]  Pontas it's really really good now they also have I don't even know how you know where this comes
[25:24.160 --> 25:31.680]  from so their coffee comes from Brazil they also sell olive oil that is uh similarly uh single farm
[25:31.680 --> 25:37.200]  origin comes from Chile it's obviously you need a different climate for good olives than coffee
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.400]  it's really good stuff it is really good olive oil to me the test of olive oil is you just get some
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.120]  good bread you pour some olive oil out on a plate and you just uh dip the bread in the olive oil
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.000]  with nothing else does it taste good yeah it tastes really good um they sent me a bunch of
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.200]  this it is really really good very pure uh lowest acid that you know you can get extra virgin olive
[25:59.200 --> 26:05.280]  oil uh really really good they're honestly the sponsorship here is for the coffee I'm just
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.600]  mentioning the olive oil just because they sent me some and it's really good and it's something to

[27:17.040 --> 27:22.560]  at the apple store apple has one it's only at the apple store it's called a logitech keys to go i
[27:22.560 --> 27:32.720]  think it's gone have you seen this thing no it's a tiny little sliver of a of a of a of a bluetooth
[27:32.720 --> 27:38.720]  it's about as small as it could be and it's got like a rubber cover sort of like like it's inside
[27:38.720 --> 27:42.880]  a rubber glove uh so it's like waterproof they even showed you know you can just totally dump
[27:42.880 --> 27:47.920]  water on it it's sort of the same basic idea as the apple's folio keyboard you know where there's
[27:47.920 --> 27:55.200]  like a covering but man is this a squishy ass keyboard and and it's cool the one thing that's
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.800]  cool is that the way it's packaged is you can just open the cardboard box and actually touch it
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.640]  uh in the apple store so i did that oh i did see this yeah all right is that what it's called the
[28:06.640 --> 28:14.480]  keys to go i don't remember but i remember the squishiness all right uh it's so squishy that i
[28:14.480 --> 28:18.960]  that i didn't buy it i was like oh this is terrible and i tweeted about it and then a couple of people
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.840]  like mg sigler said oh i've got that it's not that bad yeah yeah and so the next day like an idiot i
[28:23.840 --> 28:27.120]  went back to the apple store and bought it because i thought well if it's good enough for a logitech
[28:27.120 --> 28:37.040]  keys to go yeah logitech keys to go um and you know it is super lightweight and it is because
[28:37.040 --> 28:43.120]  it's you know doesn't have like keys you know it's got a thing i i would feel very safe and secure
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.280]  like keeping that in a backpack or a suitcase just getting all bounced around like it's
[28:48.000 --> 28:58.080]  super durable uh it pairs okay but man it is so squishy and i i it it's me it's not it's the
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.000]  keyboard is what it is and i i got to try it before buying it so i shouldn't complain but
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.120]  because it's so squishy i find myself pounding on the keys like like i was writing just going
[29:09.120 --> 29:16.720]  through email the other day trying to use it and my fingers hurt like i'm i can't willingly just
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.280]  i think if you typed like a sane person it would actually be super quiet might be one of the
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.800]  quietest keyboards in the world but instead i'm pounding on it because i want to feel something
[29:26.800 --> 29:34.720]  and if you just sort of press them it's actually sort of close to the hypothetical like like
[29:34.720 --> 29:40.880]  not even moving keys keyboard so it's it's it was a very poorly thought out purchase
[29:42.640 --> 29:48.640]  the other thing and i think that this might be what i settle on is the duh obvious uh is
[29:48.640 --> 29:54.560]  apple's magic keyboard the new one that charges with a lightning port which i didn't have until
[29:54.560 --> 30:01.120]  this week because my iMac came actually what did my iMac come with i think my iMac came with a big
[30:01.120 --> 30:05.840]  keyboard didn't it i don't know i have a 5k iMac from a couple years ago i don't use the keyboard
[30:05.840 --> 30:10.000]  that came with it i don't even know where it is because i use an apple extended keyboard too at
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.120]  some point i ended up with the mat the old magic keyboard the one that took double a batteries in
[30:15.120 --> 30:21.840]  a cylinder behind the keyboard and i never bought the new one because i'm i wasn't going to use it
[30:21.840 --> 30:28.000]  and i like the old arrow key layout better with the upside down t so i had never even tried this
[30:28.000 --> 30:35.200]  new magic keyboard with the lightning port it's amazing a it is way lighter than the old magic
[30:35.200 --> 30:40.320]  keyboard uh when you put two double a batteries in it it is a tremendous difference in weight it
[30:40.320 --> 30:47.760]  is super lightweight it is the smallest possible keyboard you could have that is truly full size
[30:47.760 --> 30:54.960]  it is just exactly like a macbook keyboard just with nothing else there's no and there's no sides
[30:54.960 --> 31:01.920]  there's no top there's no bottom the even nicely the function keys are full height so it's even
[31:01.920 --> 31:10.160]  nicer and the key travel is amazing it is this is the keyboard that i hope they can somehow put into
[31:10.160 --> 31:14.720]  macbooks yes this should be the macbook keyboard and and they have i think they have the butterfly
[31:14.720 --> 31:20.000]  mechanism or a butterfly mechanism with the you know the quote-unquote stability so that if you
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.240]  touch you know press down on the corner of the key the whole key goes down as one piece
[31:24.240 --> 31:28.160]  it certainly feels like it whether it's actually the same mechanism or something similar i don't
[31:28.160 --> 31:34.480]  know but it it it just feels great in every single way and if apple can put this keyboard that
[31:34.480 --> 31:40.880]  keyboard into macbooks i i will weep tears of joy i'm just salty that you can only get it with the
[31:40.880 --> 31:45.760]  extended version in space gray which is the only acceptable color now you can get the silver one
[31:45.760 --> 31:51.040]  in both but can only get the space gray one number pad it's you're taking the words right out of my
[31:51.040 --> 31:57.360]  mouth because i'm there the only the small magic keyboard only comes in the white and they have
[31:57.360 --> 32:02.160]  the other ones right there in the apple store you know the big ones with the space gray and it looks
[32:02.160 --> 32:09.600]  so cool and it it just hurts it hurts my heart and i don't even want to admit how much more i
[32:09.600 --> 32:16.000]  would pay to get it in space gray so it's a 99 keyboard it's 100 bucks it feels like a hundred
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.440]  dollar keyboard to be honest the logitech one that i bought was 70 and this feels way more than 30
[32:21.440 --> 32:27.920]  dollars nicer than that logitech one and it's not that much heavier it's obviously not waterproof
[32:27.920 --> 32:33.040]  you know so when you travel you've got to somehow take that into consideration uh and i have a
[32:33.040 --> 32:40.480]  suggestion on that front it but i i would pay it honestly i was gonna say 150 for space gray i
[32:40.480 --> 32:44.720]  would pay 200 if they had it for 200 i would have paid 200 to get it in space gray because that's
[32:44.720 --> 32:49.120]  how big that's how big of an idiot i am i was hoping i could buy the space gray one and just
[32:49.120 --> 32:52.800]  get that crazy canadian miner on the ave channel to cut the number pad off of it
[32:56.400 --> 33:02.400]  if the space gray looks so much cooler yeah so in terms of traveling with it and i think that
[33:02.400 --> 33:08.640]  this is what i'm gonna end up with uh uh friends of the show studio neat makers of all sorts of
[33:08.640 --> 33:16.240]  very cool and a wide a range of crazy stuff they make everything from the glyph which is
[33:16.880 --> 33:24.640]  a very cool little tripod mount for uh phones to uh they have a they have a kit for making
[33:24.640 --> 33:30.880]  clear ice cubes so great they have a pen serie remote holder a serie remote holder they just
[33:30.880 --> 33:36.160]  you know they make cool things they're just two guys they have a podcast over there on the relay
[33:36.160 --> 33:40.720]  where they talk about the stuff that they make very cool stuff but one of the products is called
[33:40.720 --> 33:46.320]  the canopy it's a thing that to put the the new magic keyboard in and it's got like little
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.640]  suction on the one side it's like a little three-fold thing so you put the keyboard on
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.280]  and it sticks with these little suction cups so you could remove it too it's not like you're
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.000]  sticking it with glue or something like that it sticks with suction and then it folds over
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.720]  it has a nice little leather strap so i think that that's my solution for traveling i think
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.320]  i'm gonna like that better than using the folio keyboard because a it's a better keyboard it is
[34:10.320 --> 34:16.080]  actually the best portable it is literally the best feeling portable keyboard in the world in my
[34:16.080 --> 34:23.920]  opinion better than any macbook available better than any bluetooth keyboard i've felt that is that
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.720]  would be considered portable and now you can just plug it into charge off your iPad right well and
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.440]  the thing is it's like what do i value though like do i like it overall i certainly like the
[34:33.440 --> 34:40.080]  keyboard more than the folio keyboard but on the other hand sometimes it's nice to have the iPad
[34:40.080 --> 34:47.920]  magnetically connected as opposed to just propped up right you you know there's scenarios like on a
[34:47.920 --> 34:51.120]  airplane or something like that you hit a little turbulence or something if it's on your lap it's
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.200]  not going you don't have to worry about the keyboard coming apart you know from the iPad
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.920]  so i don't know i i feel like those are my two finalists in this battle royale of a keyboard to
[35:01.920 --> 35:09.280]  take with my iPad as i travel apple smart keyboard with studio needs canopy to wrap it up and stick
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.120]  it in a backpack or just the most obvious choice and this whole thing was the complete waste of
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.040]  time and money apple's folio keyboard case yeah i just stick to apple's folio keyboard case because
[35:21.040 --> 35:26.560]  i am completely keyboard not agnostic but like you can drop me on a new keyboard and within 20
[35:26.560 --> 35:32.960]  minutes it's like fortnight you know i i just take over after 20 minutes i'm fine with it so the
[35:32.960 --> 35:37.120]  folio keyboard works fine for me it packages the whole thing up but i do love i have the canopy and
[35:37.120 --> 35:41.040]  i do love it and now i'm jealous that i'm not using it there is there are some weird stuff
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.680]  though because like an ipad optimized keyboard has some keys that a mac keyboard doesn't have
[35:47.680 --> 35:53.680]  and a mac keyboard has keys that the ios keyboard doesn't have like for whatever reason apple is you
[35:53.680 --> 36:00.880]  know as a kid's conducting a war on escape keys and the ios folio keyboard has never had an escape
[36:00.880 --> 36:08.480]  key and i guess a part of it is because ios doesn't really do much with escape key but it
[36:08.480 --> 36:14.640]  also it also has the little thing in the corner to bring up like the uh alternate keyboards so you
[36:14.640 --> 36:20.720]  it's easier to get to like emoji picker right and you if you're using a mac keyboard i actually
[36:20.720 --> 36:24.480]  don't even remember how you how you do i don't have one in front of me right now as we record
[36:24.480 --> 36:30.080]  control command space control so it's sort of like the mac shortcut oh no sorry i was talking
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.320]  about the mac no what about on ios how do you get the emoji picker if you have a keyboard a
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.560]  bluetooth keyboard connected that doesn't have i don't know because i only ever use that button
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.120]  yeah so i don't know maybe you don't maybe you don't get to use emoji yeah you got to reach over
[36:43.120 --> 36:53.360]  and hit the screen like an animal and i will also say in this whole big mix of feeling one way then
[36:53.360 --> 37:00.480]  the other then the other going back and forth it is way nicer to have a the the what do they call
[37:00.480 --> 37:06.720]  the connector on the ipads now the smart connector the smart connector is a nicer thing in practice
[37:06.720 --> 37:12.160]  than bluetooth can ever be yes because you just un you know you when you're done with the keyboard
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.160]  you just pull the ipad apart from it and there's nothing else to do whereas with a bluetooth
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.040]  keyboard you're in range you know and it's sort of like it's sort of like i wish bluetooth had
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.240]  a worse range right like i kind of like i kind of wish i could set these keyboards up so that they
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.360]  only have like three feet of range like because i'm never i don't want to use the keyboard unless
[37:31.360 --> 37:37.040]  my ipad is within three feet and it would be so nice if i could just walk to another room and have
[37:37.040 --> 37:40.880]  it say okay you're not using the keyboard anymore but instead just measure time of flight like if
[37:40.880 --> 37:45.120]  time of flight is over so many milliseconds stop using the keyboard yeah so it's like you know i'll
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.240]  be in the kitchen and i have a bluetooth keyboard hooked up and i just pick up the ipad and go to
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.280]  another room and i go to type and nothing happens and it's like oh because it's still connected to
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.560]  the keyboard and then i got to go to control center turn bluetooth off i always wait like
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.200]  a second turn it back on and then you know but it's you know a minor irritation every time and
[38:05.200 --> 38:11.600]  you never with the the smart connector you're it you're never surprised right if it's connected
[38:11.600 --> 38:17.440]  it you can type and if it's not connected you don't you get the on-screen keyboard and i never
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.600]  noticed that about the escape i think i think it's part of apple's greater war on legacy computing
[38:21.600 --> 38:25.360]  because for escape is not a human readable key if you happen to have grown up with computers
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.040]  or you're working computers you know what it means but for example like after the show finishes
[38:29.040 --> 38:32.720]  recording that escape button is going to turn into a stop record button for me because i'm using
[38:32.720 --> 38:35.920]  quick time and quick time is going to own it and the touch bar is going to show a stop button
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.480]  instead of the escape button and that's all way more human readable than just a continual escape
[38:40.480 --> 38:50.000]  key i think you know the other thing and i this pains me it pains me but and i've had this happen
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.480]  before i remember very vividly the last time when the original ipad pro first one came out
[38:56.480 --> 39:03.440]  i had a similar thing where after about 10 days i started like reaching up to touch my macbook display
[39:03.440 --> 39:09.760]  and you know but you know that i do not i do not like anybody touching my mac displays like as soon
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.360]  as like i have a macbook and somebody you know somewhere along the road six months in somebody
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.760]  touches my screen there's a part of me that dies and i just want to throw i want to throw the
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.560]  machine out and just go get well i got it now you know go all howard hughes and just buy a new
[39:24.560 --> 39:28.560]  macbook because somebody dispenser you throw it away you pull it you went off the dispenser and
[39:28.560 --> 39:34.080]  put it down yeah i i i just love the idea of a display that has never been touched by a greasy
[39:34.080 --> 39:41.840]  finger um but i find myself reaching up to touch the mac and it you know it's it's very dependent
[39:41.840 --> 39:49.360]  on what i'm doing um but like an app like tweetbot that largely looks the same it's and you're if i'm
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.080]  switching back and forth with a lot of time on the ipad pro in laptop mode to doing it and it's not
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.960]  i'm not making an argument that the mac should support touch i'm just making the observation
[39:58.960 --> 40:05.920]  that if you spend a lot of time on the ipad in using it in a laptop configuration is it it's
[40:05.920 --> 40:12.640]  a very hard it's very hard not to want to touch the mac just because your brain you stop thinking
[40:12.640 --> 40:19.920]  about it as something you know and but the other thing is i always i often always you know think
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.120]  that i can move a cursor around by going underneath the spacebar on an ipad and you know there is no
[40:25.120 --> 40:31.200]  trackpad there yeah no i wish they had to put a capacitive spacebar on the keyboard itself
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.440]  and it would work exactly the way the on-screen spacebar does if you hold your finger there for
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.600]  a few seconds and start swiping sideways it would just it would just do the cursor movement for you
[40:40.400 --> 40:44.640]  yeah i don't know it's it is funny and that is a weird thing too about this whole situation
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.840]  is that when you're using the on-screen keyboard you do get a trackpad right you can just hold down
[40:49.840 --> 40:54.880]  in the space key and you can move precisely move the cursor around and when you're using
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.920]  a hardware keyboard which in theory should be better in every way you actually lose the ability
[40:59.920 --> 41:06.480]  to to go into trackpad mode move the insertion point you lose a very big feature so it's it's
[41:06.480 --> 41:11.120]  such a mixed bag and humans are horrible at context which if you take your hands off the
[41:11.120 --> 41:14.320]  keyboard to use the screen it's incredibly interruptive to your workflow it's way better
[41:14.320 --> 41:19.840]  to keep your hands where they are so that that still hurts me yeah it's it's a huge irritation to
[41:19.840 --> 41:26.560]  me and it's a huge reason why you know it's it's a big one on my list of reasons that as much as
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.440]  i'm spending all this time on the ipad pro trying to use it as much as i can like one of the things
[41:31.440 --> 41:38.960]  i just cannot get over is is the lack of you know the needing to reach up and touch yeah on that
[41:38.960 --> 41:46.320]  front the other thing is i am so loving the new apple pencil and i don't really draw i don't have
[41:46.320 --> 41:53.680]  like it's not a hobby of mine uh you had a great video this past week and you are a you know a very
[41:53.680 --> 41:59.920]  good hobbyist uh illustrator you you're you're you enjoy it you know uh you're good at it and
[41:59.920 --> 42:05.600]  so it's it makes for a good video uh like if i made a video for illustrating i would have to
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.520]  i would have to bring an outside talent to do the actual drawing i mean gray has done really well
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.240]  with just stick figures so yeah these are good yeah i guess i could do that i could do the stick
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.760]  figure out i just like it i just like using the pencil for all sorts of things i like the using
[42:19.760 --> 42:24.480]  it to manipulate the user interface yeah i just love that it's there i just love it as like a
[42:24.480 --> 42:30.320]  fidget thing in my hand because it feels so good but the thing that sort of drives me nuts is that
[42:30.320 --> 42:38.320]  when you are editing text it doesn't act as a precise placer of the insertion point you like
[42:38.320 --> 42:44.080]  you're in notes or mail and it's a long thing of text you can use the pencil to place the insertion
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.880]  point but whatever you know you tap it in the middle of a word where you have a misspelling
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.000]  and you want to change two letters you can't tap in the middle of the word if when you tap on the
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.720]  word the insertion point goes after the word and it's the exact same thing you get when you tap
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.040]  with your finger and with your finger it makes sense because your finger is a very imprecise
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.040]  pointing device the pencil on the other hand is incredibly precise so i find it very very
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.280]  frustrating that when you're moving trying to place the insertion point precisely with the
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.640]  pencil you get the same algorithm you get with the finger and yeah i mean the pencil your finger is
[43:18.640 --> 43:23.200]  it's a blunt instrument um and the pencil it feels like you should be able to do all sorts of
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.440]  very exact mark like you should be able to circle words to select them you should be able to cut
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.520]  you should be able to cut through words to open i mean there's so much potential there yeah and
[43:31.520 --> 43:37.600]  the old you know oft quoted if you see a stylist they blew it steve job's line was only in the
[43:37.600 --> 43:43.440]  context of knee a device that needs a stylus that you can't really properly function you know
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.320]  manipulate the device without a stylus so people forget that before the iphone came out most
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.400]  touchscreens were resistive where you literally had to squeeze two layers of plastic together to
[43:52.400 --> 43:57.360]  get it to register an input and you had to use a stylus or the nail of your finger yeah to do
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.560]  anything on them and that was not that was not the future of computing no so like i don't know
[44:02.560 --> 44:08.640]  and i i had a handspring visor back in the day as my palm device um you know and and my wife had
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.360]  one too and she really liked it we used it a lot and it's kind of remarkable how much we used it
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.600]  given that it didn't have any networking so there was no cell networking at the time or there was
[44:17.600 --> 44:23.360]  cell networking but not on the palm devices and the wi-fi wasn't a thing yet we used it a lot for
[44:23.360 --> 44:28.080]  something that you have you know to get data in and out you had to connect it by usb to your mac
[44:28.080 --> 44:34.960]  and sync but yeah if you lost your stylus you were you you had to go find something stylus like like
[44:34.960 --> 44:40.000]  there was nothing technically magic about the stylus it was just a piece of you know just a
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.600]  like an etch a plastic yeah no not an ice order three packs of extra styluses just so i would
[44:47.600 --> 44:51.520]  have one around for when i lost mine oh it's not an etch a sketch what were those things called
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.280]  you know but there were those things that you could buy as a kid where you could draw on them
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.120]  and they were sort of like an etch a sketch where there was like it was like magnetic paper
[44:59.120 --> 45:05.440]  and oh yeah i don't remember yeah well whatever they were called if you remember um they you know
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.880]  you could use that as your stylus you could use a toothpick if you wanted to you know but you
[45:10.880 --> 45:15.600]  needed something to press you couldn't just tap on things yeah so that's what jobs was talking about
[45:15.600 --> 45:20.560]  jobs was talking about needing a stylus and i don't think that the ipad ever should have
[45:20.560 --> 45:25.120]  anything that requires the pencil you know and i think that they've done a great job of that
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.240]  but i do think though that they still haven't fully taken advantage of it like if you do have
[45:30.240 --> 45:35.920]  the pencil connected and paired so many things could be so much better it should be fantastic
[45:35.920 --> 45:41.200]  for like selecting text and stuff like that and instead it's it's not it's actually that stuff
[45:41.200 --> 45:46.160]  from the microsoft's courier demo from all those years ago yeah yeah well and the other thing i've
[45:46.160 --> 45:52.480]  been i tweeted over the weekend is i have found myself in the last week or so really wishing that
[45:52.480 --> 45:58.800]  i could do handwriting to text because i'll be sitting on the couch with the ipad and i don't
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.760]  have a key all this talk of keyboards you know they're all in the kitchen or in my office and
[46:03.760 --> 46:09.680]  i'm just sitting there with nothing but the naked ipad and a pencil and i want to oh somebody sent
[46:09.680 --> 46:15.200]  me something interesting on twitter i want to answer i don't like typing on the screen on the
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.560]  ipad i never have and it if anything i've gotten worse at it or i feel like i've gotten worse
[46:21.440 --> 46:28.000]  because i feel like 10 years into this 11 years i guess at this point my thumb typing on an iphone
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.520]  has gotten continues to improve like i'm better at typing on the iphone than i ever have been part
[46:33.520 --> 46:37.680]  of it is that the phones have gotten bigger the phone that i carry has gotten bigger so the
[46:37.680 --> 46:41.760]  keyboard is a little bigger and there's bigger targets and i've just gotten really good at it
[46:41.760 --> 46:48.800]  i can't type on an ipad as fast as i can on my phone and that is frustrating i i always feel
[46:48.800 --> 46:54.480]  i feel like i'm trying to run underwater like i'm in the i'm in the pool and i'm trying to run
[46:54.480 --> 47:00.400]  and it's like that is not what you're supposed to do in a pool and so whether i actually would
[47:00.400 --> 47:06.560]  be faster if i could just write on screen and have it turn into text as i write like the newton did
[47:06.560 --> 47:12.480]  whether that actually would be faster than typing on the on-screen keyboard or not it would feel
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.280]  faster to me which is really all that matters i wouldn't feel hamstrung and i suspect i could
[47:17.280 --> 47:25.360]  hand write faster than i can type on an ipad on the screen so i really i really wish that you
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.080]  could do that and i and it's funny because i i tweeted that and a bunch of people said yeah
[47:30.080 --> 47:36.160]  i wish you could do that too some people pointed to some third-party keyboards what the heck is
[47:36.160 --> 47:43.920]  this thing called it's i called mesic or something i don't know i just bought it but it's a third
[47:43.920 --> 47:49.600]  party keyboard for the ipad and when you use this keyboard you get like a little box where
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.800]  the keyboard is and you can write and it you know with the pencil and it turns what you write to real
[47:54.800 --> 48:01.840]  text and it's the handwriting recognition is surprisingly accurate i forget what it's you know
[48:01.840 --> 48:06.320]  some kind of third-party thing that i guess the thing like you know that they licensed yeah it's
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.840]  called magic m-a-z-e-c i mean apple does it with asian like you can write in chinese and it'll
[48:11.840 --> 48:15.280]  recognize all the characters that you're right it just doesn't do it in latin languages right
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.280]  that's and that's part of the frustration is that apple supports it for asian languages
[48:19.280 --> 48:24.400]  they have it on the watch right where you can write on the watch and they won't do it on the
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.600]  device where to me it makes the most sense for you know in a latin language the ipad if you have
[48:29.600 --> 48:35.200]  a pencil uh and i i can't help but suspect that part of apple is gun shy from the whole newton
[48:35.200 --> 48:43.120]  thing that maybe that the bad reputation that newton had as a that it had uh you know the
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.520]  handwriting recognition was literally a joke you know the simpsons made jokes doonesbury made a
[48:47.520 --> 48:53.280]  joke that everybody remember everybody remembers the jokes about you know eat up martha more than
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.960]  they remember the newton and just the fact that the newton itself is sort of you know because it
[48:58.960 --> 49:04.080]  got cancelled unceremoniously i know and it was the right decision and and when he did it steve
[49:04.080 --> 49:07.360]  jobs had good things to say about it you know he was like this that we're not canceling it because
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.360]  it's a bad product we're canceling it because we've got to focus this company to save it
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.440]  and focus means saying doing things like killing the newton killing open doc etc but i feel like
[49:20.080 --> 49:26.640]  it still is a scar on apple's corporate soul right because it was a failure ultimately for whatever
[49:26.640 --> 49:32.240]  you know it wasn't it get it suffers from an unfair bad reputation it was a lot better product
[49:32.240 --> 49:39.120]  than people who didn't use it think the handwriting recognition in in fact got really good it like
[49:39.920 --> 49:46.320]  what they shipped originally should not have shipped it was bad but what it eventually became
[49:46.880 --> 49:53.440]  was i think pretty good i had i had a i think a newton 130 i forget which 120 or 130 and it was
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.560]  pretty good it was fast enough and the way that it turned what you write into text the pace that
[49:58.560 --> 50:05.440]  it went at was just right you could i could write as fast as i could uh you didn't have to use some
[50:05.440 --> 50:12.480]  weird uh made up printing language like palm did with graffiti uh and again i had a palm and i used
[50:12.480 --> 50:18.640]  it and i learned graffiti and you know that it made it work you know and i you know my wife and
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.760]  i used to write notes to each other and we'd end up making our teas the weird graffiti way yes
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.520]  like i'm not put slamming palm for that but there's no way apple would ever have done it's
[50:27.520 --> 50:31.840]  just not something apple would ever do is make you invent make you learn a new way of writing
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.320]  you know the apple ways you they've gotta somehow gotta understand everybody's crazy handwriting uh
[50:38.320 --> 50:45.120]  as it is but boy i would really like to do that in any text input thing but when i have the pencil
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.840]  in my hand it just seems so frustrating that you can't you know and they have the you know they
[50:49.840 --> 50:53.920]  have it on mac too right it's called like inkwell or something i don't know is it even still there
[50:54.560 --> 50:59.840]  i think so yeah but they you know they'll do handwriting to text on the mac they do it on
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.720]  the watch and they do it in ios on asian languages but they don't allow it for latin languages and
[51:06.720 --> 51:13.600]  you've for as good as the newton got at handwriting recognition what 20 years ago over 20 years ago
[51:13.600 --> 51:19.600]  the think about how much better it would be now on modern hardware and it certainly seems like
[51:19.600 --> 51:24.800]  something machine language would you know would make really good like you wouldn't i don't even
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.040]  know if the right way to do the algorithm would be to come up with an algorithm at all it might
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.600]  just be better to feed yeah feed it all into machine learning and let the let the computers
[51:33.600 --> 51:37.920]  figure it out yeah it's just like the pencil is so much a pencil it makes the ipad feel like it
[51:37.920 --> 51:43.840]  should be much more like a paper yeah you can almost do anything you can with marking up paper
[51:43.840 --> 51:51.520]  with it yeah and it does things too like if you start a note and just use the pencil and just
[51:51.520 --> 51:57.440]  write yeah and it doesn't turn your handwriting to text but it obviously is doing that behind
[51:57.440 --> 52:02.720]  the scenes because you can search for what you write and it in my experience it is remarkably
[52:02.720 --> 52:09.200]  good and my handwriting is not good and so you know that it's obviously doing handwriting to
[52:09.200 --> 52:15.600]  text because it's indexing it but it won't actually just turn it to text and yeah it might
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.040]  be trying to keep it authentically hand like if they they think that if you're handwriting it
[52:19.040 --> 52:22.800]  should look like you're handwriting but it'd be nice to have the option to right digitize well
[52:22.800 --> 52:27.280]  i get it in notes i get that you might want your handwriting to stay handwriting in notes but you
[52:27.280 --> 52:32.160]  know like when i'm writing responding to somebody on twitter or responding to email i just want to
[52:32.160 --> 52:37.440]  write and have it turn into text exactly like scribble on the watch yeah exactly like that
[52:39.120 --> 52:43.280]  just very frustrating to me because i know it's technically possible i know apple itself has
[52:43.280 --> 52:49.280]  solved this problem on ancient ancient arm hardware all the way from the first time they
[52:49.280 --> 52:55.440]  were using arm back on the newton and i know that they could do way better today because the
[52:55.440 --> 53:01.760]  machines are so much faster and machine learning is a real thing you know they could it it's it's
[53:01.760 --> 53:07.360]  very frustrating and it just feels and i never had this feeling with the old i have a pencil and the
[53:07.360 --> 53:14.480]  ipad because i didn't have the pencil with me all the time i i never lost my pencil but i and i you
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.120]  know had a i had like a system i had a you know there's two places in my backpack where the pencil
[53:19.120 --> 53:24.480]  might be um but it was always in you know this pencil spent most of its time in in my backpack
[53:25.200 --> 53:29.120]  whereas now it's always connected to the size of the side of the ipad and i've always got it
[53:29.120 --> 53:34.880]  and yeah it it just feels frustrating so that's one of my top frustrations with the ipad
[53:36.480 --> 53:39.600]  it's like that syracusa thing where it's finally good enough that you start wanting to sweat the
[53:39.600 --> 53:45.360]  details yeah exactly that is exactly how i feel about the pencil um what about you how are you
[53:45.360 --> 53:51.760]  feeling with the pencil i love it i'm using it uh and i did not mind the other one at all you know
[53:51.760 --> 53:54.720]  people made fun of it for having to stick out when you charged it and things like that but you know i
[53:54.720 --> 53:58.640]  would run out of pencil in a coffee shop on a plane and it was a lifesaver just plugging it in
[53:58.640 --> 54:03.440]  and getting a bit more juice so i was i was fine with it but having it always i would lose pencils
[54:03.440 --> 54:07.040]  i would leave them in different cities i would leave them on planes and it's just it's become
[54:07.040 --> 54:12.240]  a habit to slap it on top of the ipad and it's just it's always charged that way i forget that
[54:12.240 --> 54:16.560]  it's actually an electrical device now because it's always there always charged i'm using it
[54:16.560 --> 54:22.160]  constantly i put it back there anytime i get up to get anything uh and it just it went enough over
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.720]  the top of that curve that it's become almost almost like a real pencil at this point it's it's
[54:28.720 --> 54:36.160]  just a remarkably pleasant thing to hold in hand it really is i don't know i i'm i just can't say
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.720]  enough good things about it yeah i'm vacillating on whether i want more of the sides to be flat
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.560]  because it feels more like a standard pencil i can rest my index finger on it like i would a standard
[54:44.560 --> 54:49.200]  pencil but not my middle finger and i'm used to having sort of flat edges on both sides getting
[54:49.200 --> 54:54.800]  to that point of fussiness it is a little weird having it having one flat side i can't recall
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.320]  ever having a pen or pencil with one flat side before you know i've either had like an octagon
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.400]  is that what a pencil is octagon or the hex hexagon i think yeah probably hexagon octagon
[55:04.400 --> 55:09.600]  would be too many yeah so either a traditional pencil that's a hexagon or something that's
[55:09.600 --> 55:15.040]  completely round like a pen like having one flat side is different but it's not unpleasant
[55:15.040 --> 55:19.440]  it shows you which side has to be connected for the charging to work and to to if you had more
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.440]  than that you'd have to try to figure out which one so i get that it just it just feels like an
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.320]  in-between thing to me right now yeah yeah and it's so funny because everybody and i've been
[55:28.320 --> 55:32.160]  you know reading a bunch of reviews and listening to podcasts and everybody's talking about the ipad
[55:32.160 --> 55:37.040]  pros and i i've heard i haven't heard anybody say they don't like the new form factor of the ipad
[55:37.040 --> 55:43.520]  pros everybody really loves the flat sides um the only downside i can think of is syracuse's
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.800]  observation that it makes it harder to pick up when it's naked and especially one-handed and
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.800]  that is there is some truth to that it's because it is flat and even with the camera bump the
[55:52.800 --> 55:59.920]  camera bump there is a weird tripod effect where it you'd almost wish that the camera bump raised
[55:59.920 --> 56:05.360]  it more so that it'd be easier to pick up but instead it somehow even with a what looks like
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.720]  a very big camera bump it still lies flat yeah my finger grissos w i could never get them underneath
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.960]  an ipad anyway so i just i haven't changed the way i pick it up at all but that's valid but it
[56:14.960 --> 56:21.040]  is funny it's just neat it looks better i love the flat sides uh i love the way it feels but it's
[56:21.040 --> 56:25.680]  such a pro i don't know what informed what but it's such a as a practical matter to have the
[56:25.680 --> 56:31.040]  pencil magnetically attached like it does you need flat sides yes yeah and it's weird because
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.520]  when i was hoping that when the new ipads came out we'd finally have this unified design language
[56:35.520 --> 56:41.040]  across apple's mobile stuff the way we have with the macbook air across apple's computers but now
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.000]  with this i'm kind of not upset because i want more stuff to look like this again yeah the pencil
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.840]  is so neat too because it is it is a computer right the apple pencil is a tiny little computer
[56:51.840 --> 56:56.800]  and it is one of these things that it it's like one of the things that apple does not get anyone
[56:56.800 --> 57:02.480]  near enough credit for in my opinion is how good they are getting at making tiny little computers
[57:02.480 --> 57:09.040]  air pods are tiny little computers then the whole way that their two air pods are always in perfect
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.800]  sync in one ear and the other is because they're two little computers that negotiate with each
[57:14.800 --> 57:22.160]  other and like you know it in less time than you could ever notice they're you know a b a b a b
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.840]  okay we're in perfect sync there you go so this pencil is a computer but it has no lights it has
[57:27.840 --> 57:34.080]  no ports it it doesn't there's no sign that it's a computer all the things that you think a computer
[57:34.080 --> 57:40.400]  has click a button nope doesn't have a button doesn't have a light doesn't have a port i just
[57:40.400 --> 57:45.680]  a computational object which is what more and more of apple things are becoming exactly except
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.840]  and i love this you snap it onto the ipad and what do you get you get a little on screen uh
[57:51.840 --> 57:56.880]  a little like a popover type thing that says apple pencil and then it boop tells you the battery life
[57:56.880 --> 58:00.640]  because that is one thing for me i never had any idea how much battery life was in my old
[58:00.640 --> 58:06.320]  apple pencil and when it ran out of the widget when it well yeah there were ways that you could
[58:06.320 --> 58:10.320]  check and i knew about it but i'd never i would never know it wasn't in your face yeah you know
[58:10.320 --> 58:14.240]  whereas this you never go to check you just collect it and it's like okay i see your apple
[58:14.240 --> 58:19.040]  pencil and by the way your it's got 93 battery life and because it's a little computer if you
[58:19.040 --> 58:22.960]  ever do forget and just put it down it goes into a deep sleep mode to save you power so
[58:22.960 --> 58:28.240]  you can still use it when you pick it up again it's remarkably clever yeah it's you know it it
[58:28.240 --> 58:33.360]  i wonder how long it takes i remember talking to apple about that one in a couple weeks ago and
[58:33.360 --> 58:36.720]  you know had a briefing to talk about all this stuff and that was one of the points they were
[58:36.720 --> 58:42.320]  super proud about is that the pencil the pencil knows like it it's like a little you know
[58:42.320 --> 58:49.440]  anamorphic anthropomorphic item it like knows when it's not being used yeah yeah they don't
[58:49.440 --> 58:52.960]  even talk about the thing because when the with the previous version was like it it'll fast charge
[58:52.960 --> 58:56.640]  to this point it'll totally charge and now they just don't want you to think about charging
[58:56.640 --> 59:00.880]  anymore they don't give you any numbers just put it on your ipad and it will always be and
[59:00.880 --> 59:07.360]  really like air pods it'll just always be charged um the the nub nib what do you call the tip the
[59:07.360 --> 59:13.360]  tip the nib tip is exactly the same as the old apple and i don't know why i don't know you know
[59:14.080 --> 59:19.040]  it's an it to me it's interesting that it's exactly the same because everything else is
[59:19.040 --> 59:22.800]  different and you can't use the old pencil with a new ipad and you can't use the new one with an
[59:22.800 --> 59:27.600]  old ipad etc so they could have changed the nib and it really wouldn't matter it's not like it's
[59:27.600 --> 59:31.600]  i don't think there's anybody out there who's like stockpiled hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[59:31.600 --> 59:38.400]  of replacement tips and oh thank god all of my replacement tips will still work but on the other
[59:38.400 --> 59:44.400]  hand i can't think of any you know there's no reason not to use this yeah there's no reason
[59:44.400 --> 59:49.440]  to change it they don't change for changes sake right and so if you do have a stockpile of
[59:50.000 --> 59:56.800]  old apple pencil nibs you're in luck yeah they will all work i just love this product i really
[59:56.800 --> 01:00:02.080]  do it's it's so clever and that whole the whole thing from planning to exit it's one of those
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.200]  things when people keep saying you know that was old you know apple's doomed apple doesn't
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.480]  have any well you just look at some of the products that have come over the last few years
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.880]  and how smart they are and how truly again like what you do with watch bands the whole watching
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.160]  industry never thought about making the kind of bands that was easily changeable or easily
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.240]  customizable and there have been people making styluses people making all these projects
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.240]  products for years wacom had a decade lead on these things and apple just thought of stuff
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.720]  that in a decade never occurred to wacom hold that thought on the watch bands i am going to
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:35.760]  take another break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at squarespace look
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:41.680]  squarespace you guys know squarespace this is where you go all in one to build your website
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:49.920]  you can do everything domain name you can get your analytics you can design you can post it is
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.240]  your cms so let's say you set up a website let's say all you do is you want to host a podcast you
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.560]  can set up a thing on squarespace make your podcast and then when you post new episodes
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.360]  you do it through squarespace in addition to being your app that you use to design the website
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.440]  it's also the app you use to post if it's a blog or podcast or something like that with
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.160]  you know periodic content just a terrific terrific thing they have great customer service
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.360]  they have a tremendous track record technically in terms of uptime and everything you know like that
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.960]  and even though they help you they get you started with a bunch of great great templates and stuff
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:33.360]  like that to start with it's not one of these things where oh you can always tell when you're
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.880]  on a squarespace site because it's going to be one of these you know eight templates or something
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.720]  like that it's the opposite you use squarespace sites every day and you have no idea because it's
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:49.040]  so easy to customize the design and get your own brand on that site and make it truly own it and
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.920]  make it yours it's just unbelievable if you ever get nosy and start viewing source on websites
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.160]  and looking for you know the things in the headers that that show that it's being hosted on
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.840]  squarespace it's unbelievable how many sites you visit on a daily basis are built and hosted on
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.840]  squarespace and you just never would know it visually because they don't look like cookie
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.600]  cutter sites it's tremendous it's it's everything you would want in a all-in-one hosted website
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.800]  service they have been sponsoring this show forever and people keep signing up and it's great

[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.600]  of the talk show go to squarespace.com slash talk show all right watch bands here's a thought that
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:32.560]  popped into my head this week I don't know if you remember this Renee but last year apple announced
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.960]  a product called airpower yes I've heard of it and it's a very appealing sounding product
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:50.400]  it's a charging pad that you could rest a iphone 8 or iphone 10 including the 10s and 10r on it and
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:58.240]  it would charge and you could you could put your apple watch on it and it would charge your apple
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:06.000]  watch and what else was it going to do it was up to two phones the apple watch and the airpods with
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.080]  a special that's right the airpods I can't believe I forgot that so the airpods we're going to there
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:18.400]  was going to be a new case and and they didn't have exact plans at the time for what would the
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.800]  what would the story be for people who already own airpods they didn't they said we don't know yet
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.640]  we're you know we're thinking about it but probably it would be something that you know
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.880]  people who already own airpods could just buy the new case instead of buying a hundred and sixty
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.040]  dollar new airpods you could just buy the case and then you'd have this wireless case and then
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:43.760]  you just rest it on the thing and it would charge well it's it's about 14 months later and yes
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:51.680]  and the air power is nowhere to be seen apple has held two events this past few months and they've
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.240]  never mentioned it at either event and in fact after their september event introducing new phones
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.640]  they almost eradicated all mention of it from apple.com but it's still on the instruction book
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.240]  for the 10s and the 10r which is remarkable for me it is that is it the most prominent mention
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.760]  of air power in 2018 is in in the get it start getting start i think you're the one who pointed
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.160]  that out on twitter at least you're the one who pointed it out that i noticed which is rather
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:25.440]  remarkable uh and you know that apple pays an awful lot of attention to like the things like
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:32.160]  the getting started guide that ships with iphones um everything in that box is so fully considered
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:39.040]  right up to the top levels of the company um so that's deliberate and and it certainly is
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:46.240]  a suggestion that maybe it is still coming um i do i do not think it is coming in calendar year
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:53.360]  2018 because as we record it is november 18 and us thanksgiving holiday is this week
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:00.560]  which you know it i'm not i don't know when apple effectively shuts down but it is not
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:07.280]  going to be uh you know it's not the week to release new products there's only one december
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.520]  product i can remember and that's the smart battery case for the iphone 7 that's the only
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.520]  thing i can remember coming out into december right and that's one of the weirdest products
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.680]  yes in apple history it was i loved it it was because it was so quirky and it was in so many
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.520]  ways a very good product but it was very unusual and it wasn't it was function over form and it
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:33.280]  wasn't function over form and it drove a lot of people crazy very much it is truly it is probably
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:40.800]  the most function over form device in the entire johnny i've era of apple uh maybe even in apple
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:46.480]  company history honestly i don't even know what else to compare it to but you're right though it
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.920]  came out at a weird time the original air pods came out at a weird time they weren't supposed to
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.600]  they were supposed to ship you know ideally probably alongside the iphones that year you know
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:05.840]  in september early october and they apple even released at the time a statement um i forget if
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:12.320]  it was given to one outlet or or what but you know they had a brief press release that just said look
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.320]  uh air pods are very difficult to manufacture and we're only going to release them when they're ready
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.320]  and they're not ready yet we're working as hard as we can and they'll be out you know as soon as
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.040]  we can and we think you're going to love them something like that um in other words they're
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.120]  late because they're hard to manufacture um you know the truth right it's you know uh but they
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:40.080]  did end up start dribbling into customers hands in like mid december uh and it was hard to get them
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:49.040]  for christmas so in theory you know could air power ship silently quietly in mid december or
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.600]  something early december it could i'm not going to say it can't happen i wouldn't say it's entirely
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.320]  unprecedented but i don't i would i would bet that it isn't going to happen to me it's either
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:08.720]  a 2019 thing or it is going to get killed or or a it'll come out exactly as described in
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:16.240]  sometime in 2019 who knows early or late or whatever uh b it is going to change and what
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.520]  they will ship is going to be different than what was shown last year or c they're going to kill
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.160]  this thing yeah and it's just never they're just it's going to be something we just don't talk
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.440]  about we don't talk about air power yeah it's interesting because there's a bunch of products
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.880]  i would have expected like i would have expected maybe the second generation
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.920]  air pods maybe the inductive case i know that's that's commingled with air power but just they
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:46.480]  could have released um what a sweat resistant air pods if they'd wanted well they could have
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.320]  been on the agenda we didn't get coffee like updates for a bunch of the max still it's just
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:57.360]  it's very strange sort of an end of the year vibe well and i really do wonder uh how that ties into
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:04.880]  how that ties into air pods now air pods are along with the pencil and i feel like they're almost
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.680]  like sibling products because they're like i said 10 minutes ago they're these tiny little computers
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.520]  that you would never think of as computers and they're just such a joy to use uh i i'm still
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.600]  i've never lost mine i still have my original pair from whenever they came out um yeah and my
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:29.440]  battery life on them is still tremendous um i have and it was funny this week um at some point last
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.080]  week i have i have the pixel three and i have uh i bought apple's usb-c to 3.5 millimeter headphone
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:41.680]  jack uh i don't know why again i just pissed money away at the apple store it's like nine
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.720]  dollars i'll buy that i i bought a usb-c to headphone jack that i plan never to use
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:53.120]  just to see it so just to have one yeah they didn't give me one with the they didn't give
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:59.200]  any of the reviewers one with no things so uh i bought one and i have googles and they both
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.200]  work everywhere you know i can plug you know there's no difference but you know they both
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:10.480]  any device with any device i have with usb-c a macbook an ipad pro my pixel three i can plug
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:17.120]  either one into any of those usb-c jacks and put headphones in and it just works the problem i
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.680]  had is i couldn't find a pair of headphones with a 3.5 millimeter jack i really couldn't i i my
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:30.080]  i used to i i had i feel like i had hundreds of them yes because it's like with review units
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.400]  apple doesn't want the headphones back they've never actually told me this but you know they
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.120]  don't come i send the phones back i don't send like the headphones back because what are they
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:48.080]  going to do with old gross headphones so i i had headphones from every ipad or ipod i'm sorry ipod
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.080]  those are long gone though um but in recent years when apple was still shipping iphones with a
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:01.120]  traditional headphone jack i'd buy myself a phone every year i would get a review unit starting with
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.040]  like around the iphone 4 with verizon uh and then as the years went on they'd started you know i'd
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.520]  get two review units because i'd have the big one and a small one so i'd get like three a year and
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.080]  my wife would get a new iphone every year so we were like accumulating and my son has you know
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.320]  it doesn't get an iphone every year but he had a couple we had a whole stockpile surplus of apple
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.880]  and my son has systematically destroyed them all
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:37.840]  just just just destroyed them by watching using them to watch youtube on his macbook or and or
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.480]  i guess sometimes plugging them into his phone um my wife has gone through a few because she
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.200]  they're they were those air pod the old wired air pods were notoriously not sweat proof and she she
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.680]  destroyed some you know by using them at the gym um and we at our old house we had kitchen chairs
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.360]  again i don't know why would the hell we didn't just throw the damn chairs out but we had these
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.120]  kitchen chairs with two things that stuck up off the back you know sort of like a school size
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.280]  chair and they had two things that stuck up the back that the only function of them was to snag
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:19.680]  headphone cables and it would hurt it would be like a big rip out of your ear so she broke a few
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.640]  pairs um but it's my son who's the main culprit and i didn't even realize this and and i would
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.960]  just every time he'd like run low and see like dad i need you know do you have any extra headphones
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.160]  and i go down my office and find you know go through my old uh iphone boxes and yeah there
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.160]  were i could open any there was a time when i could open any of those boxes and there it is
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:45.200]  inside a brand new you know never used pair of of apple air air pods or uh air air pods ear pods
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.280]  ear pods um i went down a couple weeks ago and i started going through boxes and they're all gone
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.200]  and i finally found one and it was one of the ones remember when they used to ship in a really nice
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.400]  clear plastic case yeah yeah uh and i gave them to them and i thought i wonder where the rest of
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:05.040]  mine are and then i spent some time this week and i realized they're all gone and i gave i i kind of
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.840]  regret giving him my last pair it seems like something i've the pack rat in me wishes i'd
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.800]  kept one pair but i i went through all these boxes dozens and dozens of phone boxes and they're all
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.960]  they're all gone so i couldn't i had a hard time i actually i wound up i didn't even test them with
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:28.160]  apple ear earbuds i have a um eventually if i was like well stop looking for those and find some
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:34.560]  other pair of headphones uh and i have an old pair of sure uh over the ear ear things that they they
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.440]  weren't noise canceling but they they like were sealing so they were like my old years ago
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:48.880]  airplane ear earbuds so i used those anyway uh it was a long digression but anyway the point of it
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.920]  was it makes me wonder for all of my affection for air pods everybody was sort of anticipating
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:02.160]  that there might be new ones this year yeah and i wonder if the hold-up is related to air power
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:10.160]  that they are that they they don't want to ship new air pods without the new case
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:18.560]  but they can't ship a case that advertises wireless charging with air power which isn't
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.400]  shipping yeah what are you supposed to do buy a second mophie or just put them on the side of your
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.000]  ipad and hope for the best well yeah i don't think they're going to charge on the ipad magnetic part
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.200]  i'm almost certain they weren't going to charge and and apple was a little vague about this last
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.800]  year like what used qi the standard and what was proprietary apple watch clearly doesn't use qi it
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.480]  uses its own proprietary inductive charging it's qi plus it's like qi plus you can i've had some
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.840]  people fool it by putting special magnets with a qi charger um but it is cheap it's sort of like qi
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:55.120]  plus plus or something i get i get that and and i did i do remember talking to people at apple about
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.600]  it and you know they're never going to like they're not going to explain it they're not
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.840]  going to tell you exactly what's in the secret sauce but yeah the idea that it was qi plus was
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:11.280]  sort of the explanation and even publicly i think when when shiller introduced it he even said that
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.480]  you know look we're using the qi standard we've come we we want to do things the qi standard
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.360]  doesn't support and so we've we've made these but we want to contribute those things back to the
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:27.200]  standards group um you know that they weren't hope they weren't trying to keep it proprietary
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.680]  they just needed to do things that had to be proprietary because the sticking to the standards
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.520]  wouldn't wouldn't allow it to work so i can't help but think though that the the lightning
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:42.240]  or not lightning the the non-lightning the air pods that charge inductively we're not using the
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.320]  qi standard that it would be like the watch like qi plus because i don't think something that small
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.520]  can use the qi standard yeah um but anyway it makes me wonder isn't that crazy though to think
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.240]  that the air pods have been held up by a totally unrelated not unrelated but yeah totally separate
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.040]  probably i mean i who knows i don't know well then but if they shipped air pods too and then
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.520]  three months later shipped air power you have to buy new case for your pods too and then people get
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.440]  upset again and yeah well and did you see that there was a rumor this week that uh somebody some
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.760]  supply chain leaker who had a photo of a bunch supposedly new air pod cases yeah um says that
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.320]  it's still going to ship in 2018 the air pod too yeah i mean again like we've had december stuff
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.040]  but it's just rare and i think it's super inconvenient for holiday shoppers well yeah and
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.600]  you know and i i said you know i pointed out that like hey a lot of people have already started
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.320]  buying gifts yeah it goes into high gear the day after thanksgiving next week that's black friday
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.680]  you know the day when people go absolutely nuts buying stuff so how many you know i don't know
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.600]  millions i don't know if millions might be too big a number but hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.000]  of air pods will be purchased and then if apple comes out with new ones in december
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:03.200]  i mean and people point out well you know they have a very generous holiday return policy you
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.280]  know where you can buy a holiday gift for somebody in mid-november and they don't because they don't
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.760]  get it till you know december 25th or something like that they can take it back in january and
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.840]  yeah you know no questions asked so anybody who got old air pods and new air pods come out could
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:26.320]  exchange them but that's a pain in the butt right i mean nobody likes like you know here's your cool
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.120]  expensive for apple right it's very expensive for apple like why would apple want to do this
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.560]  why would they want angry customers and why would they want to deal with the expense of all these
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:41.600]  return things like in theory if they could have shipped a new second generation air pods this year
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.440]  the latest i think they could have done it would be to announce them at the october end of october
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.880]  event and say whether they were ready to ship at that moment or not say they're coming you know
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:18:00.240]  in the next few weeks and then everybody would know to wait and if sales of existing air pods
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.880]  plummet because everybody's waiting it's all good because you know apple is going to get the money
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.000]  when they buy them when they shipped anyway so it doesn't matter would have known that and they
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.480]  would have ramped down hard on air pod production in preparation for it right i just can't help but
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.640]  think that and i you can't help but think that they would have had them ready to give to reviewers
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.640]  too because like you know back when the original air pod ship they had prototype air pods they
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:29.120]  didn't look like prototypes they looked identical um but or pre-production i guess would be a better
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.680]  way to put it not prototype pre-production air pods that looked like the production ones but
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.640]  the production ones weren't ready but they gave them to us to review in september they would have
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.040]  done that too i would think and there's a huge like it doesn't look like there's any lack of
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.400]  supply there's a huge supply and a bunch of different discounts at different retailers so
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.520]  they look they look stocked for the holidays so i it just seems to me like people and i just know
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.160]  it i asked on twitter weeks ago months ago i forget what at this point like hey you know the quick
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.400]  twitter poll how many people are thinking about buying air pods either your first pair or a new
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.480]  pair but aren't because you're holding off for a next generation and it was you know it my
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.200]  followers are not really indicative of the world at large but at least among my followers yeah
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.080]  there were like lots and lots of people who are like yeah that's me uh i either want to get my
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:24.400]  first pair or i need to buy a replacement pair and i'm waiting and they're waiting and waiting
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:33.040]  and waiting yeah it's a very weird situation for a terrific terrific product right i feel like
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.800]  it's in this weird neverland and i can't and it popped into my head this week is something to
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:45.040]  really think about because of the joy of charging the pencil wirelessly yeah like charging the air
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:51.840]  pods isn't onerous right because i have lightning cables all over the place and so you just stick
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.040]  them into lightning every once in a while when you think about it um but man having a mat where you
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.680]  could put them would be even better because then they'd always be charged it's sort of this is
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.600]  complete tangent but it's i keep getting asked is it safe to buy imax because it's safe to buy it
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.440]  before september no is it safe to buy it before october because people want a new imac but the
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.720]  coffee lake ones aren't out yet and it seems like they could come out at any minute so people
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.400]  hesitate and then they wait and then when is it finally safe because apple's not going to update
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.360]  them and it just becomes a whole thing yeah i wouldn't buy an imac right now i i probably
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.520]  wouldn't if i needed it i probably wouldn't hesitate to buy an imac pro even though they're
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.320]  like a year old but you know if you need if you need it you need it i wouldn't buy a regular imac
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.000]  though and xeons are on i think the xeons are still sky like they're in a whole different
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:44.560]  schedule yeah it's well intel yep those poor bastards i know i've joked about this but literally
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.000]  every time i wake i go to sleep i am afraid that i'll wake up and there'll be a new lake
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  uh optimization cycle inserted before cannon lake again i i can't there's whiskey lake and amber
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.840]  lake and ice lake i can't bear to pay attention to it anymore i really can't it's it it doesn't
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.280]  pay to pay attention because it never it never turns out the way that that it said it's gotten
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.000]  painful they never hit the road map the road map might as well be like uh the map to mordor in the
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.920]  beginning of the lord of the rings it's fictional it's just the second movie they still haven't
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.440]  gotten there yeah it's just made up and they never get there anyway i want the other thing i wanted
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.600]  to think about and this popped into my head this week is with you were talking about watch bands
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:33.200]  before yeah and my favorite if i could only use one apple watch band if i had to pick one and
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.080]  that's you know it's never coming off the apple watch that i wear it would be the woven nylon
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.400]  band uh i find that to be the best combination of comfortable and i like the way it looks i like
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.520]  the way it feels i like everything about it it's the track pants of watch bands i just i love it
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.200]  i just love i know and i'm a fan of you know nato style uh yeah watch straps on my you know
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:04.160]  traditional watches too i just like the look um but curiously to me in the fall 2018 you know
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:11.200]  fashion lineup of new watch straps the woven nylon ones are out of the lineup um you can buy them but
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.080]  they're like you know like second-hand stuff on ebay or whatever the loops are still there but
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:24.880]  the buckles are all gone yep so the they've seemingly at the sporty um sporty end of the
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:33.440]  market other than the you know the the what would you call mark can do some sport yeah spanned the
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:40.080]  rubber rubbery default band for elastomer floral elastomer i thank you for thinking that um you
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:47.120]  know the one that is the iconic apple watch strap uh the sport loop i think is what they call it
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.600]  the velcro one is the yes that's the that's you know and it's been all right you know they came
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.280]  out with that last year but at this point it is sort of like the at the sporty end of apple's
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:06.880]  lineup that's that's that's the one um at the premium end ignoring the ermes stuff at the
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.040]  premium end i feel like the one that's the most popular and i also feel like apple is pushing it
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.200]  and i feel like they're pushing it because it's popular is the milanese loop yes um and i just
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:25.120]  happen to see when i see somebody with a stainless steel apple watch more often than not male or
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.680]  female it's it's often with the milanese absolutely it seems very popular my wife swears by it
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:38.960]  absolutely adores the milanese um the curious thing to me though is with the milanese
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.360]  and the velcro sport loop they're both closed loops so when you take them off they remain
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:55.280]  a loop which i think wouldn't work with air power as described like air power to me was described
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.480]  as you'd have to put the watch you know the way that you you know the the back ceramic back of
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.800]  the watch has to touch the pad yeah so i find that very curious that the the watch straps that
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:12.000]  apple is pushing the most this year are seemingly ones that are not compatible with using it with
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.080]  the air power yeah and there was no indication like when apple put out the previous charger
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.680]  um they had a they you could always get the cable that came with the watch but they made their own
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.280]  charging disc and you could push up the middle of it to become vertical so you could put the
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.920]  loops on and this one had no such provisions right right and that's in fact we have one in
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.400]  our bedroom because like i said my wife is a devoted fan of the milanese and it's you know
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.520]  having that that pad that has the pop-up thing so you can put it on sideways is the only way to do
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.160]  it um and you know me i like i have the um the i actually have it on today the uh link bracelet
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.720]  yes which apple seemingly has sort of quietly uh i don't think they haven't discontinued it you can
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.800]  still buy it but they've um de-emphasized it yeah and they didn't make the gold version like they
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.960]  did for the milanese no there is no there is no gold yeah there's a there's a the whatever the
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:14.960]  2018 gold shade is 2018 apple gold stainless steel has a milanese and does not have a corresponding
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.520]  link bracelet yeah so i don't know what the deal is with that but the link bracelet certainly
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.880]  wouldn't work on the air power without disconnecting the link you know there's a it's not
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:31.280]  too tricky to do it's part of the genius of apple's link design that you can break out of the loop but
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.680]  you don't want to do that every day well i have the cuff well the first hermes watch that came
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.320]  with the cuff and that was only out for the first generation and they haven't repeated it and unless
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.720]  you use the cable charger you can't put it on the disc because there's too much leather right and
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.480]  you can't put it on the stand it just doesn't work anyway and i'd have to pull it off right every
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.840]  time and i think that's probably why they didn't continue it yeah there's it just sort of seems
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:00.400]  like you know the balance between hey we have some cool ideas for bands and straps and you know
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.320]  we have certain needs for how to charge this thing aren't haven't always been compatible
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.520]  is basically what i see and the other thought that pops into my head is and i know i don't
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.720]  think air power is secretly you know better than it was promised i'm sure i mean this is
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:22.800]  years in the future but my pet bugaboo about calling inductive charging wireless charging
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.640]  when it has to be in contact whereas yes siri true wireless charging where the charging would
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.920]  work the way the way that wi-fi is truly wireless networking yes would be fantastic for the watch
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.400]  even if you know again even if the range was just you know six inches that would be great though you
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.280]  could just put a charger on your you know drawer your dresser or something like that and then just
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.880]  put the watch within a foot or something like that and have it charged that would be fantastic
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.880]  i mean quarkon if a bunch of companies have patents for that like just like they have patents
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.560]  for inductive charging through metal but having a patent and actually getting a product on market
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:04.400]  that works so different yeah don't you think too i i would like to think that if if air power ever
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.280]  actually does ship i would like to think that the apple pencil could charge on it too but maybe not
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.000]  wondering about that yeah right but maybe not because of the magnets like i don't think air
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.280]  power has the magnets but i guess they're somehow getting over that with the watch right the watch
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:24.400]  what yeah you know that's probably the complexity is that they need to it's not just that they have
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.600]  to take three very different power profiles but three different connection methodologies right
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.040]  yeah and you know with the watch chargers whether it's sustained you know they're all the same
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.160]  the actual charging part whether it's the pad or you know the just the the circle the disc at the
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.600]  the disc at the end of a cable they all precisely align you connect it you know you you get it near
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.920]  the back of your watch and the magnets snap it right into place perfectly and when you put the
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.120]  pencil on top of your ipad it snaps perfectly in the place it wants to be in the right position
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.280]  those haulback arrays they're just so yeah so happy with those it's like death star tractor
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.240]  beams i don't know how they if but if all these things need these you know tractor beams to get
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.400]  the magnetic tractor beams to get everything precisely aligned i have no idea how air power
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.680]  was ever going to work like i honestly i don't have any real inside info on this other than
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:19.120]  whispers that boy this this product this this product has had a lot of problems you know and
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.920]  should not have been promised when it was it wasn't in a state to be
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.560]  delivered when they thought it was going to be somebody gave a very optimistic
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.520]  estimation of ah we've got the x y and z problems to solve but we can do it we're apple
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.480]  and that's why well we're really understanding is that it had three zones and you could put
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.320]  any of the products onto those three zones um and then it was supposed to just handle yes the
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.600]  magnetics and the but you could only put two phones you couldn't put three phones which i
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.480]  guess was a limit of the power of the overall device yes i believe that was true too yes yeah
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.160]  um and it was supposed to just have the different size coils and positioning so that you didn't have
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.000]  to be too fussy with the phones but the watch and the cases would adjust would lock into place
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  but that anything that you're not in charge of implementing is super easy to do yeah it probably
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.920]  all fell apart in the actual implementation yeah so i i don't know i don't know what the heck is
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.320]  going i think it's such a weird and if they had never announced it if they had just never
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.440]  announced air power i feel like people would feel so much better about buying like new air pods
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.120]  today even though i know i know there are other features that are supposedly coming to new air
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.400]  pods like noise cancellation and and always on hey siri listening so you don't have to tap your ears
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.480]  you know i'm sure there's all sorts of cool ideas they could have for air pods it's not just the
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.640]  charging case but i feel like it's that charging case that's keeping people from buying air pods
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.560]  now and i think you heard this too but my understanding was it was it was supposed to be
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.680]  like this halo product the same way that air pods were with the lack of a 3.5 millimeter headphone
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.440]  jack to show apple's commitment like a little bit of strutting but to show their commitment
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.000]  to the technology and this was supposed to highlight that they were doing inductive charging
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.800]  but they were super committed to not only doing it but making it useful and pushing it forward yeah
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:07.440]  yeah no i heard that too it is one of the strangest products in my in my career following
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:13.040]  apple just in terms of how weird it is for them to announce something and then be unable to ship it
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.520]  i mean even the only other thing i can think of that was quite like this was the white ipod
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.200]  iphone 4 yeah was it the iphone 4 or the 3gs i think it was the four the four yeah because
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:29.120]  they couldn't get the the glass um was it was obstructing the sensors yeah initially it was
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.440]  very strange and it ended up not shipping until like that was when the phones were coming out at
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.000]  wwdc in june or at least they were announced there and then they'd ship it like the end of june and
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.840]  it didn't even come out until like may so it was like six weeks before before people thought maybe
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.320]  the iphone 4s would come out now the iphone 4s didn't come out in june of that year because that
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:55.040]  was the one that was that changed to a fall schedule but still 11 months after it was
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.280]  announced is very strange delay yeah it's the only other thing i can think of is when steve
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.480]  jobs did that statement about the intel switch when he said you know we've wanted to be able
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.640]  to give you the power mac with it with the g4 and we wanted to be able to give you the power
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.080]  book with the g4 and we just haven't been able to do it all right moving on how about this i i
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:21.200]  the ipad os argument in terms of and this uh merlin and i talked about it last week on this
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:26.080]  show uh and there's a lot of people who were like yes everything you guys said is what drives me
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:33.520]  nuts this os is just not meant for multitasking and you know like stephen trompton smith who
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:38.160]  loves the ipad and multitasking like tweeted he was listening to our show and just felt like he
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.280]  was listening to two guys from 20 years ago talk about how the you know gooey is never going to
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:48.800]  take over the command line and i i get it and that's why i try not to be i really try to keep
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:56.080]  as open mind as i can but man the more i dig into it the more frustrated i get with multitasking on
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:01.120]  the ipad there are some crazy crazy things and again i'm coming out from the perspective of
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:05.120]  someone who generally is thinking about it with at least when i'm multitasking when i have two
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.960]  things on screen it's with a keyboard i'm using two and the way command tab works on the ipad is
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:17.200]  insane yes it is it it it it should be as an operating system interface it should be committed
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:24.240]  it is it is insane like but like all right so if you have messages on screen full screen and then
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:30.080]  you go to your dock and you drag notes out of the dock to do multitasking and you make it a split
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:34.720]  screen thing and now you've got messages on one side and notes on the other when you go to command
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:39.920]  tab notes doesn't show up in the command tab switcher because you didn't you didn't tap it
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:47.280]  to launch it you dragged it out of the dock into multitasking so it doesn't register in the command
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:53.040]  tab switcher you just you go to command tab here's a list of your most recently used apps and the one
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.280]  you just opened notes the one you might have just been typing in right now the one that might
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:01.840]  currently have input focus from the keyboard doesn't show up it's insane registered with the
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:09.840]  system it's absolutely insane it's not a bug it it seems like a bug but when you watch it it's
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.240]  deterministic it's because you didn't tap it to launch it it's because you dragged it out of the
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.840]  dock yeah but that's that's insane it's a huge oversight it's not a bug but it's a huge oversight
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:27.680]  and there's a completely different app switcher when you use your finger and drag up and go to
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:35.600]  you know the the overview where it's like mission control yeah it it's insane that there's a there's
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:42.720]  one switcher for using your finger to swipe up to get to and a completely different switcher
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.360]  in a completely different order when you do command tab like command tab should obviously
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:54.240]  bring up the same thing you get when you swipe up from the bottom it's insane and you could just see
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.480]  like uh so i there's this huge problem in tech support and i've talked about this before is that
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.240]  people tend to tell you solutions they want rather than problems that they have and you might have
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:06.640]  way better ways of solving their problems than just listening to their endless list of solutions
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.560]  and this is sort of that just like you know let's just give the computer people command tab you know
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.480]  they're used to it from the mac we'll just do it and that's always the wrong answer and yet super
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.920]  frustrating when it takes three years for copy paste and 10 years effectively for drag and drop
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:26.240]  but when they actually do go and and take the same problem and come to an ipad native solution it
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.480]  always works better than when they try to transplant something from the mac into ios
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:37.520]  and there's all sorts of ways like sometimes if you have keyboard focus in an app and then you
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.240]  command tab away and then you command tab back the focus sometimes sometimes it's still there
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:48.160]  and sometimes it's gone and you have to tap again where you want to be typing like that's insane it
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.360]  is you can't just change focus like if you're on the keyboard there's no way to change focus
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  between the two apps that you're using no even though they're both right there yeah it is so
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:04.160]  clearly it it makes a lot of sense when you're hand holding the ipad and you're entirely using
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.120]  the touch screen yeah it makes some sense i don't think it's a great multitasking system i don't
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:15.360]  think the interface for having two things on screen at once is that i i don't like it i i
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:21.360]  really hope apple has a serio you know these rumors that ios 12 was going to have a major ipad
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:28.000]  interface change for power users and it got scuttled on the basis of hey let's just focus
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.560]  ios 12 on being faster and more stable and punt a year on this you know there's rampant rumors
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.000]  that that was true um so i know everybody every podcasting universe is talking about their ideas
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  their whole the engineers that you would imagine would be working on that were retasked to work on
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.400]  the performance and they can't do both at the same time so you know who knows what they have in mind
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:55.200]  my hope would be that this would be a lot more of a rethink than just adding more on i really kind
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.000]  of i would like to but on the other hand i know there's people who love it at the same say they
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.840]  love it at least the way it is and you can't yank that away i don't think well you know they've
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.840]  changed so many they completely changed the way that it worked i think it was an ios 10 and people
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.080]  had no idea how to pull apps onto the side anymore so i think they're it's new enough that you can
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:20.800]  still mess around with it but uh get getting it to that point uh for me is super interesting because
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.040]  you when they did the apple watch they didn't just transplant springboard i mean they made
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.440]  they made the carousel interface but that's been buried over time and it's sort of like you can't
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.880]  take the you can't take the the uh expectations you have from an iphone and just put them on every
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.400]  device size and with the apple tv yeah it still has that i forget what they call it pine board or
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.200]  headboard yeah that looks like icons but really they're moving it towards the tv app interface
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.840]  because that's better and the ipod is the worst offender with this and that it really did just
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.160]  have a big iphone interface when it's clearly not suited to the big screen and it hasn't had
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:58.480]  the benefit of getting its own interface layer the way the watch has or the or the tv has and
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.320]  it feels past you yeah it really does and and when you have a keyboard connected is when to me it
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:10.640]  really shows it can be very very frustrating at times with the diff you know the inability to
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.880]  control input focus and stuff like that just give me like quicksilver or alfred where i'm
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.160]  i type tweet tweet at john grueber having lunch today and it just does it all i mean like palms
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.440]  had that blackberry's had that it's an understand understandable paradigm it is true spotlight is a
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.400]  lifesaver for launching apps on the ipad because you can't you still can't like they do have a
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.360]  command h i think that this is follow-up from a couple weeks ago i i think i might have misspoken
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.520]  on the show and said that there's no way to go home on a keyboard and except for some of these
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.280]  third-party keyboards that have a home button like some of the third-party keyboards have an actual
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:52.560]  like old school you know remember when iphones had home buttons they have a home button but uh command
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.400]  h works um if not everywhere it should work everywhere in terms of you can always go home
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.360]  but then once you go home and you're on the keyboard there's nothing there's nothing you
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.280]  can do you can't arrow around to select icons and again like this focus ui on the apple tv that lets
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:13.200]  you use a serie remote to to select things and on ios but where it would make sense on the ipad it's
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.880]  not there yeah it really would to me is to be able to go home and then you what i would like to be
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:24.640]  able to do is make it more like a lot more like the finder where you can maybe by default you go
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.960]  home there is no selection but then as soon as you start touching arrow keys it would make a
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.240]  selection and it would make the selection by popping it up off the screen like apple tv and
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.760]  then you could go left to go left across the grid you could go down to go down and then you could
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.280]  type the first letter of an app that's on screen right now and it would jump to that app so if i
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.520]  type p it would highlight p calc and it would pop off the screen like i i don't understand why you
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.520]  can't do that like the mac like they have the minus one home screen they've had it for a while
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.920]  in ios when you swipe to the side and it's got a text field where you can start typing search terms
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:03.680]  it's got a machine learned app recommendations which are likely the apps you're going to want
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.360]  to use and it's got a bunch of informational widgets that present you with with the things
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.600]  that it believes are the most important right now and it feels like if you just start sliding that
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.640]  over to be the default home screen and let me page over to a set of apps if i really want to i would
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:22.560]  i would be a lot faster on the ipad yeah so the interface that does work best on with the keyboard
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:28.480]  is command space to go to spotlight because you can just start typing and you can use the arrow
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:35.680]  keys afterwards to select things from the results so if i do command space and type s a f i get
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:41.360]  safari yep you know so you could type your shortcut names right into there and just start
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.080]  executing things spot yeah that would be nice that would be like the modern command line yeah
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:53.520]  so spotlight is very nicely hooked up to the keyboard but it only just exacerbates how much
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:00.880]  else of the os isn't you know it it all feels very tacked on in my opinion like it needs a lot of
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:11.200]  love and it really shouldn't feel like a big iphone you know it's it it's too many and we're
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.120]  too many years into this right it's it's in the there's no excuse because the oh the ipad still
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:23.600]  new or whatever it's not new i mean for god's sake steve jobs uh yes it showed it off and i mean it's
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:30.080]  eight years old when the mac was eight years old it was 1992 and the mac was you know it had an
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:36.000]  incredibly rich ecosystem of apps and industries like the entire graphic design industry had
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.480]  had in eight years the entire graphic design industry and printing industry had completely
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:50.160]  switched to a macintosh based uh workflow for designers to printing and you know it
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.960]  whole industries went around it and the and the interface conventions
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:02.640]  were the same like it wasn't like oh but to get powerful stuff like photoshop and illustrator
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.520]  and quark we've got to really rethink the os at a fundamental level no the os at a fundamental
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:14.080]  level was exactly the same as 1984 i mean they added the issues but it it the i the basic
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.360]  concepts were the same i think one of the issues is apple tv has a whole org under eddie q that
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:25.520]  just works on on apple tv interface and watch has a whole group of people under jeff williams and
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.120]  kevin lynch that just work on the watch but there is no ipad group effectively there's no like yes
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.440]  you are the people in charge of iphone interface and springboard and all there's just a springboard
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.760]  team and a lot of the time their attention gets sucked into iphone because that's that's where
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.240]  all the money in the volume is yeah and i wrote about this i really i wrote about it in the
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:52.160]  context of apple's quarterly results and how you know that how the macintosh out out revenued to
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.720]  make up over the ipad uh you know ipad sold more units but the mac made more money and you know
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:04.240]  that warms my heart as a guy who's you know favorite platform of all of apples is the mac
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.120]  but for all the consternation out there among mac people who are worried that quote-unquote
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.920]  tim cook wants everybody to just use an ipad for everything and that the mac is going to be phased
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.840]  out and the you know that they're just going to have this one ios platform and everything will
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:28.400]  be running you know you know the future of the imac is a giant 30-inch ipad or something for all
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.840]  of that consternation and all of apple's hey the mac isn't going anywhere you know the big
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:40.080]  craig federighi slide at wwdc are we going to merge these two platforms no right like giant
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:47.760]  80-foot letters in a period yeah i i almost feel looking at this and really studying the ipad's
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.160]  interface as a you know trying to get it trying to be as much of a power user as i can
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:57.680]  i honestly feel if anybody should be worried it's the ipad people because it's the ipad that's not
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.080]  getting the love and i know there's so many people who think that apple doesn't show enough attention
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:08.400]  to the mac and and you know it's the it's overlooked in favor of the iphone i think the ipad
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:15.280]  has suffered way more from apple's look the phone is first phone is you know the most the most money
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.320]  the most users the most important it's the ipad that suffered more than the mac because if the
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.400]  mac has gotten less attention than we might hope engineering and design wise it's already good it
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:33.360]  doesn't need yeah it doesn't need major changes whereas the ipad really needs help conceptually
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.680]  the ipad gets a lot of hardware attention not as much software attention the max feels vice versa
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:44.560]  right and that that is a perfect that is so true and that is exactly what is like in my head using
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:52.320]  this remarkable ipad pro computing device this this device put aside the user interface the
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:59.840]  actual hardware is just it continues to just amaze me like i don't i i worry sometimes if i you know
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:06.800]  i don't want to be too effusive in a review if if if i'm reviewing this thing and it and i feel
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.640]  like man i just have good things to say about this am i what am i missing right but it i almost
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.320]  feel like in my review the ipad pro i undersold how great the hardware is yeah it's i only
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:21.680]  reviewed the hardware and i got a lot of criticism for not having enough negatives but i think that's
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.080]  because i just didn't touch on the software at all i touched a little bit i i sort of brushed
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.240]  it aside and i think i got some of the same criticism too because it just it is what it is
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.360]  it's not a story yeah ios 12 didn't change right it's not new like that's the story is that it
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.440]  didn't get the love that we were hoping it would get in terms of productivity features and
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.880]  a more sensible ways to be able to arrange multiple apps on screen and stuff like that
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.400]  because when you think about it with the iphone introduction yes they've already introduced the
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:54.160]  io the version of ios at wdc but there's inevitably features that are unique to the hardware that get
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.480]  announced alongside it and this ipad didn't have that it's not like it's a brand new ipad with
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.960]  edge and we're announcing this new software stuff that goes with it i i just there's so many little
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.640]  things i'm so frustrated i they've overlooked like in a way that on the phone i just love the new
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.000]  gestures for getting around the system i just love it and i never i never think about it
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:22.640]  um and the phone on the ipad it's so overloaded in terms of a little bit gets you you know i i
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:28.160]  if i'm not being very careful almost like surgically approaching how i raise my finger
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:33.200]  from the bottom of the screen to get exactly what i want i end up going home when what i wanted to
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:39.600]  was to bring up the dock i i i can do it on purpose like if you bet me remember that uh
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.160]  the uh actually i wouldn't want to take this bet now that i think about it but remember the the
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.680]  tarantino short film in uh the the what was that movie where they took place in a hotel and the
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.520]  bet was you could light the guy could light his lighter 10 times in a row otherwise he'd lose
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:46:00.640]  that finger yeah uh three rooms was the name of the movie and tarantino's uh like would i want
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:06.320]  to bet my finger that i could get the doc to come up and not go home no i wouldn't know i would bet
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.880]  i would bet a hundred dollars i would bet that i if i'm very careful if i got to be as careful as
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.760]  i wanted to uh could i make the ipad doc come up and not go home yeah i just did it very carefully
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.560]  and it was i got it but when i'm not thinking about it when i just sort of raised my finger
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:28.240]  a little bit which is what my mindset when i'm working when i'm in the flow right i i'm always
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:33.920]  going home when i wanted to just raise the doc and that's it's not hard to go back but it's like
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.080]  jarring if you're writing in notes and you're on in the flow and you're writing like like quick
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.720]  want to bring something up and then all of a sudden your notes app is gone it's very healthy
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.920]  you want to get to that mission control screen so you got to pull it up and not go home but then
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:51.760]  pull it up a second time i still not go home you really it requires surgical precision i and that's
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:47:01.600]  that's bad i mean it's not overloaded right i i find it so like when you bring up an app and
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.920]  and you know there's two ways to bring up a second app you can you can lock it in as like okay it's
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:13.760]  either half or a third of the screen and it's locked in or it's floating over the other app
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:19.840]  like temporarily sometimes i can just flick that app away and sometimes it's like there's it it's
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.600]  like there's no way to flick it away i don't know why i don't i don't understand it's like
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.000]  last time i had this i had the notes up temporarily i just flicked it off to the side
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.680]  and it disappeared now it won't go away and i the only way i can make it go away is to lock it into
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:39.520]  the screen permanently and then drag the divider between the two apps to make it go away whereas
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.480]  like to close a window on the mac i'm never confused i just hit command w or i click the
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:52.560]  red button yeah that's it i don't know i i feel like i don't know i i feel like everybody should
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:48:00.080]  agree that the ipad needs major ui help for multitasking and serious use and we can obviously
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:07.120]  disagree on just what that would be and it's obviously a big there is no obvious solution in
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.080]  my opinion it's going to require apple to do what what we like apple to do best which has come up
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:18.480]  with innovative new user interface ideas well my thing like and i wrote about this back in 2015 is
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.280]  that i just want there to be a team that does pad os the way there's a team that does watchos
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:28.640]  and a team that does because then they have to have deliverables every year if it's just ios it
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.960]  can it can go back and forth between two different devices which isn't really fair to either of them
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:40.560]  yeah and that kind of comes back to the point of convergence and that people somehow it it sounds
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.840]  great to say that everything should converge to one os and it would just look different whether
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:52.560]  it's a laptop or a tablet or a phone that sounds great and it's it it there's a you know a certain
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.920]  appeal to the sound of that idea but in practice i don't think that's ever a good idea and if
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:03.840]  anything i think they should what's the opposite of they should dive divergent right i i would
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:10.240]  i i would rather see ipad break off into pad os or whatever they would call it ipad os
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:16.240]  then then continue on the current path i would rather it's not an absolute i mean like right
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:20.720]  now spring like springboard is just a layer like backboard i believe is remarkably similar between
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.760]  the different ones core os is the same between mac and ios on many occasions and you can have
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.240]  all this infrastructure that is identical and compatible and provides continuity and all the
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:33.920]  inextensibility and all the features that you want and then just have a team working on those
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.880]  presentation layers on top of them and you know i'm not asking for them to turn the ipad into mac
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:44.000]  os you know i yeah it's that there's no point we already have mac os and i you know i love
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:50.160]  in principle i love the idea of not having windows uh everything is in a window that you know because
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:56.000]  windows having a bunch of windows on screen can get fiddly and they don't quite line up you know
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.560]  neatly the the way that you know like effectively a tiling system where everything is either full
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:07.360]  screen or half screen or a third screen and it's all nice and neat and everything is full height
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:12.560]  and you don't have uh you know it's like look here's a window that's about 20 pixels too short
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:19.280]  as to be full height i guess i'll fix it because i want you know those those minor you know low
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:25.040]  grade ocd wants the extra you know pixels it's nice that everything snaps into place you know
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:32.080]  in principle in practice boy it's tough to beat a windowing system i would just argue that like
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:36.240]  a lot of people just want to solve ipad by by like they just say just give it finder and they want to
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.360]  they won't they are mac users whose only conception or understanding of how to improve the ipad is
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.920]  because they're mac users so that's entire frame of reference but the best thing about ipad to me is
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.680]  that it issues the baggage of os 10 it keeps all of the a lot of the foundational parts but it's
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.360]  a fresh start to computing because there were a lot of really bad decisions that were made in
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.080]  unix over the years because the people building it were computer scientists and not human interface
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.000]  people and it's most for most people i think one of the biggest problems we had at the um ipad event
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.120]  that at the october event is that apple put up this slide of ipad sales versus laptop sales
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:15.120]  and a bunch of people said oh look it is a laptop instead of saying oh look how many people are
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:19.600]  buying the ipad because it is not a laptop yeah and there's this huge market of people for whom
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:25.680]  computers are still crypto crazy stuff that they just cannot relate to and it's good that we're
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.720]  rethinking all these things it's just we're thinking them way too slowly yeah and i i feel
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:37.040]  like the ipad is best for the most people to be honest when it's and but i think it's at its best
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:44.480]  when it's used the most simply my wife is a devout ipad user spends way more time on her ipad than
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.080]  phone and mac combined and she doesn't even know how multitasking works i mean she lives with me
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:55.120]  she knows it is a thing and she has no interest in it she goes home she wants to do mail she taps
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:01.760]  mail mail takes up the full screen she wants to go back to safari and she goes home and taps safari
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:08.480]  and goes to safari and that simplicity i the way i see people and i'm i know i know that you know
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.520]  steven taunton smith's probably going to tweet at me because of this episode i know he's using it
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.200]  and i know federico is using it yeah and i know snell is doing some fancy stuff with it but i
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.520]  actually think if you look at it the people who are using the making the most use of the
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:29.760]  multitasking and who swear by it are some of the most advanced users i know they're they're you
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:37.600]  know they're the power users among power users and i almost feel like the ipad is like it's like two
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:42.960]  polars there's the the simple use of ipad where it really shines and it's just one app at a time
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.800]  on screen like a big phone and people freaking love it and then there's the multitasking stuff
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:55.920]  and it's so weird and fiddly and conceptually non-obvious that it only the only people who
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.280]  use it are some of the most advanced users on the planet i think there's a third group and you know
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.480]  it's it's and i've joked about this before but like anyone who lives in a village north of you
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.720]  is a northerner it doesn't matter how far north they are anyone who does similar work to you or
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.760]  more complicated work in your mind is is a pro and anybody who does anything else is not a pro and if
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:18.480]  like if vitice can use an ipad he's obviously not a pro and then if you can't do use an ipad you're
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:23.040]  obviously not smart enough to use it and it's all this nonsense but i when when apple has some of
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:28.080]  these demos or you just meet people there are incredible classes of professionals from people
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:32.880]  like the guy who was at the event rob mccullen who does all of the storyboarding for pacific rim and
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.120]  star wars and all of that on an ipad pro and he had i forget the name but there was a guy who's
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:43.120]  an architect does a lot of the famous famous celebrity houses and he does all of that on an
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:49.040]  ipad pro and they were and kareem was there from dj incredible dj does all of that on the ipad pro
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:55.040]  they're a huge swath of developers who were completely underserved by computers until
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.760]  something like ipad came on people who make as much money as any pro who are as legitimately
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.800]  any pro not traditional computing pros the only underserved market now is developers who's one
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:10.000]  of the biggest categories of pros and who still can't develop for ipad on ipad but i'm hopeful
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.120]  that i mean i think you got the same photoshop demo i did where it's real photoshop it's not
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.360]  full photoshop but you can sort of take your environment with you on the go and if apple
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:25.760]  would figure out that for xcode and let developers use important subsets of of their projects on the
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.080]  go with ipad pro i think we'd see a lot of the pain points sort of disappear it doesn't have to
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:37.200]  be a mac but it has to let you get the stuff done that you need to get done um yeah i i think you
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.760]  know what i would say is that all of these computers all of these devices are at their
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:48.160]  best when they disappear and yes it's not in your mind that you're using it and i feel like the ipad
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:55.600]  at some moments and in some cases is the most the most amazing of these devices that when it
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:02.000]  disappears it can disappear for a long stretch of time you know and talking to people who do
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.040]  like illustration on it uh i forget his name but the guy who's the illustrator for penny arcade
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  just had a blog post yeah yeah um about you you know he's been using an ipad pro i don't know for
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.760]  how how much you know some i don't know like a year or something and bought the new one and
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.320]  as much as he liked the old ones just blown away by the new one but it's you you listen to him talk
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.560]  about it and it's like part of it is that it just it's not like using a computer anymore it's just
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:35.040]  it he's just it's just a pencil in his comic you know that the ipad becomes the actual comic yeah
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:40.160]  it's not a device with a comic it is just is the comic i think the ipad is so great at that but
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:45.840]  then there's times when you just want like a big safari window on the left and a tall skinny
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.600]  twitter window on the right and then oh you want to replace that twitter skinny twitter thing on
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:57.840]  the right with messages because somebody just texted you and it's like eight eight swipes and
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:05.280]  taps yeah yeah when it really shouldn't be because you still want safari over there on the side in a
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.880]  way that you know once you pair these two things side by side they become like a married couple
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:15.280]  that can't be separated you know they've got like a dependence problem and that's the other thing
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:18.640]  people always complain that there's not full safari on there and i never know who's to blame
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.080]  for that because you talk to apple and they're like there's just one safari team we just make
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.480]  safari but then you try to use the fine ipad and all these sites load the iphone version of it
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.320]  instead of the desktop version and you have to press the desktop button and you get it like
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.640]  it's available to it there's for some reason the mix of mobile safari's identity bar and those
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.800]  websites just always give you a bad experience yeah it makes people think that safari is worse
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.360]  than it actually is there's other things too i gotta write about this it's it's it's just such
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.440]  it's just such a mountain it's just such such a huge rant but i gotta get it off my chest but
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.040]  like one of the other things i noticed i've been trying to do more and more work on it and so
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:00.880]  i upload the the audio hosting for the talk show is on soundcloud and to upload there might be
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.720]  other ways i don't know the way i know how to do it is i log into soundcloud's website and they
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:10.800]  have a button that says upload audio and then you choose from the file picker or you drag it into
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:17.520]  the window and it uploads the audio and you wait and it does a little processing and then it's
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.320]  ready and then you know i can proceed with the other stuff i have to do so i tried doing it on
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.640]  the ipad last week with the last episode and soundcloud doesn't have a mobile or at least
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:33.200]  on the ipad they they show you what looks like the same thing i see on a mac it's it shows you
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:40.080]  the full website and it lets you hit the upload button and uh the upload button lets you pick
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:47.760]  from the apps in files so i can pick from dropbox and i can pick from icloud um dropbox is actually
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.360]  where i what i need and it works and i can just go there and it's exact you know just like as
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.840]  familiar as the finder here's all my folders in my dropbox here's the one for the talk show here's
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:04.000]  the new episode there it is and it goes and it starts uploading and as it's uploading if i
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.640]  command tab away and go to another app and then come back to safari it stopped yeah it just doesn't
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:17.040]  doesn't work in the background um and that's you know i don't want to sit there and wait it takes
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:22.480]  minutes i don't yes it doesn't seem right that's what apple's just-in-time multitasking breaks down
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:27.680]  for you and on the other hand i get it though because i hate the idea i hate how much battery
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:34.640]  life and cpu power i waste on the mac with crappy websites running javascript i don't want in the
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:42.240]  background like i kind of like philosophically the idea that a website that isn't a visible tab
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:48.720]  should be shut down but i didn't close the tab i didn't cover the tab it's still the frontmost tab
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:55.920]  in safari i've just made safari not frontmost and the upload stops yeah i mean and i think they have
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:01.600]  a way to make that kind of stuff continue i don't remember for sure but i think for all i know it's
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:05.840]  entirely soundcloud's fault i don't know i i no that sounds like ios it's because i don't think
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.040]  soundcloud would terminate the connection that sounds like ios has reached its whatever limit
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.680]  for time and shuts down the process right i i'm just saying it doesn't really matter because
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:17.600]  practically speaking it doesn't work it always works on the mac and it doesn't work on the ipad
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.800]  unless i keep it frontmost and i even think i have to you know it takes enough minutes usually to
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:27.200]  upload an episode of the show that i i would have to keep touching the screen to keep it
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:32.720]  falling asleep see there's this weird thing like it reminds me of when marco did that whole
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:37.360]  talk about he didn't want to have a setting screen in the original overcast and he ended up having
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:41.840]  to do so many gymnastics to avoid having a setting screen it was simpler just to add a setting screen
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:46.400]  and apple really didn't want a file system on the ipad even though they had an image picker and the
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:51.200]  photos app and they could have easily had document picker and the files app like they have right now
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:56.480]  it took them years and they had silo so if you created a note um in vesper for example and then
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.000]  you forgot where that note was you'd have to try and figure out what go through every single one
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.240]  of your apps and find a note because there was no and now finally we have universal files but
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:09.120]  i can stick an sd card or a you know something into the computer and uh image picker will come
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:13.280]  up and let me pull in all my photos but document picker will not come up and let me pull in all my
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:19.040]  documents and it feels like it's just that legacy thinking where they're they're um their obsession
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:24.080]  of avoiding the complexity of files has made files so much more complex than they need to be on ios
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:32.240]  yeah um yeah we were yeah it's there's sometimes where you just need you you just can't beat the
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:38.160]  old floppy net you know sneaker net you know you just have a big file on machine a and the fastest
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:44.240]  way to get it to the machine b where you need it is to you know use an sd card or a usb drive or
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.760]  something um it's very frustrating that doesn't work i know that's been talked to death and
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.160]  it's got to be on apple's radar but yeah and it doesn't that's the things that i'd like you know
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.360]  you don't need finder they just have these existing and again i'm doing the exact thing
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:00.560]  i said not to you but don't propose solutions from over right but my problem is i get given
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.480]  these things and i need to be able to handle them and i need them to fix that for me yeah i don't
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:10.560]  you know and you know i totally get not being able to you know i i just feel like apple is a little
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:16.640]  gun shy about even opening the door crack on external storage you know and the way that you
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.120]  know even android's gotten away from it though i don't i to me it seems like most android phones
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:27.280]  don't take sd card slots that you can use as internal storage anymore and i i totally get
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.120]  people were so frustrated by that in the early years of the iphone because the storage capacities
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.320]  were so low and other phones you know would let other brand phones would let you do it you know
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:40.320]  open the back put an sd card in there and then all of a sudden you can store you know it's just
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.240]  looks like the os treats it as internal storage i get not doing that because then you you it just
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.640]  you know the mac does it and the mac has the conceptual heaviness to allow it but what happens
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.720]  when you take the card out and the app is dependent on it right it's the you know that's
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:02:00.080]  the thing is like uh again i don't want them to just put the mac onto ios but they're and i
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.600]  understand that the cloud like they have storage providers so you can hook into dropbox and icloud
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.760]  and then you can move files over the cloud that's fine but there are situations even when dealing
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.160]  with people at apple where you get given physical storage yeah and i don't need it to be persistent
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.960]  physical storage i just need to get the files on yeah so if they gave me like they have a wonderful
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.960]  new it debuted with ios 12 a wonderful new way to pull photos on because they understand that
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.960]  when you're dealing with photos and video it comes from an external source the camera or the cart
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:31.120]  files is the same thing just give me a the the files equivalent of the of the image picker and
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.920]  let me suck those files into files.app and i'll be fine i don't have to keep the drive plugged in
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.920]  i just need to get them onto my like that exactly or the opposite is let me move this file yes from
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.360]  somewhere else onto this card because i got to give it to renee because renee is the one who's
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.560]  going to go do the editing you know yes all right let me take it i don't have four gigs of time to
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.240]  wait for it to upload all right let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor

[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:35.520]  after year like that's the worst part was i hate it when i finally think of a really great gift

[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:45.200]  just burned the idea fractures as gifts you can just keep doing them year after year you don't
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:51.360]  have to waste any time waste any thought it's fantastic and nobody no grandparent ever is like
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.680]  ah i've got too many pictures of my grandkids nobody ever thinks that they're just fantastic

[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:36.160]  i love fracture i really mean it i swear they sponsor the show every year i'd swear
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.600]  even if they stopped sponsoring if they said screw you john we're not sponsoring your show
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:45.840]  anymore i would still tell people to buy fracture gifts as gifts because it's just so unbelievable
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:54.640]  uh what else is going on oh how about this cable situation i really dug deep on the the i saw that
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:02.000]  so here's here's the my dilemma and and now i've i've bought this new ipad pro and i don't even
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.040]  know where my old ipad pro is it's somewhere in my office it's it's already it's all junk like
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.480]  but now i've got this thing that i'm carrying around me personally john
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.360]  now so now it's a real problem because it's my my problem yes i've got this thing with a new
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:23.600]  connector i still my personal macbook pro is still the 2014 so i've still got magsafe for that
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:30.720]  and i've you know got a phone and now so now i've got to go around and i've got to charge
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:37.040]  if i go on a trip and i take a pad ipad and a mac and my phone now i've got three things
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:43.440]  three cable charge and you know the mac and maybe micro usb for some of your accessories
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:48.400]  right well like a battery pack yeah yeah so i've been a big fan i've i've mentioned this before
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:57.440]  mono price and makers of cables and all sorts of gadgets have these excellent cables that have
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:05.200]  their their usb-a on that goes into the charging source side and on the other side it's a micro usb
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:14.240]  with two caps that are attached one for lightning and one for usb-c so one cable it is a little ugly
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:19.600]  at the end because it's got you know two of these little like caps sort of like you know but they
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:24.560]  are attached and they're attached i've had these a couple of these cables for well over a year you
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:30.880]  know the little piece of rubber that keeps it attached it seems very rugged um and it's kind
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:37.600]  of a lifesaver it's a great thing it doesn't you know because it looks a little ugly so it's not
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.880]  not the most elegant thing to have laying around the house but in terms of like something to keep
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:47.040]  in your bag having a couple of them you just take and that they're the only black cables i have so
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:52.160]  if i see a black cable in my bag i know it'll work for anything it has lightning usb-c and micro usb
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:58.240]  the problem is it's usb-a on the other end so i need a usb-a charger which didn't used to be a
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:04.160]  problem because that's i i just used the ipad chargers right which were either 10 watt or
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:11.440]  in recent years 12 watt so the old apple ipad chargers were what i would take i'd take like
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:17.040]  two of them with me or like on a family trip i bought at some point i forget what brand it was
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:23.120]  some point i forget what brand it was this is probably an anchor i had this black thing probably
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:32.240]  about the size of like a macbook power square and it had a bunch of usb-a slots so you could i could
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:40.320]  plug this one thing in and charge like five usb devices the problem now though is that with modern
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:46.320]  macbooks and with the ipad pro you don't want to limit it to 10 or 12 watt charging you want
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:51.760]  you want faster charging because it can charge faster but the faster chargers the 18 watt charger
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.120]  that comes with the ipad pro and the 30 watt charger that you can buy from apple or the better
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:04.800]  deal the anchor one that's also 30 watt and it's like half the price they all start with usb-c out
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.800]  to get those support those faster charging speeds and the only company that sells usb-c
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:18.000]  to lightning cables that support fast charging and are certified is apple they have two they have
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:25.360]  a one meter cable and a two meter cable and i think they're 19 and a ridiculous 35 dollars
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:30.000]  respectively i mean i say ridiculous i mean i think it's hard to make a two meter cable that
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.440]  does it it's i don't know but i don't think apple's track record on lightning cable durability
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.760]  really justifies the prices that they charge i mean you know i i probably criticize apple less
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:48.080]  on pricing than most critics uh i gotta say that for their quality a lot of their products are
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:53.520]  high priced but they're also very high quality the lightning cables are high priced and they are not
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.880]  high quality there's i've thrown out an awful lot of lightning cables over the years because they
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:07.360]  fray and the things get exposed no company has third-party cables it and so i dug into it and
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:15.680]  the long story short is um it's hard to make this story short actually no you can't all right one
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:23.760]  thing i learned that i guess i knew but i think i'd forgotten is that all mfi made for iphone uh
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:30.880]  uh licensed cables with lightning every single one the actual lightning connector that little
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:35.840]  thing that plugs into the your phone the the actual lightning connector all of them are
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:43.520]  sourced from apple yes so every anchor mono price amazon you name it if you buy a certified
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.800]  lightning cable the actual lightning connector is from apple so there else is licensed to make those
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:55.520]  connectors right and part of it is uh well i don't who knows what the reasons are thanks part of it
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.920]  might be technical because there's like a chip in there for a handshake that i guess apple wants to
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:05.760]  make itself i think apple enjoys having the control yes it's almost always control they
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:14.480]  don't give them away they sell them um and i guess the problem is that the existing connectors
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:23.200]  aren't aren't certified for pd power delivery which is what is required to get above 12 watts
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:31.840]  on usb um and so apple's own cables obviously have this new connector uh that is certified
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  you know and does pd because you can you can plug these into like a 30 watt charger i think
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:42.400]  the new ipad pro would can even go up to like 45 watts or something um i think it can take advantage
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.480]  of even more than a 30 watt charger but a 30 watt charger gets you pretty close to the maximum
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:52.160]  charging speed apple isn't licensing those connectors to third parties so you can't there's
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:59.040]  nothing belkin or or anchor or amazon or any of the mono price any of the companies who you might
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:03.520]  like to buy third-party cables from they there's nothing they can do and supposedly according to
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:10.880]  these rumors they're that's going to change at some point in the spring of next year that by by
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:16.160]  like april or something like that third parties are going to have the new uh lightning cape
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:21.520]  connectors and can therefore make a usb-c lightning cable yeah they're all new they're
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:27.040]  completely new n bits yeah exactly it's so long you know that's a good way to put it the n bits
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:35.360]  are new because they support this new thing and right now only apple has yeah uh i mfi licensees
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:40.400]  do not talk about mfi because the penalty there's everybody signs a non-disclosure agreement and
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.440]  breaking the non-disclosure agreement supposedly carries fines in the millions of dollars uh that's
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:53.680]  what neil patel is as reported and i have no reason to doubt him um and i also have no reason
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:59.520]  to doubt that apple would enjoy putting a massive penalty fee on breaking uh let's just say that
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:03.520]  those ndas are so much stricter than the ndas you see around new versions of ios that people
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:10.000]  used to break routinely so there's not a lot of information out there neil i was tweeting about
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.640]  it this week and said that he's you know the verge has been trying to get a story on mfi licensing
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:19.120]  out for a while and they've been working you know for a year and they really don't have the story
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.400]  yet because they can't get anybody to talk even off the record yeah um but the one thing i heard
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:29.760]  from somebody who would be in a position to know is that at one point last year no third parties
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.480]  were getting any lightning connectors from apple that it's been like that for years like they've
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:40.480]  been short on those connectors for years not even talking leave not new connectors not new
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.880]  nbits that support higher speed charging just any lightning connector because apple had needed the
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:52.080]  entire world supply of lightning connectors for the three lightning connectors that were going
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:56.560]  into every iphone box and i and i was told this i was like wait why would you put three lightning
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:00.880]  connectors and it was yeah because at that time they were they're still giving you a charging
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:07.520]  cable of course uh the new headphones they have a lightning connector and they were giving everybody
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:15.200]  the headphone jack to lightning ding dongle yeah um and so they you know the first quarter of the
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:21.680]  millions of life right like 70 million in a quarter so that's 200 210 million lightning
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:26.800]  connectors in a quarter that have to you know and they can't the ipad production cannot be held up
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:34.320]  because of a lack of lightning dongles yeah you know and it's kind of wacky to think that uh
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.680]  that the apple wasn't able to make lightning connectors fast enough but it may well be true
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.880]  no it's absolutely true it's happened for several years hmm that's crazy when you think about because
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:50.240]  there's iphone supply this ipad supply there's apple's own accessories which aren't much but
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:56.400]  they all do add on top of it and i you know they like having that control uh and you know they
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:02.000]  know they've been able to wield that control that lightning gives them to do you know prevent things
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  like having battery cases that have a headphone jack which i can't prove is because apple
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.120]  doesn't allow it i don't i don't know anybody apple who's told me off the record no no we won't
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.840]  yeah we don't allow that we don't want that i don't know anybody nobody's told me that it's a
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.360]  sort of educated guess but the fact that nobody makes a case that has a headphone jack sort of
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:31.200]  would suggest that that is true and i've you know like you said apple likes having control
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:36.160]  so one of my everybody seems not everybody but a lot of people seem to think that because the ipad
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.400]  has gone to usb-c the the iphone's going to go to usb-c and we're going to live in this
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.680]  utopia where everything charges with the same connectors i don't think that's going to happen
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:52.880]  because i don't a i just don't think apple wants to give up the control and b i think it's another
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:56.480]  one of those cases where you need to listen to what apple says when apple says here's why we
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:01.760]  change the ipad pro yeah to usb-c and they give all these reasons they don't really apply to the
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:07.200]  phone they and they don't say well we just want the whole world to be on the same the same
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:14.480]  connector they don't say that it's and it's funny because they will typically work so they know when
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:18.720]  there's problems like for example when they took took away the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack they
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:22.320]  knew that there were people with accessibility needs who have to actually listen to headphones
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.000]  and charge at the same time so they worked it's typically like belkin or a company like that
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.640]  they'll work with those companies to make charging pads like they did with the capacity with the
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.120]  inductive iphones or to make splitters like they did when the iphone 7 came out so you would be
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:39.360]  able to buy those day and date and the fact that they didn't work with anybody to make all this
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:45.280]  stuff for the the new ipad pro i think is telling when it comes to the supply of of those components
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:51.280]  yep i agree too i just don't think it's going to happen but i the thing about me that i want is i
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:57.840]  want is i want third-party cables i'd like one of the small things hey the price is better uh
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:04.800]  you know 19 is the cheapest usb-c lightning cable you can get but the price doesn't even so much
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:09.680]  bother me so much as the fact that i don't one meter is too long for some of my needs you know
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:14.880]  i don't want i like to have a cup i like like little six inch lightning cables for like um
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:20.000]  totally you know and you know one of the ways i minimize the number of chargers i have to take on
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.800]  a trip is taking advantage of the fact that i can use a mac as a usb hub and plug my mac into power
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:32.400]  and then plug other things into the usb ports on my macbook i don't need a one meter cable for
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:38.000]  that i like a six inch cable is perfect because it's the phone's just right there next to the
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:45.200]  computer um and you know having all of your cables be at least a meter long when you need
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.600]  you know three four five maybe more cables uh it you know they get tangled it's a mess
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.280]  so it's very some people just don't like the material apple makes and they want one of the
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:58.560]  corded ones or they want one of the alternate materials that another vendor makes or one that
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:07.360]  doesn't fray yeah totally uh yeah you totally you know there's it so it it seems very curious that
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:11.680]  there aren't any and i think there was a lot of there was some speculation from some of the people
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:17.200]  when i started asking that maybe apple just doesn't want to allow third-party usb-c to lightning
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.840]  cables i don't think it's that they don't want it i just think that it is taking a very long time to
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.040]  ramp up their production of those connectors that allow it and in the meantime apple apple is the
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.840]  only one who has them and if you remember like when the when the apple tv 4k came out suddenly
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:36.320]  the apple community had to realize what a mess hdmi was because the length did matter and the
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:42.160]  shielding did matter and if you wanted 444 hdr you couldn't just use any cable and now usb-c
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.400]  even though it's been on the mac for three years people really didn't understand the complete mess
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.160]  that usb-c was that other people have been dealing with for years to the extent that a google
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:55.280]  engineer had to go through and individually review every cable on amazon so that you wouldn't burn
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.640]  down your devices by plugging them in because it is a horrible horrible mess yeah and i think yeah
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:04.160]  i don't think apple wanted to avoid that because the cut the cable that comes with the ipad
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:09.280]  doesn't do everything that you want a usb-c cable to no no that's correct that's the crazy thing
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.200]  like i don't know how many people i knew that this was true but i didn't know that as many
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:19.440]  of the details as i found out in this deep dive this week it's it is insane how different one
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:25.360]  usb-c cable can be from another and you can see it physically and and it you know and guess what
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:30.640]  apple doesn't label them there is no there is no secret small print you know that you can
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.880]  triple click your iphone to get the magnifying glass and read oh this is charging only not data
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:40.320]  nope their cables don't even have apple logos on them they're they are hyped you know they're from
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:46.480]  johnny white's white universe of objective purity you know there's and some people think like what
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:50.320]  is this a thunderbolt 3k oh thunderbolt 3 isn't a real thing it's just something that can be carried
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:55.200]  over usb-c but this one doesn't carry it and this one does right so you can tell the difference
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:59.600]  because the the one that the one that apple concludes with the ipad pro is thinner it is a
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:04.800]  very thinner suppler cable and the one that is capable of doing data too is a much thicker
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.640]  it's just a thicker cable but i didn't even realize that like i've been using these cables
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.560]  again for three years and i just assumed that apple would include the usual cable and i plugged
[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:19.120]  into a display and it didn't work yeah so i thought i was doing something stupid right and
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:25.520]  it's so a yeah renee richie the guy who's the editor at i'mor shouldn't be confused by this
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:31.440]  i mean frankly because if you are normal people are going to be baffled but i can see this being
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:37.200]  a disaster in the real world where if you're you know in a in a rush you've got a deadline
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:43.520]  you know you need a you you've got to get this uh you've got your ipad you're going to project it
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:49.280]  onto a screen for an important meeting or a demon you know whatever you you need you know to connect
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:53.520]  and here i've grabbed a usb-c cable let me double check the connectors yes definitely usb-c
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:21:01.040]  good to go plug it in nothing yeah right and oh it's thinner i didn't realize what normal person
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.920]  is going to think it's the wrong type of usb-c cable there's just well there shouldn't be a
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:13.360]  wrong type of usb-c if it looks like usb-c it should be usb-c yes and i will say to apple's
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:21.280]  credit on this delay getting a third-party usb-c to lightning cables out is that once it happens
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:28.320]  you won't have to worry about it that all of the licensed ones will be will support faster charging
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:36.240]  speeds and there won't be any that don't um which brings me to the ones you can buy because please
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  please please i hope i didn't wait too long to bring this up on the show i hope my email box
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:45.760]  isn't already filled up with more of the i don't know what the hell you're talking about john i
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:51.360]  bought a bunch of these usb-c lightning cables on amazon for six dollars each i know that you
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:57.440]  can buy them i know that that there's a i forget i didn't want to mention the brand some a bunch
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.560]  of no-name brands i think they're all just white labeled you can go to amazon and buy cables that
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:09.760]  are usb-c on one end and lightning on the other but a they are not mfi certified and so they're
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:16.080]  not using apple's lightning things and i would not use a cable like that plugged into my 1200
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:21.120]  iphone yeah power is not something you ever want to screw around with i would not plug the other
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:31.200]  end of it the 30 the usb-c and i would not plug that into a 30 watt charger i just i and i i think
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:38.400]  that the risk of like fires or sparks or something like that is probably pretty low but these cables
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:42.960]  even if they work perfectly are never going to deliver more than 12 watts of power yeah
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:49.680]  because they're not using you know that they're not pd certified so it will work and i know that
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:53.520]  there are people i got a ton of you know people are saying like i bought these they work they
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:58.160]  charge just fine i think they're fast charging well they're not fast charging although 12 watt
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:03.280]  is faster than five watt i mean it's they're fast charging the way the old ipad adapter yes
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:07.440]  like the old usb-a and ipad adapter used to fast charge not the way a usb-c adapter would
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:12.480]  right and you if you actually sit here and stopwatch like a new ipad pro charging on a
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:20.880]  30 watt charger it is significantly it is very fast uh so you're they're not good cables uh
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:27.200]  but b if you actually open up the reviews scroll down and amazon and look at the reviews and sort
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:32.720]  by most recent don't because if you i forget what they sort by by default but it's like the
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:37.600]  companies have enough shills yeah yeah most helpful isn't good because they're all they
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:41.680]  make it sound like these cables are good just put up their own cables yeah yeah go to most recent
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:47.360]  where you just see just in order the most recent reviews and they're just chock full of people who
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:52.640]  say that they break after a week week or two weeks i mean however fragile apples connectors
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:59.040]  are they don't break after a week so you're getting what you pay for so anyway that's my
[02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:05.680]  rant on on cables it's public service john and the mess that usb-c is yeah i don't think that
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:11.920]  do you think that the apple's going to make the iphone usb-c no i mean i uh i mean never say never
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.960]  uh but i think the advantage is i mean the reason we have lightning is because usb-c didn't get
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:20.480]  certified fast enough i'm sure if usb-c was available three years earlier it would have
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.120]  been an easy choice but it was very similar teams that worked on i still don't know about that
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:29.200]  no maybe fair enough but apple was not apple wanted to make the iphone 5 they were not going
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:34.640]  to wait for usb-c to do it and lightning let is a smaller connector and also one because apple
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:38.800]  has complete control they can change anything about it at any time without waiting for anybody
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.880]  any standards commission right to rule on those changes deal like didn't they do that with the
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:47.760]  headphones like they'd you know like lightning as it came out in the first generation i don't
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.320]  think could have done headphones and i think that they you know but they they had it in mind as a
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:56.560]  future use and then they you know changed the protocol so i think it was intelligently switching
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:00.240]  like the old dock connector that you had to rewire over and over again and they would change what the
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.880]  what the ports what these what the keys did and the pins did in the old dock connector because
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:10.320]  technology changed and i think they made lightning to be way more adaptable for them than it was but
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:13.440]  like there were rumors that google was already working on a phone that has no ports and no
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.760]  buttons and they just couldn't get remote restore working fast enough and you look at the apple tv
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:21.840]  4k and they got rid of the port and they've got remote restore working on it yeah and i think
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.000]  there's much more likely that we'll go to no cables then we'll go to usbc yeah that's what
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.200]  that's my guess my and i don't know how many years that is but my guess is that we'll go to an iphone
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:37.600]  that's more like the watch with no ports uh before we'll see usbc and the watch still needs remote
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:43.840]  restore badly yeah definitely restoring a watch is the worst i don't want to and i'm pretty sure now
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:47.920]  that as soon as we get usbc sorted the standard will announce usbc micro anyway and we'll just
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.160]  lose our minds all over again god because remember there was usba and then usba mini
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:57.200]  and then usba micro and it just got worse and worse yeah well the mini was terrible
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.080]  and it was double wide if you had a hard drive yeah double wide connector and we're still stuck
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.400]  we're still stuck with all these micro products and i guess i think i can't help but think that
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.440]  part of the reason that more more like things like battery packs and that that keyboard i was
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:20.320]  talking about earlier that logitech uh sponge keyboard uh it charges by micro usb i hate micro
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:26.480]  usb i hate it i just hate it with it's just so freaking ugly to look at and you know now that
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:33.520]  usbc is out and can be plugged in upside down yeah but i feel like it's the complexity of usbc
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.520]  that keeps more of these devices from switching right like you know maybe i don't know maybe
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.640]  maybe i'm wrong i'm not an electrical engineer but i can't help but think you know like with
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:47.200]  micro usb no matter what you plug in it's not going to be high wattage there is no such thing
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:52.400]  as high wattage usbc but whereas you might plug this keyboard into a 85 watt macbook
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:57.840]  pro power charger and it you know needs to do something intelligent to say i don't need that
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:03.600]  i just you know here give me the low you know give me the low watt thing whereas micro usb it's it
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:07.440]  just works well i think that google guy a lot of his early reviews was like these things are not
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.520]  power managing and you can easily over overcharge them and then i think the nintendo switch came out
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.880]  and it wouldn't work with standard usbc because it was doing something weird with you and it's
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.200]  just again no no humans have to worry about these things no and that is sort of the advantage of
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.320]  lightning as it stands is that if you see lightning and it's from a name brand company you can you it
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:27.760]  should just work and should do everything you expect lightning to do it will charge it will
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:32.960]  carry data there is no different kind of lightning no so yeah but it's going to be a while till we
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:40.560]  get i get my beloved uh three-way cables back yeah i'm sorry john uh that's it for me that's
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:44.800]  all everything on my list for the show anything else renee that you wanted to talk about no i was
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.880]  going to bend some ipads but i'll do that later yeah what i didn't watch this before the show so
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:56.880]  explain this video to me so there's this video of zach who does the channel jerry rig everything
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:03.200]  he somehow beat unbox therapy to bending ipads this year um and he just took an ipad he does
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.800]  this really weird thing and i think it's farcical i think it's meant to satire because there's no
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:12.080]  way you can take it seriously or he does these unboxings and he's kind of comedic about it and he
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.160]  he says like look it's aluminum and he scrapes an exacto blade along it and he cuts out all the parts
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.800]  and peels the pencil back and then he just took the ipad and he bent it in half and immediately
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:25.040]  twitter flooded with all these people going oh my god you can bend the ipad in half but you can
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:31.120]  always bend the ipad enough it's like metal bends plastic cracks glass breaks and ceramics shatter
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:36.080]  every material has you know every material science has these issues and you have to mitigate them so
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:42.240]  then another youtuber quinn from snazzy labs did the exact same video even more parodied where he
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:48.080]  did the same thing to a huawei tablet and it was just it was one of the funniest send ups i'd ever
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.680]  seen where he's just like oh bend it in half cut it open with an exacto knife but i think the
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.680]  reaction by the internet is more telling because immediately i was flooded with you know apple's
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:03.360]  got another bend gate my ipad can bend oh my god and there was no sort of context or clarity
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:09.040]  or thought put into the reaction it was just don't put it in your back jeans pocket i know
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.640]  dalrymple used to put the meaning in his back jean pocket and it scared the crap out of me every time
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:16.960]  but it's a tablet it's a valuable piece of very thin glass and aluminum take care of it right
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:20.800]  they'd have to start making like new jeans instead of having like two jean pockets you'd just have
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.960]  one one big pouch that goes across your entire ass and then you can you could slot an ipad in there
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:31.040]  and bend it when you sit down i mean some people have bent them it's been previous generations of
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:34.560]  ipads i think tim steven said he did in in a backpack but you know you're putting pressure
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:39.360]  on aluminum and it will bend you got to be real and apple could make them could make them bend
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:43.200]  proof but that would essentially be basically putting an autobox case on it that you could
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:46.720]  never remove yeah so the better solution from apple's point of view is if you need something
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:51.200]  rugged put a rugged case on it but you can take it off when you don't need it if we put it on
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:55.920]  for you you can never take it off and have a light thin ipad yeah the jerry rig everything guy what's
[02:29:55.920 --> 02:30:02.560]  his name zack i don't even know that yeah he there's something i i do get caught i i see why
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:09.440]  he's successful on youtube because i once i start if i can bear to stay with it for a minute then i
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:15.200]  do end up watching like three of his stupid videos it's rage of mouth marketing but there's something
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:21.520]  about that guy that really irritates me but irritates me in a way that is compelling
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:30.960]  you know what i mean yes yeah and it's some of it some of it is just so
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:37.680]  dumb like i don't know i i just i can't stand seeing these devices smashed i mean like the
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:41.600]  drop test thing is a legitimate thing like well let's see what happens when you drop a phone
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:48.400]  because phones really do drop but like scratching them up with like a diamond it's like it's gadget
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:57.040]  snuff right it is it really is but youtube is weird yeah anyway don't worry about i mean just
[02:30:57.040 --> 02:31:00.720]  take good care of your ipad treat it with the value it's an expensive thing treat it with care
[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:09.600]  yeah well i i had never bent an old one so yeah uh everybody can follow you on twitter you're at
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:17.040]  renee richie uh and all of your work or most of your work much of your work is at imore.com all
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:22.880]  of it imore.com vector and you are i don't understand when you sleep because you are
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:29.920]  a video producing machine with vector thank you and i think well no i mean it i i don't know i
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.320]  don't do videos yet i don't know i mean it seems like everybody's doing videos now but i don't
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:40.240]  understand it takes me so long to review a product in writing yeah and i feel like when i have messed
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:45.280]  around with video it video takes forever it's like yeah i won't lie like if you have a verge
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:48.480]  video team and like neilay says how long it because he has to share the device with the
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:52.240]  verge video team but there's still a verge video team and it takes them up to the last second to
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:57.280]  get it done so i have no idea what i'm doing yeah well the yeah the imore video team is you
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:02.960]  yes or at least you're the vector video team is you yes uh but you're getting you've always been
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:07.360]  good and i enjoy your videos but you're they're getting even better it shows you know the the the
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:14.320]  the you know adage of you you know you get better by just by doing it it definitely shows uh thank
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:18.560]  you very much really and you know sometimes the video is the right way to do it uh you know like
[02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:25.520]  when you're showing illustration it really is a show don't tell type of thing that was a completely
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:29.520]  because finnerty caldwell went to apple and can't make videos anymore and she did those great apple
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:34.240]  pencil reviews i just felt like i had to pick up that tour it is amazing though that you're you
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:40.560]  her colleague at imore are also a fairly talented illustrator uh you know that you lost a spent
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:46.560]  youth john so if you want to work at imore you got to be able to draw effectively the lesson
[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:52.880]  i did see serenity at the event did you saw her i'm sure yeah yeah it was good she was there
[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:57.760]  in her capacity as as an apple person now and then she was very nice enough to say hi and
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:01.280]  she was obviously i knew she was busy because we were outside and it was freezing and she didn't
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:05.760]  even have a coat on and i was like oh she's busy she was moving as fast on feet as she usually does
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:10.480]  on skates yeah definitely she needed skates i think she was going so fast um it was good to see
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:18.080]  her uh i do miss i do i do miss having her pencil reviews but that's the way the world was um all
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:22.800]  right my thanks to you uh anything else you want to plug no that's great thank you so much yeah
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.640]  vector everybody should watch your video definitely watch the one on the pencil it's a great it's a
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:32.720]  great it's a great example of of where vector as a youtube uh channel is oh thank you john
