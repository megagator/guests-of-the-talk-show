[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  Hello, man, you always sound so good. I
[00:03.760 --> 00:08.120]  Got I just I'm doing what what Marco tells me to do. I know I've got it
[00:08.120 --> 00:11.400]  I keep saying I'm gonna do what Marco tells me to do and I haven't done it yet
[00:11.880 --> 00:13.560]  Well, he keeps changing his opinion
[00:13.560 --> 00:16.600]  I like I bought all the stuff that he told me to buy and then like a week later
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.320]  It was like oh, oh, but this microphone's even better and then like two weeks later
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.640]  It was like and then there's this microphone dude. I'm not gonna keep buying microphones
[00:24.640 --> 00:30.360]  The other thing that gets me to is the
[00:31.160 --> 00:36.960]  The now that I have the watch I feel like it's one too many devices to have to silence before a podcast
[00:37.280 --> 00:44.440]  You know, I leave my watch silenced all the time. I do to accept when I don't and I at least have to I feel like I
[00:44.440 --> 00:46.440]  At least have to check it before recording
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.600]  Well, that's true. Yeah, I I leave it. I leave it off the whole time. I I can't remember the last time I turned it on
[00:53.600 --> 00:58.200]  That would kind of I don't know. I might be I might be wishing for too much magic
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.200]  But I kind of wish that there was like a
[01:02.120 --> 01:09.080]  Like a some kind of way to tie into iTunes or iCloud and say silence all my shit. Oh, that's
[01:10.080 --> 01:14.560]  Yeah, I mean the problem with the iPhones right and right just the iPhones have the physical
[01:14.840 --> 01:16.840]  So I won't switch
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.720]  So right you could silence it, but it would still be switched to on I don't know
[01:20.720 --> 01:26.240]  I did I think about that. I wish I had a button to push you know for the valuable podcast and demographic
[01:26.240 --> 01:28.240]  I wish I had a button to push that basically said
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.860]  Okay, stop syncing all your drop boxes and stuff
[01:32.360 --> 01:34.360]  Thank everything is silent
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.640]  It's enough already. I don't know. I I the Apple watch sound
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.880]  That is one of the least compelling things about that that product to me and I just I don't want to have like I
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.040]  Can feel the little taps. I kind of don't need to hear the sound I
[01:51.440 --> 01:55.120]  Kind of agree I forget who I was talking to I don't it might have even been on it
[01:55.120 --> 01:58.680]  You know, you never have that re-forget what you said on a podcast and what you said in real life because I
[01:59.080 --> 02:02.080]  Talk about the same stuff in real life that I talk about on shows
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.960]  Yeah, I was on this podcast. No, that was just a conversation I had
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.320]  That the default might be wrong that the default for the Apple watch might be to be silent
[02:10.720 --> 02:11.600]  Huh
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.160]  I can see why it's not because it's that's so
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.760]  Anti-thetical to every other device you own, but I feel like with the watch it
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.000]  It actually makes sense where most people, you know, maybe by the end if you're new to it
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.080]  And you're unfamiliar and you're going through the infamous first week of getting to know Apple watch
[02:30.040 --> 02:35.560]  The faulting to trusting the haptics or taptics whatever you want to call them is I think the way to go
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.400]  Yeah, I don't see I don't see the point
[02:39.400 --> 02:42.680]  I mean I I can see the point in the making noise when it's not on my wrist
[02:42.680 --> 02:48.280]  But when it's on my wrist and I can feel it I kind of feel like that's enough for me and that and the shame of it is
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.480]  if there are you know if there are instances where you should be
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.920]  Alerted audibly because something's going on
[02:57.960 --> 02:59.960]  You know you
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.160]  They're mixed in with the ones where it's pointless and so it's just you know
[03:03.160 --> 03:05.160]  I just turn them off and you know
[03:05.160 --> 03:09.560]  I'd much rather scale them back to have them be only when it's particularly important
[03:09.560 --> 03:15.640]  But you know right now it's like every time anything happens it wants to do a little dang and I don't need a little dang
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.640]  I've got I've totally got the the haptic feel down
[03:19.640 --> 03:21.800]  I know I know that it's tapping me
[03:21.800 --> 03:27.960]  I don't need a noise too and the noise and noise everybody else in the world the beauty of the the the the haptics on the Apple
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.880]  Watch is that nobody hears your your your your vibration like they hear it on the phone. It's just a complete
[03:34.440 --> 03:37.960]  Secret, you know message from from your watch to you
[03:37.960 --> 03:39.960]  So why do I need a dang?
[03:40.280 --> 03:42.280]  Yeah, you're recording right. I am recording
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.280]  We just got right to do it. This is I'm always I'm always recording
[03:47.800 --> 03:49.320]  I'm
[03:49.320 --> 03:56.400]  With Dan more in the other week and and halfway through were like is this a podcast? No, it's not but I was recording it. It could have been
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.720]  It's not okay. Just okay, why not
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.160]  So I've been I've been away. I've been on vacation for a while
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.880]  So I am there has not been a show for a while
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.200]  There's not really been much news that's gone on. It was it seemed like a I picked a very
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.320]  I've been taking this time to go on vacation news wise, but there was a
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.400]  Couple of things that I it was like oh man
[04:17.400 --> 04:19.400]  I wish I was it's had time to write about this because
[04:19.880 --> 04:26.120]  This is like a good like commentary type of punditry type stuff that that burst out in the last two weeks
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.400]  But one of them I guess this is actually predates that this is all the way back to June
[04:31.400 --> 04:34.840]  Which is when the new pebble time started shipping? Did you get one of those?
[04:34.840 --> 04:36.840]  I didn't
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.320]  You were you wore the original pebble for years right for the two years basically
[04:43.320 --> 04:50.120]  I mean until until I got my Apple watch and I was one of the Kickstarter people so I got it in whatever february of
[04:50.840 --> 04:52.840]  Thirteen something like that so two years
[04:53.480 --> 04:57.160]  Yeah, I kick started it the original work for like two days and
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.520]  I bought the new one too because I thought well, I mean I'm rooting for these guys
[05:02.520 --> 05:05.560]  I really do you know hope that that they I pull it out
[05:05.560 --> 05:11.800]  And I think it's I think it's great that they have a different set of priorities not just to Apple but to everybody else in the space
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.960]  But it it really it's especially after having worn Apple watch for a while it
[05:18.520 --> 05:24.680]  It it just it's so far behind in so many ways that it just can't end the thing that made me think about it
[05:24.680 --> 05:28.440]  And just of all the things I want to talk about with you get it out of the way first
[05:28.440 --> 05:33.080]  Is you saying that when the tactics go off? You don't have to worry about people hearing them well when the
[05:33.320 --> 05:34.520]  Pebble time
[05:34.520 --> 05:37.160]  Taptic goes off everybody in the room knows it
[05:38.600 --> 05:39.880]  Yeah, you know for me
[05:39.880 --> 05:42.200]  It's and it's not their fault but as an iOS user
[05:42.760 --> 05:45.560]  I just I can see the writing on the wall before it was like
[05:46.120 --> 05:52.360]  You know Apple had some Bluetooth stuff that would send out notifications and there were other devices that could support it including
[05:52.840 --> 05:54.840]  Pebble and it seemed like
[05:54.840 --> 06:00.200]  You know it was what it was but it was clear then the background Apple was working on a watch and was going to put all the
[06:00.200 --> 06:03.000]  effort into tying iOS with that watch and
[06:03.560 --> 06:05.560]  You know what when I saw Pebble time I thought
[06:06.280 --> 06:07.480]  You know
[06:07.480 --> 06:12.040]  It they keep adding features for Android because they can tie into all of the Android Wear
[06:12.120 --> 06:16.120]  APIs and it just seemed clear to me that that Pebble was going to be
[06:16.680 --> 06:21.880]  A much better watch on Android than it was ever going to be on iOS because it was never going to be a priority for Apple
[06:21.880 --> 06:25.960]  to support Pebble because why would they they've got their own watch
[06:26.760 --> 06:29.480]  Yeah, and even if you want to take a less cynical
[06:30.040 --> 06:33.080]  Competitive or if you want to say anti competitive view
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.560]  It's just never going to be a priority for them to spend the time to make those APIs
[06:38.040 --> 06:43.320]  Public instead of private even if they kind of in their heart of hearts if Apple wanted to
[06:44.120 --> 06:48.120]  Support third-party watches like Pebble as best they could on iOS
[06:48.120 --> 06:54.760]  They're never going to have the APIs cut up to where the private APIs for Apple watch are just not
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.840]  Nor are they going to be as rich as what is in the the Android Wear stuff on Android?
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.840]  So if you're Pebble you're like, you know
[07:02.840 --> 07:05.240]  iOS is a nice market and you'd like to be there
[07:05.720 --> 07:10.600]  But your product is worse on it than it is on on Android. So I think
[07:12.040 --> 07:15.640]  I understand why they're prioritizing things that way and I would make the same decision
[07:15.640 --> 07:22.760]  And I don't blame Apple because you know, what does Apple want to focus on Apple watch or kind of vague third-party support
[07:22.760 --> 07:27.720]  That really would only be I mean Google's talked about doing you know Android Wear support on iOS
[07:27.720 --> 07:28.600]  But it'll be the same thing
[07:28.600 --> 07:33.880]  They'll be an app that ties into some basic Bluetooth stuff and maybe some Google services they'll be able to do
[07:34.440 --> 07:40.840]  But you know, I get the impression that Apple can do some very clever things in the background in terms of launching
[07:41.320 --> 07:44.920]  You know like launching apps grabbing the data sending it to the watch
[07:44.920 --> 07:46.920]  That is not something that is
[07:47.400 --> 07:51.480]  allowed by third-party apps and so they're always going to be ahead of things yeah
[07:51.720 --> 07:57.320]  Yeah, and if that's already a problem on Apple watch and it is you know in terms of sometimes the latency between
[07:58.200 --> 08:04.680]  Tapping the weather complication on your face and actually getting the weather to update with Apple having the inside
[08:04.920 --> 08:10.280]  Access to it. Imagine how much worse it would be for someone relying on third-party. I can't help but think that that's why Google
[08:10.280 --> 08:15.280]  that was like a rumor leading up to was months ago actually, but a
[08:15.320 --> 08:21.560]  Rumor leading up to IO that that was something that they might announce at IO in early June or late June or May whatever the hell
[08:21.560 --> 08:23.560]  IO was
[08:23.560 --> 08:28.840]  And didn't happen and I can't help but think that one of the reason, you know, maybe the main reason why not that they haven't been working on it
[08:28.840 --> 08:32.760]  But that it is so it pales in comparison both to
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.680]  Apple watch for iOS and Android Wear for Android and so therefore why you know
[08:38.680 --> 08:44.360]  It's second rate either way no matter just my experience with the pebble thing is like pebble would update its apps in the background
[08:44.360 --> 08:47.640]  As long as the pebble app was running and it would run for a while and at some point
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.240]  iOS would just kill it because it hadn't been running for a while and it needed the memory and at that point that was it
[08:53.320 --> 09:00.120]  Like pebble won't talk to the watch or I mean won't talk to the phone after that because you know, it's just an app and
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.760]  It doesn't have any special
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.160]  Powers there and you know, that's just that's just how it is. It's a it's a tough situation
[09:08.160 --> 09:12.880]  But I like them too. I like the idea that this is a lower a lower cost
[09:13.200 --> 09:15.360]  You know simpler the long life
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.360]  I like the fact that it's got the long battery life. There are lots of things to like about it
[09:19.360 --> 09:24.000]  But you know the fact is platform vendors have so much power over
[09:24.880 --> 09:32.720]  Over what these other products can do and at least with Google they can tie into the stuff that Google built for Android Wear and good for them
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.440]  That that makes that a more compelling product on Android, but on iOS. It's just never I mean
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.400]  I kept having this hope for the first two years like
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.560]  That they would get better and it did get better for a while and then it feels like to me
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.680]  They hit a wall where it's like this is all Apple is ever gonna let Bluetooth generic Bluetooth devices do
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.480]  Yeah, I you know app is a sort of nebulous word and as time goes on
[09:54.480 --> 10:02.480]  It's ever more nebulous, but the basic idea because it doesn't really relate to anything like at a low-level computer science
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.160]  term it's a bundle, you know that that
[10:06.880 --> 10:14.240]  Basically means it's a process running on your computer that displays a user interface to the user and
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.320]  It to me. I mean this is my interpretation of the word. It's it's a word
[10:19.360 --> 10:27.280]  inherently of the GUI era of computing. It's a thing that no matter which computer you're on that the user looks at and interacts with
[10:27.280 --> 10:35.280]  And I you know even on iOS and and maybe in the early days like 2008 when the app store first debuted
[10:35.280 --> 10:40.800]  That's really what apps were they were processes that show to user interface and it had an icon and
[10:41.280 --> 10:43.520]  It if you were looking at it and it you know
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.640]  It was running and if you weren't looking at it. It wasn't running and it was really pretty simple
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.080]  And now there's you know as as iOS has evolved
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.720]  There's a lot more that can happen in the background and you know apps can stay in memory
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.720]  As long as there's enough memory to keep
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.520]  You know the most re you know three four five most recently used apps
[11:03.840 --> 11:09.120]  You know you can request for background downloads even when you're not running etc etc
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.480]  But basically to interact with another piece of hardware to have a phone
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.560]  Interacting within controlling with a watch you don't really want an app for that
[11:18.560 --> 11:21.360]  It has to be part of the operating system and there's an you know
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.040]  There's there's no way that third parties get to write parts of the operating system on iOS
[11:25.040 --> 11:32.080]  Yeah, you need some sort of feature and it's not like it really aren't steps toward this and some of the iOS updates that
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.440]  Have come out over the last few years, but you know for something like pebble
[11:35.440 --> 11:38.640]  You really need like a demon to use Unix terminology
[11:38.640 --> 11:41.680]  Yeah, something that is a process that runs in the background all the time
[11:42.160 --> 11:44.880]  And app is not going to let Apple always has the
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.120]  Ability to even even when there is a process running in the background because I always backgrounding
[11:49.280 --> 11:49.840]  You know
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.960]  S apps can run in the background facelessly to do some updates and things that Apple is never going to
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.920]  Give up the option to kill something if it wants to improve the user experience by freeing up memory
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.960]  So that this other app can run and so you know somebody like pebble
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.360]  They just can't they can't install something that's running all the time and they can't count on that being there
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.240]  And that you know it limits what they can do whereas apple can
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.080]  Can can try to do that we should say because I mean you mentioned it
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.280]  I sometimes will put on like a weather complication or or something like that
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.280]  And it just or the sunset
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.000]  On that what is it the solar face where it calculates out like the sunrise sunset data
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.480]  I've had that just it gives up and it shows it like it's the equinox because
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.880]  Even though it's talking to the phone whatever process updates that data has just died or stalled
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.480]  And so even Apple is struggling with it and they control the operating system
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.240]  And that's you know if if it could if it made any sense
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.960]  And it doesn't for pebble to be connected to your Mac instead of to your phone
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.160]  It doesn't because you're gonna wander away from your Mac with your watch on and want to have a connection
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.800]  And that's why it wants to connect to a phone and not to a computer
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.320]  But if it if it made any sense
[13:00.400 --> 13:03.680]  They could write max off where that did everything they wanted to do
[13:03.840 --> 13:05.840]  But it wouldn't go through the Mac app store
[13:05.840 --> 13:11.760]  It would be the sort of thing you download from get pebble.com and install on your Mac the old fashioned way
[13:11.760 --> 13:16.080]  Because it would have to do things that even in the even on the Mac through the app store
[13:16.080 --> 13:18.000]  You're not allowed to do well at that point
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.680]  You should just have Wi-Fi in the thing and have it just talk to a web service
[13:21.840 --> 13:26.560]  Right and then only use the phone when it absolutely has to but then it's not really a phone
[13:27.040 --> 13:32.800]  Accessory anymore, right? It's just a yeah, or there's a web service that the phone is talking to and that
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.280]  The watch is talking. I mean, it's just a mess. It's not it's not the same product at that point
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.480]  All right, so my review of the pebble, which I haven't written and I don't know if I'm gonna write
[13:42.480 --> 13:45.840]  I didn't write a review of the first pebble because it was it and
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.240]  Sort of out of good sportsmanship
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.520]  For lack of a better term that it would have been very negative and I didn't feel like that was
[13:55.040 --> 13:57.520]  I just didn't want to do that, you know, I
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.120]  I've plenty of other people wrote about it. It just felt like it was it beat like jumping on the pile
[14:03.120 --> 14:08.240]  Right with this one. I feel like hey, they've been around long enough and now you know
[14:08.240 --> 14:14.240]  The market is this it would be fair to write a negative review. So maybe I will maybe I won't but it's short and it's basically
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.720]  A the hardware really does not compare in any
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.800]  Meaningful way to to what you can get with an Apple watch sport
[14:23.120 --> 14:31.520]  So let's just compare to Apple watch sport for 350 and 399. Yes, that's more expensive than the pebble time which starts at 199
[14:31.520 --> 14:38.800]  But it's in the same ballpark, you know to me 199 and 349. It's yet, you know close to half
[14:38.800 --> 14:41.600]  I guess it's half if you compare it to the 42 millimeter version
[14:43.280 --> 14:45.280]  But it feels like way more than
[14:45.920 --> 14:48.640]  The Apple watch feels way more than twice as well made
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.520]  It's and to me aesthetically you can tell just by looking at a picture of the pebble time
[14:53.920 --> 14:57.360]  There's this double bezel effect around the display
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.160]  So the display is what actually lights up and is in color, but then around that there's a black
[15:02.720 --> 15:04.560]  Thing that goes around the display
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.240]  And then around that is a piece of plastic that covers the crystal
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.200]  So there's like two bezels around the actual watch face and to me in photographs
[15:13.280 --> 15:15.280]  It it looks like it is what it is
[15:15.280 --> 15:18.000]  But while I was wearing it it every time I glanced at my wrist
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  It just stuck out and I realized it
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.360]  In I've never seen a watch that has anything like that before digital analog or otherwise
[15:25.360 --> 15:29.040]  And it really feels like a compromise in terms of engineering
[15:29.680 --> 15:32.880]  So aesthetically and build wise. It's real. I thought it was really poor
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.040]  I
[15:35.040 --> 15:39.200]  Know that it sounds like a petty thing, but to me the the
[15:39.840 --> 15:42.080]  Taptic engine or whatever you want to call it in the pebble time
[15:42.560 --> 15:45.920]  It the fact that it's like a vibrator from your phone and it's very loud
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.240]  I mean like surprisingly loud is just a deal breaker
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.080]  And part of that is just my experience with Apple watch with the tactics being
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.320]  Surprisingly central to the experience of using Apple watch
[15:58.880 --> 16:01.920]  With the pebble time it's it to me is horrendous
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.200]  I don't even know it may not even be any different than the one from the original
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.120]  Pebble, but once you got used to Apple watch or I did at least
[16:09.840 --> 16:12.800]  And it's sort of this subtle tapping that is completely silent
[16:13.840 --> 16:20.160]  The loud jarring like it just feels like the equivalent of holy shit something terrible is happening
[16:20.160 --> 16:26.560]  That you need to be alerted to right away. Even if it's like a text message from somebody you're working with who says yes
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.280]  You get like a jolt to your wrist. It almost feels like an electric shock
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.520]  And that to me and I'm not judging that in terms of iOS or Android
[16:35.520 --> 16:38.400]  That would be the same no matter what you're using it with and
[16:39.520 --> 16:43.680]  Lastly the my other big complaint about it is that this color screen that they're using
[16:43.680 --> 16:46.000]  I understand that it gives tremendous battery life
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.080]  And the battery life on Pebble is clearly the single best thing about it compared to Apple watch
[16:51.040 --> 16:54.320]  But I can't read the screen in any light or I without
[16:54.880 --> 16:59.200]  Like getting it real close to my eyes and holding it at a perfect angle whether it's broad daylight
[17:00.240 --> 17:02.240]  Well-lit room indoors or
[17:02.640 --> 17:09.360]  Especially in dim lighting and dim lighting. I can't see it even when it lights up. It's it's a really really low contrast screen
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.560]  And maybe it may be I'm in a bad place on that because of the you know the stuff
[17:14.560 --> 17:16.560]  I've had with the retina and stuff like that
[17:16.560 --> 17:21.120]  But even when I closed my bad eye and just look at it with with my perfectly good right eye
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.080]  I really have a hard time reading that screen worse and to me the contrast is the big thing
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.840]  It the contrast is worse than with the original Pebble because I even went back and powered up my original Pebble to compare
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.680]  And just for readability to me it was it's worse. It's really really low contrast
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.760]  Yeah, I wasn't convinced that given the resolution of it
[17:41.760 --> 17:44.720]  I wasn't really convinced that the color was even necessary
[17:44.720 --> 17:50.240]  I mean, it's nice to have because they're gonna get mocked if they don't have color, but it's it's not like there are
[17:50.480 --> 17:54.000]  You know beautiful works of art on that display because it's not a very high-risk display
[17:54.480 --> 18:02.000]  It really is about getting imparting this information to you and anything you do to junk that up and and it just makes it harder to read
[18:02.960 --> 18:05.440]  I don't know it's I I'm with you. I feel like uh
[18:06.160 --> 18:10.320]  I want to root for those guys, but you know even at the time even when I
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.720]  Back that kickstarter. I felt like
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.880]  These guys had a very short window where they could come out and I like that they're trying to be something different and
[18:19.280 --> 18:23.760]  Cheaper and you know, maybe they could compete with the fit bits of the world, but instead, you know
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.240]  I don't know I got the warning sign I got was when they came out with the Pebble Steel
[18:29.040 --> 18:32.640]  Because I didn't mind the design of the original Pebble. I mean, yeah
[18:32.640 --> 18:34.640]  It was a big black watch, but it was this you know
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.720]  It was what it was it was a curved plastic big chunk and it told the time and that was fine
[18:40.720 --> 18:45.400]  I mean ultimately it always told the time and it lasted a week and it did a couple of other neat things
[18:45.400 --> 18:49.360]  So I was fine wearing it as just a watch, but the Pebble time when it came out
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.720]  It's like more expensive and it was supposed to be fancy. No, you missed the steel. I mean start pepl steel
[18:53.720 --> 18:56.360]  Yeah, and it was not it was not
[18:56.360 --> 18:58.240]  I didn't like the design of it
[18:58.240 --> 19:03.240]  I really wondered what they were doing at that point that like it was it was this nice material
[19:03.240 --> 19:08.800]  But like if you rain your finger over the front of it like there were sharp edges at the bezel because of the way
[19:08.800 --> 19:16.680]  They built the steel bezel on top of the screen and so it was kind of like uncomfortable to touch and yeah at that point
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.720]  I was I was starting to wonder what are what are their priorities here and you know
[19:20.720 --> 19:23.600]  Do they know that this this freight train is running at them and
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.160]  Pebble time, you know, I think their timing was great for their kickstarter because it was before
[19:28.160 --> 19:35.120]  You know before Apple watch stuff started to really happen and they try to get in just before then but I don't know
[19:35.120 --> 19:37.120]  It's just yeah, I feel bad for him
[19:37.320 --> 19:42.280]  But there was no way that I was gonna buy one. Yes, that aesthetically
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.960]  I actually think the original Pebble is better than either of the subsequent ones. Yeah, I agree
[19:46.960 --> 19:50.320]  It doesn't have that double bezel effect. It is a weird look and watch
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.240]  It's clearly some kind of smart watch type thing, but it's not too big and
[19:54.240 --> 20:02.080]  It's to me. It's very honest to itself. It looks like a hundred to her hundred and fifty dollar digital watch and it has a
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.880]  You know, you know, band that it stripped with was a it wasn't great, but it was fine. It was a fine
[20:06.880 --> 20:13.600]  You know, what would you ever call you know rubber? It was a rubber. Yeah, I I I took that off so fast
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.640]  I just I made my
[20:17.080 --> 20:19.560]  Risk sweaty and I got a leather band for it
[20:19.560 --> 20:24.920]  But there's lots of people who there's lots of other digital watches though that have a band that's very much like that
[20:24.920 --> 20:29.880]  It's fine and but the fact that they picked a standard watch connector so that it was easy for somebody
[20:29.880 --> 20:33.000]  Just as easy to put a new band on it as it is any other standard watch
[20:33.920 --> 20:39.680]  So I've seen yeah, actually a lot of the people who I know who who have a original Pebble use, you know
[20:39.680 --> 20:41.680]  some kind of other third-party band
[20:41.680 --> 20:45.360]  You know, I've seen you with yours many times used to at least
[20:45.360 --> 20:51.880]  Yeah, black leather black leather band from the shopping mall down the street and you know, it was easy to put it on
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.760]  And I you know, I like I like that. It was fine. It did it served its purpose
[20:55.760 --> 21:01.280]  But you know the Apple watch was always hanging over that product and and we're honestly in Google
[21:02.320 --> 21:03.520]  Google's
[21:03.520 --> 21:10.120]  Android wear stuff too because the platform vendors were clearly gonna come in and these these poor little guys
[21:10.200 --> 21:12.200]  We're gonna be kind of
[21:12.200 --> 21:18.160]  Squeezed looking at it too. I'm looking at the just the get Pebble home page where they show all three of their watches
[21:18.160 --> 21:20.640]  And they still sell all three the other thing that really gets me
[21:20.640 --> 21:25.920]  I think that the steel is truly an ugly watch and I've seen a few people wearing them like not people
[21:25.920 --> 21:28.000]  I know that I've seen people on airplanes
[21:29.040 --> 21:36.920]  Wearing them and they they're very very telltale to me like there's certain a certain thing about the the three
[21:36.920 --> 21:43.600]  Lugs that stick out of the top and bottom to connect the the wristband to and the way that the
[21:44.480 --> 21:52.080]  display is almost or not the display but the face is almost a rectangle, but not quite it's like a like a looks like a box that you've
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.080]  Stuffed too much stuff into when you're moving
[21:54.840 --> 21:59.520]  Like it doesn't look like it's it doesn't look like it's supposed to be a rounded shape
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.520]  It just looks like you know, they
[22:01.520 --> 22:08.320]  Fattened it up on the sides a little bit, but the other thing that really gets me that looking into picture is that they decided to print the word Pebble
[22:08.320 --> 22:11.960]  It's so bad black bezel underneath which is I
[22:13.280 --> 22:17.760]  Think a horrendous design mistake and they're almost like hubris, you know, like
[22:20.480 --> 22:22.000]  You can get into it with phones
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.200]  But to me it's a lot like the way that you know a lot of that you know almost all the Android phones
[22:26.200 --> 22:28.720]  I've ever seen always have like Samsung written at the top
[22:28.720 --> 22:32.320]  Probably with a Verizon or an AT&T stamped on the glass too
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.640]  And it's just like a low rent move and it just however well it flies in the phone world
[22:38.640 --> 22:44.280]  It flies worse in the watch world. Well, you know, it's not like a Rolex doesn't have a logo on it
[22:44.280 --> 22:48.280]  And but it doesn't feel like that to me. It feel it felt like yeah
[22:48.280 --> 22:52.280]  It felt cheap to me on the Pebble that you know, oh, we know what we're gonna do
[22:52.280 --> 22:54.920]  We're gonna stick our name on there and you're never gonna be able to
[22:54.920 --> 22:59.160]  To get it off. Yeah, I don't know why they did it. It may just have been that
[22:59.480 --> 23:05.000]  To get the right size bezel and the size of their screen. Yeah, they we got extra space. What do we do?
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.760]  Put our name there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know bothers me. Yeah, so I my
[23:11.720 --> 23:14.920]  Vice would be I don't think there. I know they're not a publicly-out company
[23:14.920 --> 23:17.080]  But my advice would be if they were to sell your stock
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.720]  But I am rooting for them
[23:19.720 --> 23:27.240]  So I feel I don't take any pleasure in that really, but I feel like they are this is the problem of had it going head-to-head with
[23:28.440 --> 23:35.360]  Your two hundred billion dollar company or yeah, I guess Apple's more like an eight hundred billion dollar whatever a company with with Apple's resources
[23:35.680 --> 23:37.680]  Yep
[23:37.680 --> 23:41.320]  Let me take a break and I will thank our first sponsor. We have
[23:41.320 --> 23:50.920]  We have our good friends at Harry's you guys know Harry's they sell high-quality razors and blades for a fraction of the price of
[23:51.600 --> 23:53.600]  The big razor brands
[23:53.600 --> 23:57.600]  It was started by two guys who wanted a better product without paying an arm in the leg
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.280]  But they got really really serious about this. This is the thing
[24:01.280 --> 24:03.920]  I'd always impresses me about Harry's is you hear well
[24:03.920 --> 24:10.240]  It's some startup that's selling razors and stuff and you think that they buy this stuff white label and just buy razor blades
[24:10.240 --> 24:14.040]  Third-party and relabel them and package them in their own stuff
[24:14.760 --> 24:22.280]  No, what they did is they found an old razor blade factory in Germany that they liked so much they bought the factory and
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.960]  They make their own blades. They're all high-performing German blades crafted right to their own
[24:29.360 --> 24:31.360]  specs and
[24:31.360 --> 24:37.440]  That's the thing that the whole shaving experience starts with obviously before you get to any kind of products before you get to the handles
[24:37.440 --> 24:40.440]  It's the blade that you're rubbing against your skin and
[24:41.280 --> 24:48.640]  Harry's is so focused on that that they bought their own factory truly truly impressive and in my experience it really shows in the product that they sell to you
[24:50.240 --> 24:53.720]  What they do is they offered this high-quality stuff at
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.200]  Factory direct pricing because they don't have a middleman when you buy stuff from Harry's calm
[24:59.200 --> 25:01.840]  It's Harry's who fulfills it and ships it right to you
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.360]  So by getting rid of them the middleman layer by getting rid of distributors by getting rid of third-party
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.040]  Stores by getting rid of drug stores
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.800]  They have to go to and visit and go through the hassle of asking someone to unlock the case and open it up
[25:13.880 --> 25:21.400]  They just sell it right to you and the starter set is a great great deal really really low price for 15 bucks
[25:21.600 --> 25:27.400]  You get a razor moisturizing shave cream or gel your choice in three razor blades
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.040]  Then when you need more blades they're just two bucks each or less and eight pack is 15 bucks a
[25:34.040 --> 25:38.120]  16 pack is just 25 and I think it goes up from there
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.440]  You can buy them bulk and save more and more of the more that you buy at a time
[25:41.560 --> 25:46.720]  But even if you just buy eight at a time, it's 15 bucks for a refill. You cannot beat that with
[25:47.560 --> 25:50.680]  Gillette fusin fusion or any of those brands like that
[25:52.760 --> 25:59.160]  I think if you go to Amazon at least last time I checked here's from my notes is that it at Amazon and Amazon of course is
[25:59.480 --> 26:01.800]  huge discount or they sell everything at this count but
[26:01.800 --> 26:10.520]  For a 12 pack of fusions from Gillette. You pay 41 bucks. So it's way more. It's more like three and a half bucks are blade
[26:12.200 --> 26:17.280]  It truly is half the price for something of comparable quality great packaging nice heavy handle
[26:17.280 --> 26:19.960]  I was just looking at my handle recently. I've been traveling with it
[26:20.520 --> 26:23.960]  I've had this thing ever since Harry started sponsoring the talk show
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.360]  I've had one handle from Harry's I was looking at it
[26:26.360 --> 26:28.360]  I got like the chrome one whatever that one's called
[26:28.360 --> 26:35.520]  It run it under some hot water and wipe it off. It looks mint condition and it's not like I baby it's unbelievable
[26:36.160 --> 26:40.440]  Looks brand new. So all I've ever done all I've ever done with these guys to refill it is
[26:40.440 --> 26:43.280]  I just buy blades in one time I bought more shaving cream, and that was it
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.800]  So here's what you do go to harries.com use the promo code the talk show. That's the code and
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.360]  You will save five bucks off your first purchase
[26:54.360 --> 27:02.760]  So my thanks to harries you got the harries Jason. Yeah that that handle it's still yeah still super sharp
[27:02.760 --> 27:08.040]  And yeah, I just buy blades in the and the and the shape cream the Winston set is the one I bought
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.520]  That's the one that comes with the chrome handle. It's the Truman set that comes with the orange
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.600]  I don't know what that is like ceramic or plastic. Yeah, I got I got the shiny one that that's the that one the original one
[27:18.600 --> 27:25.240]  You got and yeah, it's pretty and nice and yeah, that's I it's funny. I was trying to come up with like who have a competitor's
[27:25.240 --> 27:28.600]  It's like I don't even remember they're gone. I just get the harries blades
[27:29.560 --> 27:32.520]  About those competitors forget it done. Yeah
[27:34.520 --> 27:36.520]  All right next on my list of
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.160]  topics for the show is
[27:39.560 --> 27:45.160]  This thing that popped up back half cheese like two weeks ago now, but it was at the beginning of my vacation this whole idea
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.000]  That that's safari is the new i.e
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.760]  This was I was on vacation too
[27:50.760 --> 27:56.040]  This was I read this before going to bed in my in-laws house and it made me it made me a mad
[27:56.040 --> 27:59.480]  And I was like I'm just gonna sleep on it. I woke up in the morning. I was like nope still mad
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.040]  So this was written by a web developer
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.920]  Name no one Lawson
[28:06.920 --> 28:15.400]  Yeah, I had his own website and it kind of blew up ours technica republished it with I'm 99% short given
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.600]  You know ours that they paid him and that they republished it there, but it certainly brought it to more people's attention
[28:21.560 --> 28:23.560]  And
[28:23.560 --> 28:26.200]  For people who were around in the 90s and
[28:26.760 --> 28:33.720]  Disagreeing with and maybe even the early 2000s. Honestly, I think I've still got a style sheet for daring fireball that says
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.640]  IE sucks dot CES you do then it yeah, and it's
[28:38.840 --> 28:39.880]  I don't even room
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.320]  I honestly would have to look it up
[28:41.320 --> 28:48.680]  I've sure I've left a note for myself and you know Jimbo explaining why it has to be in a separate file and why I think it's because it's
[28:48.680 --> 28:51.560]  I have it conditionally commented out on IE in the
[28:52.360 --> 28:57.960]  I think that's the story in the HTML for daring fireball. It's conditionally commented out and
[28:57.960 --> 29:03.000]  At a small style sheet IE underscore sucks dot PHP that you've got there. It's yeah
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.400]  It's just setting margins and hidden. Yeah. Yeah. It's it sucks
[29:07.960 --> 29:12.200]  Yeah, and that was and that was I think and I think I was mostly concerned with the Mac
[29:12.200 --> 29:14.760]  IE, which was a better IE in my experience, but anyway
[29:14.760 --> 29:20.520]  Oh by far people who had to deal with IE. It's it does not seem like you have to do that sort of stuff with
[29:20.680 --> 29:22.680]  JavaScript. I'm not JavaScript with
[29:23.560 --> 29:25.960]  Safari, so it feels like it's
[29:25.960 --> 29:33.000]  Accusations that the headline was written to get attention rather than to accurately portray the article to me were
[29:34.120 --> 29:36.120]  Just
[29:36.120 --> 29:38.200]  I think I don't think he intended it
[29:38.920 --> 29:41.880]  To become famous. I think I don't think so either
[29:43.960 --> 29:48.760]  I think he was frustrated look he went to a conference one of many he probably goes to
[29:49.320 --> 29:53.400]  About with web developers and all the web developers bitched about how
[29:53.400 --> 29:59.480]  Oh, you know, I want to do this thing, but it's not on safari and the apple doesn't let you do this on safari and they complained about
[29:59.480 --> 30:03.640]  This stuff that that safari didn't do or didn't do well and and they
[30:03.880 --> 30:09.480]  You know perceive it's like we who knows what apples doing and you know some of that may be Apple not communicating and some of that
[30:09.480 --> 30:11.480]  Maybe Apple not telling them what they want to hear
[30:11.720 --> 30:16.200]  But I think it was really much very much like who are who are we bitching about at the meetings?
[30:16.200 --> 30:18.200]  It used to be IE and now it's safari
[30:18.520 --> 30:21.720]  So safari is the new IE and and you know he ran with that
[30:21.720 --> 30:25.160]  maybe being he I think he was being cheeky and
[30:25.640 --> 30:28.760]  Then it kind of it kind of blew up in in his face
[30:28.760 --> 30:32.760]  But I think that was his intent and you know when I was at Macworld
[30:32.760 --> 30:36.360]  I would hear it from our developers our web developers that
[30:36.920 --> 30:41.720]  both on the front end and also for our CMS who would who would do this stuff and
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.120]  Show it to us new feature and we would try it in safari and they would be like
[30:46.280 --> 30:48.920]  You know, we'd say it doesn't work in safari and then back
[30:48.920 --> 30:54.680]  Safari, so I heard that from them too. I suspect that might have been more that they weren't properly testing on safari and
[30:54.920 --> 31:00.440]  You know, but I definitely have heard from the web developers I used to work with that safari had some weird things about it
[31:00.440 --> 31:06.600]  There were outliers and they had to do some extra stuff in order to get the get what they were building for us to work on safari
[31:06.600 --> 31:11.320]  So there's I mean, I'm sure there is some truth to that although you could probably look at some stuff
[31:11.320 --> 31:16.520]  That's in safari and if you develop for it then get frustrated by Chrome or Firefox to
[31:16.520 --> 31:24.600]  Depends on your perspective and in in Lawson's piece. I very much felt a very Chrome and a little bit Android kind of perspective
[31:24.600 --> 31:27.560]  But I think in the end what he really meant was we used to bitch about
[31:27.880 --> 31:30.920]  i.e. And now we bitch about safari at these conferences that I go to
[31:31.320 --> 31:33.000]  Yeah, I think it's twofold
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.000]  I think one is that a more accurate and perhaps even more sensational
[31:37.400 --> 31:39.960]  Headline would have been Apple is the new Microsoft
[31:40.760 --> 31:44.680]  Yeah, if you just want a wow blank is the new blank
[31:44.680 --> 31:46.920]  I think that's it and and by that I mean
[31:47.480 --> 31:49.480]  They are in charge of a
[31:49.800 --> 31:57.880]  Dominant operating system or by dominant. I mean it means everybody has to support it and most people feel like they need to support it as a top tier
[31:58.360 --> 32:00.360]  Target for their web development
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.680]  And it has a massive user base and the company is not motivated to
[32:08.200 --> 32:12.440]  Dance to the rest of the web open web
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.440]  uh
[32:14.680 --> 32:16.080]  Communities
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.880]  tune because they don't have to and so they can do what they want. They can do what they want and so
[32:22.520 --> 32:27.800]  In many in many cases not all in both in both Microsoft and Apple's cases not all the time
[32:28.200 --> 32:33.640]  But some of the time they just decide well we that that is not as high a priority for us as it is for you
[32:33.720 --> 32:36.520]  And so we're going to do what we want to do
[32:37.560 --> 32:41.160]  And that is frustrating to them. I use the freeze
[32:41.160 --> 32:46.040]  high priority or Apple's prioritizing and I got a whole bunch of angry
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.440]  I was walking around downtown San Diego
[32:49.000 --> 32:54.280]  On my vacation and I keep getting these like every time I would check my phone there'd be like 15
[32:54.520 --> 33:00.200]  20 new responses on Twitter and they were very much from web developers and and they focus so much on
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.440]  That idea the prioritization like Apple's got all the money. They don't need to prioritize. They can do everything
[33:06.440 --> 33:09.080]  Which is not I think accurate at all, but
[33:09.080 --> 33:11.080]  But it is
[33:11.080 --> 33:17.320]  The differences that Microsoft in those days could really define the web because almost every browser was using
[33:17.960 --> 33:23.000]  was using windows and using IE almost like I mean like what 90%
[33:23.240 --> 33:27.720]  85% it was at least it was probably around 90% and and at that time
[33:28.200 --> 33:31.720]  The only devices that were browsing the web were PCs
[33:32.280 --> 33:35.720]  Yes, there were no mobile devices doing this and in the latter days
[33:35.720 --> 33:41.880]  Maybe there was like a WAP or something like that, but basically that's well past the point of where IE became i.e
[33:42.520 --> 33:44.920]  You know right yeah, so so that
[33:45.960 --> 33:51.480]  It's a very different one of these arguments is about kind of access to a platform that people like a shiny platform
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.080]  Which is we want to be on iOS and I I definitely got a sense that you know
[33:55.080 --> 33:56.120]  This is about
[33:56.840 --> 34:00.520]  Originally, I was wondering if it was about Safari and WebKit in general and as I read his article
[34:00.520 --> 34:02.200]  I realized it's really just about mobile
[34:02.200 --> 34:08.680]  He's he doesn't really care about the Mac Safari. He cares about iOS and wanting access to iOS and wanting to build things that work
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.760]  Really well in iOS and I get that but that's very different from a company that could literally like
[34:15.320 --> 34:20.200]  Just whatever they did was the web and that was where Microsoft was so in in some ways
[34:20.200 --> 34:21.800]  It depends on how you define it, but in some ways
[34:22.200 --> 34:24.920]  Nobody's ever going to be the new IE ever again
[34:25.240 --> 34:30.040]  No, and so when I read that I start to read it as this isn't really about
[34:30.040 --> 34:37.160]  It is about web standards, but it's about using web standards and being frustrated that they don't grant you the level of access to a particular
[34:37.720 --> 34:40.200]  platform that you want to have and
[34:41.480 --> 34:47.880]  You know, I understand where they're coming from, but it's not it's not the same
[34:47.880 --> 34:51.720]  It's a it's a different kind of argument. That's where that analogy falls down for me
[34:52.440 --> 34:54.440]  All right, and to me one of the things that
[34:54.920 --> 34:58.920]  Microsoft did that made i.e. i.e. Is that they promoted
[34:58.920 --> 35:06.440]  Purposefully, you know, for the for the reason that you know, it's not even that there could be an argument
[35:07.240 --> 35:09.240]  The other way there is no maybe about it
[35:09.880 --> 35:11.480]  um
[35:11.480 --> 35:15.640]  That they added features to i.e. That depended on
[35:16.120 --> 35:17.080]  Windows. Oh, yeah, well
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.120]  Especially the active x stuff which was like literally just x86. How do we fix the web to make it more interactive?
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.800]  We'll just embed x86 code in web pages
[35:25.800 --> 35:33.480]  I mean, I guess you could argue that that would be the the that it wasn't really about locking locking i.e. to windows
[35:33.480 --> 35:36.440]  It was about making it more interactive, but um
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.000]  You know, I I think that there were ways to make it interactive that wouldn't have been
[35:41.800 --> 35:44.840]  So proprietary and active x could not have been more proprietary
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.800]  There was no way for other platforms to add active x even i.e. on Mac didn't do in the active x
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.880]  It was really it wasn't even about locking the web to i.e. It was about locking the web to
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.040]  Windows or at least part of it and a whole slew of
[35:59.000 --> 35:59.880]  You know
[35:59.880 --> 36:05.720]  Corporate type stuff where where windows was already entrenched in where there were a lot of in-house windows developers already
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.160]  All went that route with their with their websites and you know
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.840]  There was you know as a mac user from the whole era there was a whole
[36:13.720 --> 36:17.720]  You know time when you know everybody was it went from
[36:18.120 --> 36:18.920]  There's no way
[36:18.920 --> 36:24.440]  I'm ever gonna do banking online because that would be crazy it would you know I'm gonna get hacked and lose all my money
[36:24.840 --> 36:30.040]  To maybe I should do banking online to I think I I would like to do my banking online
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.400]  And then you find out that your bank's website only worked with you know i.e
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.720]  Version blank or later on windows blank or later because the whole
[36:40.360 --> 36:43.160]  website was based on proprietary windows
[36:43.160 --> 36:52.040]  Yeah, and and the we should say that during that period the web standards people were a real lifeline for mac users because
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.360]  They were saying this stuff isn't standard and mac users were
[36:56.680 --> 37:02.760]  Were the example like this 10% of the web is not allowed to access this stuff ultimately what cracked
[37:03.560 --> 37:08.920]  Crack this open. I think is first off. I you got so bad that firefox became
[37:08.920 --> 37:12.360]  be started becoming popular and a lot of the same
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.760]  A lot of the stuff that didn't work on i.e
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.640]  Didn't work anywhere, but i.e for windows didn't work on firefox on windows either
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.960]  And so sites started to to make sure that it also worked in firefox and I can't tell you how many times you probably experienced this too
[37:26.360 --> 37:30.760]  In that couple of years things started working on the mac
[37:31.320 --> 37:36.840]  Because the websites were redesigned to work on firefox on windows and not just i.e
[37:36.840 --> 37:38.840]  Yeah, and the mac users were like thank you very much
[37:39.960 --> 37:45.960]  Because it works for us to now and and you know that that was a web standards based thing and it's when you're in a
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.520]  Minority platform it is a web standards are especially a big deal
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.160]  Yeah, and so I don't that's where I think the analogy between safari and i.e
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.160]  Really breaks down into me. It's really more about apple and Microsoft and
[38:01.160 --> 38:07.160]  Being more interested in their own well-being and their own users well-being, you know
[38:07.160 --> 38:10.360]  I've always said like apples priorities are threefold apple first
[38:11.560 --> 38:16.920]  It's user second and it's developers third and it wants all three to be happy
[38:17.160 --> 38:22.440]  but when push comes to shove that's the order in which things are going to fall and
[38:22.760 --> 38:28.440]  I'm sure that there are people at apple who would argue that users come first but in my experience covering the company
[38:28.440 --> 38:31.560]  I'm sure I don't even know if I can think of a good example, but
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.720]  Well, I don't that's hard to say I don't know I sure if I gave it some time
[38:40.440 --> 38:45.640]  For example, there's a reason I've always said oh, oh, I mean this is I don't want I don't want to go down this rabbit hole
[38:45.640 --> 38:47.640]  But I will say things like
[38:48.600 --> 38:49.640]  Things like
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.840]  Amazon and comexology not being able to purchase in app from a perfectly reasonable vendor
[38:54.840 --> 39:00.680]  because Apple wants to intercept 30% because they're making money on Apple's platform is
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.120]  Not an improvement of the user experience, but it is an Apple benefits. So
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.440]  Even even the fact that they just allow say the Kindle app from having a link that goes jumps you out to Safari
[39:13.320 --> 39:21.160]  To do the purchasing of Kindle. That is a perfect example. I think you could also argue that their high-profit margins on hardware
[39:21.800 --> 39:24.040]  Are apple first user second?
[39:24.040 --> 39:30.920]  You know it relevant to developers more or less it's hard not to argue that it wouldn't be better for its customers if
[39:31.320 --> 39:37.280]  Prices were a little bit lower across which is not to say that they can't you could make it's just to say that these are the priors
[39:38.600 --> 39:43.800]  Right, and then you could make a long-term argument that maybe that is good for users because the high-profit
[39:43.800 --> 39:52.200]  Margin strengthen Apple as a company and make it more likely that they're going to be successful in a position to do cool new things going forward
[39:52.200 --> 39:57.920]  You know that the iPhone could be developed when it was in 2007 because they had the money
[39:58.120 --> 40:05.240]  Which were profits from the Mac to fund it, etc. I mean, but now you're going you know another level deep in the argument
[40:07.320 --> 40:15.000]  But because of this you know it Apple first user second developers third if you want to subdivide developers third
[40:15.000 --> 40:23.320]  And web developers are going to come in underneath native third-party app developers every time for Apple
[40:23.960 --> 40:31.240]  And that's not to say that Apple doesn't want so far everywhere Mac and iOS to be a great platform and to have web developers
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.280]  Use it
[40:32.280 --> 40:40.640]  But it's never going to be a higher priority than native stuff right and this argument. I feel like I don't know if you listen to a couple weeks ago on
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.040]  on ATP. I felt like Marco and John were
[40:46.480 --> 40:47.680]  Kind of
[40:47.680 --> 40:52.240]  They weren't arguing it sounded like arguing, but they were actually just arguing two different points that I
[40:52.560 --> 40:59.200]  Agreed with both of them and it's the it depends on how you view the web. I mean on on one hand
[40:59.680 --> 41:06.160]  The web is an open web is a beautiful thing that we all benefit from and that we need to keep
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.480]  Because no one vendors in charge of it and it's a commonality that we all have you don't have to go use an app
[41:12.480 --> 41:14.920]  Imagine a world where you had to use an app for everything right?
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.600]  It's like the web browser is great because some stuff doesn't need to be in an app doesn't have to be in an app
[41:19.600 --> 41:21.600]  People build web pages any device
[41:21.600 --> 41:27.760]  Including ones we've never even thought of now can be devised and can read those web pages and isn't that great?
[41:27.840 --> 41:33.240]  So that's the open web and I think it's powerful and important and web standards are important because that way
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.320]  No, no one vendor is going to control the future of this and everybody can access it
[41:37.480 --> 41:39.880]  but for me the other the other piece of it and
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.320]  I mean what John Syracuse has told me is you guys are really overdoing it, but
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.720]  If you read the Nolan Lawson piece
[41:47.720 --> 41:50.760]  I think it is definitely in there is this concept of what he calls the
[41:51.480 --> 41:58.280]  It was a point made in an installable web apps breakout and the whole idea there is
[41:58.280 --> 42:06.200]  You know standards community wants to create that has decided that a good thing is to bundle up web apps and make them
[42:06.200 --> 42:12.840]  Instalable like apps which is that the width of the you know the Chrome app store that idea and that is
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.920]  That's really different because that's not the open web per se
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.760]  It's sort of like using web technologies to build apps and
[42:21.560 --> 42:26.280]  That is totally where I see somebody who understands Apple somebody who's inside Apple goes
[42:26.280 --> 42:31.800]  Yeah, we are not as excited about that because that doesn't sound like the open web
[42:32.040 --> 42:37.400]  That sounds like you guys trying to say we want to have you know
[42:37.880 --> 42:44.280]  a me-to app platform on your devices and we don't love that idea right at least right now
[42:44.280 --> 42:49.480]  Like why would we prioritize that we're really happy with with native apps
[42:50.760 --> 42:54.120]  Well that said Apple of course is the company who in
[42:54.120 --> 42:56.120]  2007
[42:56.520 --> 42:59.800]  First said this is how you can create apps for the iPhone
[42:59.800 --> 43:05.000]  But it's limited to what the initial version of web kit was Apple has allowed you
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.760]  I mean because if we don't mention it we're both gonna get 500 emails about it
[43:08.920 --> 43:16.120]  You know, I forget what version of iOS added this feature, but it was years ago. It was certainly two thousand single digit
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.000]  You know 2008 2009 where you hit the action button and on any web page you can
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.560]  What is it called save add to homes if that if if that isn't in iOS one at some point?
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.560]  It was certainly in iOS two, but I think right and and there's a way a very simple way as a web developer
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.280]  Where if you don't do anything when you do that you just get like a bookmark on your home screen
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.240]  And you tap it and it opens that web page in mobile safari like a regular tab in mobile safari
[43:43.240 --> 43:46.120]  But there's a way that you can have just with some simple metadata
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.160]  You don't even have to do any programming really just some markup
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.760]  You can have your web page open without being looking like it's in safari
[43:54.760 --> 43:57.960]  It looks like a standalone app and some people have made some pretty
[43:58.760 --> 44:02.600]  You know app very very close to native looking native feeling
[44:03.800 --> 44:06.760]  Solutions that way and it's still there. You can still do it
[44:06.760 --> 44:17.560]  The difference with I think this Nolan Lawson argument and the people who back him up is that they want those apps to be able to do more and more and
[44:18.120 --> 44:21.320]  I even think that one of the proposals that they want
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.120]  I mean some of the stuff they want to do
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.600]  I mean this is just not gonna happen if you know Apple is
[44:27.400 --> 44:29.400]  Is it the service server workers?
[44:29.400 --> 44:31.400]  Service worker they call it
[44:31.400 --> 44:33.400]  Is like doing stuff in the background
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.720]  Yeah, that is not gonna happen and it ties into something. I want to talk about later
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.520]  You know, which is the whole idea of
[44:43.240 --> 44:49.880]  Web pages doing stuff in the background by JavaScript and the adverse effects it can have on performance and battery life and
[44:50.760 --> 44:54.760]  Not to mention control, you know from Apple's perspective. This is not gonna happen
[44:55.640 --> 45:02.360]  I think that I like I get I get why web developers would want to do this because it puts their skills in the most exciting place to be
[45:02.360 --> 45:05.800]  Right now is developing a mobile apps and they are limited there
[45:05.880 --> 45:11.960]  So I think they would like this and any web standards body is all about the web standards
[45:11.960 --> 45:14.360]  So why would we you know, they not want to be a part of this?
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.920]  I totally get that and I get why Apple would be resistant and I get why Google wouldn't care and would perhaps even be
[45:20.920 --> 45:24.360]  Eking them on and supporting it in Chrome because it doesn't hurt Google
[45:24.840 --> 45:30.440]  Like it hurts Apple because Google is happy to give away an operating system and let everybody use it and whatever
[45:30.440 --> 45:36.200]  What while Apple needs to be different and pushing their platform forward and having reasons why it's better
[45:36.760 --> 45:40.440]  So I understand all that I also think that ultimately if
[45:41.240 --> 45:43.240]  Every web browser does something
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.000]  If this becomes sort of the consensus of like this is how it's done
[45:47.400 --> 45:50.520]  I don't think Apple's going to kick and scream and drag its feet
[45:50.840 --> 45:54.280]  I think it's going to embrace whatever ends up being the standards
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.640]  But I do think that it at this point stuff like this Apple is completely
[45:59.640 --> 46:01.640]  Understandably just saying yeah
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.960]  Not our not our number one goal here because we really like native apps and yeah the sweet solution has always been there
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.680]  but you know the app store is a huge strength of apples and
[46:13.400 --> 46:15.400]  I think they're they're
[46:15.800 --> 46:18.040]  They don't see a strategic benefit in
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.360]  allowing web developers to bypass the app store and create experiences that may or may not be up to
[46:24.360 --> 46:30.840]  Snuff from what can be done with you know with native apps using the latest iOS APIs
[46:34.680 --> 46:41.000]  And part of it too and it almost it's not even implicit it's a lot of these arguments from the pro web developer
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.440]  We want you know, we see Apple is you know dragging its feet in this thing and that they're holding back the open web
[46:47.960 --> 46:49.960]  Part of it is that
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.960]  Apple
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.000]  Yes, they have an interest in keeping the app store as important as it is and that's a strategic
[46:59.720 --> 47:01.720]  just for Apple
[47:02.200 --> 47:04.440]  Advantage that that richer
[47:05.160 --> 47:10.040]  Web apps that you could just install from everywhere that don't have an approval that don't go through the app store that it would hurt that
[47:10.520 --> 47:15.800]  But the other thing that these that these developers want is that they're still chasing the dream of right once
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.000]  Run everywhere where they can write one
[47:19.960 --> 47:25.000]  App that would run on all mobile devices, you know windows phone and Android and
[47:26.440 --> 47:30.200]  iOS with minimal if none if any
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.240]  per platform
[47:34.200 --> 47:35.480]  You know
[47:35.480 --> 47:37.480]  special cases and
[47:38.520 --> 47:44.200]  That's not just against Apple's interest. That's actually against Apple's vision for what's best for the platform because we've seen that
[47:44.200 --> 47:52.760]  For decades, you know at any any kind of right once run anywhere run time type thing is inherently a second class
[47:54.840 --> 47:57.080]  Experience to what can be done natively
[47:57.640 --> 48:04.040]  And so there's a reason that that's actually in in the long run. It really is it's maybe anti-developer
[48:04.040 --> 48:11.480]  Maybe anti web developer, but it's in Apple's perspective very much pro user to say we want to take strategic
[48:11.480 --> 48:17.640]  We want to strategically keep that from becoming the where the industry goes because we think it's a much better
[48:17.960 --> 48:24.920]  Vastly better user experience to mostly be using native apps and if they're mostly using native apps
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.600]  It allows us Apple to do new things quickly
[48:29.800 --> 48:34.040]  More quickly than if it depended on the industry updating exactly right exactly
[48:34.040 --> 48:36.040]  I mean those those are the two big issues
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.040]  One of them is this right once run anywhere thing where
[48:40.040 --> 48:45.080]  And and people who use Java today get really mad when I talk about the 90s
[48:45.080 --> 48:51.960]  But in the 90s we were all sort of sold this idea that Java was this amazing technology that was going to let
[48:52.280 --> 48:58.680]  People write apps that ran on the Mac and ran on the PC and anybody on the Mac in the 90s who tried that
[48:59.080 --> 49:06.520]  Saw that when they ran they ran badly and they never felt like you were using them on the Mac anyway
[49:06.520 --> 49:13.480]  It was a bad experience even and then you could put in as a developer huge amounts of work to try and make it
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.280]  Better on the Mac and look more like the Mac
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.080]  But at that point now you've got all this this huge chunk of work that is about kind of localizing it for the Mac
[49:21.080 --> 49:23.080]  And you're no longer writing once and running anywhere
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.600]  So it was it was a that was my sort of like formative moment in terms of saying oh
[49:29.240 --> 49:34.280]  It's important that stuff get written for the platform that it's on you can tell when it's not
[49:34.280 --> 49:37.960]  I mean you could even tell when things like Microsoft Office were written
[49:38.680 --> 49:45.240]  For the Mac but using some code and guidelines from Windows even even when it wasn't right once run anywhere
[49:45.240 --> 49:46.520]  It was still
[49:46.520 --> 49:52.200]  Not a good experience on your platform because it was really something that had come across from a different platform
[49:52.600 --> 49:55.320]  So it's not it's not good for users
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.600]  And I don't think that I think you know this would be similar
[49:58.600 --> 50:04.600]  And that's a bad experience and Apple knows that it would almost certainly be a bad experience in most cases
[50:04.600 --> 50:06.160]  There's always that you know, but what about this?
[50:06.160 --> 50:06.640]  But what about this?
[50:06.640 --> 50:08.600]  I'm sure there would be some brilliant ones that would be great
[50:08.600 --> 50:16.920]  But a lot of them would be exactly the same on Windows and on Android and they would look kind of like neither and be kind of icky
[50:16.920 --> 50:18.600]  And would we really want to do that?
[50:18.600 --> 50:27.920]  And then your second point is absolutely true right now Apple can say hey new API's at WWDC new iOS coming out developers jump on it
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.760]  Look how we can push this platform forward you've got access to a touch sensor now
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.320]  You've got you know, whatever the next thing is you've got we put the metal APIs in there
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.400]  We're doing all of the stuff for you that makes making apps on our platform better than anywhere else and makes our platform better
[50:42.400 --> 50:47.680]  And makes your apps better so let's do that and then contrast that with well, you know
[50:48.240 --> 50:50.560]  Everybody what do we want for our standard?
[50:51.120 --> 50:54.000]  Let's run it through the standards body. Let's see what everybody says
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.840]  It's not that standards aren't important and can't be good, but that seems pretty antithetical to
[51:00.640 --> 51:03.440]  What is a key part of Apple strategy?
[51:03.440 --> 51:05.440]  Which is pushing things forward
[51:05.680 --> 51:12.000]  itself being opinionated and saying we think this is important we built it and having a team of you know
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.400]  Community of developers who will adopt that stuff and then everything gets better
[51:16.400 --> 51:23.920]  And I have a hard time seeing how that happens quickly in a you know in a web standards app development platform
[51:24.960 --> 51:31.600]  Right, and one of the things that seems to be forgotten in this whole Apple is opposed to the open web
[51:32.880 --> 51:40.560]  Mindset is something that is very much of a what can one opinionated company in a position of strength do
[51:41.040 --> 51:45.040]  Which is the way that in my opinion Apple single-handedly?
[51:45.040 --> 51:45.920]  the
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.920]  burst the
[51:48.240 --> 51:51.440]  Pox that Adobe flash was on the open web
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.960]  both in terms of user experience in terms of
[51:58.640 --> 52:00.640]  Battery life and performance
[52:01.200 --> 52:03.680]  Certainly in part terms of security
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.040]  Even to this day like even this in July
[52:07.760 --> 52:11.200]  2015 that this hacking team outfit over in Italy
[52:11.200 --> 52:17.040]  All their exploits were most of their exploits. We're based on Adobe flash
[52:19.360 --> 52:22.960]  Security holes that we're you know here to for unknown to the public
[52:25.200 --> 52:27.200]  And in terms of beings
[52:27.840 --> 52:33.040]  Having what is called the web what you get on a web page being driven by standards well
[52:33.040 --> 52:41.040]  but Adobe flash was on a standard proprietary format controlled owned by Adobe and
[52:44.560 --> 52:46.880]  When iOS shipped without flash
[52:47.360 --> 52:52.400]  It was predicted by many as a reason that it would never really take off because you wouldn't be able to
[52:53.280 --> 52:55.840]  See video on the web or do anything interactive on the web
[52:56.800 --> 53:00.080]  And then as time went on and famously Steve Jobs wrote an open letter
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.840]  Thoughts on flash explaining
[53:05.440 --> 53:11.440]  Why do why why they haven't and why they do not plan to and will not support Adobe flash on iOS
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.200]  You know, and it was criticized by many including a lot of people who I think
[53:17.760 --> 53:22.880]  At the time we call them so that you know the argument was that plugins and plug-in APIs are part of the web too
[53:23.920 --> 53:28.000]  Well, it turns out that it did and that didn't keep iOS users from seeing video
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.320]  It took years it did take years and you know one site at a time as they got their act together switched to the open standard
[53:36.320 --> 53:39.280]  Which is just the simple video tag from HTML5
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.840]  But here we are today and I I serve
[53:44.960 --> 53:49.200]  99% of the time in Safari and I have iOS and
[53:49.200 --> 53:56.960]  Mac and sometimes on the Mac I still run into sites where when they see that I'm on a Mac they insist on serving me flash
[53:57.200 --> 54:00.960]  Even if I change the use do the developer menu trick and say okay
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.040]  I'm gonna tell you that I'm an iPad will you please give me a team of five video and every once in a while
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.920]  I still get that and I have to if I really want to most of the time I just give up and say screw you
[54:09.920 --> 54:10.880]  I'm not watching your video
[54:10.880 --> 54:15.120]  I if I need to I can go to Chrome and Chrome has the flash plug-in built in
[54:15.120 --> 54:19.920]  I can't remember the last time I encountered video that didn't play on my phone or iPad though
[54:20.160 --> 54:25.200]  Every but just about everybody seems to have their act together and when they're actually dealing with iOS and serves
[54:25.760 --> 54:28.640]  That and that is not just for the benefit of iOS users
[54:28.640 --> 54:35.440]  That for the benefit of anybody on any operating system or any device that wants to watch a video and not have flash run
[54:36.480 --> 54:38.480]  And that is the sort of thing that
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.800]  If Apple just went along with what the quote unquote community wanted they would have added plug-in support to iOS
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.600]  But beat by being a single opinionated company
[54:49.040 --> 54:57.280]  With different priorities from maybe the industry as a whole certainly different priorities from the all the web publishers that were publishing flash based video
[54:58.320 --> 55:00.880]  They changed the web. I think it gave Google some
[55:00.880 --> 55:09.680]  You know cuz Google remember tried to tried to get flash running on Android for a little while and at some point
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.200]  At some point that fell apart and I feel like some of that was also yet the courage to
[55:15.920 --> 55:21.200]  Not bother because it was already on iOS and and it was one of those things that
[55:21.920 --> 55:25.920]  Wasn't gonna be they thought it would be a competitive advantage it turned out to not be
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.320]  And that was helpful for all of us that I mean
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.360]  What would have happened if Adobe had gotten flash to work efficiently on Android?
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.800]  Maybe things would have been different, but you know we do we do benefit from the fact
[55:41.280 --> 55:47.040]  It's an enormous bit. Yeah, but since they haven't gotten a running. They could they could they couldn't they couldn't they just couldn't
[55:47.040 --> 55:54.320]  And if you saw it on blackberry playbook or you saw it on like the web OS tablets it was awful and yeah, yeah
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.640]  I mean that that was a I can't help it thing
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.600]  I don't know enough people at Google to say that I can vouch for that
[55:59.600 --> 56:02.240]  I don't have any little birdies at Google who can say that this happened
[56:02.240 --> 56:08.400]  But I would bet my bottom dollar that there were an awful lot of people within Google if not a majority of people within
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.360]  Google who
[56:09.360 --> 56:14.800]  When when they sort of doubled down on flash support on Android that collectively within the company
[56:14.800 --> 56:16.400]  They were like what the heck are we doing?
[56:16.400 --> 56:20.800]  Why don't we follow them and we can wipe this scourge off the you know
[56:20.800 --> 56:27.080]  Web faster. Why in the world would we not follow their lead here? Here's somewhere where we ought to be aligned with
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.560]  It's because they were buckling it was because they were really defensive and behind and they thought it was one of their own
[56:31.560 --> 56:35.240]  But they did differentiation I think just for Android though, right?
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.640]  That's one of those areas and that was at a time and and this is certainly
[56:38.960 --> 56:44.400]  Lessened greatly and I think it really does sort of correlate to when they got Andy Rubin
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.720]  You know sort of shoveled him under a closet and got him out and put Android under the control of
[56:49.720 --> 56:52.840]  Sundar or whatever his name is
[56:54.040 --> 56:57.680]  That Android at that point became a lot more
[56:58.120 --> 57:01.960]  Integrated with Google up until then and I wrote about this a couple times under in Fireball
[57:01.960 --> 57:03.400]  I always felt like
[57:03.400 --> 57:11.360]  Android felt like a you that it's own independent company within Google sort of like what nests supposedly and seems to be right now
[57:12.160 --> 57:14.880]  That it was in Android's interest maybe to do that
[57:14.880 --> 57:17.440]  But it certainly wasn't with it Google's overall interest
[57:17.440 --> 57:20.120]  I think Google's overall interest were much better served with flash
[57:21.600 --> 57:24.960]  Wiped out. I mean in flat because one I mean it just thing about search
[57:25.360 --> 57:29.560]  You know any kind of content in flash player was either either not
[57:29.840 --> 57:39.440]  Indexable or harder to index than stuff that was in HTML. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that was that was right Google Google as a as a company
[57:39.440 --> 57:42.480]  It's much more sort of open web standards kind of company
[57:42.480 --> 57:48.960]  And then there was the Android group and the Android group was like this is a Apple has given us an opening by refusing to support
[57:48.960 --> 57:51.840]  It was kind of like don't throw me in the briar patch a little bit. It's like
[57:52.560 --> 57:57.680]  Yeah, we get to support flash because Apple didn't and then they did and then they worked with Adobe and realized
[57:57.680 --> 57:58.800]  Oh, this is not very good
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.520]  And it was in the end it was it was not an advantage to have flash on mobile
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.920]  But they thought it was and they hoped it was and there were lots there were ads, right?
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.480]  There were like TV ads that said real flash real web video. Yeah
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.240]  It was I mean it would but that was the thing is it was it was strategic
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.280]  To try to find a weakness for Apple and when Apple kind of blindsided everybody with the iPhone
[58:22.560 --> 58:27.040]  Yeah, and the app putting that as an ad was in my opinion a stupid thing because nobody ever had any idea
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.320]  What was flash and what wasn't all they knew is that every once in a while and they still do
[58:30.320 --> 58:34.080]  Everyone's in a while as they get a dialogue box saying you can't do this unless you upgrade your flash
[58:34.080 --> 58:42.560]  And click these 18 buttons and install all the password in and stuff and install all this and then come back and hopefully it'll work
[58:42.560 --> 58:48.400]  But they don't know what's flash and what's not especially as long as it's worth no flash thing was really great for Apple in the end because
[58:48.400 --> 58:53.280]  I think how many how many native iOS apps were written in the early days of the iPhone
[58:54.080 --> 58:56.880]  Because the you know, whatever
[58:56.880 --> 59:03.120]  Assights extrusion into the world, you know, was built around flash and they're like a G's we can't do that
[59:04.080 --> 59:07.680]  Let's write an app we can do it that way. I'm like the majorly baseball
[59:08.560 --> 59:14.840]  App which has been one of the most successful apps ever and was there on I think day one on the on the app store
[59:15.440 --> 59:19.040]  One of the reasons that existed is because they didn't you know
[59:19.040 --> 59:22.160]  They were using flash and then later. I think silver
[59:22.160 --> 59:27.680]  for all of their audio and video stuff and they couldn't do that on the on the iPhone and they really wanted to be on the
[59:27.680 --> 59:34.960]  iPhone so they you know rather than rebuild their entire infrastructure on the on the and build rebuild the front-end for
[59:34.960 --> 59:37.120]  Everybody they just took those you know
[59:37.120 --> 59:44.400]  They made sure they had some iPhone compatible streams on their servers and wrote an app and so in the end the app market got a lot
[59:44.400 --> 59:46.400]  Richard because
[59:46.400 --> 59:52.640]  Companies wrote apps because they couldn't just rely on flash on the web and that was good for Apple. Yeah
[59:53.440 --> 59:57.600]  And and maybe MLB would have written an app any either way anyway
[59:57.840 --> 1:00:02.400]  You don't know. I mean they still don't have a Mac app if you're on a Mac and you want to watch the ball game
[1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:08.640]  You still have flash they do but or do they it's yeah, they do I wrote a thing about a few months ago on six colors
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:16.160]  It is I think they wrote it last year. It's still posted. It uses the it uses the streams that that the iPad app
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:18.160]  Uses, so it doesn't use flash
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:21.200]  It crashes half the time not while you're playing it
[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:24.240]  But like the next time you launch it it crashes and then you launch it again that works
[1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:28.560]  So like every other time it crashes on launch super hinky my understanding is that they
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:33.760]  That they deprioritized it so it's basically I think there's some developers at MLB
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:39.680]  Who really wish that they were building this thing because they're Mac users and they haven't been given any time to do it
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:42.880]  but it is around you can find it and
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:48.560]  And it doesn't work which is I was going to say I'm in my in my mind
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:50.800]  I'm thinking of MacBooks which is what I you know
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:57.120]  But if I clue it the most majority of people use and I think that's that's not a good machine to watch a ball game on
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:01.280]  As I sit here talking to you staring in front of a 30-inch red in the iMac
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:05.840]  Which I guess kind of would be a pretty good machine to watch a ball game in front of yeah
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.040]  I mean it's a and not bad to just I would like to warn that but yeah
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.800]  It's it's okay. It's better than a web page right and and but you're right
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:15.040]  There is no they didn't need to do that on the Mac
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:18.400]  But they did need to do it to get on iOS and so they did yeah
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:25.440]  And who knows how many other companies are in a similar position where they had a thing that worked in flash and then the developers and
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:30.320]  Designers probably would have wanted to go native anyway because they they
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:35.840]  They know how much better native can be and they could go to management and say we really want to do a native app
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:42.080]  Our choice as a company is to use the it this is in the hypothetical world where you could get flashed a run on iOS
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:44.000]  We can do this thing
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.120]  We could just use our flash and adjust it to the screen size and it's going to be a really crummy experience for them
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:51.440]  Or we can take the time to write this native thing
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.800]  Some companies are going to say let's do the cheaper easier thing and stick to flash as opposed to in the actual world
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:08.080]  Where the argument was we can either not run at all on these devices any iPhone or we can write an app. Yeah, and that's a very different
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:14.560]  Proposal to management. We can do a crummy thing in flash or go native or we can not be there at all
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:20.080]  Or write a native and I think this is one of the things that motivates Apple to look on skeptically at
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:25.840]  At these issues of how do we use web technologies to have
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:29.040]  Instalable mobile apps. I think they look at that and
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:38.240]  And I'm of this opinion too. I think that if there's a scenario where the perception is you don't need to write an iOS app
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:41.840]  And you don't need to write an Android app. You can write a web app, and it's good enough
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:47.440]  There will be a whole class of people who will just write the good enough thing
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:50.640]  And you know, maybe their apps aren't great
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:56.000]  But they're native and it picks up a lot of the stuff that's that comes with being a native app
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.640]  And the you update it for the next OS and it picks some things up
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  If you have a whole swath of apps that are just kind of non platform crappy
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.640]  That that's bad. I would argue that's bad for both platforms
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:11.040]  I'm not sure it's bad for Google. I'm not sure they care
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:14.240]  But I think it'll be bad for Android users. It would certainly be bad for iOS users
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:18.000]  And so I think that may be part of the thought process at Apple
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.240]  It's certainly what I thought of immediately is is if we make it a really
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.960]  Really easy to choose either one
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:27.760]  There are a lot of people who will just choose the easiest path
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:30.400]  And the easiest path is going to be bad for the user
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:34.240]  So we're going to make it we're going to prioritize the user over the developer
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:39.520]  And make them do the extra work to do a native app because it's a better experience and enforce them too
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:45.760]  Yep, and I and it's exactly what I've you know what I said before that in my experience time after time after time
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:50.000]  Apple first user second developers third and I really think that the heart of this
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:55.520]  You know Apple is the new i.e. argument is really complaining about not putting developers first
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:01.520]  And you know and I think in a lot of ways you could argue that that was
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:04.560]  Microsoft's way and that Microsoft put
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:11.520]  Developers ahead of users in terms of like the way that Microsoft historically with Windows has bent over backwards
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:17.920]  Not to break API's and to keep legacy API's around as long as they can and that yes
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:20.320]  We have this new thing but the old thing will still work
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.520]  I mean that you could still run DOS apps and I'll open in a window
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.840]  The problem with Microsoft is that unlike Apple which historically has had
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.400]  Apple and
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:34.240]  Users and developers as its constituents more than any other groups
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:38.800]  Microsoft it's it's Microsoft and users and developers and
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:43.920]  Like the buyers the the clients because there's so much business
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:50.480]  Right aspect to it and I feel like so much of that compatibility stuff wasn't really about honoring the developers
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.480]  It was more like the developers
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.520]  were
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:54.800]  stuck and
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.760]  The and maybe the developers even wanted to move forward but the businesses didn't
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.920]  They wanted it to be just exactly the same and for most of Microsoft's modern history
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:11.440]  That was the priority was how do we make a product that will continue to get us the big contracts
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:18.240]  From the big businesses to buy a billion PCs and install them everywhere and let's just do that
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:22.240]  And they didn't want change they they just wanted to stay in the mud so they did
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:23.760]  Yeah, all right
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:27.920]  I have a I want to talk about Chrome next so remind me all right
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:33.760]  But I want to take a break here and thank our second sponsor and it is our good friends at hover
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:38.720]  Hover is the best way to buy and manage domain names. I've been telling you about them for a while
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:40.720]  They used to be the best
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:45.920]  They still are today. You could look around and find as many it list all the domain name registrars
[1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:47.920]  You can you're not going to find one better than hover
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:53.840]  They have a special code just for Darren Fireball listeners. I'm gonna tell you at the end of the read
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.960]  It's a great code
[1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.480]  They come up with the I'm terrible at this sometimes they ask me for suggestions
[1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:04.880]  Hover likes to have these in jokes as the code if you listen to it to any other shows that hover sponsors like ATP
[1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:09.600]  They always come up with these in jokes. I'm terrible. They they ask me for them and I can't do it
[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:11.600]  But they come up with some good ones and they have a good one this week
[1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.600]  So keep listening and and I'll tell you the code now if you don't know about hover. Here's the thing
[1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:23.360]  You want to secure a great domain name they have everything you need in less than five minutes
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:26.960]  You can find the domain name you want through searching and they'll help you find
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.560]  you know the combination of words that are available with the top-level domain
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.280]  Combination, you know, whatever you want dot whatever you want
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:38.800]  Really clean and simple
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:45.280]  Interface on the website no other ads. I don't even get that on other domain name registrars where they're it's like I'm paying you
[1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:51.920]  This is your your the service. Why am I looking at ads for other things on on this thing? It's so different at hover
[1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:58.720]  If you have registered domain names anyway, so you know that a lot of their competitors may get a really unpleasant
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:00.240]  Experience
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:04.560]  Every step of the way to change anything to register something new. They're always
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:11.920]  Checking checkmarks checkboxes that give you little add-ons or upgrades or stuff like that that you maybe you know shouldn't be on by default or
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:18.440]  Or they're for things like domain name like who is privacy domain name privacy to keep your stuff private
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:23.600]  They may make you pay extra for that hover that stuff is all anything that should be built in is built in
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:25.720]  There's no heavy-handed up-selling
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:29.960]  They don't charge you for stuff that should just be there everything is just
[1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:36.440]  That should be included is included with your domain and you get a smart control panel and you get who is privacy and
[1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:42.040]  They have the most amazing thing in the entire industry which is valet transfers
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:43.440]  This is the thing about hover
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.400]  This is the fact this is the human touch that makes it seem too good to be true, but it is true
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:54.840]  When you want to do you have red domains from other crummy registrars and you want to just now you've signed up for hover
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:56.640]  You see how good it is you see that it's true
[1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.240]  You want to get them all there you should in that way
[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.200]  Everything is in one account at hover
[1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:06.160]  But transferring from one registrar to another can be a huge hassle especially if you have a lot of domains
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:11.560]  And especially because some registrars love to make it really really hard to move your domains away
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:18.120]  They do it on purpose. It's like trying to call the cable company and get them to cancel your service because you're switching to files or something like that
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:22.280]  Hover offers valet transfer service
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:28.720]  Give them your credentials for your other registrar and they will move them over for free
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:35.480]  That's just part of being a hover user. That's how much that's how and the reason they can afford do this is because they know that once
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:38.520]  You go to hover you're never gonna leave and you're gonna be a customer for years to come
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:42.920]  So they want to help you with this they do this all the time
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:46.320]  They're their valets who do this they know all the tricks of the other companies
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:51.240]  They know all the hassles the hoops they have to jump through if they'll even update the DNS to make sure you don't have any
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:54.000]  Down time with your website or your email or something like that
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:00.480]  So go check them out go to hover.com and if you use this code is all one word
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:05.360]  Elephant Marco
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:07.360]  Yeah
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:18.280]  E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T Marco at checkout you will save 10% off your first purchase go to hover.com and use the code elephant mark
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.280]  Oh
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:23.080]  I love that. That's great. I just all my hover
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:29.680]  registrations are coming back for all the domains. I bought speculatively for launching six colors
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:35.120]  They're and they're all really it's like a reminder that I'm coming up on a year because all my
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:42.240]  Speculative I bought it almost everything for one year just like I don't know if I'm gonna use this or not and they're all starting to come back now
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:46.160]  That's saying it's time. Do you want to register this again or do you want to let it go?
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.160]  I always re-register. I've yeah, eventually. I'm gonna bankrupt myself on on
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.560]  The the renewal fees for domains that I've never used because I worry
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:00.840]  I feel like whatever the reason was I wanted to use it
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:06.040]  I feel like maybe it'll come back to me and then it'll be gone because somebody'll slurp it up
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:08.080]  And I don't think I had it and all I had to do was
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:15.080]  Yeah, just pay pay 15 bucks or 10 bucks or whatever and just let it ride for another year
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:22.680]  Yeah, I read this for domains for these novels that I wrote like five years ago that I keep meaning to rewrite and
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:30.920]  and I I kind of don't want to let them go because they're pretty great domains if I ever finished the novels and sell them or something
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.680]  I would want to have the domain. So I just keep paying it. Yeah. Yeah, you got to keep them going
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:38.480]  That could be Twitter's business models
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  If they just started charging you for you
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:48.600]  Subsequent out you get one user name for free. I would have to start paying 50 bucks a year for all my I'm looking at my Twitter account
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:50.760]  I've got like 10 accounts in my Twitter
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:57.320]  How many are you's oh, they're all used? Yeah, yeah, yeah pretty much. I've got something aren't I got a couple that aren't a couple
[1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:03.080]  Kind of gag ones, but it's all you know all these different sites and podcasts and stuff and I got I've got Twitter accounts for all of them
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:05.400]  All right, so Chrome
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:11.200]  Here's the other thing in this Safari is the new IE argument that I saw and that to me was very clear and it's like to me
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:18.040]  And I hate to broadly generalize, but I I think it's true in this case is that there's a sort of
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:22.400]  I was going to say myopic, but maybe it's a little bit more
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:29.560]  I don't know what the word is, but it's it where you only can see your own perspective and you can't see anyone else's perspective and
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:35.200]  To me a lot of these web developed not all web developers, but the web developers who jumped on this particular
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:42.320]  Storyline this Safari is the new IE all seemed to not be able to even see things from Apple's angle right
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:47.080]  And that to me is what you what you wrote, and I'll put your thing in the show notes for sure
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:49.720]  It's really the first thing that made me want to have you as my guess this week
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.200]  Because I thought your thing was short and sweet and I thought it really hit the point clearly that this is not in
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:58.640]  Stuff that's not in Apple's interest Apple is not going to be enthusiastic over
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:03.840]  Regardless of the consensus of web standards and that's exactly what people jump jumped on you for
[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:06.560]  but they don't they can't see that and
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:11.880]  The the thing that kept coming up and there's a couple people who made this point, but
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:18.160]  The gist of it is if you read between the lines what they want them to do what they seem to want Apple to do is just give up on
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  WebKit and and let
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:29.200]  Chrome and blank which is Google's fork of WebKit take over just like just like Chrome do what it wants on iOS or even you know
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:31.520]  And they would even I'm sure they would even say just you know
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:38.640]  You don't have to build it in for out of the box, but just let the version of Chrome that you download from the app store
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:44.880]  Use blank and I think they don't go this far, but I think it you know once that happened
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:50.240]  They would realize and let blank do what it wants in terms of being able to install
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  apps on the homepage on iOS
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:58.680]  Which is clearly outside the bounds of what any kind of app from the app store can do today
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:04.400]  Because Google with blank and Chrome
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:08.400]  Is moving very quickly and implementing
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.080]  prospective new web standards for things like local storage and for background
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:18.200]  updates and stuff like that very very quickly and
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:25.640]  WebKit is moving and always has it seems to be moved a little bit slowly not that they don't support stuff
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:28.960]  But that they seemed you know WebKit is more of a conservative
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  standards-based
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:40.200]  Rendering engine then blank is and maybe then Mozilla's whatever they call the the
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.320]  Rendering engine
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:47.240]  It's I they've got I got new one now, but you know just Mozilla as an organization
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:49.880]  and
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:55.760]  And there's a reason you know there's a reason why blank was forked from WebKit
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.600]  I mean Google used to be this second biggest contributor to WebKit after Apple and
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:09.240]  The reason basic basically the reason they forked and took WebKit on their own and you know name their version blink was that they
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:12.280]  Google and Apple had different priorities
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.240]  So if Apple had won if Apple followed any of this and want you know was in alignment with them
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:25.400]  All they would have had to do all along is just accept all of the Googles or not all are just most or more a lot more of
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:32.840]  Googles, you know proposed patches and additions to WebKit and they would have had exactly what these people seem to think they want WebKit to be
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:36.200]  Like and there's a reason why it had to be a fork
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:38.080]  Yeah, and the whole point here
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:41.960]  I mean it looks like an end around to me it look this is the this is the well
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:46.640]  If you don't if you don't want to do this just put Chrome on there and let and then we'll have you know
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:51.600]  It's it's basically make why can't you be Android make it like Android's then we then we can have what we want
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:58.120]  Which is problematic for a couple ways first off talk about giving one vendor the keys to the the web
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:02.800]  You do want two vendors pushing and pulling in mobile you want them pushing and pulling at each other
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.920]  You don't well unless you really are in the bag for one of them or the other of them
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:11.320]  And I'm sure we've been accused of being in the bag for Apple and we've you know
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:16.720]  essentially accused Nolan Lawson of being in the bag for Google but if you what you really want is
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:24.840]  For the standards process to be a push in a poll and have it be stuff that neither Apple or Google is entirely happy with
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:31.720]  But they can live with and that is like a middle a middle ground and that's the stuff that they're both willing to to do so that that makes sense
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.880]  As opposed to saying oh well
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:39.880]  Why don't you just give you know let it be let it be Chrome on on iOS and then we can and we can run with it
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:44.280]  Plus, let's let's also say that's a totally unrealistic thought
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:50.600]  That you would have a scenario where you go to your bank and the bank says what we've gotten app
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:54.840]  But it's a web app so what you here's what you need to do if you're on an iPhone
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:59.720]  You need to go to the app store and download Chrome and install it and then come back here
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:04.240]  And then we'll let you tap something and install it on it. No that will never happen
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:11.360]  That's just never gonna happen. It's unrealistic and I think it shows how a lot of the people who are having these conversations
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:18.320]  Are not thinking like a regular user they're thinking like a web developer or a developer or a very technical person because you know
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:24.880]  Just making Chrome available for iOS would be great for power users like I was talking to Mike Hurley about this because he uses chrome
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:29.200]  And it's like if you could use the Chrome rendering engine as a power user's like yeah, okay
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:35.040]  That would be great, but you cannot ever count on that being that that's never going to take over
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:40.720]  People are on iOS are not going to rush to adopt chrome
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:44.640]  It's just not going to happen. It would always be a minority browser
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:49.040]  That's actually why I'm kind of okay not necessarily with embedding like at mobile apps inside
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.840]  But I'd be okay if Apple said you know what yeah, okay
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:57.280]  You can run within the Chrome app itself. You can run your went rendering engine. We'll let you do that if they did that
[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:04.400]  I don't think chrome would ever be more than a tiny fraction of the web pages viewed in iOS ever because
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:06.800]  Most people are never going to download it
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:13.440]  We should point out because I know from my email that there are a lot of people out there who are rightfully
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  Confused about this issue because
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:19.360]  a lot of the email I got from readers
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:23.840]  More or less in support of Apple and against this safari is the new i.e
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:29.040]  Rote to say how can they say this? Here's the link to chrome on the app store
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:32.880]  Which is a reasonable mistake to make because chrome on the app store does exist
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:39.440]  It is popular with a fair number, but I think you're right minority of you know decided minority of iOS users
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:45.600]  But the rules of the app store are if you want to render HTML in any way
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:47.680]  You have to use the
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:54.400]  API's for web kit and there's a bunch of them now and we don't have to get into the differences between the different ways that you can embed a web kit view
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:57.040]  but basically
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:02.480]  Every browser in the app store and you know, and there's a bunch. I cab there's an iCab exists for iOS
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:04.480]  I could probably
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.280]  It's probably another one of those categories where if I haven't looked for a while
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:10.800]  But there's probably like 200 apps in the app store that are web browsers
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:14.800]  Chrome obviously would be the one that's most used and most famous
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:18.480]  But it's using the iOS system version of web kit
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:25.600]  Not because it's and it that's the rules. It has to be and so what chrome does is it does all the other things that a browser does
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:28.320]  It lets you log in with your Google credentials and have your tabs
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:32.720]  You know, you see your bookmarks. My wife uses chrome
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:38.720]  On the desktop and so she's got chrome on her. I've had because
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:42.000]  It's got her bookmarks in it, but it's still using web kit
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.240]  It's just using you know wrapped around Google's yeah Google sync stuff
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:51.440]  Right and and apps, you know, there are apps that for for in it
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:54.640]  You know, I think by definition tend to be geared towards nerdier users
[1:18:55.920 --> 1:18:58.560]  Who will do things like give you an option like I think
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:03.600]  I think tweetbot has the option where you could say when I open a link in a browser
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:10.400]  Can you know you want it to be Safari or Chrome if you if you have Chrome installed so that you can open stuff in Chrome instead of opening in Safari
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:15.920]  Of course the story is in iOS 9 all that stuff's gonna go away because everybody's gonna use the Safari view controller
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:20.720]  and that's just gonna be Safari inside the app completely and
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:26.480]  You know, I just I this is not the direction Apple is going with this stuff to say well
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:33.280]  But it is it can be confusing to talk about the differences between a rendering engine and the browser
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:36.560]  But basically it's you know what
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:43.760]  It's the Chrome is the browser what goes around the rectangle where the HTML is rendered is the browser and
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.880]  That rectangle where the content is man, you know
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:52.640]  You know the the part that's gray when you go to daring fireball. That's the rendering engine
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:20:00.160]  And this like it's a good example though this this new Safari view controller
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:06.720]  So like for example, every probably everybody out there uses some kind everybody listening to me right now is using some kind of Twitter
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:12.600]  Client on their iPhone whether it's the Twitter app or tweetbot or Twitter rific
[1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:15.760]  They all have an in browser
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:21.760]  Things so that you tap a link you don't get switched to another app you just stay right there and it renders it right there
[1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:25.480]  But if you ever notice when you do that you don't get your bookmarks
[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:30.760]  It's not connected to your tabs when you go to Safari the next time whatever that page is if you left it open
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:36.960]  It's an open because it's the rendering engine is in the Twitter app and the browser is a separate app with its own tabs and things
[1:20:37.080 --> 1:20:40.480]  So with this new thing in iOS 9 the Safari view controller
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:49.160]  Apps will be able to open in the same way. It's a lot more like mail has always been in iOS like when you send an email in
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:53.520]  App it's using your actual email account that you can figure in mail
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.120]  Well, that's what the safari view controller is going to do
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:03.280]  It's going to be a real safari view right in the app and you'll be able to see all your regular safari bookmarks and bookmarklets and
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:08.680]  Etc, etc. And then when you go back to safari safari will be aware of that
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:11.200]  tab that's open
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:14.420]  So it's and that you can see that this is one of the reasons why Apple
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:16.560]  You know
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.840]  Maybe with it and I'd say this I know some people you know who feel strongly on the you know
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.600]  We should be able to install whatever they want. We'll roll their eyes. I'm not even saying I agree with it
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:35.240]  But this is a reason why some people at Apple have clearly have resisted until now allowing users to set a system-wide
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:37.480]  third-party default web browser
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:43.480]  Because when they come up with features like this the users in tapels mind are better off
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:50.860]  Having been using Safari all along because now here's this amazing new feature and you get to use it because you've been a
[1:21:50.860 --> 1:21:55.680]  You're a safari user all right, and Google is never going to be able to provide that kind of feature
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:59.520]  So so then you're going to have even if you like let's say tweetbot
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:02.360]  or or its Twitterific
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:06.640]  Embeds this new safari view controller thing
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:14.760]  And also gives you the option to go open it and Chrome while those experiences are going to be totally different because one of them is going to open a separate
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:17.480]  Browse or you know separate app switch you out of the app
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:23.440]  You're in and the other one is going to keep you in the app that you're in but layer this safari window on top
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:28.720]  And that's weird too because now you've got this like opening in another app versus not which is just not
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.640]  Yeah, and and it cuts both ways. I mean I use a third-party
[1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:39.360]  Email client and every now and then I tap on something somewhere in Apple wants me to use mail and I think oh
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:40.760]  Well, you know, I
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:47.980]  You know what I what I end up doing is I set up all my accounts in mail anyway until it not to check mail and that way at least I can send mail from there
[1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:54.120]  because that's usually what it's trying to do but you know that's just those are the breaks because the upside is you get all this
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.920]  tight super tight integration between these things and
[1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:01.280]  You know you can't it makes a lot harder to open it up to third parties
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:06.760]  But it makes it a better user experience assuming the users are using the built-in apps which almost every user is
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:13.560]  Is that that's the other thing we lose sight of? I think there were a lot of geeks who were shocked at the statistic that more than half of
[1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:19.080]  Of iPhone users use the notes app every day or regularly anyway not every day but regularly
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:22.920]  It's like well, that's appalling. There are so many better notes apps than that. Yes
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:28.760]  But it's on the device. It's there and so people use it and people use mail and people use safari
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:30.760]  That's just and they're gonna
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:34.520]  Well, it's like when I was on to Polsky's podcast a couple weeks ago, and he was
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:36.520]  Incredulous that I use Apple Maps
[1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:41.080]  It's that statistics that I've seen show that over 70% of
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:49.480]  iOS users use Apple Maps and Maps is maybe it's clearly the maybe the one where they'd be the most third party users
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:53.080]  You know especially around the world where Apple Maps is nowhere near as consistent
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:57.720]  As Google Maps is that's one where you know, you could really make the argument where I
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:02.360]  Would make the argument that for me in my use. It's as good as Google Maps for
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:10.280]  For my use almost every time, you know the only time the only thing I've used Google Maps for in the last two years is transit in New York City
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:12.920]  and hopefully you know
[1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:16.040]  You know once I switched to iOS 9. I won't even need to do that anymore
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:21.960]  But I totally understand and every time I say this I get email from somebody in another country and they had shown me like what their
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:27.400]  Neighborhood looks like in the two and Google Maps looks like Google Maps and Apple Maps, you know
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:32.840]  That's like, you know, the name of the town living and that's it. So I understand obviously they don't do it
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.640]  But to fact that it's you know somewhere around 70% and it's a decided advantage
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:41.560]  It just shows how powerful being the built-in app is and let alone how you know
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:46.920]  how comparable Safari and Chrome are or mail and and spark or
[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:53.560]  You know, what's the third party email that you use? I'm using I'm using mailbox on my iPad and I'm using yeah
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:57.480]  The riddle was spark on my iPhone right now. Yeah boy. That's a good man
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:01.320]  Holy cow. That's got me thinking about switching. Yeah. Really does. Yeah, I mean
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:07.080]  I'm gonna go back to mail for iOS 9 just to see you know how how it's changed, but that's a
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:14.040]  That's a it's a really good app. This is I feel like that was the one of the subtext of the of the latest Apple event too
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.600]  When they rolled out Apple music. I think that was a subtext was and
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:24.920]  Hey, did you hear about how all our default apps are really great and used even even when there's tough competition?
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:29.640]  These get used more than everything else. Well, guess what streaming services built into a built-in app now
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:33.800]  Yeah, yeah, that was definitely
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:39.800]  Part of the message just like these built-in that's powerful the built-in apps doesn't mean Apple music's gonna
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:44.600]  Gonna take over the world or anything, but it is awfully powerful that it's integrated and
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  And it's on every device that's and I read a piece today about podcast and about how there was some survey that said that
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:58.920]  Not only because there's a built-in podcast app not only are most podcasts listened to on iOS devices and not Android
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:05.640]  But that most podcasts on iOS are listened to through the built-in podcast app because again
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:09.880]  It's built-in that's hard to compete with it's not like Marco doesn't have a good business
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:12.760]  on with overcast, but
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:18.680]  You know, that's among people who think to look for something more in the app store and then find it and then buy it
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:26.520]  Versus like oh podcast. There's a search for podcast. There it is. That's where all the podcasts are and it's just that's being the platform owner
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.840]  The app store is vibrant and that's great, but Apple knows that
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.200]  some stuff needs to be
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:41.320]  In the platform at least a basic version of it has to be in the platform because the platform needs to be rich like that and
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:46.520]  And they and that's why they do that's why they improve notes and you know, that's why
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:49.640]  Maps is so successful
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:56.280]  This just in from from the home office in Lincoln, Nebraska
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.640]  There is a chance. I cannot check it. I will I could check it, but I'm not going to while I'm recording
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:05.080]  There's a chance that I botched the code for
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:11.880]  Harries could be that it's just talk show without the the
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.280]  So anybody out there who's buying some shaving stuff if you try the code
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:21.160]  We don't have we maybe I'll edit this maybe not maybe this will be a little a little mid episode surprise
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:24.760]  You just stay to there's a little mini read for a good friends at Harries
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:28.600]  If you try the code the talk show and you don't get any money off your order
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:32.840]  Try the code talk show without the the and and one of those two
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:35.480]  I guarantee you will save you some bucks. So now it's like again. Yeah
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:38.360]  It's like a coin flip
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:44.040]  And while I'm talking about sponsors that allow me to take a moment here and thank our next one and it's another
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:47.800]  old-time friend of the show good people at fracture
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:55.400]  It's really sad that all of our photos from recent years so many of them are
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:58.360]  trapped only on
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:05.320]  digital devices or maybe they're on an Instagram feed and you really only look at them on these devices temporarily
[1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:12.200]  Fracture is a modern way to break your photos out of the digital world the best ones
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:18.200]  The ones you really want to save the ones you really want to see all the time and get them printed on a piece of analog
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:21.720]  Media and that you can hang on your wall you can prop up on your desk
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:29.320]  Here's what they do fracture. They print your photos directly on pure glass real glass comes with a foam back
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:33.960]  That's ready to mount right out of the box the little one that comes with everything you need to hang on on the wall
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:38.280]  Comes with a nice little screw and stuff like that the bigger ones that you can prop up have you know
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:41.480]  The casing is as interesting as the printing technology that they use
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:47.240]  But it is that it just takes your photos. What's less face it are all digital these days
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:49.560]  I mean who shouldn't film anymore if you are you know
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:54.680]  You're already way ahead of the game in terms of having prints because you have to have a physical print to look at it
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:03.960]  It I don't know there's something about a photo that is printed on a piece of analog medium that has to me a more
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:09.720]  Emotional appeal and I'll give you an example. Here's an example. My wife Amy at the the live talk show
[1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:13.240]  The couple weeks ago when I had
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:19.400]  Bill she'll she'll her fill she'll her fill she'll her. That's right. I mean technology executive
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:22.040]  Yeah, so
[1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:27.880]  You know that was a special night and she was backstage and she like poked her iPhone through the curtain a little bit and
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:32.360]  Took an amazing photo truly truly amazing photo of
[1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:35.080]  me sitting alongside Phil
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:40.240]  Sort of we were front lit in reality, but from her perspective backstage. We were back lit
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:43.440]  By these lights in front of us
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:48.240]  Which almost have like in the the way that they showed up under picture almost like a science fiction field
[1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:54.320]  It almost looked like we were sitting in front of like a screening of a science fiction movie with two stars in front of us with these two
[1:29:54.800 --> 1:29:56.800]  Spotlights
[1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:59.200]  Fantastic picture. She posted it to Instagram
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:06.560]  And I thought it was great. I told her it was great and I you know gave it a little heart on Instagram and there goes
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:09.280]  But my friends at fracture
[1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:12.400]  I this is I was away on vacation. This is true story
[1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:14.640]  Got back last night
[1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:19.760]  One of the things that we we where we had the mail held till today and it actually worked which is crazy
[1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:22.880]  I don't know about people in other countries, but it
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:27.120]  Maybe in other cities, but in Philadelphia. It often doesn't work when you tell them about you
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:31.760]  Well, we got a whole pile of mail today including a bunch of packages and one of them was from fracture
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:33.440]  And it was for me and I thought that's weird
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:38.160]  I don't remember I did not order anything from fracture recently and when you do order from fracture this stuff comes right away
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:43.040]  Well, I opened it up and here it was. It's a little square picture. They took it out of Amy's Instagram feed
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:45.760]  That picture printed on
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:51.760]  Glass for me and it just as I didn't know what it was. I opened it up
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:57.920]  And I saw it and I was just like wow and it just like was like a little jolt to my heart and I thought wow
[1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:01.440]  That's great. So anyway, my thanks to Instagram for not Instagram to fracture
[1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:04.160]  for the gift but
[1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:10.720]  To all of you do that with your favorite pictures go through your Instagram and pick a couple of your favorites and send them to
[1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:12.720]  fracture and get them printed out and
[1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:15.520]  You really are going to appreciate it. It looks so great
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:23.600]  Let's see if I can get the code right because if you do get it right you're going to get 15% off your first fracture order
[1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:30.320]  And the code for my show is I don't really have it here. And drum roll Paul drum roll
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:35.920]  To do I'm going to guess it's a daring fireball
[1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:41.920]  And we'll see if that's right, but my thanks to them go to fracture me calm get something printed out
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:46.320]  Do it and and use that code and you'll save some money and you'll have something beautiful to hang on a wall
[1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:48.800]  I've got like a six of them here
[1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:51.200]  You know what you could use use this use the yet
[1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:54.320]  I know that this here's the code that they use because they sponsored that live show
[1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:58.560]  The code that they used for that one was
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:04.000]  You know what it's funny. I have it right here in front of me, but I can't see oh, it's because I don't have the
[1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:08.400]  Safari status bar showing it's
[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:17.200]  Wwdc use that code wwdc and then they'll think you're coming from the Phil Schiller episode
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:23.840]  So either way you'll get the money
[1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:31.280]  So the other thing that we that I missed while I was away on vacation was this whole thing that sort of blew up
[1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:36.960]  And I did write about this while you know because you can't you know you did we're never really on vacation. I'm discovering that
[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:42.960]  Yeah, it is it's so curious how that's going for you now that you're a year in
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:48.560]  It probably was different when you were at a publication that had a real staff that could keep everything
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:52.400]  Yeah, you can say on one vacation you take care of it for me and then you go on vacation
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:53.520]  Everybody helps each other out
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:57.680]  But when you know, it's I do have Dan Moore and writing for me a couple of days a week for six colors
[1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:59.200]  So I was able to say sort of like Dan
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:03.440]  This is the day that we're driving in the car for eight hours. Can you write on that day and
[1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:09.200]  Also, it's a shifting gears from my brain works as thinking of like Macworld. We'd post 10 stories a day
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:10.880]  and
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:15.600]  I actually look to you and Jim and Federico and I and you know
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:16.960]  There's no there are no rules for this
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:20.320]  And I want to do right by my sponsors and not like a band in the site for a week
[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:26.640]  But at the same time I have to train myself out of the idea that if I don't have like five new items a day or even
[1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:29.840]  You know if a day goes by and I all I have is a link or two
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:33.200]  It's fine. And I've learned that lesson that it's not
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:39.040]  You know, I'm not running a comprehensive news site that is going to have to feed the beast every day
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:42.560]  And I you know, I can't I just I can't I'm one person
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:48.640]  The sponsorship model to me it works both ways where if you're writing more and you're having a busy day
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:51.760]  You're getting a bunch of things and more you're getting a lot more page views per day
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:55.960]  And people might see the the sponsor link in the sidebar if you have it there or something like that
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:01.120]  But on the other hand with the idea that you post like a little thank you to the sponsor
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:05.040]  That that idea then and the times when you're slower
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:11.840]  Or at least this is the way I see it the times when I'm slower and I'm not posting as much the that post thanking the sponsor
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:14.320]  Stays closer to the top stronger
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:18.320]  And it's you know, I don't know which one is better
[1:34:18.320 --> 1:34:22.160]  I don't know if it's better to be the sponsor on a busy week a daring fireball or a slower
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:22.960]  We get daring fireball
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:28.240]  But I think there's a very simple argument to be made that there are pros and cons to both of them
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:32.960]  You know one of them buries your thing sooner and the other one you have more
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.400]  Pages being loaded during the week. So you know, I've never once gotten a complaint about that. I mean every once in a while
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:40.400]  Sometimes August is a little slower to sell
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:48.160]  This year at last year August did not sell for me. It was like I think like twice during the month of August
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:52.640]  I had to post like a hey next week is still available getting touched blah blah blah sort of
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:56.160]  You know really sort of down to the last day
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.920]  This year August sold out for me already in July, so I don't know but it's you know
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:08.720]  So August is a weird month though for advert. I mean infamously and all forms of media TV print. I mean it's always slow
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:16.000]  But other than the month of August. I've never had complaints about that. Yeah, it's I mean sometimes people will say to me like hey
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.640]  Is Chris how's Christmas like I was thinking about sponsoring your site?
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.640]  I see that Christmas is open and
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:24.320]  My answer has always been and I've never once had a complaint about it
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:29.120]  It is slower because people aren't at work and they're not get you're not getting those page views of
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:32.800]  I'm bored at work or I've just sat down and I you know just want to see what's going on
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:34.800]  But on the other hand
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:40.880]  I was like I think that what happens is a lot of people are at family events and they get bored and they should go to their iPhones
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.840]  So it's it's actually not that slow a week. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's a yeah
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:49.520]  I just kind of feel like I'm still trying to get into the rhythm of like what's the heartbeat of the site?
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:51.520]  I don't want the site to seem like it's abandoned right
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:54.640]  So I want to keep a little bit of a rhythm there also
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:36:00.080]  Yeah, I mean I just I want to send a message that the site is here and it's gonna have stuff on it
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:03.840]  And I'm still learning. I'm still learning, but it is it is definitely a change
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:09.520]  And it's not like I totally ignored work when I want on vacation, you know, I would be responsible and I would check in
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:16.160]  And I would occasionally see that news was breaking and write something. I mean I wrote a I actually wanted an award for a thing
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:18.160]  I wrote at my in-laws
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:20.320]  dining room table on an iPad
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.560]  And it actually won an award. I'm like that is I will always look at that
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:28.960]  I've got the little plaque here somewhere and and it was like for online commentary
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:35.600]  Some journalism group and I I look at it and I think well I pat at the dining room table in Irvine, but
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:38.480]  but it's different
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.560]  Here because you know
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:44.000]  Something happens like that no one lost a thing and I'm like well, I can't
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:47.920]  Pass this to somebody if I want to say something about it
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:51.760]  I need to say something about it. So it's just a little bit different not having that not having that net anymore
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.040]  But I'm getting I'm getting there. I'm getting used to it
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:36:58.880]  I've I know that it was August
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:05.200]  I don't remember the exact date, but I was actually at the Jersey Shore with my folks and you know Amy and Jonas
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:09.280]  Heading out to dinner
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:17.040]  So it was probably you know around five of six o'clock in the evening when the news broke that Steve Jobs
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:19.040]  Was stepping down his seat right
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:23.360]  And
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:28.400]  somebody texted me and it was like you know it was one of those things
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:33.120]  I bet everybody a lot of people when they first you know that was the sort of thing you texted other people about right
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:38.320]  You heard that and you think it's somebody and you think I got a text somebody and I bet a lot of people who get you know
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:40.960]  Saw the news the same way. We're like this has got to be a mistake
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:45.280]  Just you know and then your second thought is and no actually it makes a lot of sense
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:52.640]  You know, and then you'd kind of be dreading it, but like I said, I you know told my family and then you know my parents are a little a little bit not
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:56.800]  I
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  They more or less understand what I do
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:07.520]  But they understand it well enough that my you know when I said that they everybody every nobody gave me a single moment of grief of
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:14.560]  Okay, we understand you're not coming to dinner, you know, I had to drop everything and think about what I wanted to do and right um
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:20.080]  You know, that's one of the few times I can think of bread did that but yes, you are on call and it makes me worry
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:22.080]  It does make me worry one thing. I don't do is
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:23.920]  I almost
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:28.400]  And I if I do I have tremendous anxiety even if it's just for a couple of hours
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:34.560]  I don't even like flying without Wi-Fi as I do kind of feel like I need to be online all the time just in case something like that
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:39.920]  I got to say I'm not as worried about it as I was and this is only because
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:45.120]  For years every single thing I did was in the frame of
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:53.360]  What if Steve Jobs dies like even when he wasn't that sick and it was just like what if Steve Jobs dies in a plane crash or or something like that?
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.640]  I had that like what could be so huge. What is the huge thing?
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:06.240]  And after he died I realized for a while I would I would ask myself what if Steve Jobs died. Oh, okay
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:14.320]  And I just for whatever reason that was like I always felt like that was the the number one story that would that they would ever be
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:20.720]  Where you'd have to set up all the alarms and I mean it would still be true if if something, you know
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:28.640]  Hadn't for bid happen to major Apple executive or they're disasters that could happen, but whatever it was like I think I have a kind of a
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:32.560]  Complex about that about Steve Jobs and with him gone
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:35.120]  That little
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:37.720]  Neurotic part of my brain got like filed away
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:41.120]  Kind of disconnected and so it's not quite as bad now, but you're right
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.040]  I mean this is that this is part of this business
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.080]  It's again less true now that I feel like I don't I'm not in the breaking news business
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:53.440]  I may be in the breaking analysis business, but I'm not in the breaking news business where at Macworld like literally
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.120]  If something even like remotely big broke
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:00.640]  I would just be in the CMS making a new article saying headline
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.200]  Write a paragraph
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:09.520]  You know more more information to come post like just to get it out there because we were really in that game
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.680]  And I'm not in that game so much now, but it's true. You also, you know
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:17.600]  I do think this is breaking analysis in a way, you know
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:24.400]  You don't want to be left with not saying anything about something that huge that happens that matters to the people who read your site or my site
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:26.400]  they you need to you need to be
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:32.400]  Engaged and and I at least have data and to help out on on some accounts, but you know
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:36.000]  Derifiable as you so it needs to be you or it's nobody
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:41.120]  Yeah, you know you got to get me into something Jimmy the internet. Well
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.480]  Yeah, it's like for a while it I don't really grat it
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.000]  But I wonder if I ever if I've painted myself in a corner where it's like
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:52.960]  You know, it's like Trump with his haircut
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.880]  I mean it's like everybody's giving him grief about it, but he's like stuck with a long break
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:00.240]  Right can't count. Yeah, you can't really give in
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:06.000]  You know, I mean, and it's like I feel like the every single word ever written on Daring Fireball was by me
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:11.920]  You know, it's a nice streak, but in a turn, you know turns into a Cal Ripkin thing at some point
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:16.000]  Maybe I should take a month off and not do anything, but you know
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.520]  I really don't want the site to go dark from right, but then I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.160]  I guess poster one you're like David Letterman no guest hosts
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:27.200]  Right, but I've but I even said to you when I did when I did
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:33.680]  Your show to talk about Letterman that I actually feel like that hurt him in the long run where I feel like
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.000]  There was a stretch a couple of years ago where it felt like maybe he was a little burned out
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.520]  It felt like he you know
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:47.040]  And I don't think that ever happened to Carson because Carson as the years went on took off more and more time
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:51.760]  And one of the ways that he just you know was able to take off time was that instead of just showing reruns
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:58.360]  They had guest hosts. Yeah, he was working three days a week and you know for for 30 40 40 40 year man
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:41:59.720]  What a deal?
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:08.640]  And and well, so only doing this for 10 months now. I mean, I I if look if you if you set because you you did sort of set this model
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:11.200]  But some of the people who followed you like Jim
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:16.120]  I'd like Federico so the loop and and Mac stories
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.520]  they they
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:26.160]  changed the equation a little bit and you know Jim has like Dave Mark and he's had Sean King and he had Peter Cohen for a while
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:28.560]  like supplementing what Jim does and
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  and
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:34.520]  and in fact, I think Dave Mark post more stuff to the loop than Jim does at this point and then Federico
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:37.800]  Although he is the primary author of of Mac stories
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:41.560]  He's got a bunch of like I saw a prep-turp straw on there the other day
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:43.560]  And I mean he's got some people who
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:49.840]  Contribute and that I felt like that was enough that that sort of freed me. I was like oh and and with so many people
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:52.880]  I used to work with losing their job simultaneously I
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:58.080]  said to Dan you know in lieu of him getting a full-time job somewhere
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:04.720]  Would you like to to write some stuff with me and you know in the in the first days after Mac world had the big layoffs like Dan
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.160]  Freaks wrote a thing and you know a few people wrote things for six dollars
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:13.200]  But with Dan it was a good opportunity because he wanted to keep his hand in in in the game
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:16.760]  He didn't want to vanish from writing about Apple because that's his profession
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:19.640]  But he wasn't working somewhere full-time
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:24.280]  So, you know, I think it was beneficial for him. It was really beneficial for me
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:30.640]  But I would I have done that if if I hadn't seen some other people who who said no
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:35.600]  It's not just me it's sort of me and some of my friends who are doing this and I might not have and
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:41.600]  It's just a different feel it's just a different feel I can't I mean I could see it wasn't one of the
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:44.920]  I don't know whether it was caught key or was it Andy Bayo
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:50.520]  I remember somebody who was like a big link blogger did this at one point where they they basically said I'm handing the
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:57.080]  The reins no cocky's cocky's done that for years. It's cocky has but when cocky does it as he gives it away for the whole week
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:58.040]  Right exactly
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.920]  You know who I actually I believe the first person who ever did it for him
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:06.000]  I think this is a little bit of inside the world of personal
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:11.640]  Personal slash professional blogging whatever you call like this thing that we do
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:14.320]  trivia is I
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:21.480]  Think his first guest post or was Adam Lisa Gore. Wow. It was the first time. I'd I'd never even heard of him before
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:24.400]  and
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:28.640]  We could look this if it wasn't the first he was one of the first and it was before Twitter
[1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:32.560]  And so it was before anybody who's heard of Adam Lisa Gore by Twitter had heard of them
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:37.200]  And it was certainly before anybody who's heard of Adam Lisa Gore before sandwich video
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:42.960]  And I went back and read it and it was fan of course fantastic
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:48.120]  It was like holy hell this guy's amazing, but cocky's done that for years and he picks you know very
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.200]  He he picks people though a lot of times and they're good
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:56.200]  But he he and he's this is part of Jason cocky being Jason cocky and being very talented
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:02.120]  He picks people who bring like a very different right voice to the site like people who are not cocky like
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:06.200]  Whatever that means to be cocky like cuz I think that's sort of hard to define
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:11.120]  Yeah, I forget all the guy he's had a bunch of guest posters over the year when I was in Arizona
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:17.080]  I'm visiting my mom. We were watching like a baseball game and a sandwich video came on and I said hey
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:19.080]  I know that guy and
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.160]  My mom's like oh really how and I told her like oh well, it's Adam. Let's go and just this and just that and
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:30.480]  And now she sends me emails saying hey, I saw I saw that friend of yours again on a different ad
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:36.600]  It's like okay. I don't need updates about the sandwich video empire, but it's cute. It's sweet
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:40.360]  Hey Amy and I were at a bar the first time that we
[1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:46.520]  Saw a sandwich on real TV. It was like barred ESPN was on the TV beyond the bar
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:49.360]  It's a real moment when you see him on real TV instead of the internet
[1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:52.640]  Like we posted things in the internet whatever, but he's on TV
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:54.920]  Right we couldn't get the words out of him out
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.320]  I forget which one of the two of us noticed first
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:03.560]  But we both were just like not even saying anything just pointing at the TV and then we like like we're like we know that guy
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:07.800]  We know him and everybody, you know, we look like two mad people, but we were like well
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:10.080]  If you're traveling you see ads you don't see other places
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:13.520]  And this is what this was is whatever he was selling him this ad in Phoenix
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:16.800]  Was not a product that is available in my area
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:23.080]  And so I was just like I've never seen this before, but there he is he's selling something what came to mind to me was
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:29.000]  Was the scene in good fellas when the crew finds out that Tommy got made
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:34.200]  Oh, yeah, because it's like they're never gonna get made because it's just a bit
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:40.480]  Right, so he's the only one who could get made and they're in tight with him
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:45.400]  So this is the best they're ever gonna do is have a made guy and we're never gonna be on TV
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:48.800]  I don't want to be on TV commercials. No way. I mean, it's not I'm not even, you know
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:53.560]  It's not gonna happen right so the closest we're gonna get to being on TV is having sandwich beyond TV
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:56.520]  So we were like all the cows is amazing
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:02.520]  Yeah, exactly exactly and and so hopefully it's the same thing as when people when when your
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:08.320]  Relatives don't understand what you do writing on the internet. This was always the case. I said this right after
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:15.520]  I think when we talked about about Macworld and all that at the end of last year that one of the things that I took great pride in
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:24.560]  Was so many people we published in the magazine and they could like take a piece of paper of a magazine with their picture and their name on it and say look mom
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:31.000]  Look grandpa. I wrote a thing in a magazine and it was like validation in a way because it was
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:37.200]  understandable and and not something that people you knew got to do unless they were very special and
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:43.200]  I feel like watching Adam on a TV is a little bit like that too. It's like wow
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:47.380]  That's the real television. This isn't this internet crap that we do. That's the real TV
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:52.480]  Exactly, I just hope that Adam doesn't come to the same end that Tommy did
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:54.480]  You mean oh
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:03.480]  Spoiler. Yes, sorry. I'll tell you what anybody out there hasn't watched good. Good. What is wrong with you
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:08.600]  Go do that immediately and then go listen to Syracuse's four and a half hour discussion of
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:15.360]  Which I don't I'm not I'm laughing just because it's it's good not because it's oh no
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:19.080]  I have a I'm hoping I do this before somebody else gets it
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:22.280]  I want to do it in comparable with Syracuse. I'm back the godfather
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:28.880]  Man, you got it. That'd be like if if good fellas was I know 84 hours
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:31.800]  Godfather
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:38.040]  Someday, I'll do that because I love that we we you know in comparable is so so much about like sci-fi stuff more
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:39.640]  more than
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:46.560]  Anything else, but I do want to do more classic movie stuff and that's one that I mean I would love to do good fellas
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:52.200]  But I feel like it's kind of it's been done. I would not want to just rehash that same conversation that John and Dan had
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:55.280]  That's one of my favorite movies of all time, but godfather
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:57.840]  I'd love to I'd love to do that too because that's a classic too
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:03.480]  All right, I have one more break to make and I got to talk to you about back place
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:07.320]  I feel like this show is loaded up with the all stars of
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:14.480]  Taring Fireball and and the talk show sponsorships. These guys have been with this show for as long as I've been doing it
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:16.080]  a
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:22.200]  Fantastic app and service. It's online unlimited unfrautled backup for your Mac
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.600]  You go to backblaze.com you download their free
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:30.880]  Install it on your Mac puts a thing in your
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.280]  System preferences. It's written by former Apple engineers. This is seriously good
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:45.080]  Good software on the Mac. There's PC version two runs native. This isn't some kind of cross-platform
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:49.120]  You know crap like we were talking about before. This is really good stuff
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:52.000]  You install it
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.600]  What happens then?
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:59.000]  Everything on your Mac starts getting backed up to your backblaze account online in the cloud
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:04.200]  They have over one hundred fifty petabytes of data backed up doesn't matter how much stuff you've got
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:10.880]  Didn't matter if you got a terabyte of stuff or got four terabytes of stuff and you got an external hard drive in addition to your internal hard drug
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:15.400]  It all gets backed up now. Is there any kind of magic that makes it all get backed up immediately?
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:18.800]  No, definitely not so the more stuff you have the longer it's going to take to do it
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:25.160]  You get a 30 day free trial should be long enough with any kind of modern internet connection to get the whole thing backed up by the end of the free trial
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.320]  After that what happens well of course everything gets backed up incrementally after that
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:34.640]  So one file changes that file gets backed up
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:38.480]  You've got nice controls. You can pause it. You can throttle the
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:43.720]  The amount of bandwidth that we'll use if you need to do something else like record a podcast and you're just signed up
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:50.320]  But seriously once you have it installed you never notice it just runs it's no hassle never
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:56.360]  It just does exactly what you think it should do which is just silently back up everything to the cloud
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:01.640]  How can you access it after that you could do it almost any way you could imagine?
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:08.440]  You just need one file log in find that file to all organize the same way the hierarchy is on your computer
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  Find the file download it right there
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:15.400]  25% of all restores from back-place customers are just one file
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:18.760]  That's it. You can and you could do that from your iOS device. They have an app
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:25.520]  You can log in with that get a file from your iOS device when you're on vacation or traveling or whatever and email it to someone
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:31.120]  So it's a great way. It's not even just backup. It's a great way to just remotely access the stuff on your Mac from anywhere
[1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:34.840]  Let's say catastrophe hits your hard drive
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:41.520]  Shits the bed all you have to do is you could just get everything if you want to download it
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:42.600]  You can download it's gonna take well
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:50.040]  What you could do is just buy it on a USB hard drive. They sell the USB hard drives at cost and then they'll you could get a FedEx to you
[1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:53.600]  The next day here comes a USB hard drive has everything that you need it on it
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:56.760]  Really really great stuff
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:04.000]  It really isn't just for disasters, but having an offline backup like back blades out of your house somewhere
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:07.720]  Just in case some kind of catastrophe doesn't just hit your computer, but hit your home
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:16.640]  Just cannot give you I can't tell you the peace of mind that you have when you know that everything on your computer is backed up somewhere outside your house
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:25.720]  No add-ons no gimmicks no additional charges no upsells or anything like that you just pay five bucks per computer per month
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:27.040]  for unlimited
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:35.360]  Unthrottle backup five bucks a month and you will sleep like a baby knowing that your stuff is backed up so you get no no credit card required
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:37.360]  just go to backplays.com and
[1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:43.320]  The code is daring fireball. I think you go to backplays.com slash daring fireball
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:46.140]  And then I'll know you came from here right away right from the beginning
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:51.600]  So my thanks to backplays go sign up at backplays.com slash daring fireball
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:57.240]  So the last thing I want to talk about Jason is this thing that came up. I don't even know how it started
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:01.240]  But everybody it's like this month has been talking about how
[1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:06.480]  advertising on the web has made things slow and it's
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:12.720]  It's it's this weird catch 22 that a lot of sites have gotten caught in
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:17.480]  I wrote about I'm more on daring fireball
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:25.040]  Just as an example of a site that I love I linked to all the time. I know a whole bunch of the people who work there
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:27.040]  I maybe I know everybody who works there a
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:32.560]  Great I of the staff sites that cover I don't I that was the phrase I use I couldn't think of a better term
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:39.200]  But of the sites with like a payroll and a staff that that cover Apple I think right now they're they're the top of the heap
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:46.880]  Really do like them and I really think that they they love their readers and want to do right by them and they have a website
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:54.040]  That is really heavy with trackers add trackers and with a lot of video content
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:59.440]  It caught you know four or five megabytes to download just a regular article five six seven hundred words
[1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:01.880]  and
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:06.000]  It's more than just the time it takes to download that if you're on a slow connection or
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:11.800]  Something like that. It's the fact that they the some of these trackers run execute for over a minute
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:18.720]  Doing who knows what the hell they do on JavaScript, which hurts the performance of of your battery, you know, and
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:26.640]  Three four literally. I mean, I don't even think I'm exaggerating three or four hundred HTP calls for separate resources on the page
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:33.200]  And it sounds like well, they should just switch to different ads, but it's really is sort of a catch 22 where
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:40.200]  That's the way for the sort of revenue you need to run a site with a staff like that the only way to do it is through
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:44.960]  Advert, you know, these existing ad networks and the way the ad networks work is exactly what you see
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:46.960]  I'm more is not
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:48.960]  outside the bounds of
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:52.520]  These sort of sites in fact. I would I would guess I haven't done this
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.080]  But I would guess that if you went around and went to all the sites that have you know your mashables and
[1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:00.160]  The verge and in gadget
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:04.840]  I was hoping somebody would weigh the macro pages because they've just got to be enormous
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:10.840]  They they have to be Macworld and IGG. I mean, and you know this. I mean, I can't let it go
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:15.960]  But I mean Macworld had a feature, you know, it still does I guess we're an auto place video on page loads
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:21.800]  Which I'm guessing wasn't popular with the staff. No, I mean, that was the number one thing that the staff
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:25.880]  I think I think it's still not popular with the with the remaining staff
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:30.200]  But certainly everybody who was there back, you know a year ago. That was the number one
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:36.520]  I thought to get that turned off for like six months and I finally got it turned off and then they replaced the guy who was in charge of
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:39.040]  The company with a new guy who immediately turned it back on
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.360]  Yeah
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:49.360]  It's you know it and bet Thompson I would guess among anybody, you know who doesn't have a site that does this
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:55.960]  So he's sure no it been Thompson it's for strategicity. He's to techery. Yeah, he got really changed the pronunciation. It's just your techery now
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:56:03.360]  Well, I'm well, I'm gonna stick with strategic. You could do that. Ben Thompson of strategicery has made the case
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:04.360]  You know
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.480]  eloquently, you know that this is the business dynamics it didn't know this is the
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:16.360]  The corner that the industry has painted itself into this is the only source of advertising that can generate the sort of revenue that they need to do this
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:22.080]  How did we get here right it's it's yeah
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.840]  It's it's you know, we
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:29.760]  So my boss for a long time at IDG for like most of the last couple of years
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:36.320]  I was there IDG has an ad network, so he and he was in charge of it and then he was put in charge of our company our consumer group
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:43.360]  Good guy. I really like him actually, but you know ad network. I learned about ad networks and and about
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:48.680]  programmatic by and all of these things like in the back in the day
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:53.360]  And I can't believe I'm saying this about the web, but back in the day. It was all like really I
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  I
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:56.360]  Mean web advertising has never been
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:00.360]  Good I would say or rarely been good
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:02.920]  On the mainstream it was all
[1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:06.520]  It's all click-driven, you know
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:11.960]  Everybody wants to see return on investment based on clicks or based on purchases, which I actually think is is baloney
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:17.920]  Yeah, that that one of the most valuable kinds of advertising is branding
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:24.200]  Advertising brand advertising, which is another old boss of mine used to say a sales guy used to say you got to be
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:29.520]  You've got to be known to be considered and considered to be bought and the way you get
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:35.760]  known is through brand advertising you see you yours then perceived as being a legitimate player and
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:41.280]  That's powerful, but it might not lead to a direct sale, right?
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:43.120]  It's just to get you in the ballgame
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:52.240]  It's like saying you know if you sell accounting software and you blank it the you know the internet with and podcast and websites and all that with accounting software
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:56.360]  Are people going to say oh yeah my company needs accounting software right now?
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:00.960]  I'm gonna click through or is it more going to be like that name is going to stick in them and a year later
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:02.960]  They're going to think oh yeah
[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:06.520]  They this is a piece of accounting software. Maybe I should look into that
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:13.080]  Maybe we should buy that but that's not measurable by the web and the web has really pushed because TV with TV and magazines and news
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:19.400]  Papers you couldn't measure direct you can maybe do like a specific phone number or PO box or something like that and try to measure
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:24.400]  The volume, but really was very hard to do and the web made it
[1:58:25.480 --> 1:58:27.240]  Made it much more
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:31.600]  Technically possible to do that sort of thing and it kind of drove everything to this crappy
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:37.920]  Instant response kind of advertising and and then this takes it even with the ad network should take it even further where
[1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:45.000]  It's no longer the heyday of the web where there were still like custom sale staffs with very specific like
[1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:49.640]  Relationships with buyers who understood what your content was about and understood
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:53.200]  You know what your audience was and now it's very much like you know
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:56.960]  Everybody's in a pool they they say who their demographics are page
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:01.760]  You know page views not even like sites, but page views in certain parts of certain sites are
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:10.360]  whole-sailed and run through us, you know through a program that's just buying a certain number of pages of a certain kind on a stock
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:16.040]  Exchange essentially and it's like if you didn't think web advertising would have had enough five years ago
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  It is way worse now
[1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:23.440]  Ben Thompson had a great piece. I just made a note to put it in the show notes. So knock on wood
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:26.160]  It'll be in the show notes
[1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:28.160]  Talk to craft shoot with me
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:32.800]  He had a great post explaining how the modern advertising
[1:59:33.320 --> 1:59:40.040]  Networks work. Yeah, it gave me the shivers because I learned that in the last couple years. Yeah, and in terms of
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:42.080]  I've got a whole bunch of places
[1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:45.960]  I haven't had the time because I've been away, but I probably will
[1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:49.400]  I don't know about it if it'll happen before this podcast airs
[1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:53.360]  But sometime within the next few days. I'm gonna write about it and linked all these things
[1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:58.920]  But there's a piece at Digiday which is an I think a new site and if it's not
[1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:05.280]  I have never heard of it before but it's an interesting article by Ricardo built in about how the Washington post cut
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:08.480]  It's page load time by 85% in two years
[2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:16.080]  That two years ago the Washington post calm typical article page took eight seconds for the page to load
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:21.720]  And that that was measuring like where it was like usable by the you know not necessarily completely done
[2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:29.360]  But at the point where it looked done to the typical reader and they've in two years by making it like a top priority
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:37.360]  In the whole development staff that they they've got it down to 1.7 seconds, which is an 85% performance increase
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:43.680]  And they mentioned this this is in the article, which is interesting that this is the guy
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:51.040]  He's the his name is Gregory Frank chick hope I'm pronouncing that right his name is spelled a little on usually
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:55.240]  But he's his title is chief architect at the Washington post and one of the quotes from him
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:04.160]  Is that in commerce this a quote the one second load time is the one that everyone wants to hit in media
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:08.360]  It doesn't seem as if there was ever that much emphasis on performance said frantic
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:12.000]  And that's in other words that we were writing like a commerce of website on the web
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:16.600]  There was this mantra it got to be one second or less or we're gonna lose this person
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:24.400]  You know like God forbid somebody like go so far is to put their the product in their cart and then they go to check out and
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:28.040]  They're waiting and waiting and waiting and they're like ask who it and they close well
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:33.680]  You know that would drive that team and rightfully so if they would say we got to get that in one second so that we don't lose them and
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:40.000]  That media sites didn't have that that drive maybe they would say well be nice if if the paid's loaded in a second
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:45.560]  But yeah, you know two seconds isn't bad and then two seconds isn't bad three seconds isn't bad
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:50.640]  And if three seconds is bad, I'm sure they'll not gonna they're not gonna leave us if it gets to four seconds on average
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:55.960]  And then all of a sudden you end up with a washington post taking eight seconds to load which is a long time
[2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:59.080]  It is I I mean and you know
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:02.960]  We can make all the arguments we want about how amazing
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:09.440]  You know how amazed with Thomas Jefferson be if you could show him a web where every page loaded in eight seconds
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:10.680]  Well, yeah, he'd be blown away
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:14.440]  But guess what it you know I wouldn't take him long before he'd be saying hey
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  Can't we get these to load a little quicker
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:25.680]  It eventually no matter who you are where your perspective is eight seconds is too long, but the media backed themselves into that corner anyway this article with the post
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.040]  concludes there's a lot that
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:35.120]  Publishers don't have complete control over however, and it's basically ads and
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:40.440]  Here's the quote from the guy frantic we have very little control over ads that load later slowly
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:46.360]  But we wanted to make sure the core user experience was as solid as possible. That's what we have control over said frantic and
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:54.320]  That to me is so telling that here's the Washington post and they even they say they don't have they don't have control over the time
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:56.320]  It takes for the ads to load
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  That to me is is
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:05.720]  Starling yeah, well you everything is on ad networks, and so I mean I think what your goal needs to be is
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:15.360]  You need to not be held accountable, you know, you need to you need to build your pages so that they load regardless of what happens with the ads is basically what you have to do
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.680]  and
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:25.120]  That can be that can be hard. I can't tell you how much when I would fight for a development time at IDG with our development group
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:28.200]  so much time went into ad ops
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:34.880]  so much time and and and and the big problem was ad ops was often driven by salespeople who would sell some crazy campaign
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:42.760]  And then they would have to deliver it and then the front end developers would have to try and find ways to make it not break all the pages
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:48.760]  Which is a totally backward way of doing it, but that would happen all the time and and so much went into that and
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:54.360]  And the fact was more could go into it because your your imagine I mean
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:04:01.160]  It's like anything imagine something that's completely out of your control being dropped into every every little bit of product that you do
[2:04:01.160 --> 2:04:05.400]  That's what happens with these things and so it's and it's mind-bob. Yeah, you try to mitigate it
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:09.880]  You try to reduce it as much as possible and make it so that if the ad server fails
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:12.760]  I mean remember this doesn't happen so much anymore, but it used to be a time when
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:15.320]  one job a script call
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:20.600]  You know breaking somewhere would prevent pages from loading like anywhere because I don't
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:27.520]  And I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure that in the early days all JavaScript was synchronous
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:32.720]  It wasn't a single right so get to that part on the page and it would just wait for that that third-party server to load
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:39.040]  Yeah, and the way pages used to render to you know, you know like in the
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:44.960]  You know like it's anything below it in the DOM would not render and
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:50.560]  I don't even think that was that long ago
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:55.240]  I seem to recall there were problems where one time when the the deck network server went down
[2:04:55.240 --> 2:05:01.480]  Big chunks of daring fireball didn't render because the deck network JavaScript include call was
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:06.360]  At the top of the HTML not at the bottom
[2:05:07.800 --> 2:05:10.200]  So it's not even right, you know, then that you know
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:13.160]  That's only going back to the daring fireball here a little in the 90s
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:17.560]  Here's my theory on this and let me run up by you because and again
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:21.160]  This is one of the reasons I wanted to have you on the show this week so you can speak to this
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:25.560]  To me, I've always thought and I've always been an outsider
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:28.760]  I've never had a full-time job working at a
[2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:31.400]  publication
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:33.400]  what I always saw and
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:41.960]  To me it seemed very obvious in the early years was for the most part the big name web in the early years came from two sides
[2:05:41.960 --> 2:05:43.960]  Came from print and it came from TV
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.720]  So CNN had a big news website New York Times had a big news website
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:52.400]  And in both cases
[2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:54.640]  institutionally
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:06:00.640]  The institutions did not value the websites as much as they valued their traditional form
[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:02.720]  So print publications
[2:06:03.280 --> 2:06:08.320]  Favorite print over it was the favorite child over the web and the web was this thing that they were
[2:06:08.880 --> 2:06:13.120]  Maybe not even drawn kicking and streaming to but you know in some cases in some publications
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:16.400]  I think that was true and a lot of them. It just was always the second
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:18.400]  secondary
[2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:20.800]  child
[2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:27.840]  And that they didn't have respect for it and they didn't have the respect for it that they have for their
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:37.120]  Flagship product because and here's what I would say the New York Times was never going to let advertisers into their printing press
[2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:39.200]  Like you
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:45.760]  Chevy, you know doesn't get to put an ad in the New York Times and get to go into the printing press and slow down the delivery of the next
[2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:48.560]  morning's New York Times because they want to make sure that
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:51.520]  You know the colors are aligned on the printing press
[2:06:53.520 --> 2:06:55.600]  Or to draw another
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:06:59.840]  analogy Chevy doesn't get to put an ad in the New York Times that the New York Times doesn't see first
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:08.160]  CNN doesn't let the advertisers control whatever goes on over the air during the 30 seconds that they bought
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:11.040]  They give them a video and the video
[2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:17.920]  You know, you know, they have the video in their hands before it runs CNN delivers the video right
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:26.400]  Whereas the web from the very early on evolved in this way where there was a lack of respect that they would have like for
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:29.920]  Example New York Times is never going to sell and add that
[2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:38.320]  Sticks to the two pages surrounding the op-ed page so that if you want to read the op-ed page
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:43.040]  You've got to like break an envelope seal. You know find like a sharp thing and do that
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:49.600]  Whereas they they have things on their website that are the equivalent of that where you have to spend a few seconds doing
[2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:56.960]  Something or waiting for something before you get to read what you're going to read whereas they would never sell an ad like that on their print product and
[2:07:57.920 --> 2:08:02.240]  The fact that they started from a position of disrespect and they were the big name
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:07.680]  Sites not just I'm done to say New York Times and CNN in particular all of those sites though that had
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:12.840]  Existing successful print publications or existing successful TV news operations
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.240]  They set the standard for the online ad
[2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:25.040]  Industry and the industry involved in a way where the the inmates run the asylum the advertisers got whatever they wanted because the
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:29.120]  Publications didn't have respect for their sites and didn't have respect for their users
[2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:32.000]  Yeah
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:39.960]  So you don't think I'm off I'm off the mark no, I mean I think the challenge has always been that it's been it's it's been hard
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:41.960]  It's always been hard to make money online
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:51.600]  I know that seems crazy to say but I can tell you from a publication standpoint. It's always been hard. It was not I
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:58.480]  Say at the point that it was clear that the web was the was the most important product and
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:02.600]  That like a magazine like I worked for was not
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:05.920]  It was probably another five
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:08.800]  Maybe seven years
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:13.520]  Before the web revenue got anywhere close to the print revenue
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:19.960]  And that's because it was even like five years ago. There was a I saw a story the other day that was pointing out this
[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:24.120]  That Mary Meeker slide deck that gets dropped at the de conference every year
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:28.760]  or that the co-conference now, right, but the same conference and
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.120]  Five years ago
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:35.000]  She had one of those things that we had seen to you know
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.760]  Internally IDG and everybody in the industry had seen it where even though web was being used to a great degree
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:44.160]  The advertising wasn't on the web. It was all on
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  TV and print and
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:51.400]  That's a red flag because that's like well, this is going to change it is going to change
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:54.760]  But for a long time it didn't change and so you got this, you know
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:10:00.520]  We're giving away all our content for free and we're desperately trying to make money in it because we know that the future is
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:07.320]  Going to be in this medium and but nobody's buying so we're gonna then like redouble our efforts to make
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:10.440]  do anything we can and I think it was
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:13.240]  dangerous because
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.200]  There was some desperation
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:21.880]  at a time when you know, it was about to be a sea change and the the
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:28.040]  Clients were going to be coming with all their big checkbooks to the web
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:32.280]  Very soon because that's where the eyeballs were going that was where everybody wanted to go
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:34.680]  and
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:37.800]  You know, it was probably not realistic to say well, we're just gonna hold out
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:41.320]  But the fact is everybody was just like no, no, no, we're desperate. Please give us money now
[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:43.400]  Please let's make this valid also
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:46.680]  I think there was maybe a little bit of a first one's free kind of mentality like
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:53.720]  What can I do to get you to try to advertise on the web because we really need you to do that because this is where it's all going to go
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:00.680]  As a result though, I mean we yeah, we we've got this situation where the what people pay is not a lot
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:06.840]  It's completely I mean imagine not only the New York Times saying well, you can run an ad
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.040]  We haven't seen and we'll wrap it in a we'll cover the editorial
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:17.800]  Section in a code that you have to enter before you can get you can peel off the piece of paper and read the rest of the newspaper
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:20.680]  But let's take the the analogy further
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:24.920]  You know what if the New York Times doesn't have
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:32.200]  Any control over any of it and isn't even using their own salespeople like there's a robot somewhere
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:36.360]  There is a stock exchange a an ad exchange somewhere that's just
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:42.440]  Automatically serving like the at the salespeople are even gone at that point that's sort of where the web is now
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:46.200]  And you know it's just it's a very different medium and that's fine
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:53.640]  But what Ben Thompson would tell you is unless you have scale unless your buzzfeed maybe unless you have just huge scale
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:58.120]  Where you have so many pages that you can section it up in a bunch of different ways
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:05.240]  Or unless you are very small but had an amazing audience like daring fireball
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:06.760]  If you're in the middle
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:10.520]  It's tough. It's tough to do it because you don't have the scale
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:15.720]  So a lot of advertisers don't even want to talk to you and you're using these ad networks and you know
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:22.200]  That's where i'm or is that's where mac world was and is and you end up doing that thing where you put
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:26.520]  More and more junk on your pages because every piece of junk you put on your pages is
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:31.320]  more money and you're desperately trying to make enough money to pay your
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:37.640]  People who are building your website and who are writing your articles and it's tough. I I'm not convinced
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:40.040]  This is actually one of the reasons why I was so
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:45.480]  Committed to leaving idg for the last couple of years and knew I needed to get out
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:47.800]  I'm not convinced that
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.160]  This you know this business model is going to work for
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:55.400]  80% of the websites
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:01.960]  I'm just I'm not convinced that it's going to work the give it will give it away for free in exchange for loading up on advertising
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:03.240]  well, I
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:04.360]  I
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:06.360]  It's really do think that
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:11.240]  It might be the reckoning might come sooner than later. Yeah, because
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:14.040]  I and it's from
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:19.240]  Multiple factors multiple directions. It's not you know one thing is going to do it but
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:27.400]  It without question this and that's what makes it so interesting to me timing wise because to me it ties in with
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:37.840]  Tangentially perhaps but it turns it ties into that argument that hey apple has like a the argument from the apple that safari is a new i
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:44.680]  e part of their argument is that like i e that they perceive apple is having abandoned it that they've sort of lost interest in it
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:52.400]  And that the reason that safari isn't adding all these features. They want them to add is that apple either can't do it or is understaffed or disinterested
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:55.320]  What what escapes their mind
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:01.560]  To go back to my point earlier about their they're not being able to see it from a perspective other than there's is that apple is doing exactly what it
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.000]  Wants with safari and they are putting a lot of effort into it
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:10.120]  But it's not really about these features that these developers want it's about features for the user and and Renee
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:17.520]  Richie at i'm or had a great article about it where he said it was you know apple is steering it towards this user centric web
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:24.240]  And again, it's apple favoring users over developers, but that's what a
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.120]  Lot of the stuff and there was a lot of stuff about safari at wwdc this year
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:35.600]  Some of my I mean it's partly because it's it's more of this type of stuff I deal with firsthand but
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:45.520]  There's an awful lot of stuff that wwdc sessions that felt directly related to me in my work and what I'm interested in and and you know the content blockers is one and
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  You know the new news app
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:50.880]  is another and
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:58.720]  They're both to me driven by the same thing which is that we want to do things that make stuff you want to read load quicker and
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:01.360]  Keep maintain more of your privacy
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:09.480]  We want to you we this should be faster. It should be a better experience and you should have the feeling that it's more private
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:12.640]  Because that's the other flip side of the whole
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:18.720]  Inmates running the assignment asylum argument with online advertising is this is the magic of code
[2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:24.720]  Right in general just the idea of running software code and this whole, you know code software is eating the world
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:26.960]  It's the first time that advertising
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:34.640]  Advertising could do any of this stuff, right? I mean the the idea of tracking someone who watches TV in the old days over the air
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:40.160]  It was impossible right and the the metrics and of course advertisers want metrics and of course they want the metrics to be
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:42.240]  accurate
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.320]  And but the you know the Nielsen ratings especially in the old days were were famously
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:52.800]  Inaccurate in terms of whether the the Nielsen families were actually a honest about what they watched and b
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.240]  Demographically representative of the country as a whole
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:05.840]  You know, I think newspaper magazine circulation was was probably and probably still is more accurate because it's better regulated through the
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:11.680]  What's it called? You know, I'm sure you know, they there's like a standard group that oh like a baby
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:14.160]  Yeah, like the IAB
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:17.920]  Or at least and if it's not accurate at least it's consistent
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:20.880]  I you know or more consistent, you know, but for the most part
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:24.880]  You know if you placed a full page ad in New York Times, you know
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:30.000]  Whether you you know they actually was read by you know
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:31.760]  They tell you they print you know
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:36.320]  1.1 million copies or whatever it is on a weekday and how many people read it?
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:40.000]  Well who knows because some of those copies are in a doctor's office and people come in
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:43.360]  You know 10 patients come in and read the front page of the same copy of the New York Times
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:45.760]  but you basically know
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:47.440]  roughly loosely
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  How much exposure you're getting
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:56.320]  From the New York Times and if you advertise in sports illustrated instead of advertising in vogue
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:02.400]  You know the basic difference between the demographics of those two big magazines, you know
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:05.840]  And when you advertise in Macworld, you know the print magazine, you know
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.600]  You have a pretty good idea of of the demographics right to a loose degree
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:16.640]  But it's nothing at all like what you get from the trackers that the ad networks do online in terms of knowing that here's a person
[2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:22.000]  Who not only reads Macworld, but they also read three of these photo sites
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.480]  So we can serve a targeted ad which in some sense, you know
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:28.320]  There is a you know, there's a plus side to it
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:35.120]  Where maybe it can serve you an ad that truly is interesting to you because it's about some amazing new Mac software meant for photographers
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:39.120]  When it works like that, that's fantastic but in terms of you know
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:40.240]  Are you comfortable?
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:45.920]  Would you be comfortable buying a print magazine that somehow knew which other print magazines you ran?
[2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:49.760]  It read it doesn't even make any sense like how would how would that even be accomplished?
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:53.920]  That's the magic of code right like letting code run in general and advertising
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:55.760]  Change the game
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:57.760]  Yeah, the question is
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:17:59.760]  I mean trying to think of a way forward
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:03.440]  I ask myself sometimes what would I rather see
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:10.960]  What I rather see a web I think it's unlikely that we'll see a web where almost everything is behind a paywall
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:14.320]  I think that seems unlikely although I think more stuff will be
[2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:19.840]  Harder to get to and that there will be experiences that you'll be able to have on the web or in apps
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:25.440]  As a paid whoever that are better. I do think that will probably happen
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:28.880]  But I what I really asked myself is
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:35.360]  Would I rather have the web littered with more and more junk
[2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:41.920]  Or would I rather have a web that had less junk on it, but it knew who I was
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:43.920]  And
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:45.920]  Maybe this makes me a bad person
[2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:51.120]  But I think I honestly would rather have a good experience and share some of my personal information
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:55.280]  Then have a terrible experience because they don't know who I am
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:01.120]  Unfortunately the world we live in is they want to know everything about who you are and they want to fill your screen with junk
[2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:05.360]  And they also want to put up a paywall after 10 articles
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:09.520]  So that you can pay to see all the junk and be tracked
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:11.520]  So it's like everything is there
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:15.920]  And I don't know what the solution is other than muddling along with it being kind of generally awful
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:18.480]  other than if
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:23.920]  If companies start going out of business and I think that that may be I just saw michael sippy
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:28.800]  Who has been on the internet for a million years and used to be the head of product to Twitter
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:37.040]  Refer to it as the great reaping right? It's like what happens then if if that happens we're like a lot of these mid-range sites
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:39.040]  Just go out of business
[2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:44.800]  Something interesting might happen after that that that is people and probably people like you and me
[2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:50.320]  Either on their own or in small groups banding together to try and find some new way of doing things
[2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:51.680]  That's not like that
[2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:58.720]  But it might take that like a dissolution of these staffs like what happened with macro old imagine that happening just again
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:04.720]  And again and again where you end up with a whole lot of people who are just forced to do something different
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:08.240]  The apocalyptic version of that is that they're just gone they go take jobs
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:11.840]  At places that aren't in the media and you never hear from them again
[2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:18.720]  And the world is a poorer place for it and then all we're left with is some some people kind of on the far left end of the curve
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:23.360]  Like during fireball and some people at the far right and like buzzfeed and that there's nothing left in the middle
[2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:25.920]  But I fear that that is a strong possibility
[2:20:26.640 --> 2:20:28.640]  the reckoning is that
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.320]  the
[2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:37.520]  Overlooking the fact that the users have the ability to fight back and the music industry face this with an abstract era
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:42.240]  Where they wanted a magic solution that would keep users from
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:46.720]  Doing downloads you still see it with film and TV
[2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:48.240]  You know with you know
[2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:50.880]  They're reluctance to be more generous
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:55.520]  Not generous not in terms of like lowering prices, but do you know like the way that stuff is all still regional?
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:56.960]  I mean it drives
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:21:02.240]  We're so lucky living in the US, but it you know drives, you know some of my friends in Canada
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:09.600]  Not when you know TV shows don't show up right away let alone other countries around the world where they show up after they do in Canada
[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:13.360]  It's crazy. There's no reason for that and you wonder why people in Canada might
[2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:16.160]  you know resort to
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:26.160]  Illegal downloads to get the TV shows that they can't get the same day that people get in the US. That's because they're being an idiot about it
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:33.200]  And don't underestimate the fact that users can fight back and if you think ah who cares if our web page is
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:35.120]  Take eight seconds
[2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:41.760]  And then you view people who install ad blockers as criminals or something like that and expect some kind of magical
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:44.720]  Solution to route around the ad blocking. It's you know
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:51.120]  It's not going to work. It's not going to be magical and and now that it's starting to get built into a high level and
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:58.320]  In a truly flagship operating system. I know that you can install ad blockers on the Mac for a while, but in terms of affecting a
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:01.440]  great swath of
[2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:05.280]  High profile and hot you know good demographic users
[2:22:06.560 --> 2:22:10.960]  Having these content blockers in iOS is I think going to be a game changer
[2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:17.840]  I really do and I say this again as somebody who makes my entire living practically from advertising
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:21.600]  I am incredibly sensitive to the fact that
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.840]  You know, I can't really recommend ad blocking. I don't run an ad blocker. You know, I do
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:33.520]  I do run ghostry and I have ghostry set in Safari to block trackers
[2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:37.680]  So I do block ad trackers according to ghostry, but I don't block ads
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:42.160]  So I do obviously see different ads than I would if I didn't have ghostry installed
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:44.880]  And I do plan though to run
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:52.440]  Safari content blockers and I don't plan to run them to block ads, but I absolutely plan to run them to to block JavaScript trackers
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:53.440]  Yeah
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:59.400]  and I I think there's going to be a lot of people who are not as
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:06.080]  You know, and I think rightfully so I don't have judgment on them
[2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:12.960]  But who aren't going to have draw that distinction between blocking ads and blocking trackers and they're just going to block all of it
[2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:17.120]  Oh, yeah, no doubt and when the performance increase is
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:23.680]  Dramatic when you when all of a sudden you try this a content blocker and all of a sudden
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:30.640]  These things start loading remarkably faster on your old iPhone just because you installed iOS 9
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:38.000]  It's there's no you know, it's not like people are going to uninstall them later and it's you know
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:43.920]  I just I really do think that that's going to come. So what did sippy say? It's a what's coming?
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:53.760]  The great reaping yeah, where some sites in the middle that middle between the the the super-scale sites like Facebook and Buzzfeed
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:23:58.440]  And us on the the bottom of the tree that right?
[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:05.000]  It's what would Ben Thompson calls the smiling curve where it's like there's the like a good uptick on the left and the good uptick on the right
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:09.720]  And it's not very good in the middle. Yeah, the way I mean and again
[2:24:10.120 --> 2:24:14.320]  A lot of times when I talk about this or write about this. I also get so please do you know, I mean address it
[2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:15.960]  I
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:19.880]  My criticism of I'm or was not I don't did this true
[2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:24.120]  I do not have it. Here's what I'm or should do to solve the problem. I wish I did if I did
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:26.120]  I would be the first one to share with them
[2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:30.560]  I don't but I wrote that article not saying
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:37.040]  Hey, here's what they should do or and it certainly wasn't meant to they should do what I do because it wouldn't work
[2:24:37.040 --> 2:24:40.720]  No, right? I have an operation that is a very nice living for a
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:47.280]  Staff of one, you know, and I could you know, maybe I could hire one person or hire somebody full-time or part-time or something like that
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:50.320]  I believe the term again, right, but
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:56.320]  You know the the daring fireball slash the talk show model is not something that would run a
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:01.040]  Staffed organization. It's you know, no, so I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.360]  I would like to see them try and maybe somebody could find a way to
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:10.480]  You know find something new that could run something of that size, you know, but I feel that's the other thing
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:14.400]  If there is a lament, it's that people have stopped trying new new things in advertising
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:16.400]  it's this catch 22 of
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:20.960]  The advantage of giving away our content for free is that you get more viewers
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:23.680]  But then you have to monetize them all because
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:30.320]  Which is a word I hate but because it conjures up sort of this imagery of turning people into stacks of coins or something
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:31.680]  But that's basically what it is, right?
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:37.200]  And so you've got how do you do that and the answer is you put ads everywhere and you try to track them and
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.040]  The the fact is people are reluctant to give you money
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:43.200]  a lot of people
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:47.200]  Your your other choice is to is to say look. I don't care. I'm going to
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  charge people for for my stuff and
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:53.760]  It'll be a much smaller group, but if they pay me enough it'll be worth it
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:57.760]  The challenge is getting the math to work or a hybrid of that right where you give some stuff away
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:02.720]  I like Ben Thompson gives some stuff away to get visibility and then including the article that I will link to this week
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:07.560]  Exactly right, but he also writes several other pieces a week that only go to the people who pay him a hundred dollars a year
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:09.440]  Which I think is actually a kind of a great deal
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:13.920]  And it allows him to make a living just doing that which means you get as a subscriber
[2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:19.880]  You get his entire output other than the one free piece a week. I feel like I feel like that is part of the
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:22.680]  Genius of his model. I feel like a hundred dollars is magic
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:25.960]  Yeah, and if I wasn't sure what to think of it when he started
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.520]  But I feel like it's magic and there's an awful lot of people who it's out and never pay a hundred dollars a year for
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.520]  Anything online, but it's somehow if you're
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:38.280]  But then they're I think a lot of those people wouldn't pay ten dollars here
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:44.280]  Right, right, and and he's a really smart guy. I mean this is my my fear is that if everybody in the middle
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:47.880]  Their companies blow up and they say well
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:50.760]  I'm gonna do what Ben Thompson does the fact is I mean
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:57.880]  No, not everybody how many hundred-dollar a year subscriptions for websites or newsletters or people going to be willing to pay
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:00.440]  Nope, you have to be one of their favorites
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:03.240]  Right, but that's that's that's the old you know
[2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:09.960]  What is a thousand true fans thing which you don't actually need you don't actually need a hundred thousand people
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:16.840]  You need a thousand people or two thousand people who will who like your stuff enough to buy your t-shirt and maybe
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:22.120]  Your you know membership or donate or whatever and and that that's I feel like I mean
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:26.360]  I've thought about that a lot since going out on my own is how do I want to balance?
[2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:30.680]  Advertising with the directs. I had lots of people say I don't you know
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:33.320]  I don't I like your advertisers or I don't
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:35.080]  Like your advertisers or whatever
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.480]  I just want to support you and I don't have anything to advertise myself
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:45.240]  How do I do that and I haven't given anybody a way to do that yet and and I remember during the really bad times at IDG
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:49.960]  That you know usually you're riding high and the sales guys are in charge and they're like yeah
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:53.960]  We're selling ads. We don't really care about any anything else and then the dark times
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:57.400]  They suddenly say hey, you know, what's really great is we've got people paying us
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.640]  $35 a year to get a magazine
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:04.520]  That's a really good because we'd be out of business without that and I'm reminded of that that right now
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:11.720]  My living is almost a hundred percent directly or indirectly funded by advertising and you know do I want to have you know
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:17.080]  Let people you know can I provide them something that they would want to support and also get something from it?
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:20.280]  But that's the danger is that
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:23.000]  If you follow that through it might work for me
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:25.080]  It certainly works for Ben Thompson right now
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:29.080]  But in the end if most of the people get cleared out of the market
[2:28:29.080 --> 2:28:33.560]  I'm not sure if that'll work or not then again back in 20 years ago
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:39.640]  There were people who subscribed to 15 magazines a month right and those were all probably $50 or $40 or
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:42.840]  $20 a year, maybe not a hundred dollars a year
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:48.680]  But my dad used to get the Kipling ear letter and that was like a hundred dollars a year or more
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:53.640]  And that was like a little newsletter like type type written even when they started doing it on computers
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:56.760]  It looked they made it look like it was typewritten and it was like a
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.800]  Investing in business newsletter and that's sort of what Ben's doing and it makes sense
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:04.840]  But I don't know the the math may not work it you may end up
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:07.800]  It may turn out that the web is created a glut
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:09.800]  of
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:11.800]  Information and people
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:13.800]  That in the end just can't be supported
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:16.600]  That that unfortunately
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:20.600]  I fear sometimes that what we do is going to be like being a steel worker
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:23.640]  Yeah, I wonder. I don't know
[2:29:24.840 --> 2:29:28.200]  The other thing I wrote about with the eye more thing was
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:32.600]  That to me it was a good example of a slippery slope by which I mean
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:37.320]  that once with me at Daring Fireball and again
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:39.800]  I'm not saying it applies to other sites or larger sites
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:46.920]  But it worked for me was that I never once put anything on Daring Fireball that I wasn't comfortable with except for the time that I tried
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:49.080]  Running
[2:29:49.080 --> 2:29:52.520]  Google AdSense like when Google AdSense first came out and I've talked about this
[2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:55.720]  You know talks and stuff like that before but long story short
[2:29:56.120 --> 2:30:00.440]  The ads weren't that good and they weren't paying much and I got some control over the color of them
[2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:04.440]  But it wasn't enough and they were just text, you know
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:09.640]  But and it was and it was at a time when Daring Fireball was making zero dollars
[2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:13.640]  And it was I really wanted it to make something greater than zero dollars
[2:30:13.640 --> 2:30:16.600]  So I could spend more time on it and ideally
[2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:19.080]  You know and again for years. It was just a
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.360]  I'd old dream that I could maybe just do it full-time
[2:30:23.400 --> 2:30:24.760]  I really wanted that to work
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:29.800]  But I was so uncomfortable with the fact that some of those Google AdSense ads that I was getting
[2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:33.880]  And I had no control over them. Some of them were relevant. Most of them weren't
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:37.400]  I took them down after like a month or two
[2:30:38.360 --> 2:30:40.920]  But that I never I never put anything and you know
[2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:47.720]  God bless Google one thing Google has always known is that the web should be fast and the AdSense ads never once seemed to slow down
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:50.680]  Daring Fireball if they had I would have taken them down day one
[2:30:51.480 --> 2:30:55.560]  But I had the ability because there was nobody I had to answer to
[2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:59.720]  I you know, I could say I'm never going to add anything that slows Daring Fireball down
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:06.360]  And I'm never going to add something that I'm not proud of and I'm not going to add something to Daring Fireball that
[2:31:06.760 --> 2:31:09.560]  It has a hundred HDTP requests, etc, etc
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:12.040]  So I never broke the line on that and now you know
[2:31:12.520 --> 2:31:17.080]  I've fortunate enough that I found other ways to make money and I have a
[2:31:17.800 --> 2:31:19.800]  Terrific business right now
[2:31:19.800 --> 2:31:22.920]  But in the interim I absolutely left money on the table
[2:31:22.920 --> 2:31:30.920]  You know there were years in the 2007 2008 2009 era where I had you know, and I listened to some of the pitches from ad
[2:31:31.240 --> 2:31:33.080]  networks
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:37.480]  You know, they were you know, at least and who knows if they would have but the numbers
[2:31:37.480 --> 2:31:41.960]  They were telling me that they could give me per month were way more than what I was making
[2:31:41.960 --> 2:31:45.160]  I mean, you know by you know, maybe not by factor of ten
[2:31:45.160 --> 2:31:47.320]  But by a factor of a very nice integer
[2:31:48.920 --> 2:31:52.200]  It was way more money than I was making per month from Daring Fireball
[2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:56.200]  At a time when it really would have been meaningful to me and my family
[2:31:56.200 --> 2:31:59.880]  But I turned it all down because I absolutely wasn't comfortable with
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:05.880]  The ads now how many people at a you know at a site where you're not just an you know one person who
[2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:08.360]  You know, I'm not going to call myself an artist
[2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:12.280]  But maybe it comes at it with an artistic integrity angle
[2:32:12.840 --> 2:32:17.640]  But if you're at a site where there's you know a corporate structure above you and and you're you know
[2:32:17.640 --> 2:32:22.040]  supposed to justify stuff with the you know profit and loss and stuff like that
[2:32:22.360 --> 2:32:26.840]  How many people are going to go how many publications could go years turning down stuff and
[2:32:27.640 --> 2:32:32.440]  Building something different instead. Oh, I I can't tell you how many times. I mean the slipper slope is true
[2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:36.280]  I can't tell you how many times you wrote you wrote you know a bunch of things about like tint
[2:32:36.920 --> 2:32:40.920]  That thing that that uh, yeah, you used to what still does where it adds
[2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:42.760]  You copy you know
[2:32:42.760 --> 2:32:47.520]  You copy the name Jason Snell from to get the spelling of your name right not that your name is hard to spell
[2:32:47.520 --> 2:32:53.080]  But it adds all this crap on your clipboard and there and there were those those ads that what were they called
[2:32:53.400 --> 2:32:59.320]  That were that were you still see them where they they take like phrases in stories and editorial kind of
[2:32:59.720 --> 2:33:01.720]  Yeah, and hyperlink them
[2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:08.280]  To advertising and usually badly that's where you say and it was like this in the early days of Google to you'd say something like
[2:33:08.280 --> 2:33:12.920]  You know the drill and all the ads are for power drills, right? They're like that's totally wrong
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:18.120]  Right, and yes, if you're a close reader you could see that those links were styled differently
[2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:23.240]  Maybe they were underlining green instead of in blue exactly and but you have to be a close reader
[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:24.840]  I mean it's like every time I'd see them
[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:29.960]  I think there is no way my mom would know the difference between this link and the link that the writer of the article put in
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:33.400]  Which they really wanted the reader to know hey if you want to know more about
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:40.680]  This so click this link we would we would have I can't tell you how many times and this one of the things that were on me and my job is
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:45.640]  I could tell you how many times I had a meeting with a new salesperson or a new executive who would say
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:50.520]  You know hey have you heard about these new these great new things that do this
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:56.200]  And it would be the same old thing it would be stuff like that these contextual ads and hyperlinks and you know it would end up being yet
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:33:59.600]  Another argument where I would have to say that's editorial content
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:04.720]  And we choose what we link to and by overriding links with other links to other places
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:10.280]  You're breaking, you know, you're laying editor advertising on top of editorial and it's not it's not appropriate
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:12.480]  And it's a bad user experience and et cetera, et cetera
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:18.920]  I generally won those arguments at Mackerel which I kind of can't believe I even did but I generally won those
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:20.920]  I think we never implemented those
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:25.560]  But you know the argument was always the same which is well, it's incremental revenue
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:30.480]  And the best I could do is say look all the editors will tell you this is wrong
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:35.960]  It will be terrible for the users and all the promising you was an extra $40,000. Is it worth it to you?
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.240]  But a lot of organizations and IDG said yes on all sorts of other things
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:42.920]  They just on that one particular one for whatever reason
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:47.240]  They'll just say yes because they're like they're desperately trying to keep ahead of
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:51.360]  The you know they're trying to keep a float there and so it's like well
[2:34:51.360 --> 2:34:56.600]  This is another $20,000 and this is another $40,000 at one point when I was put in charge of Mackerel's website
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:34:59.760]  The home page was almost entirely non editorial like literally
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:05.480]  Like I think more than half the the home page was non editorial and it's because every time somebody came to them
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:08.880]  Whoever was in charge at that time the president of the company
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:10.760]  I think basically and said we've got to deal with you
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:13.920]  What if you link to this thing and we'll give you a cut? They just said yes and
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:16.160]  You know, it's hard to say no
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:21.480]  It is hard to say no and it's hard to keep a vision and if you're somebody who is dealing with the bottom line
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:29.200]  You know, you're not running a charity. You do want to make a living and you want to bring in more money so that your your company can stay in business at the same time
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:35.000]  Somebody who is thinking of the big picture realizes that you are breaking your product
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:43.440]  By adding this to it and that eventually what you're left with is nothing and you're not gonna get revenue for it because your product is so terrible
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:49.120]  That nobody wants to see it anymore and right and and one little incremental thing at a time all of a sudden
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:51.120]  You've set yourself in opposition to your readers
[2:35:51.480 --> 2:35:56.880]  Yeah, and like Mackerel I can't tell you I mean one of the reasons morale was so low was that our readers
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:59.680]  First off the people who made these decisions never heard from the readers
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:00.960]  We had to hear from the readers
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:05.520]  We had to be the ones who bore the brunt of it and tried to explain why this was going on
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:08.360]  The people who actually made these decisions never had to hear from them
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:12.800]  In fact, the reason I got the auto play video turned off for that brief time that I got it turned off is that I
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:14.480]  passed my boss a
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:17.680]  60-page Google Doc of complaints from readers
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:19.920]  About auto play video
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:25.000]  We just compiled it. I just had the editors. I said put anytime you get an email from somebody or a tweet or whatever
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.920]  Put it in here and I handed it to him and I said
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:32.280]  These are complaints from readers about auto play and and finally what broke him down
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:33.320]  He was like, what do you want me to do?
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:34.600]  And I said I want you to shut it off
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:35.400]  He's like, all right
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:41.400]  And then like I said two months later. He was replaced with a guy who immediately turned it back on but that that you know
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:45.840]  If you're if you're one of those editors that was you could tell that this was bad
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:49.320]  But the people who are making these decisions never had to hear from people
[2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:55.960]  They never really were thinking about that oftentimes you'd have like an editorial group and you'd have like the website building group
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:37:01.680]  And then you'd have like a money group the sales and deals group and what would end up happening is there's
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:09.160]  The what should happen is that group in the middle the the the website product group should actually be concerned about the product
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:13.520]  They should they should be the one that everybody else has to convince that this is a good idea
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:20.440]  but in so many editorial organizations some on the web and especially the ones that came from print but not just them
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:28.240]  That group ended up being seen as like a technical services group rather than like the keepers of the product and as a result
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:32.440]  The other two groups were just the added and sales would just run rush shot over them
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:36.200]  And that is where the slippery slope comes from a lot of the time is that the
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:39.880]  Either there's nobody in charge of the product or the people in charge of the product
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:47.720]  Can't say no and they can't even say stop and think and so you know a sales guy makes a deal that he that he's gonna
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:51.160]  Get a commission on that is gonna junk up the site. He doesn't care
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:57.160]  He's gonna make money and somebody else's problem about it junking up the site and he'll never hear from a reader
[2:37:57.720 --> 2:38:02.280]  That it was junking up the site. He just doesn't care and that's why the slippery slope happens
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:08.600]  Yeah, that's a great great story. Well, an interesting story. It's a very sad bad
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:16.520]  The last factor in all of this is this and and it we've been going on a long time, but I've been off for a while
[2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:24.040]  But to wrap this up is the mobile versus desktop web disparity and Mary Meeker's slide
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:30.360]  Let me make a note to see if I can link to that but her slide on the amount of time people spend on
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:33.640]  Very as media TV prints stuff like that versus the amount
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:39.400]  Percentage of the percentage of their time they spend on them versus the percentage of advertising that is devoted to them
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:47.560]  It it's shown ever since she's been doing it that new stuff is underrepresented by ads early and then eventually it catch
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:55.560]  It inevitably catches up. It's almost like money ball where eventually the advertisers realize that we can we can underpay for what it's worth
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:39:02.520]  on this new thing and get more bang for our buck than the existing ones and the graph shows that the amount of time
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:08.520]  People spend on TV corresponds closely to the amount of money spent on TV advertising the amount of time people spend with print
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:13.720]  Corresponds pretty closely to how much time they spend on it and in the early days of the web like you said
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:18.040]  Five years ago not even early days like five years ago. That wasn't true
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:23.880]  And it has been her slide this year. It's caught up. Oh TV TV is totally screwed by the way
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:27.560]  That's the other part of that. It's like everybody's realized that TV is not
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:32.920]  Worth it and so TV advertising is going to go in the hole as a partner except for big
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:34.360]  I except for the and again
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:40.040]  I think it's probably going to be one of those upside down smiles where like the big name sports lot still gonna lie
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:45.720]  The end right and he can live yeah NFL is going to be fine. The Oscars are going to be fine
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:54.200]  Yeah, you know episodes of 30 minutes. It comes are gonna be in big trouble. Yeah
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:01.240]  But the big thing that she showed though is that there's a big disparity with mobile and desktop and mobile is
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:05.400]  Consuming like I think about as much time as the desktop web
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:12.840]  But it's way underrepresented. She said I think her number was something like 35 or 40 billion dollars a
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:19.880]  Hole between how much money should be being spent if you say that you know all times should be represented by advertising equally
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:23.800]  And like you said even just five years ago the desktop web was there
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:30.360]  I think video two goes into that where people are watching video and the percentage of video advertising is nothing compared to the
[2:40:30.760 --> 2:40:34.200]  Where the people are is not where the advertising is in mobile and video
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:39.880]  Yeah, absolutely not and that's really going to come with kids because I mean it's it
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:45.480]  We both we both have it's Jonas still 10. He's 11. He just turned 11. Yeah, he's a little bit older than Julian
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:48.760]  So we have 10 11 year old kids and then my daughter's 13
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:53.240]  And you know they don't watch TV they watch they watch online videos
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:59.720]  They watch YouTube mostly and it's mostly Minecraft videos almost not entirely but you know YouTube and Netflix and he's a he's he's
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:04.120]  It's fascinating to watch him. He's he loves if he finds a new show
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.440]  He likes and I don't even know how he finds him. He will deep dive and watch the entirety
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:11.880]  It's word amount my son's done that my daughter and her friends will do that too
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:16.200]  Where they'll just find something and they'll let me talk about binge watching they just go they go nuts with it
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:23.000]  So you know the next generation is bringing this on to and so that they you know the money is going to try to find a way to reach them
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:25.640]  Yeah, definitely
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:27.560]  It'll catch up eventually
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:29.800]  There's no doubt about it because somebody's gonna be smart
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:31.480]  The problem is that mobile right now
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:36.520]  You know, it's it's hard to advertise on mobile right the screens are small and the mobile advertising
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:40.280]  We've seen has been lousy. Yeah, that's exactly where I want to go with this though
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:48.680]  And why the content blockers coming to iOS is so big is that for as obnoxious as advertising is on desktop web and how it
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:55.720]  You know, and let's face it the the line between desktop and mobile is sort of arbitrary because most people are using
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:03.480]  laptops as their quote desktop now and we have a lot of the same issues where you're maybe your internet connection is
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:11.640]  Not a great Wi-Fi connection, right? Maybe you're in a hotel and and you've got a Wi-Fi connection that's slower than your phone connection
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:21.400]  Or maybe you're on the train between New York and Philly and
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:27.400]  You're tethered to a cellular device and you go through sections of New Jersey where cellular coverage is crap
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:36.920]  I mean you go into city. You know you go places. There's you know buildings blocked the Verizon cell tower and for two blocks
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:38.920]  You've got crap connection
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:45.720]  Everybody knows this is true. Well, those are the cases where waiting for stuff and having ads that you know
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:52.840]  Run a script for a minute whether it feels slow or not if it just runs for a minute
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:43:00.280]  But it's stressing the antenna on your phone. This is how your battery can go down so quickly depending on your cell coverage
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:06.920]  That just doesn't fly on mobile and the idea of having ads that block the content
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:08.600]  When you've got you know
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:14.120]  You've already got so little space on the device already and to have a permanent piece of chrome covering part of it
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:19.400]  And that isn't even site navigation. It's an ad drive. She crazy and of course people are gonna block it
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:26.000]  It's way it's all of it is way worse everything that's bad about desktop advertising is way worse on mobile advertising
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:32.480]  It's bang and and everything that you can do that's a good way of doing advertising on desktop works even better on mobile
[2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:36.520]  like that's why I think that mobile in the long run should be even more valuable because a
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:39.720]  Sort of you know
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:41.720]  Daring fireball six colors
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:47.560]  Loop in sight. Hey, thanks to my sponsor type thing takes up more of the screen at a time and
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:52.880]  And I think you have a user on mobile who's more focused on what they're doing
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.680]  It should be at least as valuable if not more so if any long run if anything makes me optimistic
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:08.320]  We talked about the great reaping if anything makes me optimistic. It's that the fact is that that Mary Meeker chart that that number of eyes on
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:11.280]  Mobile web or on a video
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:17.120]  But you know, I don't love I don't love advertising a lot of people really hate it a lot of people are just allergic to it
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:18.360]  but
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:20.200]  That when I talked about the money earlier
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:24.480]  I mean the money wants to reach them like Coca Cola and you know the big
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:28.280]  advertisers of the world the movie studios who want to get people out
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  on Thursday nights and Friday nights
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:40.040]  They want to reach people they and they're gonna have money to spend the the way that the economy works that bar that bar graph of
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:42.280]  like huge bar chart for
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:49.000]  The the bar of people who are using it and teeny tiny one for how much money's being spent
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:54.680]  It's like osmosis or you know, it's going to grow that money is going to follow the people
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:01.440]  So if I'm optimistic what I think is somebody's gonna figure this out somehow because there's money who wants
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:08.400]  There's money ready to be spent as long as there are people who as somebody can figure out how to get people to receive it
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:16.080]  And I don't know what that is. Maybe it is native. I used to fight so hard against native advertising on that world where they would try to like fake
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:20.360]  I mean, they would try to fake stories. They try to make things look like they were they were stories
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:23.840]  But they weren't but you know what daring fireball does and what six colors does
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:27.000]  I mean, that's native advertising. I do a post a week from a sponsor
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:32.280]  And it says this is a sponsor, but I give them space they give me money and I give them space
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:36.000]  They give you money you give them space and you thank them and I thank them and that's it's nice
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:42.280]  Maybe that's the way forward maybe I mean, I don't think Coca-Cola wants to set up or Verizon
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:48.160]  Verizon tried this like set up their own website set up their own app with content in it and then like have their
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:51.120]  Their ads being in sitiously placed in it
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.840]  I think that's less likely to work and and that's the that's the great thing that an independent media company can do is say
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:01.360]  We're gonna make good content and build an audience and have a place for you to give us your money
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:08.560]  so that you can get your stuff in front of them, too. That's why the media has worked mass media has worked so successfully for so long and
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:12.660]  Everything may need to be broken before we get there
[2:46:12.660 --> 2:46:20.240]  But the the recipe hasn't changed. They're still marketers who have a lot of money who really want to market their product to the people who are
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:28.280]  Spending time using media and there are huge numbers of people including our kids using media and there's gonna be somebody in the middle
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:33.200]  Who puts those two things together and eventually the water will reach its own level? Yeah, yeah
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:39.760]  That's that osmosis thing eventually those numbers will align they they have to in the fat days of
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:43.240]  Print magazines and there's still some print magazines that are doing well
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:49.200]  But in you know in the days when they were at their peak there was still a maximum number of ads you could squeeze into an issue, right?
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:51.200]  Right you there wasn't an infinite number
[2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:55.720]  You know there's only so many ads you can put in an issue with a newspaper
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:47:01.840]  And there's only so much editorial you can force aside, you know on each page
[2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:08.160]  TV is a great example where in theory they could sell as many minutes as they want as ads
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:11.400]  But when it's especially you know if you talk about the the pre
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:16.120]  PVR era where you couldn't skip ads
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:22.040]  And you had to be watching live it it equalized pretty
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:28.760]  Quickly it somewhere. It was like 22 or 23 minutes an hour of content in six or seven minutes of ads
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  Yeah, although that happened like I
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:37.000]  The original Star Trek most of the episodes run about 51 minutes and a modern TV drama is about 42 minutes
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:40.640]  So time so you can see that's so that gives you a timeline of
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:45.780]  Where in the last 45 years they've they've added another 10 minutes per hour of commercial
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:48.200]  Yeah, so somewhere between the mid 60s in
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:56.240]  1981 they went from so what would that have been there's 50 50 51 minutes content an hour to 42
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:58.240]  Yeah
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:04.000]  And you know, I don't think you could push it any further, you know, that's no that that you're limited by time
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:08.960]  I mean technically you could have 60 minutes of advertising in an hour right and nobody would watch it
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:13.520]  But but so instead what they do is they say, okay, well, we're gonna have straightforward commercials for 20 minutes
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:16.720]  We're gonna content for 40 minutes, but in the content like American Idol, right?
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:22.520]  But in the content we're gonna have spot or a baseball game right sponsor segment like I don't know about the the Yankees
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:26.160]  But the Giants like they'll they'll have a good defensive play and they'll say well
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:27.840]  That's your Ford right choice right?
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:30.800]  And everything is got and it has nothing to do with it really
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:35.120]  But it's like there are like 10 pieces of flair that they have to get out give out during a game
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:41.240]  And then the broadcast booth is sponsored and that's how you increase the load beyond and that's I guess we call that native
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  advertising on what we're doing which is
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:48.240]  And to a point, I think it's not bad the classic era
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:53.920]  In the classic era and you can think back to old computer magazines and stuff the ads were good like people liked the ads
[2:48:53.920 --> 2:48:56.000]  They didn't roll the rise at the ads. They were good
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:01.240]  They were information and it's funny in podcasts. I feel like when when you do a good podcast ad
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:06.240]  It's the same thing. It's like it's can be entertaining. It can be informational
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:08.960]  and the web kind of got it wrong and
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:14.560]  I think that's one of the reasons we're in this kind of hole and then maybe there needs to be a crack up before we find
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:20.320]  Whatever that new solution is where people actually like don't mind the ads and maybe like them
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:25.320]  Started with user hostile ads and went down from there. Yeah, punch the monkey. Yeah, punch the monkey
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:30.600]  That was the original sin of the web was punch the monkey and since then it's all been downhill
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:35.840]  It was so bad when if you were a
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:38.920]  A web developer enough to know that it was just
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:49.040]  Jason Snell thank you so much for your time and your insight. I think this has been absolutely great people
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:53.560]  We've already mentioned this several times, but your new site is six colors
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:55.320]  Dot
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:50:00.880]  God I hope it's calm it is dot com. I paid the money man. I I wanted a domain you could spell
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:05.480]  No, I ended in dot com. I forgot I knew there was another thing
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:08.160]  I know but I know that you can spell colors with a way
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:13.200]  You you can spell it colors with you and I even went to Serbia and got six color dot rs
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:17.760]  Whichever way you are comfortable spelling colors. It will work for you
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:21.280]  Your podcasts
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:26.640]  Which is a big part of it a big part of your independence. I'm guessing. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.240]  Let's just listen. There's the comparable and comparable the incomparable dot com. Yeah
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:34.200]  And that's
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:39.160]  Great show weekly still you call it just a weekly pop culture show. I mean, it's really more like a network
[2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:42.960]  Well, and yeah, it is there's the main show and then there's a whole bunch of other shows on the network
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:47.160]  All right, I'm just cheating and I'm reading from your website
[2:50:47.160 --> 2:50:51.680]  But then there's upgrade which is essentially the official six colors podcast
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:57.640]  It's like I'm a little inspired by you. Yeah, that's I didn't make a six colors podcast upgrade is basically my weekly tech thing
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:02.560]  Let's the talk show is for you. Yeah, but you got Mike Hurley as as your
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:06.800]  Your co-host who doesn't like an English guy. You have to throw a little English in there
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:10.360]  And then which is our which is our
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:14.560]  Me and Dan Morin and two guests every week and it's a half an hour like us
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:19.400]  Which is like I like to provide an alternative because I hear from people are like a podcast or too long
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:22.800]  It's like well, although sometimes we get complaints people are like it's too short
[2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:27.800]  You should make it longer. It's like no there if you'd like a longer podcast my every other podcast
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:32.360]  Just take a look at the leaderboard in overcast. Yeah
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:41.480]  TV talk machine with your pal Tim Goodman from the Hollywood reporter. That's that's I know him
[2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:47.080]  And he's really great on podcasts and I he was not going to do a podcast unless somebody like posted for him
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:53.280]  And I was like I could do that. So yeah, you post cut you post podcast in your sleep and robot or not
[2:51:53.280 --> 2:52:00.880]  The most important podcast of life today where John Syracuse and I debate whether things are robots are not for about three minutes perhaps
[2:52:02.760 --> 2:52:05.320]  Because why I don't know it's pointless. It's fun
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:09.360]  That's because you guys are just you guys have your mic like in front of the computer all the time
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:13.160]  You guys can pop these things out like you know. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you just just
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:19.880]  a little little little a little backstage material for the talk show listeners is John John and I you know
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:23.480]  We talk for a while about lots of robots and then that becomes lots of episodes
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:30.800]  We don't talk once a week about a robot for five minutes. That's that would be inefficient. That's pretty smart
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:35.680]  All right, thank you so much Jason. It's a pleasure. Let me thank our sponsors for the week
[2:52:35.680 --> 2:52:40.640]  We got let me see if I can do it out of memory. We had Harry's we did get your shave and stuff you got your hover
[2:52:40.640 --> 2:52:47.680]  You get your domain name you got your fracture. You can print it picture of your freshly shaving face with the Harry's
[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:53.480]  And then and then you could put on a domain name you host with hover right and back it up to back place
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:57.880]  And then you back it up to back place. So there's our sponsors. So my thanks to all of them and
[2:52:57.880 --> 2:53:17.320]  And hopefully it won't be three weeks before my next episode
