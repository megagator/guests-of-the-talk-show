[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  If the talk show was like your bowel movements, you'd have to go see a doctor, right?
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.440]  I mean, because this show, this show is like, uh, something like the haunted house that
[00:08.440 --> 00:11.920]  the Kiwanis puts on, they're like, put your hand in the bowl.
[00:11.920 --> 00:15.120]  It's eyeballs and brains and beetles.
[00:15.120 --> 00:19.960]  Whereas dithering is literally like a professional show where you can like bank on it.
[00:19.960 --> 00:24.320]  You know, Tuesday morning, there's going to be a 15 minute and zero second episode waiting
[00:24.320 --> 00:27.280]  for you in your podcatcher, you know, there you go.
[00:27.280 --> 00:28.280]  And it's great.
[00:28.280 --> 00:31.560]  The deal was, okay, I love the idea, but how about this?
[00:31.560 --> 00:36.120]  I don't want to deal with any of the publishing details.
[00:36.120 --> 00:37.360]  And Ben was like, that's great.
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.360]  I love doing it.
[00:38.360 --> 00:39.360]  And I'm like, you love doing it.
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.280]  That's a standard, that's a standard God, a soul in my contracts right now, I am offer
[00:44.280 --> 00:45.280]  only.
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.340]  You can come to me and say, be on my podcast, but I, I cannot have to turn anything off
[00:50.340 --> 00:51.340]  to do it.
[00:51.340 --> 00:53.200]  And it must require no work.
[00:53.200 --> 00:58.240]  So we do the Zencastr and the way that I do it, I'm not a Chrome user, but, um,
[00:58.240 --> 01:00.320]  That's not on any of my machines anymore.
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.200]  I removed it from every, I've got Vivaldi, which is Chrome ish, but it doesn't have all
[01:05.200 --> 01:06.960]  the nasties that Chrome has.
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.880]  I use the, uh, the brave, which is Chrome without the nasties.
[01:11.880 --> 01:13.280]  I don't know anything else about it.
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.920]  I don't, I don't, I use brave for two things.
[01:17.920 --> 01:22.980]  I use it for recording dithering, which is amazing through the Zencastr and, or at least
[01:22.980 --> 01:27.320]  from my perspective is not having to deal with, deal with it when I'm done.
[01:27.320 --> 01:36.160]  And I stay logged into Amazon through my business, daring fireball account, which I seldom use,
[01:36.160 --> 01:43.400]  you know, uh, you know, for posting the, uh, the money-making affiliate links, uh, but
[01:43.400 --> 01:44.400]  that's it.
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.920]  I don't use it for anything else, but it's kind of amazing.
[01:45.920 --> 01:46.920]  But anyway.
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.580]  Well, we, we got onto zoom and you know, I don't have, it would be, it would be very
[01:54.580 --> 01:58.440]  subtle for me to say, I don't have a lot of affection for zoom as a product, a service
[01:58.440 --> 02:06.000]  and app or a company, Oh no, we accidentally installed another packet sniffing thing that
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  you can't find.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.960]  Oh, now you've, you've created a Webrick so people can run rails and mine Bitcoin.
[02:10.960 --> 02:11.960]  You're like, what?
[02:11.960 --> 02:14.520]  My kid has to be on this eight hours a day.
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.520]  Really?
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.000]  But, but you know, to get to where you're, and this is, this is a constant conundrum
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.500]  in the world of even middling levels of security is you're always, you know, you're always
[02:23.500 --> 02:25.920]  doing what you can to latch the screen door.
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.920]  Um, but you know, with zoom, I turned on all the, like, don't let this start streaming,
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.600]  don't automatically do anything, but then I have to click all this crap and now recording
[02:35.600 --> 02:36.880]  and all that kind of stuff.
[02:36.880 --> 02:38.560]  So then we play with a different one.
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.000]  Alex said, let's try this other one because Dan and I were using it.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.920]  It's another one of those based in a web browser ones.
[02:45.920 --> 02:48.720]  And John, I get my back as with so many things.
[02:48.720 --> 02:53.320]  It's like, I like this service, but I hate this app, you know, like whether that's Dropbox
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.440]  or like whatever it is, like the service is great, but like the way you interact with
[02:57.440 --> 02:59.320]  this is so gross.
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.280]  And so we, I won't mention the name clean feet, but we started using this one and, and
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.600]  it's, it has a couple quirks.
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.040]  You get exquisite, you get an exquisite, exactly two files that match.
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.720]  If you remember to hit the button at the same time and otherwise you get drift and whatever.
[03:17.720 --> 03:18.720]  And that's cool.
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.120]  What it doesn't give you though, is something I do that you'll get from me or Caleb, and
[03:22.120 --> 03:24.080]  you will get from me, which is I have my side.
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.080]  I have your side and I have a cycle, everything, which is like a reference track in case you
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.320]  need to like fix anything.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.440]  It's just handy to have.
[03:31.440 --> 03:32.960]  So first of all, you get these two files.
[03:32.960 --> 03:33.960]  That's all fine.
[03:33.960 --> 03:36.300]  Here's the thing, John, it all happens in the browser.
[03:36.300 --> 03:39.160]  If you close, there's no way to stop the call.
[03:39.160 --> 03:44.440]  You just close the browser and it's like, this is just feels really not Mac asked Mac
[03:44.440 --> 03:51.560]  stuff to me, which is fine, but, but also if you forget to save the files in the browser
[03:51.560 --> 03:54.480]  before you close the window, they don't exist in here.
[03:54.480 --> 03:55.520]  Oh my God.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.080]  You can't go get it from anywhere because it only existed, as far as I know, it might've
[04:00.080 --> 04:03.880]  improved, but I never thought I'd have fondness for Skype.
[04:03.880 --> 04:07.360]  So I don't, but you know, it's the devil I know.
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.300]  The Zencastr thing is pretty neat where they, they do save the files locally.
[04:12.300 --> 04:18.280]  And so whatever catastrophe might happen, like let's say an accidental command queue,
[04:18.280 --> 04:23.140]  you know, while, while you're, you, you think you're looking at a Apple notes or something
[04:23.140 --> 04:28.600]  while you're recording, but instead your browser's front most, you command Q and or command w
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.320]  whatever you close it, you, you, they've got, they've got your, they've got you covered,
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.800]  you know, like they've, they've, they've been writing locally or they've, they've been writing
[04:37.800 --> 04:40.840]  an MP3 file locally throughout the whole thing.
[04:40.840 --> 04:45.960]  But on the other hand, my thought is I, it makes me sick to think that a web browser
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.600]  is able to do that, right, that, that you just go to a website and it can just like
[04:50.600 --> 04:53.320]  be writing an MP3 file the whole time.
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.480]  And you know, it's, it's not the,
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.380]  Well, Guanadio Hijack does that.
[04:57.380 --> 05:02.760]  It's what the doctor ordered, but there's certain kinds of magic to which I am not attracted
[05:02.760 --> 05:06.400]  because then I go, huh, how's it doing that?
[05:06.400 --> 05:07.400]  It's kind of weird.
[05:07.400 --> 05:12.480]  I also think I, and I think you're like me and maybe it's an old, old person's thing,
[05:12.480 --> 05:18.640]  you know, and we just have this, however old you are, and if somebody who's older than
[05:18.640 --> 05:25.920]  me and you and has even stronger feelings about the personal part of a personal computer
[05:25.920 --> 05:28.640]  to encapsulate it.
[05:28.640 --> 05:34.320]  But like the way that like Zoom and Chrome update themselves and you're, you have no
[05:34.320 --> 05:35.480]  option about it.
[05:35.480 --> 05:36.840]  There's no, nowhere to dig.
[05:36.840 --> 05:37.840]  And Skype.
[05:37.840 --> 05:38.840]  Skype and Skype.
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.780]  That was why Call Recorder, I think finally threw in the towel, threw in the towel.
[05:41.780 --> 05:45.200]  Because they, they couldn't keep up with, there is no, there's not a P list.
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.200]  There's not a terminal command.
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.360]  I'm not aware of any way to tell Skype, please stop updating.
[05:50.360 --> 05:51.800]  Just stop.
[05:51.800 --> 05:53.860]  Just tell me if you have to do it.
[05:53.860 --> 05:57.760]  But like people who accept that that's good.
[05:57.760 --> 06:02.360]  And there are people who will argue with you that, that this is good because people don't
[06:02.360 --> 06:06.400]  update, you know, they don't click through, they, you know, they, they, they let their
[06:06.400 --> 06:13.120]  software stagnate because, because it's not broken, so they don't want to mess with anything.
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.120]  Right.
[06:14.120 --> 06:15.120]  Which used to be a sensible...
[06:15.120 --> 06:20.320]  I have to harangue my family just to do basic iOS updates because that's been a big deal
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.320]  since the summer.
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.040]  It's like, hey, by the way, do your iOS like right now, because there's something in the
[06:26.040 --> 06:27.680]  wild that's a little janky.
[06:27.680 --> 06:28.680]  Right.
[06:28.680 --> 06:32.320]  And I'll be like, I'll tell my kid about some feature that would be perfect for her and
[06:32.320 --> 06:36.320]  she'll be like, well, she'll go and look, oh yeah, I'm on, you know, iOS seven or whatever.
[06:36.320 --> 06:39.680]  I like it that way.
[06:39.680 --> 06:43.160]  But on the other hand, it's like, to me, so I get the motivation.
[06:43.160 --> 06:50.720]  I don't think that the people who implement these auto update, no option features, I get
[06:50.720 --> 06:51.720]  what they're thinking.
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.760]  And they're thinking, we know better than you because...
[06:53.760 --> 06:56.160]  That's a kind of enterprise approach.
[06:56.160 --> 06:57.160]  It is.
[06:57.160 --> 06:58.760]  It's an enterprise approach to personal computing.
[06:58.760 --> 07:06.040]  But the problem is, and maybe I'm wrong to draw analogies to the real world, but if I
[07:06.040 --> 07:15.060]  woke up and it started the day, it's Wednesday, tomorrow, I wake up and I look at my keys
[07:15.060 --> 07:16.060]  and I only care.
[07:16.060 --> 07:17.060]  I have two keys.
[07:17.060 --> 07:24.060]  I have a key to the house and I have a key to a post office box and I've got a little...
[07:24.060 --> 07:29.120]  Success in life at a certain point becomes the fewer number of keys that you need.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.960]  I don't want to look like a jailer.
[07:30.960 --> 07:35.520]  I'm very happy to have, I have exactly two keys on my ring and that is it.
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.120]  I was very upset though when I got the P.O. box because, and I think you and I have talked
[07:39.120 --> 07:42.280]  about this, you kind of have to have the P.O. box, right?
[07:42.280 --> 07:45.760]  But I put it off for years.
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.880]  The two things that I procrastinated on for way too many years after clearly this was
[07:51.880 --> 07:59.500]  going to be my career, this daring fireball stupid thing, was getting an actual LLC for
[07:59.500 --> 08:03.180]  the business, which I did at this point, I don't know, 10, 12 years ago.
[08:03.180 --> 08:04.180]  It's a long time.
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.360]  I've had it for a very long time, but I still, it was, I was years late doing it.
[08:08.360 --> 08:13.160]  And the second part was getting a P.O. box to get mail.
[08:13.160 --> 08:17.880]  It annoyed me though, because until then I only had one key, one key just to the house
[08:17.880 --> 08:21.240]  and I could just put that one key in that little jeans pocket.
[08:21.240 --> 08:22.240]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[08:22.240 --> 08:24.640]  I still keep my keys in that pocket.
[08:24.640 --> 08:25.640]  But two...
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.200]  And your Levi's like the, what they call the watch pocket?
[08:27.200 --> 08:28.280]  Yeah, the watch pocket.
[08:28.280 --> 08:29.280]  But for me, it's a keys pocket.
[08:29.280 --> 08:32.160]  Over the years that pocket has reflected many changes in my life.
[08:32.160 --> 08:33.560]  It's been for guitar picks.
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.760]  It's been for arcade tokens.
[08:36.760 --> 08:40.560]  For a long time it was for Imodium, as I'm glad I don't need as much anymore.
[08:40.560 --> 08:43.840]  But the watch pocket is a boom companion.
[08:43.840 --> 08:49.240]  Speaking about irregularity, regular publishing.
[08:49.240 --> 08:54.760]  You know, this is, I don't know how, I just, I'm just the centrifugal force of the pain
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.360]  in life somehow constantly leads me back to bitching about technology, which is, it's
[09:00.360 --> 09:03.320]  excruciating and I'm really sorry anybody asked here, but this has actually become a
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.320]  theme fairly often, including on today's Back to Work with Dan, which is when you talk about
[09:08.320 --> 09:15.520]  the personal part of PC, like I am entirely aware of the benefits that come from somebody
[09:15.520 --> 09:18.080]  taking care of that stuff for me.
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.000]  And like you say, I mean, there's, especially like if you're in enterprise or as we used
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.600]  to say a large company, if you're in a large company, like you need to know that your stuff's
[09:25.600 --> 09:26.600]  going to get updated.
[09:26.600 --> 09:29.960]  You know that like the screensaver is going to, there's all kinds of stuff, no games allowed,
[09:29.960 --> 09:30.960]  whatever that is.
[09:30.960 --> 09:36.320]  But the part that I think it's sort of frustrating when you do stop, and this is an old person
[09:36.320 --> 09:43.160]  problem to an old person, you can look at that any way you want, a computer is personal,
[09:43.160 --> 09:44.160]  right?
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.960]  And this is a very like Syracuse idea of like, I want my windows to do this and stop changing
[09:48.960 --> 09:49.960]  that.
[09:49.960 --> 09:54.440]  And you know, it's like you say with your keys, like I never opened my silverware drawer
[09:54.440 --> 09:56.280]  and find an ad for Viagra.
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.400]  Like there's certain kinds of things where like, or like I like that my smoke alarm doesn't
[10:00.400 --> 10:05.720]  just go off or announce that like they got a good deal on crypto.
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.000]  Like there's certain kinds of things where the benefit of it is that I never have to
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.360]  worry that it has become something else when I looked away.
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.200]  And it's that feeling of like, this feels less and less like my thing because you keep
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.280]  like some kind of hectoring nanny, you're constantly correcting me about how you want
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.920]  me to use this.
[10:26.920 --> 10:30.040]  And there are benefits from that and security from that in some cases.
[10:30.040 --> 10:35.440]  But in other cases, it becomes wildly, wildly frustrating, especially if you get, you know,
[10:35.440 --> 10:38.160]  kind of ungraceful silent fails that don't have any troubleshooting.
[10:38.160 --> 10:39.160]  Yeah.
[10:39.160 --> 10:43.080]  Where I was going with the key thing is if I woke up and one of my two keys was new,
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.920]  if it was like new and shiny, like let's say my house key, right?
[10:46.920 --> 10:52.760]  And all of a sudden my Schlage, instead of being, you know, five, six years old and having
[10:52.760 --> 10:58.600]  that sort of patina of an older key, it was a brand new shiny brass key.
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.360]  I would be freaked out, right?
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.600]  I'd be like, that's not my key.
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.040]  What the hell happened?
[11:03.040 --> 11:09.160]  And then if I went down and we had new locks on our doors and maybe, you know, if I fished
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.000]  through our, our physical mail, there'd be like a note that says, Hey, we upgraded the
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.920]  locks on your door to a improved security.
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.840]  And the release notes are like, we're releasing regularly to get up to the latest features
[11:20.840 --> 11:24.160]  and we've squashed some bugs and like, you know what?
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.680]  It'll be like Greg writing notes for drafts, like, really?
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.800]  Can you tell me what actually happened instead of just going, we're improving your GrubHub
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.800]  experience?
[11:32.800 --> 11:39.280]  Like my GrubHub experience is like, is typically quite excruciating and like, you know, there's
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.000]  that update day where like whatever runs, whatever the Chrome of restaurant delivery
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.360]  services and you see like nine updates from all of the apps in one day, squashing bugs.
[11:49.360 --> 11:50.360]  Squashing bugs.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.360]  Yeah.
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.760]  But I, people would rightly freak the hell out if, if without ever having agreed to it,
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.080]  there was some kind of like door lock service that just replaced the locks on your house's
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.080]  doors.
[12:03.080 --> 12:08.720]  And what went into your pocket and like gave you the new key, like people would rightly
[12:08.720 --> 12:09.720]  freak out.
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.960]  Whereas maybe, Hey, at least ask me if I would like this service, you know, and then let
[12:14.960 --> 12:15.960]  me know.
[12:15.960 --> 12:19.480]  But maybe I would opt into it at a level where you have to ring, you know, ding dong, ring
[12:19.480 --> 12:20.480]  the doorbell.
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.720]  It's easier to change the locks.
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.800]  It's also because like, I mean, I don't, again, I don't want to pitch too much.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.640]  We had talked about, I think it may be talking a little bit about stuff.
[12:29.640 --> 12:30.640]  People might be missing.
[12:30.640 --> 12:31.640]  That's really cool.
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.880]  In the Apple world, like I have a few things I'm always sort of recommending to people
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.700]  that I've captured here in your document, but it's, it's, it is beneficial to get updates
[12:41.700 --> 12:43.320]  that keep security and all that kind of stuff.
[12:43.320 --> 12:49.820]  But if you've done virtually anything to improve the way things interact with each other, which
[12:49.820 --> 12:54.900]  is in a lot of ways, what we use these dumb things for, you know, your scripts break or,
[12:54.900 --> 12:59.360]  you know, something I I'm sorry, I'm going to say this, I, and I'll mention this later.
[12:59.360 --> 13:06.180]  I love doing shortcuts via HomePod, but for the second time, like in maybe this quarter
[13:06.180 --> 13:12.560]  shortcuts have utterly shat the bed on HomePod and all my, all my HomePod shortcuts that
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.900]  I made stopped working, which is all fine because it just means I watch Hulu slower.
[13:17.900 --> 13:23.780]  But what if you have an actual business where you've built shortcuts to run in that way?
[13:23.780 --> 13:28.440]  What if you like the things that Tim said on stage and he get in a given June and you
[13:28.440 --> 13:31.300]  said, I'd love to do that as well, it'd be available in fall.
[13:31.300 --> 13:37.640]  And then when it is available, like it might just, it might just poop itself egregiously
[13:37.640 --> 13:38.640]  in the food court.
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.380]  And then you tell your boss, you know, it's okay.
[13:42.380 --> 13:43.380]  It's computers.
[13:43.380 --> 13:44.380]  You know, they're helping us.
[13:44.380 --> 13:45.380]  It's not that personal.
[13:45.380 --> 13:48.380]  It's not a personal computer now.
[13:48.380 --> 13:49.380]  Oh man.
[13:49.380 --> 13:50.380]  All right.
[13:50.380 --> 13:51.380]  Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[13:51.380 --> 13:52.380]  Why not?
[13:52.380 --> 13:53.380]  Right.
[13:53.380 --> 13:54.380]  Tell me about something you like.
[13:54.380 --> 13:55.380]  What's going on?
[13:55.380 --> 13:56.380]  What do you got there?
[13:56.380 --> 13:59.740]  Well, Hey, let me start by telling you about Linode.
[13:59.740 --> 14:00.740]  Linode?
[14:00.740 --> 14:01.740]  Oh, you guys know Linode?
[14:01.740 --> 14:02.740]  You know Linode.
[14:02.740 --> 14:03.740]  Linode?
[14:03.740 --> 14:04.740]  Is it Linode?
[14:04.740 --> 14:05.740]  No, no, no, no.
[14:05.740 --> 14:08.420]  It's, it's, it's Linus Torvalds.
[14:08.420 --> 14:10.580]  It's I think, so it really should be lean.
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.460]  I don't want to be a dick about it literally, but I think it probably should be Linode,
[14:14.460 --> 14:18.100]  but you know, they've got plans to start it like, well, what if it started like $5 a month?
[14:18.100 --> 14:19.100]  Oh my God.
[14:19.100 --> 14:20.100]  Yeah.
[14:20.100 --> 14:21.100]  It's crazy.
[14:21.100 --> 14:25.980]  Visit linode.com slash the talk show and see why Linode has been voted the top infrastructure
[14:25.980 --> 14:29.980]  as a service provider by both G2 and TrustRadius.
[14:29.980 --> 14:34.340]  Look, I don't know who G2 or TrustRadius are, honestly.
[14:34.340 --> 14:35.340]  Let me tell you this.
[14:35.340 --> 14:37.660]  I host Daring Fireball at Linode.
[14:37.660 --> 14:41.980]  Not because they sponsor, I've been hosting there for years now before they ever sponsored
[14:41.980 --> 14:46.340]  because they're just, it's, it just rock solid web hosting.
[14:46.340 --> 14:47.900]  It's just tremendous.
[14:47.900 --> 14:54.620]  They have award winning support offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a
[14:54.620 --> 14:59.460]  year to every level of user, including, you know, you get like the, I think they call
[14:59.460 --> 15:00.580]  it the nano plan.
[15:00.580 --> 15:01.860]  I think that's what you were talking about.
[15:01.860 --> 15:04.940]  It's like five bucks a month and you need help.
[15:04.940 --> 15:05.940]  You get help.
[15:05.940 --> 15:10.420]  You don't have to be like a big spender with a big quote unquote enterprise plan.
[15:10.420 --> 15:11.420]  Get the basic plan.
[15:11.420 --> 15:14.700]  You still get the great tech support and it is so easy to use.
[15:14.700 --> 15:19.560]  They have a great web interface to all of their services.
[15:19.560 --> 15:25.420]  It is why developers have been trusting Linodes for projects, both big and small since 2003.
[15:25.420 --> 15:30.380]  You can deploy your entire application stack with their one click app marketplace.
[15:30.380 --> 15:34.720]  So if you need to install blah, blah, blah, you just go through, there it is.
[15:34.720 --> 15:36.580]  You say, install this, there it is.
[15:36.580 --> 15:40.760]  You get it right through the web interface or you can build it all from scratch and manage
[15:40.760 --> 15:45.980]  everything yourself with all the Unix nerdy goodness that you'd expect.
[15:45.980 --> 15:51.740]  They offer the best price to performance value for all compute instances, including GPU's
[15:51.740 --> 15:56.540]  as well as block storage, Kubernetes, and their upcoming bare metal release.
[15:56.540 --> 15:59.660]  You're just saying words now.
[15:59.660 --> 16:04.340]  It looks like these all, well, what are the, what are they, when the vote for what trust
[16:04.340 --> 16:10.220]  fund and brand Buster trust fund, trust fund, brand Buster G2 trust radius.
[16:10.220 --> 16:11.220]  Right?
[16:11.220 --> 16:14.900]  They make power cloud computing, fast, simple, and affordable.
[16:14.900 --> 16:22.300]  Go to Linode L I N O D E.com slash the talk show and create a free account with your Google
[16:22.300 --> 16:24.140]  or get hub account.
[16:24.140 --> 16:25.900]  Or you could just use your email address.
[16:25.900 --> 16:29.900]  And when you do it by going through that URL, you get a hundred dollars in credit, a hundred
[16:29.900 --> 16:30.900]  bucks.
[16:30.900 --> 16:33.280]  Hey, you know, that ain't jump change.
[16:33.280 --> 16:34.280]  That's a lot.
[16:34.280 --> 16:35.280]  That's a lot of money.
[16:35.280 --> 16:36.860]  You know, they're headquartered right here in Philadelphia.
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.860]  I did not know that.
[16:37.860 --> 16:38.860]  Are they part of cable town?
[16:38.860 --> 16:39.860]  Nope.
[16:39.860 --> 16:40.860]  Well, not yet.
[16:40.860 --> 16:41.860]  Oh, well.
[16:41.860 --> 16:42.860]  Give them time.
[16:42.860 --> 16:44.900]  Give them time.
[16:44.900 --> 16:50.340]  But right now they're independent and their headquarters television and television and
[16:50.340 --> 16:52.060]  microwave oven program.
[16:52.060 --> 16:53.620]  I have yet to visit them.
[16:53.620 --> 16:54.620]  They're very nice.
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.900]  There's a couple of people there who I probably listened to the show.
[16:56.900 --> 17:02.100]  John, John, a bunch of the things that I listened to, I happen to know are hosted on Linode.
[17:02.100 --> 17:03.100]  Things like the incomparable.
[17:03.100 --> 17:06.500]  There are people like your, our, our buddy, Jason, like they were in their whole operation
[17:06.500 --> 17:07.500]  on Linode.
[17:07.500 --> 17:13.900]  They, but their headquarters, their headquarters are in a section of Philadelphia that we call
[17:13.900 --> 17:18.540]  old city, which is like, like lots of stuff in Philadelphia.
[17:18.540 --> 17:22.220]  Is that where Mac buys his cool sleeveless t-shirts?
[17:22.220 --> 17:27.500]  Quite possibly, quite probably would be where Mac would buy his sleeveless t-shirts.
[17:27.500 --> 17:29.580]  It is the old part of the city.
[17:29.580 --> 17:32.140]  Like, you know, guess where South Philly is?
[17:32.140 --> 17:33.140]  It's south.
[17:33.140 --> 17:34.140]  That's it.
[17:34.140 --> 17:35.140]  Okay.
[17:35.140 --> 17:36.140]  And then, you know what?
[17:36.140 --> 17:37.900]  You guys keep it real straightforward there, don't you?
[17:37.900 --> 17:38.900]  Yeah.
[17:38.900 --> 17:39.900]  We just keep it real simple.
[17:39.900 --> 17:40.900]  And who's you're not allowed to be taller than?
[17:40.900 --> 17:41.900]  Is it William Penn?
[17:41.900 --> 17:42.900]  Ben Franklin?
[17:42.900 --> 17:43.900]  Who are you not allowed to be taller than?
[17:43.900 --> 17:44.900]  William Penn.
[17:44.900 --> 17:45.900]  But then they, they got rid of that in the eighties.
[17:45.900 --> 17:48.780]  That, that's, that's why we have, we have real skyscrapers now.
[17:48.780 --> 17:56.820]  But until, Ooh, I'm going to say 1984, the city hall has a statue of William Penn atop.
[17:56.820 --> 18:00.220]  And that was supposedly, that was the, you couldn't be, couldn't build anything taller
[18:00.220 --> 18:01.460]  than William Penn's hat.
[18:01.460 --> 18:04.300]  As long as Mike Schmidt's alive, you're not allowed to build anything taller.
[18:04.300 --> 18:05.300]  That was the rule.
[18:05.300 --> 18:06.300]  And-
[18:06.300 --> 18:07.420]  Oh, so, so what's, what's called action, John?
[18:07.420 --> 18:09.740]  Where are people supposed to go to get on the Linode?
[18:09.740 --> 18:12.100]  Linode, linode.com slash the talk show.
[18:12.100 --> 18:13.100]  There you go.
[18:13.100 --> 18:14.100]  They got the article in there, which is nice.
[18:14.100 --> 18:15.100]  Yeah.
[18:15.100 --> 18:16.100]  Hey.
[18:16.100 --> 18:17.100]  Oh, I always appreciate that.
[18:17.100 --> 18:19.180]  I don't like to mention it too much anymore because I don't want to-
[18:19.180 --> 18:21.780]  Well, you mention it when people don't, and I think that's entirely reasonable.
[18:21.780 --> 18:22.780]  They're just letters.
[18:22.780 --> 18:23.780]  They don't cost anything.
[18:23.780 --> 18:30.340]  Do you, do you get a lot of printed catalogs mailed to your house?
[18:30.340 --> 18:31.340]  Oh, John.
[18:31.340 --> 18:32.340]  Oh my God, John.
[18:32.340 --> 18:33.340]  Yes.
[18:33.340 --> 18:34.340]  Yes.
[18:34.340 --> 18:35.340]  Yes.
[18:35.340 --> 18:36.340]  Yes.
[18:36.340 --> 18:39.300]  It makes our, our little sack that catches our mail groan.
[18:39.300 --> 18:42.260]  And I don't, I don't, first of all, we're liberal suckers.
[18:42.260 --> 18:48.660]  So we get, you know, the ACLU, you guys, I love you, but it's a bridge too far.
[18:48.660 --> 18:49.740]  It needs to stop.
[18:49.740 --> 18:52.660]  So calls need to stop.
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.340]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[18:54.340 --> 19:00.740]  Well, but like, I mean, no shade, no lemonade, but hand to God, the ACLU has become like
[19:00.740 --> 19:04.460]  letting me know my car warranty is, is expiring.
[19:04.460 --> 19:05.460]  It's bad.
[19:05.460 --> 19:09.100]  And then I think I'm on some kind of podcast advertising sucker list.
[19:09.100 --> 19:10.100]  Oh, that's me.
[19:10.100 --> 19:11.100]  Yes.
[19:11.100 --> 19:12.100]  Have you gotten, have you gotten bundle?
[19:12.100 --> 19:13.100]  B-U-N-D-L?
[19:13.100 --> 19:14.500]  No, I haven't gotten that one yet.
[19:14.500 --> 19:15.500]  No, I don't think so.
[19:15.500 --> 19:20.740]  Oh, it's like the Casper mattress, the blankets, the blanket startup, John.
[19:20.740 --> 19:25.240]  I don't know how that's even possible, but it is remarkable how many of the catalogs
[19:25.240 --> 19:26.240]  I get.
[19:26.240 --> 19:28.780]  You can easily tell which ones are meant for Amy.
[19:28.780 --> 19:30.820]  Don't be sick of using a spoon.
[19:30.820 --> 19:32.780]  That's not right for you.
[19:32.780 --> 19:34.100]  Try Spooner.
[19:34.100 --> 19:36.100]  It's S-P-U-N-R.
[19:36.100 --> 19:37.100]  I don't know.
[19:37.100 --> 19:43.580]  You know, there's, there's, there must be 700 companies that are vaguely competitive
[19:43.580 --> 19:53.220]  with, let's say like athlete or Lululemon, you know, sort of women's athleisure athleisure.
[19:53.220 --> 19:54.220]  Right.
[19:54.220 --> 19:59.580]  So, you know, Amy has, you know, a lot of that, those type of pants and, and she works
[19:59.580 --> 20:00.580]  out a lot, right?
[20:00.580 --> 20:01.580]  Oh yeah.
[20:01.580 --> 20:02.580]  She works out like a, like a mofo.
[20:02.580 --> 20:07.860]  No, she does not run, but, uh, she does the, uh, she lifts, she lifts, you know, oh, I
[20:07.860 --> 20:08.860]  don't know.
[20:08.860 --> 20:09.860]  Yeah.
[20:09.860 --> 20:10.860]  Like 300 pounds.
[20:10.860 --> 20:11.860]  She'd bench you.
[20:11.860 --> 20:12.860]  Oh yeah.
[20:12.860 --> 20:13.860]  Easily.
[20:13.860 --> 20:14.860]  Yeah.
[20:14.860 --> 20:15.860]  Easy.
[20:15.860 --> 20:16.860]  She, if we arm wrestled, she would just snap my arm right off.
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.860]  I wouldn't even get involved in that.
[20:17.860 --> 20:18.860]  No.
[20:18.860 --> 20:21.900]  It is, it is weird though, because I mean, obviously there must be seemingly, obviously
[20:21.900 --> 20:25.820]  there must be the kind of thing we always imagine, which is like, you're on a list.
[20:25.820 --> 20:26.820]  Like, yeah.
[20:26.820 --> 20:31.260]  I mean, like I want to give St. Jude's all the money, but like somewhere, I think my
[20:31.260 --> 20:36.980]  name fell off the back of a truck and now we get so much personal email from, from president
[20:36.980 --> 20:38.700]  Biden and vice president Harris.
[20:38.700 --> 20:40.740]  And I literally, I run up the stairs.
[20:40.740 --> 20:42.460]  So, so my wife can hear me coming.
[20:42.460 --> 20:45.380]  I run in screaming, stop what you're doing.
[20:45.380 --> 20:48.480]  You just got in a personal note from, from president Biden.
[20:48.480 --> 20:54.180]  So you might want to just really, you know, time block some time to really get in there.
[20:54.180 --> 21:00.300]  It is my job in the house is, is the person who scoops up all the mail when it comes in.
[21:00.300 --> 21:01.300]  Yeah, me too.
[21:01.300 --> 21:02.940]  It's the, cause it's the least I could do, right?
[21:02.940 --> 21:08.260]  I mean, it's literally all the little chores that somebody has to be responsible for.
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.980]  I'm coming up anyway.
[21:09.980 --> 21:10.980]  It's minimal.
[21:10.980 --> 21:14.340]  I'm the greedy bastard who picks all of the easiest ones, right?
[21:14.340 --> 21:15.940]  Like, Oh, you know what else I do?
[21:15.940 --> 21:17.060]  I take the garbage out.
[21:17.060 --> 21:18.060]  Guess what's easy.
[21:18.060 --> 21:21.220]  You know, what's really easy taking the garbage out on Sunday night.
[21:21.220 --> 21:22.220]  It's nowhere.
[21:22.220 --> 21:25.100]  You know where it goes and I know where it is.
[21:25.100 --> 21:26.700]  It's in our, we have a garage.
[21:26.700 --> 21:27.700]  That's where it is.
[21:27.700 --> 21:30.100]  It's already been wrapped up and deposited throughout the week.
[21:30.100 --> 21:34.820]  It takes 10 minutes and you'd go out there and, but you know, it that way, nobody else
[21:34.820 --> 21:35.820]  has to worry about it.
[21:35.820 --> 21:36.820]  But anyway, I scoop up.
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.140]  I'm the garbage czar for our entire building.
[21:39.140 --> 21:40.140]  I do.
[21:40.140 --> 21:42.940]  I'm the garbage czar for all garbage in the building and I wouldn't when new tenants move
[21:42.940 --> 21:47.980]  in in the other flat, I will tell them, just so you know, Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
[21:47.980 --> 21:49.700]  Please don't smoke inside.
[21:49.700 --> 21:53.620]  And um, I am the garbage czar, so I know which order the cans go in.
[21:53.620 --> 21:55.980]  I know, I know which way the lids should go.
[21:55.980 --> 21:58.740]  If they're in a different order, the czar ain't happy.
[21:58.740 --> 21:59.740]  I love that job.
[21:59.740 --> 22:00.740]  I treasure it.
[22:00.740 --> 22:01.740]  And it's right.
[22:01.740 --> 22:04.660]  It's really right about at my pay grade, you know?
[22:04.660 --> 22:09.380]  So there, there is no threat that Amy is going to take over the job.
[22:09.380 --> 22:14.060]  She doesn't want to, but she does get angry at me because what I will do is we'll get
[22:14.060 --> 22:15.320]  20 catalogs.
[22:15.320 --> 22:20.100]  And I think to myself, these, a lot of them are exquisitely well printed.
[22:20.100 --> 22:24.500]  Some of the, you know, like, uh, yeah, clothing catalogs and I got a nice, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:24.500 --> 22:28.500]  But like with a full bleed on really nice, not even paper, almost like cardboard.
[22:28.500 --> 22:29.500]  Yep.
[22:29.500 --> 22:30.500]  Yep.
[22:30.500 --> 22:34.140]  And then you got to pay for the little tapy, tapy circles that like keep it closed and
[22:34.140 --> 22:40.420]  you open it up and it's like a blanket startup, man, uh, the, uh, I love their stuff.
[22:40.420 --> 22:41.420]  They're not a sponsor.
[22:41.420 --> 22:44.060]  I don't think they've ever sponsored the show, but, uh, American giant.
[22:44.060 --> 22:49.140]  They're the company that somehow famously like 10 years ago, Farhad Manju wrote an article
[22:49.140 --> 22:52.900]  for slate that was like the greatest hoodie ever made.
[22:52.900 --> 22:54.980]  Oh, that was a, yes.
[22:54.980 --> 22:58.740]  I think they might be based here because it was, they were constantly talking about, and
[22:58.740 --> 23:03.740]  I got that ad, like at the bootle ad all the time about how this was the, uh, this is the
[23:03.740 --> 23:05.500]  hoodie nobody can keep in stock.
[23:05.500 --> 23:10.300]  And once this article went off and, and they're, they're, they are made in America.
[23:10.300 --> 23:13.700]  You know, it's, it, they are high, I love in San Francisco.
[23:13.700 --> 23:19.100]  Um, but once this article took off, they, their hoodie that the article was about was
[23:19.100 --> 23:22.080]  backordered for like eight months because there was, and there was like nothing they
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.080]  could do about it.
[23:23.080 --> 23:24.080]  They're like, we're making them.
[23:24.080 --> 23:27.420]  So like, like you did with the Mack Weldon slippers, you almost put them out of business.
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.420]  Yeah.
[23:28.420 --> 23:29.420]  Well, hold that thought.
[23:29.420 --> 23:30.420]  Guess who's sponsoring this show.
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.420]  Oh boy.
[23:31.420 --> 23:32.420]  Oh boy.
[23:32.420 --> 23:33.980]  Um, we're going to clean their clock today.
[23:33.980 --> 23:38.180]  Let's pick something real, real obscure that they probably don't have much, uh, the, uh,
[23:38.180 --> 23:39.180]  the American giant.
[23:39.180 --> 23:40.780]  They now I've ordered their products.
[23:40.780 --> 23:41.780]  I love their products.
[23:41.780 --> 23:44.940]  Are you familiar with the YKK zipper company?
[23:44.940 --> 23:45.940]  Yes.
[23:45.940 --> 23:46.940]  That's how you know it's well-made.
[23:46.940 --> 23:47.940]  Right.
[23:47.940 --> 23:48.940]  So the Y.
[23:48.940 --> 23:49.940]  Seriously.
[23:49.940 --> 23:51.940]  So I mean, you, I don't learn this from you, but it's my understanding that if you see
[23:51.940 --> 23:57.400]  a YKK zipper in front of your business, if you, if you've got a YKK front in your junk,
[23:57.400 --> 23:58.700]  you know, that's a well-made garment.
[23:58.700 --> 24:00.340]  John, here's the thing about a zipper.
[24:00.340 --> 24:04.020]  A zipper is the kind of thing you don't think about until it's not working the way you expected.
[24:04.020 --> 24:05.020]  Right.
[24:05.020 --> 24:09.140]  It's like, it's like furniture in your life, but like a zipper has a sort of, I want to
[24:09.140 --> 24:11.060]  say I'm, I'm, I don't read the trades.
[24:11.060 --> 24:14.100]  I want to say like a locking mechanism, like on your fly.
[24:14.100 --> 24:15.100]  Right.
[24:15.100 --> 24:19.740]  We're like, it'll kind of lock a little bit and you don't realize a good zipper does that
[24:19.740 --> 24:20.980]  until it don't.
[24:20.980 --> 24:24.900]  And then all of a sudden, you know, you're in, you're all together, you know, with, with
[24:24.900 --> 24:29.460]  your Y2K in your hand and a good zipper will take care of that for you and you shouldn't
[24:29.460 --> 24:31.460]  have to think about it.
[24:31.460 --> 24:33.340]  And I'm just, I sent you a photo just now.
[24:33.340 --> 24:34.340]  Yes.
[24:34.340 --> 24:40.580]  Tom Bihn maker of, I think the best backpacks totally uses a heavy duty Y2K zipper.
[24:40.580 --> 24:41.580]  YYK?
[24:41.580 --> 24:42.580]  YYZ?
[24:42.580 --> 24:43.580]  Look at that.
[24:43.580 --> 24:44.580]  Look at that photo.
[24:44.580 --> 24:45.580]  Isn't that a beautiful zipper?
[24:45.580 --> 24:46.580]  I'll put that right in the show notes.
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.580]  Okay.
[24:47.580 --> 24:48.580]  Thanks.
[24:48.580 --> 24:49.580]  Usually it's just for tabs.
[24:49.580 --> 24:50.580]  Usually it's just for tabs.
[24:50.580 --> 24:53.820]  But if you, I'm telling you and, and I'm telling you, if you've never heard of this company
[24:53.820 --> 24:56.920]  and, and you'll think, this is what I thought when I learned about this, cause I only learned
[24:56.920 --> 25:01.300]  about this company, I don't know, five, six years ago.
[25:01.300 --> 25:06.820]  But it, it, it's like that usual suspects, uh, denouement, you know, where it's like,
[25:06.820 --> 25:10.680]  all of a sudden, you know, they're like, oh, it was, you know, it was, that guy was always
[25:10.680 --> 25:11.680]  Kaiser Sose.
[25:11.680 --> 25:13.360]  You know, zipper Sose all along, right.
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.860]  And it's like, you know what I have my whole life, I have noticed YKK on a bunch of zippers.
[25:18.860 --> 25:19.860]  You don't think about it.
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.860]  You don't think about it.
[25:20.860 --> 25:24.020]  But it's always been in the back of my head that I've seen it.
[25:24.020 --> 25:26.120]  And I didn't even know if it was a brand name.
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.780]  I didn't know if it was like a, maybe like an ISO technical standard, right?
[25:29.780 --> 25:32.460]  Like a size or something, you know, I don't know.
[25:32.460 --> 25:33.460]  I don't.
[25:33.460 --> 25:34.460]  Yeah.
[25:34.460 --> 25:35.460]  Right.
[25:35.460 --> 25:39.340]  You know, like you learn these tricks in life and God, we got to talk about something else.
[25:39.340 --> 25:43.740]  The, the, um, you learn this in life where like there's tricks, like for example, and
[25:43.740 --> 25:46.860]  I'm just, I'm pulling these out of my ass, but like the YKK zippers is an extremely good
[25:46.860 --> 25:47.860]  one.
[25:47.860 --> 25:53.260]  Another one is like when you get a necktie, I think I made Ben Thompson really mad twice.
[25:53.260 --> 25:57.860]  One time I made fun of guys who were photographed in neckties and he got so fucking mad at me.
[25:57.860 --> 26:00.500]  And then another time I did literally make fun of the word enterprise and he got mad
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.500]  at me about that too.
[26:01.500 --> 26:02.500]  Hey Ben.
[26:02.500 --> 26:06.660]  Um, the um, but, but neckties, you know, the thing about the number of threads, you count
[26:06.660 --> 26:09.380]  the number of threads and that's like how well it's made.
[26:09.380 --> 26:14.380]  You can think about, for example, does this jacket have lining or do these gloves have
[26:14.380 --> 26:15.380]  lining?
[26:15.380 --> 26:19.260]  There's all these things that lets you know how much care went into that.
[26:19.260 --> 26:24.580]  And if you're an idiot like me and you mostly just buy clothes on the internet, you have
[26:24.580 --> 26:25.580]  to go somewhere.
[26:25.580 --> 26:28.380]  It's nice to know that this one's probably nicer than that one.
[26:28.380 --> 26:33.040]  And you can tell by the way the seam is done or you can tell the quality of the extra buttons
[26:33.040 --> 26:34.220]  at the bottom.
[26:34.220 --> 26:37.940]  I think the people in the know, if this was the forties, John, we would know this stuff
[26:37.940 --> 26:38.940]  inside out.
[26:38.940 --> 26:39.940]  Mm hmm.
[26:39.940 --> 26:44.220]  No, there's definitely something, you know, there, you know, there's, uh, there's certain
[26:44.220 --> 26:50.380]  things where I'm never going to know the difference between like a truly great men's suit and
[26:50.380 --> 26:52.740]  uh, just a good men's suit, right?
[26:52.740 --> 26:54.340]  Like I, I don't wear suits.
[26:54.340 --> 26:56.220]  I don't have an eye for fashion.
[26:56.220 --> 27:01.720]  But you know, you, you can kind of learn with a couple of tips that you can keep memorized.
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.220]  You can kind of know the difference between a truly ill fitting man's suit, like the kind
[27:07.220 --> 27:09.940]  our former president, you know, typically wears.
[27:09.940 --> 27:12.740]  Like you, you, those pants are pretty big, weren't they?
[27:12.740 --> 27:13.740]  What is jacket?
[27:13.740 --> 27:14.740]  They were like jenko jeans.
[27:14.740 --> 27:18.340]  I mean, you get that photo of him and the North Korean fella and they're both wearing
[27:18.340 --> 27:19.340]  their stovepipe pants.
[27:19.340 --> 27:21.340]  It's a hell of a look.
[27:21.340 --> 27:23.380]  What's he, what's he got in there?
[27:23.380 --> 27:30.820]  You know, it's fruit, you know, but yes, but you could tell, I watched the second X-Men
[27:30.820 --> 27:33.060]  or sorry, X-Men first class, which is one of my favorites.
[27:33.060 --> 27:37.420]  And I think I, I think I might have a little bit of a thing for Michael Fassbender, you
[27:37.420 --> 27:38.420]  know, I love him.
[27:38.420 --> 27:40.140]  And so I mean, I love him in Inglorious Basterds.
[27:40.140 --> 27:44.500]  I love him in all those things and like, he's wearing this when he goes to see the guy in
[27:44.500 --> 27:47.980]  Switzerland, the guy with the feelings, remember he's wearing like a suit and he's got like
[27:47.980 --> 27:52.280]  an overcoat and he has so many suits and he's got a waistcoat and I'm like, God, and you're
[27:52.280 --> 27:59.380]  shaped like a, like a narrow, like you're shaped like a inconsolata condensed letter
[27:59.380 --> 28:03.020]  V. You're exquisite, your entire body makes sense.
[28:03.020 --> 28:07.300]  Now, I don't know if that's the suit of the Fassbender, but you do notice, you notice when
[28:07.300 --> 28:11.340]  somebody wears something that looks, that's like what my friend used to Chris, my friend
[28:11.340 --> 28:16.020]  Chris used to call the appearance in court suit or the appearance in court shirt.
[28:16.020 --> 28:19.380]  Like something somebody got you out of lost and found so that you could meet the dress
[28:19.380 --> 28:20.380]  code.
[28:20.380 --> 28:28.880]  Well, they are like, if you, I know that these sort of establishments are a vanishing breed,
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.440]  but if you, if you enter an establishment with a requirement that men need to be wearing
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.660]  a jacket, sometimes they'll, they'll have, in New York City, there's like, you know,
[28:37.660 --> 28:39.700]  people dress so much more formally there.
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.700]  You know what I mean?
[28:40.700 --> 28:41.700]  Like I would just wear suits all the time.
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.700]  At least they used to in Manhattan.
[28:42.700 --> 28:43.700]  Yeah.
[28:43.700 --> 28:47.620]  And I think they would, they would like give you like a loaner jacket, which is really
[28:47.620 --> 28:50.220]  upsetting.
[28:50.220 --> 28:55.440]  But you know, and, and depending on your circumstances, you know, like it might be, if it were just
[28:55.440 --> 29:00.400]  me and you and we were out and we went to, let's say, let's go eat here.
[29:00.400 --> 29:04.620]  And they came in and they said, and they, and they said, we've instituted a policy.
[29:04.620 --> 29:06.020]  You need to have a coat.
[29:06.020 --> 29:09.620]  We would probably just look at each other and say, well, you know, we'll noted for the
[29:09.620 --> 29:11.540]  next time, but we'll just go somewhere else.
[29:11.540 --> 29:12.540]  Right.
[29:12.540 --> 29:15.660]  But if let's say you're a check in the box, but like, you know, if there's like a whole
[29:15.660 --> 29:19.500]  party who's already there and you don't want to be left out and you're the only jerk who
[29:19.500 --> 29:22.220]  didn't have one, you'll just put, put their loaner jacket on.
[29:22.220 --> 29:23.220]  But you know what?
[29:23.220 --> 29:29.460]  It's probably going to be a roomy fit because, you know, a smaller man can fit in a large
[29:29.460 --> 29:30.460]  jacket.
[29:30.460 --> 29:32.800]  Whereas a larger man cannot fit in a smaller jacket.
[29:32.800 --> 29:37.420]  So I do tend to think that the loaners, you know, tend to err on the side of right.
[29:37.420 --> 29:41.460]  You're going to get like a, like a 44 wide, right?
[29:41.460 --> 29:42.460]  Is that a size?
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.460]  I don't, I don't know.
[29:44.460 --> 29:45.460]  Yeah.
[29:45.460 --> 29:48.620]  Have you ever been to, when's the last time you were at a place where you ran into that
[29:48.620 --> 29:51.740]  sort of rigmarole?
[29:51.740 --> 29:58.380]  I mean, there are, this being San Francisco and this being the pandemic era, I mean, you
[29:58.380 --> 30:02.580]  know, we don't go out over much, but when you do go almost anywhere in San Francisco,
[30:02.580 --> 30:03.900]  it's, it's pretty cash.
[30:03.900 --> 30:08.040]  Not least I think because of, you know, tourists like those, the goddamn Germans, I feel so
[30:08.040 --> 30:09.040]  bad for them.
[30:09.040 --> 30:12.380]  They come here in the summer and they wear their short pants, they're short and hosen.
[30:12.380 --> 30:15.660]  And I feel so bad for them because they have no idea that it's going to be 50 degrees every
[30:15.660 --> 30:16.660]  day.
[30:16.660 --> 30:20.300]  And, uh, but I think that it's pretty casually, I'm trying to think of situations.
[30:20.300 --> 30:25.220]  I have to tell you, John, I've been to a few, I've been to a fair number of really quite
[30:25.220 --> 30:27.100]  good restaurants in terms of cuisine.
[30:27.100 --> 30:32.160]  I have not been to that many places where you really feel like there's a place in Tampa.
[30:32.160 --> 30:33.500]  I think I've talked to you about this place.
[30:33.500 --> 30:35.980]  I feel like I've talked to everybody, Tampa, Florida.
[30:35.980 --> 30:38.340]  There's a place called Burns Steakhouse.
[30:38.340 --> 30:41.540]  I don't think you have talked to me about this, but oh my God, you got to look this
[30:41.540 --> 30:43.140]  place up, uh, run by a guy.
[30:43.140 --> 30:44.900]  Actually I went to Brady's Bits.
[30:44.900 --> 30:48.740]  I went to military school with his son, uh, the guy's name is Burn Laxer and I think he
[30:48.740 --> 30:49.740]  might've passed.
[30:49.740 --> 30:51.540]  How do you, how do you, how do you spell burn?
[30:51.540 --> 30:52.540]  B-E-R-N.
[30:52.540 --> 30:53.660]  B-E-R-N.
[30:53.660 --> 30:55.300]  So not, not a Mr. Burn.
[30:55.300 --> 30:56.300]  It's a...
[30:56.300 --> 31:01.300]  No, no, but you, um, but this place, and I mean, I could go, I could just go on about
[31:01.300 --> 31:02.300]  this place.
[31:02.300 --> 31:04.140]  They have their own organic farm.
[31:04.140 --> 31:07.580]  All of their seafood is live on premises till they make it.
[31:07.580 --> 31:12.220]  They have, they, you can get a tour of their wine cellar, which is really, doesn't do justice,
[31:12.220 --> 31:14.260]  but you'd go look up Burns B-E-R-N.
[31:14.260 --> 31:17.540]  That's the place where you go in and it really does have like the whole like flocked paper,
[31:17.540 --> 31:23.220]  uh, wallpaper sort of, uh, this looks, I don't know, like a sex worker place from Deadwood.
[31:23.220 --> 31:25.900]  Like it's really, it's pretty epic.
[31:25.900 --> 31:31.820]  Like you expect, you expect, you expect Clementine to come up and say so much of a rhyme on you.
[31:31.820 --> 31:32.820]  All right.
[31:32.820 --> 31:33.820]  This is something too.
[31:33.820 --> 31:34.820]  I know that...
[31:34.820 --> 31:35.820]  That's the kind of place where you got to wear a jacket.
[31:35.820 --> 31:36.820]  You got to wear a jacket.
[31:36.820 --> 31:37.820]  You got to wear a jacket.
[31:37.820 --> 31:38.820]  You're like me.
[31:38.820 --> 31:44.340]  That's the kind of place where, where, where you will peruse, I will peruse the in-flight,
[31:44.340 --> 31:47.580]  uh, American Airlines magazine for like the top 10 steakhouse.
[31:47.580 --> 31:48.580]  Yes.
[31:48.580 --> 31:49.580]  Right.
[31:49.580 --> 31:51.380]  And there's that and the plastic surgeons.
[31:51.380 --> 31:52.380]  I always look forward to that.
[31:52.380 --> 31:54.860]  They don't even put SkyMall in the pocket anymore.
[31:54.860 --> 31:59.100]  They got the, they got the plastic surgeons, they got the, uh, uh, orthodontia, right?
[31:59.100 --> 32:00.100]  Lawyers.
[32:00.100 --> 32:01.100]  I think lawyers.
[32:01.100 --> 32:02.700]  Lawyers are a big one.
[32:02.700 --> 32:07.420]  And then there's always like a feature article at the top 10 steakhouses in America.
[32:07.420 --> 32:14.020]  And number one, you know, I love a steakhouse and number two, I just love, it's bananas
[32:14.020 --> 32:21.020]  to me that it's one magazine that they print thousands of copies of, put it in every single,
[32:21.020 --> 32:25.720]  you know, whether it's United's or American, whatever, you know, every single American
[32:25.720 --> 32:32.860]  Airlines flight has this exact same magazine, but they've got 10 steakhouses from 10 random
[32:32.860 --> 32:35.760]  cities around North America.
[32:35.760 --> 32:41.040]  What percentage of people ever even go, like what percentage of Americans have, have ever
[32:41.040 --> 32:43.220]  or will ever go to Tampa, Florida?
[32:43.220 --> 32:44.220]  Not me.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.220]  I've been there.
[32:45.220 --> 32:46.220]  I actually have been to Tampa.
[32:46.220 --> 32:47.220]  I had to.
[32:47.220 --> 32:48.220]  It's a lovely place.
[32:48.220 --> 32:53.400]  It's, you know, it's, it's yeah, but like the steak stuff is obviously those are paid
[32:53.400 --> 32:54.700]  placements and that's all fine.
[32:54.700 --> 32:58.100]  Ditto for the surgeons, but you're like, you're sitting there and you're like, oh, you know,
[32:58.100 --> 32:59.100]  we're going to land soon.
[32:59.100 --> 33:03.080]  I guess I'll, I would always look at the SkyMall or the in-flight magazine, like kind of like
[33:03.080 --> 33:06.580]  after they made the announcement that we're going in, that is by the way, also the only
[33:06.580 --> 33:08.740]  appropriate time to talk to someone in the next seat.
[33:08.740 --> 33:09.740]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[33:09.740 --> 33:13.860]  You must be silent until then because now at this point, you know, like we're, neither
[33:13.860 --> 33:16.680]  of us is a lunatic and we have 10 minutes till we land.
[33:16.680 --> 33:20.740]  But I just imagine somebody like flipping through there and being like, huh, I've been
[33:20.740 --> 33:25.660]  thinking about rhinoplasty and there is a photo of a guy with a stethoscope here.
[33:25.660 --> 33:29.180]  And he's in Boca Raton, Florida.
[33:29.180 --> 33:30.180]  I should check him out.
[33:30.180 --> 33:31.180]  Huh?
[33:31.180 --> 33:32.180]  He's one of the top 10, huh?
[33:32.180 --> 33:33.180]  That's wild.
[33:33.180 --> 33:34.180]  Right.
[33:34.180 --> 33:36.180]  Do you ever wonder if J.D. Power's a jam-up?
[33:36.180 --> 33:38.180]  I feel like it might be a jam-up.
[33:38.180 --> 33:43.060]  Not to speak ill of J.D. Power, but when they talk about those awards, do you ever wonder
[33:43.060 --> 33:47.820]  if that's one of those like, uh, like, uh, like, um, who has the list?
[33:47.820 --> 33:54.100]  They just pivoted, uh, Annie's list or the list, Angie's list or Yelp.
[33:54.100 --> 33:58.260]  You ever wonder if the J.D. Power thing, if maybe your Buick might not be as good as J.D.
[33:58.260 --> 33:59.260]  Power says it is?
[33:59.260 --> 34:01.260]  Does it feel like a paid placement a little bit?
[34:01.260 --> 34:03.300]  Like in a Webby or something?
[34:03.300 --> 34:04.300]  Yeah.
[34:04.300 --> 34:06.900]  I always thought Zagat's was sort of fishy.
[34:06.900 --> 34:10.820]  Yeah, but it's rustic and homespun.
[34:10.820 --> 34:11.820]  Yeah.
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.580]  But, you know, word of mouth is best.
[34:13.580 --> 34:18.020]  John, I'll put this in your document, but you've got to go look, even just look at the
[34:18.020 --> 34:22.580]  splashy image on, uh, on Burn Steakhouse, which you want to eat there.
[34:22.580 --> 34:23.580]  Look how red it is.
[34:23.580 --> 34:24.580]  Oh, man.
[34:24.580 --> 34:25.580]  That's, that's nice.
[34:25.580 --> 34:26.580]  Look at that.
[34:26.580 --> 34:29.060]  Oh, they have a section called What to Expect.
[34:29.060 --> 34:31.380]  Oh, my God.
[34:31.380 --> 34:32.380]  Yes.
[34:32.380 --> 34:33.380]  And yes.
[34:33.380 --> 34:34.380]  OK.
[34:34.380 --> 34:35.380]  Sorry.
[34:35.380 --> 34:36.380]  Sorry.
[34:36.380 --> 34:37.380]  Can I request a favorite server?
[34:37.380 --> 34:38.380]  Are pictures allowed?
[34:38.380 --> 34:39.380]  What can be done?
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.380]  What is the Corkage fee?
[34:40.380 --> 34:41.380]  Can I request a favorite server?
[34:41.380 --> 34:42.980]  It says here all Burn's servers are highly trained and very competent.
[34:42.980 --> 34:46.460]  However, if you have a favorite, oh, another thing, they have a steak menu that's chained
[34:46.460 --> 34:48.460]  to the table.
[34:48.460 --> 34:49.860]  Their menus are chained to the table.
[34:49.860 --> 34:51.140]  They have a tome.
[34:51.140 --> 34:56.060]  It looks like a Tibetan Book of the Dead, but for steer and you know, you go and then,
[34:56.060 --> 34:57.060]  oh, and they do.
[34:57.060 --> 34:58.060]  Oh, John.
[34:58.060 --> 34:59.060]  They talk about Caesar salads.
[34:59.060 --> 35:03.740]  Oh, the lie that we're living with the Arby's version of a Caesar salad is a goddamn shame.
[35:03.740 --> 35:08.460]  A very, a very tall man who looks like he maybe used to be in musical theater comes
[35:08.460 --> 35:09.460]  up.
[35:09.460 --> 35:13.500]  He's dressed like a performing monkey and he comes up and he makes you a Caesar salad
[35:13.500 --> 35:14.780]  right now at your table.
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.600]  He does the whole nine.
[35:16.600 --> 35:19.300]  It's it's oh, it's we got to know what we got to do this.
[35:19.300 --> 35:21.300]  We should Patreon this.
[35:21.300 --> 35:26.100]  I, I, you know, I love a steakhouse and my my steakhouse.
[35:26.100 --> 35:33.920]  If I finish on the side, if I had hit it rich, if I had, let's say, put all my money into
[35:33.920 --> 35:42.180]  Bitcoin 10 years ago and now I was a tech or a crypto gazillionaire, I would love, I
[35:42.180 --> 35:47.660]  would love to hang it up and just start my own steakhouse and not even if I could just
[35:47.660 --> 35:54.700]  run it at breakeven as a terrible thing in the world to run a restaurant.
[35:54.700 --> 35:58.300]  I know, but you know what makes it no, what makes it really hard project for you?
[35:58.300 --> 36:02.580]  Well, what I think what makes it really hard is staying in business.
[36:02.580 --> 36:08.540]  But if let's say that's like if I were if I were a hundred million dollars cushion to
[36:08.540 --> 36:13.580]  sit on and I could run a restaurant and, you know, let's say I lost a million dollars a
[36:13.580 --> 36:14.580]  year.
[36:14.580 --> 36:17.100]  Well, I could I could easily, you know, I could, you know, I don't know.
[36:17.100 --> 36:22.700]  OK, so sort of like the way there's a place in town, I think it's called Club DNA or DNA
[36:22.700 --> 36:23.700]  Lounge.
[36:23.700 --> 36:24.700]  Yeah, that guy.
[36:24.700 --> 36:26.440]  He's still got a live journal.
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.140]  He's the guy who used to be at Netscape and then he just started a cool club and he like
[36:30.140 --> 36:35.300]  gives people a break and stuff or or like you hear about with Robin Williams, R.I.P.,
[36:35.300 --> 36:39.940]  but like he and his wife would like they never just wasn't like widely publicly known.
[36:39.940 --> 36:40.940]  They certainly didn't promote it.
[36:40.940 --> 36:45.060]  But Robin Williams and his wife would be like they come in and go, oh, you know, our St.
[36:45.060 --> 36:46.060]  Jude's thing.
[36:46.060 --> 36:47.060]  We'd love to have it there.
[36:47.060 --> 36:48.060]  We'll take care of that.
[36:48.060 --> 36:49.060]  Just just come on it.
[36:49.060 --> 36:50.060]  You could do that.
[36:50.060 --> 36:51.060]  That could be you.
[36:51.060 --> 36:52.060]  But for Philadelphia.
[36:52.060 --> 36:53.060]  Right.
[36:53.060 --> 37:00.100]  Yeah, that's exactly the DNA lounge that Jamie and he, of course, is a text files guy, right?
[37:00.100 --> 37:01.820]  No, no, no.
[37:01.820 --> 37:03.020]  He's not the text files guy.
[37:03.020 --> 37:04.020]  It's a great club.
[37:04.020 --> 37:08.740]  I was there for the I was there with Matt Howie for the release of Mozilla 1.0.
[37:08.740 --> 37:09.740]  He's the guy, though.
[37:09.740 --> 37:16.660]  Jamie Z is the guy whose gravestone will have the quote something like regular expressions,
[37:16.660 --> 37:21.020]  regular expressions where there are some people when faced with a particular problem will
[37:21.020 --> 37:22.340]  say, I know what to do.
[37:22.340 --> 37:24.240]  I'll use regular expressions.
[37:24.240 --> 37:25.240]  Now you have two problems.
[37:25.240 --> 37:26.240]  Now you have two problems.
[37:26.240 --> 37:27.240]  Now you have two problems.
[37:27.240 --> 37:28.240]  So good.
[37:28.240 --> 37:29.240]  It'll be you should you should do.
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.620]  Would you call it Daring Fireball?
[37:30.620 --> 37:31.620]  No.
[37:31.620 --> 37:32.620]  No.
[37:32.620 --> 37:33.620]  I would.
[37:33.620 --> 37:34.620]  Amy, would Amy Jane be involved at all?
[37:34.620 --> 37:35.620]  Oh, of course.
[37:35.620 --> 37:36.620]  Probably.
[37:36.620 --> 37:37.620]  Well, she wouldn't go near it.
[37:37.620 --> 37:38.620]  Oh, no.
[37:38.620 --> 37:39.620]  I think I would be the hostess.
[37:39.620 --> 37:40.620]  Yeah.
[37:40.620 --> 37:41.620]  No, no, no.
[37:41.620 --> 37:45.340]  But like a hostess as in like, you know, like like Tandy Newton again in Westworld.
[37:45.340 --> 37:50.800]  Oh, she could be dressed up in some kind of like Diamond Horseshoe Review outfit and entertain
[37:50.800 --> 37:51.800]  people in the lounge.
[37:51.800 --> 37:52.800]  Oh, gentleman.
[37:52.800 --> 37:53.800]  Yeah.
[37:53.800 --> 37:54.800]  She'd be.
[37:54.800 --> 37:55.800]  She'd run the front of the house.
[37:55.800 --> 37:56.800]  And then anybody.
[37:56.800 --> 37:57.800]  So good.
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.020]  Make sure every regular always gets in and don't do not cross her.
[38:01.020 --> 38:02.020]  She did not cross her.
[38:02.020 --> 38:03.020]  Right.
[38:03.020 --> 38:06.060]  And then if you're on her good side, you could come in without a reservation, even, you know,
[38:06.060 --> 38:08.220]  Saturday night, you come in without a reservation.
[38:08.220 --> 38:11.100]  But if she knows you, she would spot you at the door.
[38:11.100 --> 38:17.260]  You wouldn't even have to before you could even awkwardly ask, hey, she knows, hey, I'm
[38:17.260 --> 38:18.300]  a regular.
[38:18.300 --> 38:20.100]  I know I don't have a reservation.
[38:20.100 --> 38:24.300]  And you can have an area where you store jackets that fit the regulars.
[38:24.300 --> 38:26.260]  So they could come in from not golf.
[38:26.260 --> 38:27.260]  That's bullshit.
[38:27.260 --> 38:30.940]  Let's say they were playing cornhole and they decided they really wanted a tasty dairy fireball
[38:30.940 --> 38:32.940]  fillet or baseball steak.
[38:32.940 --> 38:34.340]  I've seen you at a baseball steak.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.340]  Yeah.
[38:35.340 --> 38:36.340]  Right.
[38:36.340 --> 38:37.660]  What did you get that one time we went out with Rands?
[38:37.660 --> 38:39.500]  You got you got something asinine.
[38:39.500 --> 38:41.620]  Was it was it Wagyu or Kobe?
[38:41.620 --> 38:45.020]  You got something that was very, very weird.
[38:45.020 --> 38:46.500]  Oh, I know.
[38:46.500 --> 38:47.500]  Yeah.
[38:47.500 --> 38:48.500]  Where was that?
[38:48.500 --> 38:49.620]  Did you get like the rarest of the of the rare?
[38:49.620 --> 38:54.860]  Yeah, I got the the the the I don't know if it was actually Kobe, but it was definitely
[38:54.860 --> 38:57.780]  Japanese A5, which is really what you want.
[38:57.780 --> 39:00.060]  Like Kobe is the word Kobe.
[39:00.060 --> 39:03.060]  If it literally is Kobe certified, that's good.
[39:03.060 --> 39:04.300]  But it's not magic.
[39:04.300 --> 39:09.420]  It's just a word that people know it and it actually isn't like it should have a serial
[39:09.420 --> 39:10.420]  number.
[39:10.420 --> 39:13.980]  I watch a lot of Teppanyaki and steak videos because I'm broken inside and I know all about
[39:13.980 --> 39:14.980]  the serial numbers.
[39:14.980 --> 39:16.300]  So they actually show you.
[39:16.300 --> 39:17.300]  Yeah.
[39:17.300 --> 39:19.660]  So there's actually a certificate with like a hoofprint.
[39:19.660 --> 39:21.420]  I swear to God, I've gotten it.
[39:21.420 --> 39:24.020]  I've already gotten a certificate with much respect, sir.
[39:24.020 --> 39:29.540]  You are about to eat a steer with a how you say master's degree.
[39:29.540 --> 39:34.500]  I actually don't like it because the hoofprint sort of puts a yes, you know, it brings out
[39:34.500 --> 39:36.420]  the fool on the nose.
[39:36.420 --> 39:38.140]  Oh, no, that's what it is.
[39:38.140 --> 39:39.140]  It's a nose print.
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.140]  That's what it is.
[39:40.140 --> 39:41.140]  The hoof.
[39:41.140 --> 39:42.140]  Yeah, it is the nose.
[39:42.140 --> 39:43.140]  Call it on the nose.
[39:43.140 --> 39:45.460]  That could be the daring fire, a daring fireball joint.
[39:45.460 --> 39:47.340]  Would you have a drink special is my question for you now.
[39:47.340 --> 39:50.580]  I know you like your, your fella with the, what do you have coins in the bar?
[39:50.580 --> 39:51.580]  Who's that guy?
[39:51.580 --> 39:52.580]  What's that guy?
[39:52.580 --> 39:53.580]  What's that called?
[39:53.580 --> 39:58.100]  Lee Hopsing Laundromat and his name is now, would you have a drink special at club during
[39:58.100 --> 39:59.100]  firewall?
[39:59.100 --> 40:00.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[40:00.100 --> 40:04.900]  We, I would, I would definitely pay Lee to make at least, let's say three drinks, two
[40:04.900 --> 40:11.060]  or three cocktails, one Brown, one white and one, whatever Lee wants to make, actually,
[40:11.060 --> 40:13.700]  he wouldn't let me tell him that just cut the cut the guy loose.
[40:13.700 --> 40:16.220]  And can I just say, I don't want to give you notes on your place.
[40:16.220 --> 40:19.900]  This is your passion project, but can we also do a thing where the bartender doesn't explain
[40:19.900 --> 40:20.900]  the drink to me?
[40:20.900 --> 40:21.900]  Oh, absolutely.
[40:21.900 --> 40:22.900]  That would be forbidden.
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.220]  I need a, I need a hand signal for Lyft drivers.
[40:24.220 --> 40:27.020]  Like, look, seriously, we really don't need to have a conversation here, especially about
[40:27.020 --> 40:28.020]  black people.
[40:28.020 --> 40:31.820]  But also when I go to your bar, please don't explain how you make the ice.
[40:31.820 --> 40:35.700]  And like, it's so important to me that we not have a conversation.
[40:35.700 --> 40:36.700]  Absolutely not.
[40:36.700 --> 40:41.100]  Although on the, on the flip side of that, now you and my, we've eaten here many times
[40:41.100 --> 40:44.460]  to the house of prime rib in San Francisco, which is a fabulous place.
[40:44.460 --> 40:50.460]  And it's sort of the canonical ideal of a, of a steakhouse in some ways.
[40:50.460 --> 40:56.740]  But I remember one of the first times I was there with you and we had to wait a little
[40:56.740 --> 40:57.940]  bit for a table.
[40:57.940 --> 41:05.380]  So I went to the bar to get a martini and I was told, I tend to, I tend to go vodka
[41:05.380 --> 41:06.380]  martini.
[41:06.380 --> 41:10.500]  And, but I was told here at this establishment, you should definitely go more traditional
[41:10.500 --> 41:16.940]  get a martini made with gin and avoiding the whole argument, you know, avoid avoiding the
[41:16.940 --> 41:21.840]  whole religious argument that a true martini is only made with gin and a vodka martini
[41:21.840 --> 41:24.300]  isn't even a martini, which I don't believe.
[41:24.300 --> 41:28.220]  Saying vodka martini is like saying shrimp swimming pool.
[41:28.220 --> 41:29.820]  It's just, that's not even a thing.
[41:29.820 --> 41:30.820]  But whatever.
[41:30.820 --> 41:31.820]  But you enjoy it.
[41:31.820 --> 41:37.020]  You can order a Vesper and they give it to you in a literal, like a pint glass with a
[41:37.020 --> 41:40.740]  lid that's actually two and a half drinks.
[41:40.740 --> 41:44.180]  Well and also their martini glasses are my favorite in the world.
[41:44.180 --> 41:49.900]  I don't know if they have like 10,000 of them still in storage, like how do they keep procuring
[41:49.900 --> 41:50.900]  them?
[41:50.900 --> 41:55.980]  But you know exactly what I'm talking about where the stem is articulated.
[41:55.980 --> 42:02.460]  It has like, it's like an octagon shape instead of just being purely circular.
[42:02.460 --> 42:06.260]  You're going to want that true grip system after you've had a couple of those.
[42:06.260 --> 42:07.260]  Exactly.
[42:07.260 --> 42:08.600]  It's the true grip system.
[42:08.600 --> 42:13.420]  But I remember the first time I was there and I was, you or Scott or somebody had told
[42:13.420 --> 42:17.180]  me, told me, you know, don't, don't get a vodka martini, get it, you know, get it with
[42:17.180 --> 42:18.180]  gin in.
[42:18.180 --> 42:19.180]  And I said, I would like a martini.
[42:19.180 --> 42:20.940]  And he was like, what type of gin would you like?
[42:20.940 --> 42:22.340]  And I don't even know what I told him.
[42:22.340 --> 42:26.980]  I said, maybe let's just say, I said, what's that one that's made with cucumber?
[42:26.980 --> 42:27.980]  I forget what it is.
[42:27.980 --> 42:28.980]  I'm not sure.
[42:28.980 --> 42:30.380]  I don't know that much about it.
[42:30.380 --> 42:31.380]  I don't know.
[42:31.380 --> 42:33.220]  I get Hendrix or a Boodles.
[42:33.220 --> 42:34.220]  Oh Hendrix.
[42:34.220 --> 42:35.220]  But I think I said something else.
[42:35.220 --> 42:37.340]  And he goes, oh, so you want a bad martini?
[42:37.340 --> 42:38.340]  Whoa.
[42:38.340 --> 42:39.340]  Whoa.
[42:39.340 --> 42:41.940]  And I said, I said, how about this?
[42:41.940 --> 42:42.940]  How about you pick?
[42:42.940 --> 42:44.700]  And he goes, I like your style.
[42:44.700 --> 42:47.060]  And then, you know, I don't even know what the hell he gave me.
[42:47.060 --> 42:48.780]  Smartest thing you can say it all.
[42:48.780 --> 42:55.340]  I don't care if we're talking about tacos, hand stuff or martinis, just do the one you
[42:55.340 --> 42:56.340]  like.
[42:56.340 --> 42:57.340]  Right.
[42:57.340 --> 42:59.340]  And like that, you will always mostly be happy.
[42:59.340 --> 43:00.340]  Right.
[43:00.340 --> 43:01.340]  That place is amazing.
[43:01.340 --> 43:06.540]  It's just it's they were open a little bit during for pickup during the pandemic.
[43:06.540 --> 43:08.360]  But I believe they are.
[43:08.360 --> 43:10.660]  My wife, my wife knows how much I love that place.
[43:10.660 --> 43:13.620]  And it's kind of a special thing for us, our family, too.
[43:13.620 --> 43:17.260]  But they were booked at the time she was trying to get a reservation for my late November
[43:17.260 --> 43:19.340]  birthday, which was probably September.
[43:19.340 --> 43:22.020]  They were, I think, booked through the end of the year.
[43:22.020 --> 43:23.020]  That's crazy.
[43:23.020 --> 43:24.860]  But that's great to know that they're thriving.
[43:24.860 --> 43:28.100]  But well, I can't tell you a very quick, quick side story.
[43:28.100 --> 43:29.100]  Oh, of course.
[43:29.100 --> 43:30.100]  Super quick.
[43:30.100 --> 43:34.540]  Well, and then I want to hear about something you like.
[43:34.540 --> 43:37.860]  But OK, so House of Prime Rib is this place and it's I mean, like some people would call
[43:37.860 --> 43:41.420]  it touristy, but it's just really fun, old school.
[43:41.420 --> 43:44.460]  All their their their menu is comical.
[43:44.460 --> 43:49.460]  The menu is basically how big a piece of prime rib do you want and like, do you want corn
[43:49.460 --> 43:50.460]  or spinach?
[43:50.460 --> 43:52.820]  And then they just bring you stuff and they make a salad and they spin it around and we
[43:52.820 --> 43:57.900]  all clap like we're at the fucking Olive Garden because I'm anyway, that place is always so
[43:57.900 --> 44:00.620]  booked and everybody loves House of Prime Rib.
[44:00.620 --> 44:05.460]  There's a place, let's just say, in my neighborhood.
[44:05.460 --> 44:09.940]  It's technically considered a pop up, but I think you're really stretching the definition
[44:09.940 --> 44:10.940]  of a pop up.
[44:10.940 --> 44:15.460]  My wife, my wife says a pop up can be a place that's normally a restaurant and it's just
[44:15.460 --> 44:16.720]  not there permanently.
[44:16.720 --> 44:20.800]  Three days a week, there's a place that open not too far from here.
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.660]  And Thursday, I think Thursday, Friday and Saturday night, they basically do a House
[44:25.660 --> 44:28.400]  of Prime Rib style dinner.
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.800]  They have only medium rare.
[44:29.800 --> 44:31.180]  They have only these sides.
[44:31.180 --> 44:36.280]  They have these ones, but you show up and for about a third of the price of the House
[44:36.280 --> 44:41.560]  of Prime Rib, you get a roughly equivalent Sunset District version of House of Prime
[44:41.560 --> 44:42.560]  Rib.
[44:42.560 --> 44:43.560]  It is the best.
[44:43.560 --> 44:44.560]  Isn't that smart, though?
[44:44.560 --> 44:48.700]  It's like there's a place in Chinatown called House of Nanking, which is a really famous,
[44:48.700 --> 44:50.600]  like, you know, touristy Chinese place.
[44:50.600 --> 44:55.220]  And the place is so popular that a place open next to them that basically has the exact
[44:55.220 --> 44:57.180]  same terrible looking sign.
[44:57.180 --> 45:02.420]  I'm saying you can benefit and maybe you, especially with your new enterprise, maybe
[45:02.420 --> 45:05.780]  you get parked next to someplace really popular.
[45:05.780 --> 45:06.780]  Or maybe not.
[45:06.780 --> 45:10.780]  Maybe you're so picky about your readers, maybe you're the same way about your diners.
[45:10.780 --> 45:12.660]  Maybe you want to vet them.
[45:12.660 --> 45:13.660]  You know?
[45:13.660 --> 45:14.660]  Maybe.
[45:14.660 --> 45:15.660]  Do you have a feeling about that?
[45:15.660 --> 45:16.660]  Do you want it to be, you want it to be exclusive?
[45:16.660 --> 45:17.660]  No, not exclusive.
[45:17.660 --> 45:18.660]  Probably.
[45:18.660 --> 45:19.660]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[45:19.660 --> 45:20.660]  Every y'all are welcome here?
[45:20.660 --> 45:26.500]  But, you know, regulars get preference, and not because you're famous or anything like
[45:26.500 --> 45:27.500]  that.
[45:27.500 --> 45:28.500]  No, no, no, no, no.
[45:28.500 --> 45:29.500]  You're just a regular person.
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.500]  You're loyal.
[45:30.500 --> 45:31.500]  You're very loyal.
[45:31.500 --> 45:32.500]  And you're a good tipper, you know, and you're a polite person.
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.500]  Oh, you've got to be a good tipper.
[45:33.500 --> 45:34.500]  People don't tip enough, Jon.
[45:34.500 --> 45:37.420]  Well, you know, that's the number one way to get banned from opposing laundromat.
[45:37.420 --> 45:42.300]  I mean, people, he doesn't have, he used to have the sneaker rule.
[45:42.300 --> 45:46.620]  And again, that's sort of a dress code thing, right, where, you know, but he had a thing
[45:46.620 --> 45:47.620]  for the first five years.
[45:47.620 --> 45:51.380]  But it's also a way to filter out the snorks, and it gives you a reason to say, hey, no
[45:51.380 --> 45:52.380]  golf cleats.
[45:52.380 --> 45:57.940]  Yeah, no sneakers, but he, and I'm pals with him, and he would, he would sometimes tell
[45:57.940 --> 46:02.180]  me, like, you know, there would be, I won't drop any names, but there would be like professional
[46:02.180 --> 46:09.060]  athletes from Philadelphia who would pop in late at night and were, you know, semi-regulars.
[46:09.060 --> 46:14.980]  There were actually, it was for a stretch, there were a couple of the wives of the Philadelphia
[46:14.980 --> 46:19.220]  Phillies who were regulars at Hopsink.
[46:19.220 --> 46:22.860]  But there was one time where one of the players showed up at, you know, like midnight, you
[46:22.860 --> 46:26.580]  know, there's still two hours to go before last call, but he, you know, but he had sneakers,
[46:26.580 --> 46:27.580]  and he wouldn't let them in.
[46:27.580 --> 46:31.360]  And it was like, no exceptions, even if you're like a Philadelphia Philly.
[46:31.360 --> 46:36.240]  But he, he got rid of that rule on the fifth anniversary and said, okay, you know, this
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.060]  is untenable, the world, he more or less admitted that sneakers are too common.
[46:42.060 --> 46:45.700]  And maybe, you know, like with the, they're actually sponsoring Daring Fireball this week,
[46:45.700 --> 46:48.460]  but like Adams, there, there's sort of a...
[46:48.460 --> 46:49.460]  Right.
[46:49.460 --> 46:54.820]  Also, it's not as easy to, to eyeball, okay, so like, we'll, we'll like to, to paraphrase
[46:54.820 --> 46:58.380]  Raymond Carver, what we talk about when we talk about sneakers, I mean, what are we talking
[46:58.380 --> 46:59.380]  about here?
[46:59.380 --> 47:05.220]  Like, obviously we maybe don't want to wear your New Balance runners or your Keds, but
[47:05.220 --> 47:09.460]  there are a lot of comfortable shoes that are not sneakers, like, like in school, see,
[47:09.460 --> 47:12.140]  they got around this in the manuals at my school, where they would say things about
[47:12.140 --> 47:14.600]  hard-soled shoes or this, you know what I mean?
[47:14.600 --> 47:17.180]  They come up with all those, those kinds of things.
[47:17.180 --> 47:20.220]  And, but do you think it's harmed the place that the sneaker people get in now?
[47:20.220 --> 47:22.900]  Yeah, they get in and it's not a problem, but...
[47:22.900 --> 47:24.100]  Okay, cool.
[47:24.100 --> 47:28.780]  But you still, like, no sandals, like, so if you, a man in the summertime...
[47:28.780 --> 47:31.860]  That should, that should just be posted at the entrance to the United States.
[47:31.860 --> 47:32.860]  Right, there's...
[47:32.860 --> 47:33.860]  And I...
[47:33.860 --> 47:36.900]  You, you wear sandals in a room in your house, I can't get to, that's the place you wear
[47:36.900 --> 47:37.900]  sandals.
[47:37.900 --> 47:41.340]  If you wear Adidas sandals, you should probably be indicted.
[47:41.340 --> 47:44.980]  Nothing good has ever happened from, from a young man wearing Adidas shower sandals.
[47:44.980 --> 47:48.380]  And most famously by Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[47:48.380 --> 47:51.980]  That was all he wore for years and years, you know?
[47:51.980 --> 47:53.100]  That tells you all you need to know.
[47:53.100 --> 47:58.820]  No shorts either, you cannot get into Hopsin with shorts, but you know, he's relaxed it.
[47:58.820 --> 48:04.220]  But he does famously and he'll, he has a wonderful Instagram account and Twitter account where
[48:04.220 --> 48:11.180]  he posts this, but he, he keeps, he keeps this database in an Excel spreadsheet of every
[48:11.180 --> 48:14.220]  single person who has ever been to Hopsin.
[48:14.220 --> 48:18.000]  Like you, there is no way, and people think it's pretentious.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.980]  It is weird and it sounds like it's one of those crazy, fake, speakeasy places, right?
[48:23.980 --> 48:24.980]  Like...
[48:24.980 --> 48:25.980]  Oh, I hate those.
[48:25.980 --> 48:28.820]  Or one of those guys who spies on you in a motel.
[48:28.820 --> 48:31.280]  It's like, that's too many feet, man.
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.060]  So there's a, I don't know if they're still open, who knows, but there was a place in
[48:35.060 --> 48:37.380]  San Francisco, Bourbon and Branch.
[48:37.380 --> 48:42.980]  Don't even, don't, with the password, what's the password, library?
[48:42.980 --> 48:47.540]  So Bourbon and Branch in San Francisco, I think we might have, I think we probably have
[48:47.540 --> 48:48.540]  been.
[48:48.540 --> 48:49.540]  I know, I know I went there.
[48:49.540 --> 48:55.340]  It's like the haunted, it's like a haunted house for unfuckable men in hats.
[48:55.340 --> 48:59.860]  But the gimmick was you had to knock on the door, they slide a thing open and they go,
[48:59.860 --> 49:01.020]  what's the password?
[49:01.020 --> 49:04.980]  And if you don't know the password, they won't open the door, but the password is just something
[49:04.980 --> 49:05.980]  you can Google.
[49:05.980 --> 49:06.980]  I think it's library.
[49:06.980 --> 49:08.500]  Yeah, I don't know.
[49:08.500 --> 49:15.820]  But it seems like that type of place, because Hapsing has a gate at the front door, and
[49:15.820 --> 49:19.860]  like on a Friday or Saturday night, there's almost always a line of people waiting to
[49:19.860 --> 49:25.900]  go in, and he'll only seat as many people as there are actual seats available.
[49:25.900 --> 49:32.100]  So there's no, if they, if the demand were high enough, there is no way to get in and
[49:32.100 --> 49:33.340]  stand at the bar.
[49:33.340 --> 49:34.340]  You can't.
[49:34.340 --> 49:37.700]  It's, you know, but it's, you know, it's nice though that way because then everybody has
[49:37.700 --> 49:45.500]  a seat and the tables are actually not, they're even pre-COVID, spaciously located so that
[49:45.500 --> 49:49.780]  you can have a conversation with the people who you're with and you can actually hear
[49:49.780 --> 49:50.780]  them.
[49:50.780 --> 49:51.780]  It's very, very nice.
[49:51.780 --> 49:52.780]  Oh, yeah.
[49:52.780 --> 49:53.780]  Oh, it's really wonderful.
[49:53.780 --> 49:55.580]  I would love to go there someday.
[49:55.580 --> 50:00.960]  But you do have to, when it's your turn to come in, everybody in the party has to hand
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.220]  over their driver's licenses.
[50:03.220 --> 50:08.020]  And it's usually him, but if it's not him, it's somebody else, you know, who works there,
[50:08.020 --> 50:09.020]  and they take...
[50:09.020 --> 50:11.060]  Hand over as in he holds it for you or he inspects it?
[50:11.060 --> 50:12.980]  No, he takes them inside.
[50:12.980 --> 50:18.540]  He goes inside and then uses them as, you know, like, you know, looks you up in the
[50:18.540 --> 50:21.820]  database to see if you've ever been there before.
[50:21.820 --> 50:22.820]  And...
[50:22.820 --> 50:23.820]  Oh, my God.
[50:23.820 --> 50:27.580]  He takes them inside and that's how he keeps the banned list.
[50:27.580 --> 50:29.780]  And people, you know, there are people who got banned...
[50:29.780 --> 50:33.460]  Look at a bodega where it says, don't take checks from this person.
[50:33.460 --> 50:38.980]  Right, exactly, except he's got them in this Excel spreadsheet and he's posted screenshots
[50:38.980 --> 50:39.980]  of the spreadsheet.
[50:39.980 --> 50:41.980]  Oh, my God.
[50:41.980 --> 50:43.860]  That's amazing.
[50:43.860 --> 50:50.060]  But he will, and if you leave a bad tip, he logs it and you come back.
[50:50.060 --> 50:51.060]  And so, you know...
[50:51.060 --> 50:53.660]  Okay, now I'm coming around to this.
[50:53.660 --> 50:54.660]  Okay.
[50:54.660 --> 50:55.660]  I see.
[50:55.660 --> 51:00.100]  Or, like, maybe you tried to be a little bit of a jerk with the server or something.
[51:00.100 --> 51:01.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[51:01.100 --> 51:02.100]  You're out.
[51:02.100 --> 51:03.260]  You're, you know...
[51:03.260 --> 51:08.380]  If he might come over and ask you to leave now, if you're rude to the server...
[51:08.380 --> 51:09.380]  I love this guy.
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.740]  Every time you talk about this guy, he sounds so cool.
[51:11.740 --> 51:12.740]  Oh, that's just...
[51:12.740 --> 51:14.580]  He sounds like a real original.
[51:14.580 --> 51:18.540]  Oh, he's one of a kind, truly.
[51:18.540 --> 51:22.300]  It's a remarkable place, but honest to God, I mean, I think at this point...
[51:22.300 --> 51:24.980]  Seven, eight, nine years?
[51:24.980 --> 51:26.980]  Maybe it's getting close.
[51:26.980 --> 51:29.440]  Eight or nine years that he's been open.
[51:29.440 --> 51:34.460]  But the spreadsheet, he knew he was going to do that from day one.
[51:34.460 --> 51:35.460]  The spreadsheet...
[51:35.460 --> 51:36.460]  He had a vision.
[51:36.460 --> 51:37.460]  Right.
[51:37.460 --> 51:38.460]  Yeah.
[51:38.460 --> 51:47.520]  But if you run up a $35 tab and you leave $37 or something like that, then it goes on
[51:47.520 --> 51:51.780]  your thing, and the next time you show up, he'll tell you you're not allowed in because
[51:51.780 --> 51:53.340]  you left a bad tip.
[51:53.340 --> 51:54.340]  Wow.
[51:54.340 --> 51:57.020]  Now, you don't have to tip exorbitantly, right?
[51:57.020 --> 51:59.900]  You just leave your standard 18%, you'll be fine.
[51:59.900 --> 52:01.540]  That's A-OK.
[52:01.540 --> 52:06.500]  But you stiff the server with a bad tip, you'll never get in again.
[52:06.500 --> 52:10.220]  And there's people who show up, he tweets about it, like somebody who got banned four
[52:10.220 --> 52:15.020]  years ago, and they just figure, well, it was four years, he'll never remember me.
[52:15.020 --> 52:17.740]  Well, he does because he's got this spreadsheet.
[52:17.740 --> 52:21.060]  He's using technology.
[52:21.060 --> 52:24.420]  Now it's probably really important that that always work.
[52:24.420 --> 52:28.340]  Don't update my Excel if it's going to screw up my sheet because I need to know whose new
[52:28.340 --> 52:29.340]  tip's bad.
[52:29.340 --> 52:35.940]  The other thing, too, people love to say to him, it's usually him at the gate, but when
[52:35.940 --> 52:43.540]  they get mad or angry that they can't get in because of maybe it's a man wearing shorts
[52:43.540 --> 52:48.380]  or somebody who's on the list as a bad tipper, they'll say, I would like to speak to the
[52:48.380 --> 52:49.380]  owner.
[52:49.380 --> 52:53.980]  Oh, man, you've just made his night.
[52:53.980 --> 52:57.740]  He's waited all day for that.
[52:57.740 --> 53:01.380]  Anyway, where I was going with this was in the mail today.
[53:01.380 --> 53:04.340]  I got the Sharper Image catalog.
[53:04.340 --> 53:06.980]  Have you looked at the Sharper Image lately?
[53:06.980 --> 53:17.060]  No, but just off the dome, I thought Sharper Image used to be a force of nature, especially
[53:17.060 --> 53:21.380]  once they started selling those air filter things.
[53:21.380 --> 53:26.140]  But then I feel like they became like Yves Saint Laurent where I thought they were just
[53:26.140 --> 53:31.340]  licensing their name because, John, there's a whole end cap at our Walgreens that's Sharper
[53:31.340 --> 53:35.060]  Image stuff, which you would not have seen in, say, the 90s.
[53:35.060 --> 53:36.060]  They're still around.
[53:36.060 --> 53:40.020]  Are they still making or they're selling actual stuff from a catalog?
[53:40.020 --> 53:41.020]  Yep.
[53:41.020 --> 53:42.660]  It's exactly the sort of stuff.
[53:42.660 --> 53:43.660]  I had no idea.
[53:43.660 --> 53:45.060]  Anyway, I flipped through it.
[53:45.060 --> 53:48.340]  And again, this is what drives my wife nuts with me going through because now I want to
[53:48.340 --> 53:51.140]  talk to somebody about it because I flipped through.
[53:51.140 --> 53:57.760]  And one of the items about halfway through the catalog is the Bacon Express toaster.
[53:57.760 --> 54:00.180]  It's a $60 product.
[54:00.180 --> 54:03.180]  The code, if you want to look it up on their website, I don't know.
[54:03.180 --> 54:05.300]  It's also curious.
[54:05.300 --> 54:06.600]  They don't have URLs.
[54:06.600 --> 54:08.580]  They have numbers.
[54:08.580 --> 54:09.580]  It's product number two.
[54:09.580 --> 54:10.580]  This looks...
[54:10.580 --> 54:11.580]  I see.
[54:11.580 --> 54:12.860]  The bacon, I'll put it in notes.
[54:12.860 --> 54:15.140]  It's $207,656.
[54:15.140 --> 54:16.140]  Yeah.
[54:16.140 --> 54:17.140]  Okay.
[54:17.140 --> 54:19.620]  It gets five stars according to the one review.
[54:19.620 --> 54:24.540]  It's a healthier way to cook bacon and other foods to delicious perfection.
[54:24.540 --> 54:26.780]  Makes up to six strips of regular...
[54:26.780 --> 54:30.220]  Cooks it vertically, which is, you know, a whole paradigm.
[54:30.220 --> 54:32.780]  It converts to a nonstick griddle for pancakes.
[54:32.780 --> 54:35.060]  Indicator lights tell you when it's ready to cook.
[54:35.060 --> 54:36.060]  Okay.
[54:36.060 --> 54:37.060]  You think you want to get this?
[54:37.060 --> 54:38.060]  Oh, no.
[54:38.060 --> 54:39.060]  Definitely not.
[54:39.060 --> 54:40.060]  No.
[54:40.060 --> 54:41.060]  See, I've had a lot of bad luck.
[54:41.060 --> 54:43.020]  I've got something else.
[54:43.020 --> 54:46.420]  I've had a lot of bad luck with cute breakfast things.
[54:46.420 --> 54:51.060]  Like I'm the sucker who's bought a lot of those, the like Michael Scott in your life,
[54:51.060 --> 54:52.060]  who has...
[54:52.060 --> 54:58.100]  I've bought stuff like basically an Egg McMuffin Maker, and it makes a shitty version of every
[54:58.100 --> 55:00.380]  component of an Egg McMuffin.
[55:00.380 --> 55:01.540]  But it's cute about it.
[55:01.540 --> 55:04.900]  And there's some where you get rings and you build it like you work at Burger King.
[55:04.900 --> 55:05.900]  It's so odd.
[55:05.900 --> 55:11.140]  I think a bespoke breakfast maker is not generally a good idea.
[55:11.140 --> 55:12.140]  No.
[55:12.140 --> 55:13.140]  It's only 60 bucks, man.
[55:13.140 --> 55:14.140]  You could get a few of these.
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.140]  Yeah.
[55:15.140 --> 55:16.140]  No.
[55:16.140 --> 55:17.540]  I'm not allowed to bring anything else into the kitchen.
[55:17.540 --> 55:20.820]  I have a little cubby hole where I keep my...
[55:20.820 --> 55:25.420]  I have a nice, big, I forget the name brand, but whatever Marco told me to buy, coffee
[55:25.420 --> 55:30.220]  grinder, which was way too large for our previous kitchen.
[55:30.220 --> 55:31.740]  And we moved like five years ago.
[55:31.740 --> 55:32.740]  Now we have...
[55:32.740 --> 55:34.780]  Well, you said like a big like freestanding burr grinder kind of thing?
[55:34.780 --> 55:35.780]  Yeah.
[55:35.780 --> 55:38.260]  I forget what the hell it is.
[55:38.260 --> 55:40.180]  But whatever, it's whatever Marco told me to get.
[55:40.180 --> 55:41.900]  Well, if it's Marco, I'm sure it's four figures.
[55:41.900 --> 55:45.420]  But you wouldn't want to keep it out on the counter at all times.
[55:45.420 --> 55:46.420]  Yeah.
[55:46.420 --> 55:47.420]  Nobody has space for that.
[55:47.420 --> 55:50.500]  But I have a little cubby hole and I filled it up with coffee stuff.
[55:50.500 --> 55:55.500]  And that's all I'm allowed to bring into the kitchen because the rest of it is up.
[55:55.500 --> 55:56.500]  You know, it's Amy's area.
[55:56.500 --> 55:59.900]  You know, in the same way that she's not going to buy stuff to put into my office,
[55:59.900 --> 56:00.900]  right?
[56:00.900 --> 56:01.900]  She's not going to buy like...
[56:01.900 --> 56:02.900]  Yeah.
[56:02.900 --> 56:05.020]  I'll go where you work and slap the iPhone out of your mouth.
[56:05.020 --> 56:09.700]  Or she's not going to pick a new laser printer and just say, oh, I bought a printer.
[56:09.700 --> 56:10.700]  And now...
[56:10.700 --> 56:11.700]  Oh, boy.
[56:11.700 --> 56:12.700]  We have words.
[56:12.700 --> 56:13.700]  If my...
[56:13.700 --> 56:17.740]  I don't like to be like this, but I am the COO of CTO things.
[56:17.740 --> 56:25.500]  And like if something is brought into the house in that instance without my input, don't
[56:25.500 --> 56:29.980]  even get me started on the pre-lit Christmas tree we bought five years ago.
[56:29.980 --> 56:30.980]  Because...
[56:30.980 --> 56:31.980]  Because...
[56:31.980 --> 56:32.980]  And like...
[56:32.980 --> 56:33.980]  You know what?
[56:33.980 --> 56:34.980]  I'm going to tell you something we're going to talk about.
[56:34.980 --> 56:35.980]  I'm going to learn about Sharper Image.
[56:35.980 --> 56:38.180]  Did you want to tell me about anything else you liked?
[56:38.180 --> 56:39.180]  Yeah.
[56:39.180 --> 56:42.740]  Let's take a break here and talk about our friends at Mac Weldon.
[56:42.740 --> 56:44.740]  I'm not going to lie to you, Merlin.
[56:44.740 --> 56:45.740]  I jiggered the schedule.
[56:45.740 --> 56:46.740]  It's that time of year.
[56:46.740 --> 56:47.740]  It's that time of year.
[56:47.740 --> 56:52.580]  I rejiggered the schedule to get this into the episode with you because I know you've
[56:52.580 --> 56:53.900]  got strong feelings about it.
[56:53.900 --> 56:57.500]  Look, the holiday season is here and with it come the yearly questions of what do I
[56:57.500 --> 57:00.240]  wear to non-ugly sweater parties?
[57:00.240 --> 57:05.220]  How do I maximize my time savoring holiday moments and minimize my time shopping for
[57:05.220 --> 57:06.220]  gifts?
[57:06.220 --> 57:07.420]  Look, fear not.
[57:07.420 --> 57:08.420]  Go to Mac Weldon.
[57:08.420 --> 57:11.420]  M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N.
[57:11.420 --> 57:14.700]  They have all the answers, whether it's an office party, a party with family or friends,
[57:14.700 --> 57:18.100]  or just a party of you, your couch, and a game on TV.
[57:18.100 --> 57:19.920]  Oh, I love the football.
[57:19.920 --> 57:23.300]  Mac Weldon has all the essentials to keep you stylish and comfortable throughout the
[57:23.300 --> 57:28.740]  season and their innovative daily wear system has taken the hard work out of outfit planning
[57:28.740 --> 57:33.700]  with pieces designed to work together for any occasion, saving you time, sparing you
[57:33.700 --> 57:35.700]  any extra holiday stress.
[57:35.700 --> 57:37.940]  Man, I love their stuff.
[57:37.940 --> 57:42.460]  They've got these, uh, I'm not a sweat pant guy, but Syracuse had talked me into it last
[57:42.460 --> 57:43.460]  year.
[57:43.460 --> 57:44.460]  The Ace.
[57:44.460 --> 57:45.460]  The Ace sweat pants.
[57:45.460 --> 57:46.460]  Oh man.
[57:46.460 --> 57:47.460]  The Ace is a good pant.
[57:47.460 --> 57:48.460]  It's a very good pant.
[57:48.460 --> 57:49.460]  You know what?
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.460]  And modern sweat pants, they don't really have that old, uh, eighties.
[57:51.460 --> 57:55.300]  Can I literally beg you not to get started on this because this is the bane of my existence.
[57:55.300 --> 57:56.300]  I'm a man.
[57:56.300 --> 57:59.860]  I'm, I'm a loud and proud man with a short rise.
[57:59.860 --> 58:03.740]  You would not believe what I have to go through to get accommodating pants for my rise.
[58:03.740 --> 58:06.140]  No matter what you do, I get joke pants.
[58:06.140 --> 58:10.580]  I get pants that are too high, too long.
[58:10.580 --> 58:13.720]  And because I guess I'm a joke sized man, which is, which is fine.
[58:13.720 --> 58:18.020]  But if you find a sweat pant that you love, you put a ring on it and you're going to,
[58:18.020 --> 58:23.180]  the slippers, the shirts, the underpants, like I'm a big on their shirts.
[58:23.180 --> 58:24.240]  That's my big thing.
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.060]  But also, they probably don't even have them in stock because you've, you've destroyed
[58:28.060 --> 58:29.580]  the slipper industry.
[58:29.580 --> 58:34.420]  My friend Alex now calls the first time that they wear, uh, McWalden slippers in a given
[58:34.420 --> 58:35.540]  year because it's cold.
[58:35.540 --> 58:36.540]  Slippy season.
[58:36.540 --> 58:37.540]  Time for slippies.
[58:37.540 --> 58:38.540]  Yeah.
[58:38.540 --> 58:39.540]  You did that.
[58:39.540 --> 58:40.540]  You did that.
[58:40.540 --> 58:42.440]  I, I'm telling you, the slippers are insane.
[58:42.440 --> 58:46.100]  And I texted you, this is when we first scheduled this show a couple of weeks ago.
[58:46.100 --> 58:49.980]  What I did is, you know, and we, we've had, you know, chalk it up to, uh, it's probably
[58:49.980 --> 58:52.320]  half climate change and half just a fluke.
[58:52.320 --> 58:59.640]  But we had a sort of unseasonably warm October here, here in Philadelphia, uh, slipper season
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.280]  started late for me this year, but when I, when I went to the slippers, I, I opened up
[59:04.280 --> 59:05.280]  a new pair.
[59:05.280 --> 59:08.240]  Oh, that's the thing.
[59:08.240 --> 59:11.580]  You know, you love it when you got one in the chamber, you know what I mean?
[59:11.580 --> 59:15.720]  You know, I've always got one now because they sell, they, the last time we talked about
[59:15.720 --> 59:19.260]  it on the show, they sold out for weeks.
[59:19.260 --> 59:20.260]  You bury the needle.
[59:20.260 --> 59:21.260]  You, you, you all.
[59:21.260 --> 59:22.560]  You brought the whole company down.
[59:22.560 --> 59:24.760]  And then all I heard for months is where do I get the slippies?
[59:24.760 --> 59:30.200]  I can't help you, you know, but you know, you could go try the Pima long sleeve t-shirt
[59:30.200 --> 59:33.060]  that I have all of, I have all of them.
[59:33.060 --> 59:34.060]  You know, it also is great.
[59:34.060 --> 59:35.060]  They're white.
[59:35.060 --> 59:38.180]  Just, this sounds crazy, but they build their clothes.
[59:38.180 --> 59:39.440]  I don't know if they're cantilevered.
[59:39.440 --> 59:43.560]  I'm not an engineer, John, but the way they make their clothes is different.
[59:43.560 --> 59:49.320]  You get their white undershirts, you tuck them in, they stay tucked in, but they're
[59:49.320 --> 59:50.320]  not cute about it.
[59:50.320 --> 59:51.320]  They're just normal clothes.
[59:51.320 --> 59:54.840]  But I, I've been, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, 48 years old.
[59:54.840 --> 59:58.080]  I've, I've been wearing undershirts, you know, my whole life.
[59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.200]  Undershirts are, they tend to, you know, you can tell when an undershirt is a couple of
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.760]  years old and it's time to turn it into a rag, right?
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:11.040]  You know, you know, use it to, when the pits get yellow and waxy, it loses its shape.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.040]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040]  It's all watered up all the time.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.880]  I've, I've, I switched to Mack Weldon white undershirts years ago.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.760]  And I've never had to rebuy them because they all, they all still look brand new.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.120]  I can't tell how old they are, right?
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.560]  They still look like the day they were, you know, and you know, I'm, I'm hard on an undershirt.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.560]  You know, I wear them too.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.560]  Yeah.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.320]  Well, you go to a steakhouse and you work up a good meat sweat, you know?
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320]  That's true.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  That's true.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320]  Or, or like, yeah, screenshotting some tabs.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.600]  That's the kind of thing that's really going to put a hurtin' on a Hanes.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]  Sorry.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]  Sorry.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]  No, no, no.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600]  No shade.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600]  No lemonade.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  Cut that.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600]  Cut that.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600]  No disrespect to the fine folks at Hanes.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.080]  Whatever fruit is coming out of your loom, you do you.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.960]  I'm here to tell you when you're ready to grow up and you don't have to dress like a
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.360]  grownup, but you get to feel like a grownup because you're going to get clothes that fit.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]  They're extremely well-made.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.080]  They got cool ass zippers in them and this stuff, it really, really works.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]  I like their socks.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]  I like it all.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]  Like I say, I'm a shirt man.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.080]  I just, in the sense that I've, I've, you know, I'm, I'm, my Weldon blue is pretty fat
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080]  right now.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.160]  Let's just put it that way.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.840]  But I, I, their, their shirts are the perfect weight for how and where I live.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.040]  I don't feel like some kind of disused lumberjack, you know, nor do I feel like somebody who
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.440]  forgot their jacket on the first day of third grade.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.160]  I'm totally comfortable and I can pass as an adult when I go into places, which is kind
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160]  of the whole idea.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.600]  I kind of wear it to your steakhouse probably.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600]  Can I go to your steakhouse in a Mack Weldon shirt?
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]  Would that be good?
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  Yeah.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]  That's what we've got.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600]  We'd have a box of Mack Weldon's all sealed.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.480]  Also, by the way, that when you buy the new stuff, they come in the nicest packaging you've
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.480]  ever found.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480]  But it's not obtrusive.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.560]  It's not, it's not over much with the packaging.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.200]  Also, also most clothes I buy new clothes.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.200]  I generally wash before I wear the first time Mack Weldon stuff.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.880]  It smells like, ah, like freshly clean.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:07.080]  You know, the comedian, the comedian, Jerry Lewis was, was an unusual guy and he had one
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.200]  aspect of his life.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.840]  Well, there's a lot of aspects of his life to which I do not aspire, you know, having
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.720]  a loaded gun in the bathroom and like getting addicted to drugs and stuff.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.000]  But um, read the King of Comedy by Sean Levy.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.900]  It's a very good biography, but, uh, but you know what I do love Jerry, Jerry Lewis.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.540]  He showed up somewhere to do a gig.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.080]  You know what's in his rider?
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080]  Fresh pair of socks.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.760]  Jerry Lewis, as a grown man, never wore the same pair of socks twice.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.080]  Now I understand this a little bit wasteful and like, you know, we give one to, you know,
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:43.720]  like, ah, if I could just have just sort of like maybe, well, they wouldn't say this,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.320]  but like an American Psycho closet.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.080]  If I had a closet that was just piles and piles and piles of Mack Weldon clothes and
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.920]  bags, I wouldn't get one every time because they last for years.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.680]  That's the value proposition.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.680]  But like Nietzsche said, you know, it's a consolation to know that it's there.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.040]  I can rip into a new white t-shirt anytime and that would, I would really feel like I've
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040]  arrived.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.880]  You get a steakhouse, I get a pile of shirts.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.880]  Anyway, they've got these gift sets for the holidays and it's, they're fantastic.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]  What a concept.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.020]  One gift, it holds many gifts inside.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:17.060]  You can just go there, get somebody on your shopping list, one of their gift sets.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.560]  All you need to know is their size and they get a box full of all sorts of cool stuff
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.560]  for the holidays.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.960]  It's a great gift idea.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.760]  Plenty of time right now in early December, you could still do it with limited edition
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.100]  color drops and a bevy of new releases.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.760]  The holiday gift sets, truly a perfect present for any guy on your list.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.460]  That's why Mack Weldon is one of my favorites and here's what you get.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:46.360]  You get 20% off your first order just by using this URL, mackweldon.com slash the talk show.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360]  They get it.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.160]  They got classy, enter that same, that the code is the same thing.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.360]  The talk show, all one word.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.320]  Just take out the spaces and you get 20% off your first order.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:05.840]  My thanks to Mack Weldon for dressing me and being, you know, I think that maybe that would
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.260]  be the dress code.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.200]  Maybe we get them to sponsor the steakhouse and then you almost, you have to be wearing
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.520]  Mack Weldon to get in.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.120]  I'd say it would be a reason for them to really step up their game on the production of slippers
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.400]  if they knew everybody at the well-regarded Daring Fireball Steakhouse was going to be
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.960]  wearing their slippies while they enjoy their baseball Kobe.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.560]  Thank you Mack Weldon.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.560]  God.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.480]  And I don't have to think about it, John.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.840]  It's a very like Steve Jobs, Marco, Elizabeth Holmes kind of thing where I just don't want
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840]  to think about clothes.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]  All right.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.280]  I'm not thinking about anything, but like I know I grabbed one of these shirts and I'm
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280]  going to be happy.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.560]  I don't, you know, and it's like the Steve Jobs thing where he had the exact same sweater,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.120]  the turtleneck thing.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:54.640]  You kind of have to be a little more self-confident than I am to just say I'm going to just literally
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.680]  wear the exact same thing every goddamn day, including in public appearances.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.920]  You know, what's his name?
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]  Did the same thing.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.440]  Einstein had like a favorite blue sweater and then he supposed, I don't know, this could
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.840]  be one of the, you know, with Steve Jobs, we know it's true, but I think they're pretty
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]  good.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.840]  I think we did.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.840]  We find out that they're like from Japan and fairly costly.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.840]  Yeah.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.840]  They're very expensive.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.840]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.840]  And I don't think those are H&M sweaters.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840]  No, no.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.600]  There was some famous Japanese designer and he was like, I like this and he was like,
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.240]  I think maybe I'll just wear this every day.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.440]  And then like he called them up and he was like, I would like to buy all of your sweater,
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440]  you know, whatever.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440]  And they're like, no.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440]  How many do you want?
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.000]  He's like, I want them all.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.960]  But Einstein apparently did the same thing with like a blue sweater, you know, but you
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.040]  could, California, you could wear that.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.400]  Not everybody can pull that off.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.520]  I have a project I'm working on called the Wisdom Project where I add bullet points about
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.040]  things I've learned in life.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.360]  And one of them is to generally avoid clothing that's more interesting than you are.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.680]  And I think that also goes for just overall wardrobe, Weltanschau.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.920]  Like be careful that you're not being too cute.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.880]  You know, you might look more like a clown than you realize.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.680]  Well, that's why with the Mack Weldon stuff, like these Warm Net shirts are, again, call
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.040]  the sponsor read over.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:10.080]  I'm just telling you, it's, I don't know how they make it because it's t-shirt thickness,
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:16.440]  but somehow because it's like a waffle knit, it's warmer than some of my actual sweaters
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]  that I have.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.800]  And it fits better than most of my clothes.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.040]  Like I tend to buy oversized clothes because like I say, I don't like being aware of my
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.560]  physical existence.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.000]  I mean, I have to deal with that with bathrooms to begin with, but like as far as my clothes,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  no thank you.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.960]  But for some reason, they're t-shirts, they're, this is probably enough.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.600]  Mack Weldon, you guys, the talk show.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.960]  All right.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.160]  Before we move though, I want to go back to the steakhouse thing.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]  I want to go back.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.320]  I serve you your pleasure, Jon.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320]  Here's the point.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.840]  My point is, and A, if I, if I were sufficiently wealthy, I'd love to open a one of a kind
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.400]  steak house here in Philadelphia.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.680]  I don't want to have his chain.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.120]  You know, I don't want, no, I don't need the hassle.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.240]  I'm not in it for the money.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.820]  I would like one place.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:09.240]  But the other thing I, and I've toyed with this, I won't do it, but I feel like I could
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:18.320]  do it, is to write like a sort of a book about steakhouses and, and, or, and, or like a website
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.320]  like a Zagat's, but instead of for all restaurants, literally only for steakhouses.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:29.320]  And I get, so not the typical sort of trip, but maybe along the lines of, uh, uh, what
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.640]  is the guy with two first names, Rick Steves, but like one of those, like you, you do like
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.480]  a survey or I imagine the kind of thing Kenji Lopez-Alt could do.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.360]  Oh, well, he, he's, he's, he's way too talented.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.200]  But you don't have an insider view of something you care a lot about.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.200]  Right.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.240]  And, and, and like, it's not something cute like wine.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.080]  It's stuff where like, you can even talk about the overall, cause this is, I mean, jokes
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.380]  are left through them, John.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.440]  You care a lot about stuff that not everybody cares about, and I happen to share that.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.200]  And it's one thing, one of the very few things I admire about you is the fact that you do
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.800]  care about whether that's Ariel or, uh, Helvetica or, or whatever that, whatever that's going
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.800]  to be.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.720]  And I think that's cool about you is that you do have an internal barometer for whether
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.320]  something is classy or whether something is tasteful.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.540]  And I, I think people who have strong opinions about that and can explain why that is, not
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:24.000]  just go like, I heard the 2018 Beaujolais is really quite toothsome.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.160]  Instead, like you could actually talk about it in words that people understand.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.800]  You can explain why you didn't like that tab look.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.240]  And I, I think you could do that.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.720]  Does it have to be a coffee table book, but probably shouldn't be an ebook.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.440]  I think you should get an actual book, but you're right though.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.280]  But that's, that's the way my mind works, where I could never write a book about all
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.280]  of typography.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  Never.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.280]  I don't have the eye for it, but I could write about like a certain style of typography.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.840]  Like I have a type to put it one way, right?
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.760]  Like, yeah, well, you could certainly, you could certainly do like humanist grotesque,
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.640]  like that, that could be like, isn't that kind of a whole thing for you?
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.400]  I would be, what's the Paris airport one?
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.960]  What's the Paris airport one that I love?
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]  Oh, Frutiger.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960]  Yeah.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960]  Right.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960]  Adrian Frutiger, right?
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.960]  Right.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960]  Right.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960]  His name and namesake typeface.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960]  And it is.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.040]  That is an amazing, designed to be at the, I believe, De Gaulle airport.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040]  Yep.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.840]  And it is truly an extraordinary film.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.680]  And, and does certain things like it has those Ls, lowercase Ls with a little squiggle, which
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.840]  I don't generally like, but is terrific for signage so that there's no confusion whatsoever
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]  that it's a lowercase L.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.280]  There's a YouTube guy that I enjoy, a guy from, I want to say probably Australia, that
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.680]  does a lot of stuff about typography and he just did a wonderful thing.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.540]  He actually contributed to Atkinson Hyperlegible, which is such an interesting face.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.440]  If you haven't checked into it, it's really, really cool for that reason.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.920]  But in his videos, he shows you like, hey, for somebody who has this particular specific,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.000]  like, don't just, don't just wave your hand and go, I hope people who are blind can figure
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  this out.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  No, no.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.600]  If, what's the Don Knotts one that I don't, never want to have, the one with the middle
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.280]  of your eye, macular degeneration, like greatest fear in life.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.360]  Like, this is what your sign looks like to someone with macular degeneration for somebody
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  with dyslexia.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.200]  This is, and that's why we put a tail on the L because this is not about being clever.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.920]  This is about making people hit their plane on time.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.320]  Well, I, you could do that.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]  You should do that.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.680]  That'd be a good project for you when you retire.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.760]  The type one or the steakhouse one?
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760]  Well, I think both.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.320]  I mean, you could have an office there.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.920]  I'm thinking, yeah, you can have an incubator.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]  Here's, here's the thing.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.840]  So I am completely unsuited to reviewing restaurants in general.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.400]  Now I, you can, let's say I went to visit you and you said, hey, there's, you know what
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.680]  you like, but you do, that wouldn't be your wheelhouse.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]  Right.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.400]  But I, and it's not like everywhere I want to go, I always want to go to a steakhouse.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.120]  I'll, I'll, I'm up for anything.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.040]  I'll go to any, any, you know, Korean barbecue, I'll go to Italian place, I'll go, you know,
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.280]  wherever you want, I'll go and I'll be a good spirit and, and try to pick something I enjoy
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.280]  from it.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.800]  I would never think I could tell you afterwards, whether I enjoyed my dish, whether I enjoyed
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.760]  the service, but I would never think I could review the place because I don't, I don't
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:11.920]  have a, I can tell that I don't have an acute sense of what is good or bad or what's wrong
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.920]  about it.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.960]  But I could definitely, I can, I can go to a steakhouse and have a meal at a steakhouse
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.560]  and I can tell you every single thing that was good about it and exactly where they screwed
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.520]  up and what's wrong with the place.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  Right.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.000]  I think I know what you mean where it's like, there's certain kinds of things where like,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.640]  it's one problem with, I mean, I love TV and movies and I love talking about it and I love
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.880]  suggesting things to my friends and it's like practically an obsession.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.420]  My friends make fun of me cause I'm constantly like, you got to watch what we do in the shadows
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.000]  or like you've, you've got to watch, you know, yellow jackets or whatever.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.320]  And in some cases, if it's somebody who has a similar taste and sensibility, I can very
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.760]  much explain why.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.700]  And I feel like I've even gotten better at explaining it without spoilers.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:58.560]  So I mean, frequently I'll find myself saying things like, well, I know you like Synecdoche,
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.120]  New York, and I know you like Edgar Wright, so you might want to check this out.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.400]  And that's all I'm going to say about that.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.540]  If you trust, not, not like me or my taste, but if you, if you trust it, like we have
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.360]  enough similarity that you'll take a flyer.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.240]  It was like, that was, that was me in the leftovers with Syracuse, so where he was like,
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240]  this show is really weird.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.460]  You're probably going to hate it.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.040]  And now it's, it just recently surpassed the wire as my favorite TV show.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.040]  But when I'm on something like the incomparable, I feel like such an idiot.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.560]  Because I ended up saying like, oh, like Dr. Who or whatever.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.800]  Like I can't break it down in a way that makes any sense in a way that an actual critic could
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]  like David.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.320]  I mean, um, Oh God, David from blank check, uh, you know, those movie reviews for the
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  Atlantic.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.720]  He's like the king of the one line letterboxed review.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.480]  He just, he's so good at in like eight set, eight words, encompassing everything about
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.800]  how he feels about this movie in a way that will help you understand whether it's something
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.520]  you want to check out.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.560]  And not everybody has that.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.080]  You know, if I, if I talked about that, I would, I would just sound like a dope.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.680]  It's like, I like when he time travels or whatever.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  I feel that way.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.440]  I used to feel that way about my affinity for steak houses because what could be more
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.640]  basic than saying, I like, I like, I like a big, big piece of like large, large portions
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.280]  of steak with mashed potatoes and golden corral and martinis.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.340]  Not to get, spend too much more time on it, but my basic rules there, there, there's a,
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.640]  there is a difference between a place that happens to have steak on the menu and a steakhouse.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.320]  A steakhouse is a thing for sure.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.820]  Part of the things are number one, a steakhouse absolutely positively must be able to make
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820]  a great martini.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.680]  That's, it's table stakes.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.240]  You, you, you don't have to say, you know, you don't have to tell them not to put too
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.540]  much vermouth in or anything.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.480]  You just tell them what type of martini you want and, uh, you know, pick your gin, pick
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.320]  your vodka, and you're going to get a great martini is going to be ice cold.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.480]  If you get olives, they're going to be delicious.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480]  They do this.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.200]  And I love, I love videos of like street food and Asia and all that stuff.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.020]  And like, and all of these things we're talking about, these people would just do this all
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.320]  day long.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.800]  I really love process videos and I like the ones of like, you know, this is a place that
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.400]  makes the fanciest, you know, hamburger in this city.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.040]  And like, this is how they'd make the dough and this is how they do the things.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.320]  And it's like all day long.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.000]  This is, this is all they do all day long.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.920]  And in fact, if that man or woman's job is to, is to pour a perfect martini all day,
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.140]  they can probably even look at you.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.200]  They can knock on Gladwell you a little bit and go like, Oh, I have a feeling you're going
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.760]  to want less vermouth without even having to ask.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.240]  They must have a fine, a nice selection of wine.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.120]  I'm not a wine drinker, but it's, but just because I'm not, doesn't mean a steakhouse
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.760]  must have nice wine, but it also must be unpretentious where, where you, they're not
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.860]  trying to sell you a $200 bottle of wine.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.060]  If you would like it, it's on the menu.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:55.400]  It's there, but you can, and you can always, this is one of the things that was like a
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  revelation to me, like 15 years ago, like late, way too late in life is I was so intimidated
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  about wine.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.800]  I just thought, well, they, they, you know, they have $200 bottles of wine.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800]  That's what they want you to get.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.200]  Then the $50 bottle of wine, it must be garbage or something like that.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200]  No.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.220]  And you can always just ask for the Psalm.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:18.640]  The Somalia will come over and you can just explain what you would like in very, you're
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.000]  not going to embarrass yourself if you say like, oh, it's our anniversary, but we kind
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.600]  of don't want to spend more than $50 and then he could be like, well, do you like this or
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  do you like that?
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.120]  And that's, that's the, that's the person's entire job.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.320]  And in the most unpretentious terms where you don't have to, it's like frou-frou, I
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]  don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.400]  It'd be like, do you like fruity?
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.400]  You know, I, you know what I don't like?
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.660]  I don't like tannins and he'd be like, I got you.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.660]  This is it.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.660]  It's a $45.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.640]  We're going to love it.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640]  You got to have that.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.220]  You must have on the menu.
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:56.360]  You must have a wedge salad, just like a chunk of a chunk of iceberg or romaine iceberg.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:02.840]  Well, you could do like blue cheese, iceberg, blue cheese, and it's gotta be real blue cheese.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:08.440]  It, it, you know, it can't just be, you can't put like, if you go to a steakhouse, no, you
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.040]  can't just get, you can't just get the jar of wing sauce.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.640]  No, if you go to a steakhouse, like this is like a thing, like you, you, you just know
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.840]  you're going to have a bad meal.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.080]  Like you, you're new in town, you've gone to the, taken a guess, you go to the steakhouse
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.240]  and they say they have ranch dressing on the wedge salad.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.760]  Doesn't even matter if you don't want the wedge salad, I'm telling you right now, you're
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]  doomed to.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760]  Does it come with a toy?
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  Yeah.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.760]  It's, it's no good.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.760]  That's real.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.280]  That's, and again, for Caesars, like it's okay if you, people shouldn't enjoy what they
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280]  want.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.800]  I'm not trying to shame anybody by anything, but like an actual Caesar salad made table
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.040]  side is going to be very, very different from what you're used to.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.320]  It's going to be very anchovy forward in a lot of ways, which I love, but not a lot of
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.080]  other people do, but like, and it's kind of one reason I love these videos, whether it's
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.200]  processed videos or teppanyaki videos.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.520]  The beauty of these teppanyaki videos, especially the Aidan Films channel on YouTube is a good
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.520]  teppanyaki chef.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.020]  And again, we're talking here about in America, what we think of as Benihana, but it's not
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.360]  again, I'm using that word because it's become important to me.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360]  It's not cute.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.680]  It's not like trying to do jokey stuff and throw shrimp in your face, but it's more like
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.880]  when you watch a good teppanyaki chef, they it's very economical.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.800]  Every move is very economical and they cook, whether it's a slice of garlic or a $600 lobster,
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.240]  they cook every morsel of food like it's the main dish.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:31.060]  And once you become aware of that phenomenon, you don't love getting a salad that's lukewarm
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:35.040]  and has a bunch of like bagged sliced carrots on it.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.080]  And that sounds like where you could excel here.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.280]  You got your standards.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:43.240]  You know what you want and you know whether or not it worked and how it could be better.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.440]  Every steakhouse has to have all the standards, right?
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440]  You got it.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440]  You got to have a filet.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.480]  You got to have martini wedge salad.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.600]  I would say you do not have to offer a Caesar salad.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.520]  A wedge is a must.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.760]  A Caesar is very typically offered.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.160]  It's a lot of work, but if you do have a Caesar, it must be a great Caesar salad has to be.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160]  You cannot phone it in.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.560]  It cannot be something where it's already been pre-made and the cheese tastes like the
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560]  romaine.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.800]  It's got to be good.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.940]  French onion soup.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:19.060]  You don't have to have French onion soup, but you could have if you, but if you do have
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.160]  French onion soup, it better be fucking good.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160]  With the cheese on top.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.220]  Oh, and it's got, yep.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.800]  It's got to be in the crock with the cheese on top.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.960]  It's like White Castle.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.840]  It's like two out of three times gives me the trots of boys that love, love the cheese
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.840]  crock.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]  That's a good ass soup.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.600]  Maybe, maybe we'll get a flight of ammonium with it again.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.640]  Now if let's say you get the French onion soup and you've already placed your order.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.920]  You've, you've got a steak coming as a second, you know, your next, your next course and
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:53.340]  you know, some side dishes, et cetera and so forth, but you, they, they put the French
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.880]  onion soup in front of you and number one, they better give you the special soup spoon,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]  right?
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.080]  Because you cannot, you can't enjoy it without, with a regular spoon.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.440]  You got to have the French onion soup or soup spoon, right?
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:12.040]  It's more of a, more of a spherical spoon, but when you first break the seal on the cheese
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:17.980]  over the crock, if the whole thing just moves, give me a grapefruit spoon just to get started.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:22.640]  If they'll, if the, if you can't just easily break through the cheese because the cheese
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:30.600]  is so nice and melty, if it's sort of coagulated and the cheese on the top is sort of a solid
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.440]  and you kind of have to like, you almost, you almost think to yourself, you'd almost
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.680]  like to have a knife to cut the cheese, right?
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.680]  That you, it's, you, you're, the rest of your meal is going to be medium.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.000]  It looks too thick and it's cooling off.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.940]  Or maybe it had been made before and they just sort of heated it up.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.840]  Who knows what the explanation is?
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.880]  If it's not, if it's not a very liquidy cheese on top that is so easy that it, you know,
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.240]  and then you can share your soup.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:03.520]  You could, my wife will almost never order soup for herself, but she would, she enjoys
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.040]  a few slurps of mine.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.540]  But if it's a good soup, then she doesn't have to worry that she's going to take the
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.800]  whole piece of cheese at once, you know, because it's,
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.880]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.880]  That's really awkward.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.560]  It's like a blanket hog, but for French soup.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560]  Exactly.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560]  Right.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.480]  Because this, this, this busted ass, you know, ivory hockey puck of cheese has caused me
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.880]  to do something disruptive.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.160]  I think you're on the right track.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160]  What else?
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.160]  What are some other ones?
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160]  What about the knives?
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.720]  Do you have a strong feeling about the knives?
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.220]  So I, you just want a nice knife.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.220]  That's what I say.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.220]  We have a place.
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:40.440]  You don't have to be like a jokey outback, you know, knife kind of thing, right?
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.940]  We have a place here in Philadelphia.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.000]  It's a very nice restaurant called Barkley Prime.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.160]  And it's a one of, you know, one off steakhouse.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.620]  I guess probably the most expensive in the city.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.040]  It's pretty ritzy.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.960]  You know, it's a nice once or twice a year thing.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:03.480]  They used to have a gimmick where they would come out and offer you like six knives, like
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.200]  two from Japan, two from Germany.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.200]  Yeah.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.560]  And, but is it a trick?
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.960]  Is it like to find out if you're the Dalai Lama?
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.120]  That feels like a jam up.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.320]  Well, it's, it, it's chosen poorly.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:21.100]  It's so over the top ridiculous that it actually, I think it plays not as pretentious, but as
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:25.300]  just sort of fun.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.840]  But the funny part about it though, is they'll come to the table.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.240]  Let's say you have a table for four, right?
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.000]  You're out with another couple and there's four of you at the table.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.600]  They come out with the six knives.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.380]  There's only one of each.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.440]  And so like, oh my God.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:46.920]  So let's say you do have like musical knives, you have a very particular, a preference for
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.200]  like the one, the one knife from Germany is your favorite.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.920]  Well, if somebody else takes it first, right.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.160]  You know, you've either got somebody to beat you to the Henkel.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160]  I'm not sure.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.400]  I would just take another knife.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  That's me personally.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400]  Yeah.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.240]  But I'm sure if you said to the, to the server, if you said, you know, I actually would like
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.760]  that German knife too, they would go get you another one.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.760]  No questions asked.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.800]  But the last, if I were the server, I would say, I'm sorry, sir, the, your, your wife
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800]  wanted it more.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  Yeah.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800]  That's what I would say.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.800]  It's a ridiculous gimmick.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.000]  And I believe, I don't know if it was a COVID thing.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.960]  We went there once over the summer during our brief six week period where everything
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.180]  looked on the, on the upswing COVID wise, we went back and, and it was nice.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.440]  It's actually a nice place too, where it was one of the few places in Philadelphia where
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:36.240]  they had continued to pay their server staff through the whole thing.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.520]  So like all the regular servers were still there, which is almost unheard of here.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.040]  We've, you know, almost all of our places, we've lost our favorite servers because, you
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.240]  know, the whole thing.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.120]  But it was, but they, they, they, last time we were there, they did not do the knife thing.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.200]  They just gave us like a regular steak knife and I, we didn't say anything.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.200]  I don't know.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]  I don't know.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.120]  I don't know what, I don't know how COVID would have affected the knife gimmick, maybe.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.080]  Well, but like it's, and certainly like we could do, do a half hour bit about this, but
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.640]  the whole thing of like, well, the reason we can't do that is because COVID.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.720]  It's like, okay, but like, you know, there are some kinds of things where it absolutely
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.880]  makes sense, but I do have a couple more questions real quick, but when you're doing, but I need
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.200]  to know about, well, I want to know how you're going to handle some of the, some of the tricky
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  issues.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:28.320]  Well, I mean, and this is, I'm not trying to trick you, chilled salad fork.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320]  Oh yeah.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320]  You got it.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.120]  And your steak, I like that you passed.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.400]  Your steak will come on a plate that is dangerously hot.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.500]  You cannot, you know, it, it, whoever, when, when they bring out your steak, it comes on
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.500]  a plate.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.500]  To make you sign something, probably.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.640]  You're talking about really serious, you're talking about like basically like a, like
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.640]  a crucible.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.640]  Yeah.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.760]  Because, and again, it, I always thought I, when I was younger and, and was on, you know,
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.520]  when I was poor, let's say, I loved Outback Steakhouse.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520]  I still do.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]  I'll go to an Outback.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]  I haven't been to one.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  It's like Starbucks.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.200]  It's like people complain about it, but boy, you could sure do a lot worse when you're
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.200]  visiting somewhere.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.240]  You could definitely do, you could do a lot worse.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240]  And I'll tell you what.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.240]  It's really consistent.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.080]  Every time you get an Outback steak, it is, it is cooked to, you know, it is exactly what
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]  you want.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]  They know what they're doing.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.080]  Right.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.440]  And the best cut, the best cut there is the Outback special.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.160]  And I don't know what exact type of meat.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.160]  I'm not a butcher.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.340]  I think it might be the, I don't know off the dome, but I have a feeling that might
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:35.360]  be what some people call a club steak or where it's basically like the, you cut the cap off
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.920]  of a ribeye and it's just sort of the fancy ribeye part in the middle.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.520]  I could be wrong, but I agree with you and the seasoning is great.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]  I love the seasoning.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.920]  Also, as a general rule, not just steakhouses, but restaurants in particular, if, if the
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.920]  name of the restaurant is on one of the dishes, that's what you should get.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.200]  And this, I remember you and Simpson telling me this, but I was like, when we went to the
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.440]  House of Prime Rib and I was like, well, what cut do I get?
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.840]  There's like the Princess Cut and the City Cut and Princess City English and House of
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840]  Prime Rib Cut.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.640]  But then there's also one called King Henry, King Henry VIII, which is, that's what you
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.680]  get, which is the only time I've ever competed with you.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.640]  I'm constantly, I know you're very competitive and I guess I am, but there was one evening.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.800]  I don't like to brag about this, John, cause it makes you feel bad.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  Mr. Liston's feel bad.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.520]  But I think one that you were actually perhaps at first impressed and eventually appalled
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.880]  by how much food I can eat.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  Yes.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880]  That's true.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.600]  And you seemed a little bit like the Cowboys lost or something.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.600]  Yeah.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.960]  And you're like, wow, you just had a dessert cut too, huh?
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960]  Yeah.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960]  I think it was me and you and...
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.800]  I can eat all the meat.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.360]  Sandy and Simpson and Marco, remember Marco was with us.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360]  Oh my God.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.320]  My friend Ben, we went there with the, of all things, the MacBreak Weekly Pixel Core
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.560]  group one time.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.240]  And my friend Ben is, he's not vegan, but he's vegetarian.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.080]  And they look like, this is not a very woke thing to say, but it looked like he came in
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.760]  wearing a fancy dress and holding a parasol because he's like, what do you have that's
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760]  vegetarian?
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.960]  Marco Marco Marco has a photo of us from that night and he's, he has it.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.960]  I think it's, I think it's of all places in his, his like powder room off his office,
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:19.320]  but I was at Marco's house a while back and there's this picture of us and everybody looks
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  pretty happy.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.760]  I look a little glum and that's exactly why as I was a little depressed because I thought
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.480]  I could eat.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.360]  I bested you at beef.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  At beef.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360]  Right.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360]  Like it wasn't even close.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.160]  I want a, I want a rematch.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.400]  It wasn't even close.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.000]  It was like if we were playing golf, you would, you, I would have, you would have had this
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  affliction.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.240]  I'd love to say I'm proud of that.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.960]  There's other things I'd love to win at.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.300]  I'd love, I'd love, I'd love to win at, you know, being good to my family or, or, or the
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:50.160]  Lord or something, but I can eat all the food.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160]  It's really bad.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.640]  You, if we were playing golf instead of eating meat, I'd have to play from the children's
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.120]  teas up front, you know?
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.760]  Oh, you go way, way up front.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.760]  But anyway.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  Uh, napkin folding.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.000]  How do you feel about you stand up, they fold your napkin.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Are you cool with that?
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.160]  Do you like that?
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.360]  I know the places where like you, I think, I think generally I learned from Emily Post
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.080]  and Amy Vanderbilt, you're supposed to like put your napkin like usually on your seat,
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  I think, or something.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.520]  Do you do, how do you feel about the, uh, you, you go to, I don't know, take a peer,
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.880]  drop a deuce and they fold your napkin for you.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.880]  I think it's kind of nice.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.120]  I think it's kind of nice too, but yeah, it needs to be invisible, right?
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.820]  So that the other French service, like, and what's funny is I had one drag this out because
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:36.400]  we still have 12 hours of a documentary to talk about, but this is the thing about French
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.400]  Laundry.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.160]  I've been to French Laundry once and it was astonishing.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.620]  It's a very fancy, uh, not fancy.
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:46.600]  It's Thomas Keller and it's a fancy, but like, it's just, it's that kind of restaurant,
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.080]  best restaurant in America for a few years, that kind of thing.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.360]  But like, what's amazing about it.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.880]  And I went there with a group of friends that we called the gentlemen who dine and we would
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.480]  go out once a month somewhere kind of nice.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.280]  And then one time we went to French Laundry, it's the only time I've ever been there.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.280]  And we were all so scared about something going wrong.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:08.520]  And what was amazing was the service could not have been more, here's the word, cordial.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:14.280]  Just so low key puts you at ease, but also the part you want here, the part you want
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.460]  from French service is not being an asshole.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:22.260]  The part you want from French service is you anticipate what people want and take care
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:27.560]  of it without pretense, without pretense, bothering and pre yeah, pretense also, but
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.520]  also the whole, like, how are we doing today?
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.000]  I'm going to be your server.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.880]  Do you mind if I stoop down in your banquette?
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]  How are we doing here?
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  Well, I haven't touched the food.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.880]  I mean, the water's been empty for a while, you know, to me, the key with the folded napkin
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.980]  things happen, be classy to me, the key with the folded napkin isn't when you go to drop
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.680]  a deuce mid meal.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.960]  It's when your dinner companion goes and their napkin gets folded and you didn't, you're
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]  still at the table.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]  You didn't even notice.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:57.960]  You didn't even notice.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.600]  You didn't even notice coming up and they're not, they're not gossiping about them and
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]  stuff.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600]  No, no.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]  But what about the crumb scraper?
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  Crumbs?
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  Scrape?
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.600]  Oh, you gotta have a crumb scraper.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.600]  Love a crumb scrape.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600]  Gotta have a crumb.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.600]  Don't be a dick about it.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600]  Don't be a dick about it.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.600]  Don't make me feel bad about my crumbs.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.720]  Don't make me feel bad about what the terrible way that I've destroyed your tablecloth.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  Just don't make me feel bad.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.960]  You know, that's, that's what we say here during Fireball Steakhouse.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:23.480]  I've, I've absolutely, if I want to make you feel bad, you'll know it.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.560]  I absolutely ruin every tablecloth I ever eat.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560]  You're hard on a tablecloth.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.200]  I'm hard on a tablecloth because there's a lot going on.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.880]  You're scooping, you're scooping potatoes.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880]  You know, there's everything.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.840]  And that's what it's signed up for, you know, it's like one of your undershirts.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840]  You really put a hurting on it.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.840]  Right.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  You're meant to share.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.160]  You're meant to share everything.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.680]  Everything is, is, is up for the table.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.400]  Oh, can I make one last request, please?
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]  Tell me.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.400]  Could you please, I mean, I don't want to get up in your shit, but would you consider,
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.640]  please, not only never asking a certain question, but to ban that question from being asked
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.080]  by the staff, is this your first time dining with us?
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.040]  Oh, yeah, I would, I agree with you.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.040]  I agree.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.040]  How is that relevant?
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.040]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.040]  No, I don't understand food.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040]  Please explain sauce.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.040]  You know it.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.200]  Small plates, huh?
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200]  That's crazy.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.200]  What, do you have a name for it?
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200]  Well, we call it tapas.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.200]  What?
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.440]  I've never eaten here before.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.560]  I don't understand food.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.820]  Which hole do I shove it in?
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:23.800]  In theory, you could, you could make a, a restaurant where, or, or like a, my friend
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:30.800]  Hapsing Laundromats place, Lee's place, it is, it is an unusual place with unusual rules.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.120]  And there's a couple, you know, that, that if you've never been there before, you should
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:38.720]  know, you know, for example, one of the rules is no phone calls in, in the main room.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.900]  If you need to make a phone call, this guy, I love you.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.360]  You're allowed to use your phone.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.040]  You can like, you know, tweet or, you know, answer text messages, whatever you want, but
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:54.560]  you cannot speak on the telephone in, in the, in the bar and it, but it's exactly the kind
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:00.360]  of thing that, but I, I've, I use my phone for a phone as little as possible, but when
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:03.640]  people do use it as a phone, it's incredibly distracting.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.540]  It's incredibly distracting.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:09.480]  You're always louder than you think you are and, but you're, you don't have to leave the
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.480]  premises.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.480]  You don't have to go outside.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.640]  You can just go to the, the sort of, what would you call it?
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.520]  The anteroom lobby, the lobby chamber.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.520]  Yeah.
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.200]  There's like a little lobby when you first come in and you could just totally reasonable
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.520]  and you just walk out there and you can make a phone call.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.960]  If for example, somebody calls you, you don't have to like ignore the call.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:31.060]  You can pick up your phone and say hello, but then immediately what you need to do is
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:35.480]  go to the, to the, you can't carry on a conversation and no photographs.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.480]  Is the other rule.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.480]  You cannot take a photograph.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.960]  Oh, now that is interesting because I feel like a lot of places, we had a bar that opened
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:46.460]  not long before lockdown that I just started calling the Instagram bar because they had
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:52.860]  clearly bought a bespoke pink neon shitty sign that was like live, laugh, love kind
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:53.860]  of stuff.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:56.300]  And I was like, Oh God, you can tell this place because you've heard about this, right?
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:02.060]  This trend of like trend or whatever that I'm like, because where we are now, you really
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:07.180]  need to be on Instagram like you need to be, have people out there like talking about how
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.900]  clearly God, that's a, that's a power move.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:16.040]  He's had that rule from the get go, but he explains to you when you come in and it tells
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.040]  you the rules.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.700]  No, no cell phone calls in the room, no photos period anywhere indoors.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.860]  And he says it's for privacy of the other guests.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.300]  So that way nobody who's there needs to worry about being photographed unbeknownst to them.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:32.020]  That's and it's, it's a little bit like, like it's, there's some, I don't want to
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:37.120]  sound like I'm, I'm not trying to be funny here, but like there's so many situations
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.620]  where there are things we don't need to say to you.
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:44.820]  If it's a funeral, if it's a church service, like please don't have, first of all, why
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.280]  is your ringer on?
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:50.580]  Like why is your ringer on anywhere, let alone at a funeral?
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.000]  Like don't you feel a vibration like the rest of us do?
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.620]  Like do you really need to hear, you know, I am ringing, I'm ringing, please pick me
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.620]  up.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.660]  And like, no, like don't do that.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:07.940]  Do we have to tell you, like during the, during communion, you know, please don't take a call
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:08.940]  about your tea time?
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.240]  We, we went to see John Mulaney here in Philadelphia a few weeks ago.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.240]  And my son-
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.240]  I heard that was great.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240]  I heard it was great.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.780]  An aspiring comedian, my son, or at least as a fan of the medium.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:26.220]  And he, it was him and me and my wife and we got, my wife of course was in charge of
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.220]  getting tickets.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.220]  So we got some nice tickets.
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:29.220]  It was a great show.
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.220]  It really was.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.220]  He's-
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.220]  That's what I heard.
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.220]  It was.
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.220]  And it, you know, he-
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:36.020]  My friends who saw it cried, said they cried a bunch.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020]  It was.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.020]  It was.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:41.980]  It was a little bit, his, his, we've seen him a few times.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:42.980]  Yeah.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:43.980]  But we've seen him a few times.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:44.980]  And his previous-
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.500]  He's my favorite comedian working today, full stop.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.820]  I could see that.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.180]  He's one of mine.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.860]  He might be Jonas's favorite working today.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:58.940]  Amy, we all, all three of us love him, but his previous shtick was very polished, right?
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:05.000]  And the bits were very rehearsed and, and they're all clearly bits and he's personally
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  gone through a lot.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.300]  He's, he was in rehab, he, his marriage broke up and he's been through a lot.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.300]  All-
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.900]  She also, she, she, she got the, she got the dog.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.900]  Yep.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:15.900]  She got the dog who he loved.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.300]  Petunia, I believe the name.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.300]  Petunia.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.300]  Petunia, they used to push it around.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.300]  Pushing around the baby.
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300]  Yeah.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300]  A very, a moving show.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.300]  It was.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.780]  Because he addressed his personal stuff straight on.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:25.780]  And in a way that-
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:29.980]  A contrast, a contrast with the polish of like Kid Gorgeous or whatever.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:37.420]  And, but a little bit venturing into one man show territory where it's a little autobiographical,
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:44.460]  but even as it was raw, continuously funny, but anyway, he performed in one of, I forget
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.460]  which one.
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.740]  I think it's our Miriam Theater, but we have two, two of these old theaters right next
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.760]  to each other on Broad Street here in Philadelphia.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.820]  And they're these old 1880 constructed-
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.980]  Very haunted.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.980]  Oh my God.
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:03.940]  But every time, I mean, it's honestly like he, he even said, he's like, I've been here
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.940]  before that.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.940]  I, this is like my favorite.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:13.960]  I, I feel so under, under able to, to, to be on, I'm not good enough to be on this stage.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.220]  This theater is so beautiful.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.220]  Right.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.220]  Really, really nice.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.740]  But anyway, they had a rule, no, no cell phones.
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:23.260]  And they, what they did, you ever, you know, and it's like a whole thing in comedy now
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.260]  where, where a-
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.540]  You put it in a bag or something?
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.540]  You got to put it in a bag.
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:30.820]  So you, they don't take your cell phone, they, they, they, you, you know, you come in and
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.060]  you can put it in a little bag.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.380]  That's like a, a tiny little, what do you call those chambers where-
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.580]  Like a Faraday cage?
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.580]  Faraday cage.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.580]  Right.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:41.580]  It's like a Faraday bag.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.980]  And you get to keep your phone, but then as you leave, then, then there's somebody there
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:49.340]  to unlock it, you know, with like a magnetic thing, you know, like those anti shoplifting
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.620]  things on clothes.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.620]  Sure.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:52.860]  For sure.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:58.060]  So we just showed up without our phones because, you know, we, we could walk there and all
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.260]  three of us were there.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.000]  So who else is going to call us?
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.140]  We just showed up without phones and we could get out earlier.
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:08.180]  But anyway, towards the end of the show, somebody's cell phone rang and literally rang and he's
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:14.160]  like, that takes balls to go to a no cell phone show and not even mute your phone.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.280]  And the person, it was sufficiently, they died on the spot.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.280]  They just died.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]  That's such a bad look.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]  Oh my goodness.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:28.140]  He's like, that's really something where you, you snuck your cell phone in outside the bag,
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.020]  but didn't even think to mute it.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.460]  I mean, that's, that's something.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.540]  Anyway, how about we take a break and thank our good friends at LinkedIn.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.540]  Oh, let's do it.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:37.540]  LinkedIn.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.540]  You ever hear of LinkedIn?
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.540]  These days-
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:40.540]  I sure have.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.660]  You can go there and you make professional connections.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:46.060]  And I remember it for being a place where you put your resume where people can find
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.060]  it.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:50.460]  And you also have like relationships and a deal with people on there and they have training
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.460]  things.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:55.780]  Well, it can be hard to find and hire the right candidates for your small business.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:01.620]  And that's why LinkedIn jobs made it easier to find the people you want to talk to faster
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:03.620]  and for free.
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:09.420]  Create a free job post in minutes, just minutes on LinkedIn jobs and reach your network and
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:16.360]  beyond to the world's largest professional network of over 770 million people.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.760]  That sounds like too big, but it's actually the truth.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  That's how big-
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760]  Did you say the right letters there?
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760]  That sounds like a lot.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.240]  770 million people.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.240]  Million people.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.780]  You can focus on the candidates with just the right skills and experience.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:29.720]  They have screening questions.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:35.040]  You can customize them, get your role in front of only the most qualified people, and then
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:40.940]  use the tools on LinkedIn jobs to filter and prioritize the candidates whom you'd like
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.860]  to interview and eventually hire.
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:48.180]  That's why small businesses rate LinkedIn jobs number one in delivering quality hires
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:53.220]  and quality candidates versus their leading competitors who we shall not name.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.980]  LinkedIn jobs helps you find the candidates you want to talk to faster.
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:38:01.080]  Every week, nearly 40 million job seekers visit LinkedIn.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.420]  That's people looking for jobs, ready to find the job that you're offering.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:11.220]  Post your job for free at LinkedIn.com slash the talk show.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.300]  That's a three for three, all three sponsors with-
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.020]  Whoa, total class all the way down the line.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.280]  Now you've chosen well.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.260]  I don't know that that's ever happened before.
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:26.260]  That's LinkedIn.com slash the talk show to post your job for free, terms and conditions.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.940]  Both terms and conditions apply.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.940]  That seems fair to me, Jon.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]  All right, let's talk-
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.940]  You got to have terms.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.980]  Hey, listen, can I introduce a technology to your show that might change your life?
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.980]  All right.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.740]  And you feel free to cut this and tell me no.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.820]  Well, part two is I need to pee.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:46.820]  Part number one, something I've started doing on two of my other shows that has been transformative
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.380]  and it's called taking a break.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:54.680]  When you do a longer show, like when Syracuse and I do like a bonus episode, we take a break
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.500]  between the main episode and the bonus episode.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:00.720]  When Alex and I, every week, we talk for an hour and a half or two hours and then we record
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.500]  a half hour, one hour long after show for Patreon.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.780]  Have you considered having a 15 minute break maybe with music?
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:08.780]  Not the whole time.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:10.900]  You could play like Girl From Ibenema.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.180]  Well, I'm not going to do a two.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.020]  I'm just going to do a one, but that way I could turn on the fans.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.900]  We could refresh our drinks.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:19.900]  Would you think about that?
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.900]  Would you consider that so I could pee?
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:21.900]  Yeah.
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:22.900]  Let's take a break right now.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:23.900]  Really?
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.900]  What kind of music are you going to play?
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:25.900]  Are you going to write something for me?
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.900]  We'll find out.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:27.900]  We'll find out.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  Oh, okay.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.900]  All right.
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:30.900]  I'll be back.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.900]  Are you serious?
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:32.900]  Can we do this?
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:33.900]  Are you really going to do this?
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:34.900]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:35.900]  Because it could be a funny bit too.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.900]  Oh, it's fucking great, Jon.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.900]  You're going to feel so good.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.900]  Perfect.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:39.900]  Yes.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:40.900]  Oh, half past.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:41.900]  Oh, that long.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.900]  All right.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.900]  Here.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:44.900]  Well, it's 15 minutes.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:45.900]  That'd be 15 minutes, right?
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:46.900]  All right.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:47.900]  No, fuck it.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.900]  We could go shorter, but you're still in the spirit of the break.
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:49.900]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.900]  All right.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:53.380]  I don't know where you go and slap the baseball stake out of your mouth.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.380]  All right.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]  All right.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:56.380]  I'm actually going to hang up then, right?
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:57.860]  Oh, I'm totally hanging up.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:58.860]  Don't worry about that.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]  All right.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.860]  Hanging up.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.860]  All right.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.860]  All right.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:03.860]  Half past.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:04.860]  Half past.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.860]  Yeah.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:06.860]  Half past.
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:07.860]  Half past.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:08.860]  Half past.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:09.860]  All right.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.860]  Half past.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.860] ...
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:16.900]  Just short.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:29.420]  How'd you like your break?
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:33.260]  I thought that was delightful, but I have two issues.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:37.180]  First issue is it was so rejuvenating, now I'm worried we're going to go too long.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.980]  right oh don't worry about that right well there's there's speculation in my slack here about uh
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:49.660]  how long this may go now the problem two problem now alex is predicting a record setter and i said
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:56.300]  god i hope not because john talked about starting a steakhouse for an hour and um and snow in his
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.940]  wisdom is talking about the ways that you know that he's been introducing this with his shows
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.380]  you're worried we're going to lose our our momentum see i feel like we come back refreshed
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:10.220]  oh no i i'm not worried about losing momentum i got all the way fresh drink new glass new ice
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:15.500]  new tea all right i'm i'm worried that now we've got too much gas right that that the limiting
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:19.900]  factor the thing that actually makes this show ever come to an end especially with with when you
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:25.820]  and i are on a roll i know i won't talk i'm sorry you know that well you know if it's you know too
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:30.300]  long because i should have been a youth minister or something too too too long i love playing
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:36.300]  guitar too long doesn't doesn't really come up on this show too too often um no the problem
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:41.900]  problem number two is i went upstairs and my wife uh number one she oh boy she thought it
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:46.860]  was kind of remarkable that we were done already because she she was expecting a lot oh my sweet
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:52.860]  summer child and i said oh no we're taking a break merlin it was merlin's idea uh-huh and then she
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:58.620]  was started asking me she's she's given me a laundry list of of topics to talk about um and
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:06.860]  i said well we didn't we didn't get to get back yet and so is she is she reinvigorated to to storm
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:12.220]  in oh she's very excited um but anyway that's that's what we wanted to talk about the beatles
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:18.540]  get back documentary peter jackson's uh oh i but before we get there i i wanted to say this to you
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:24.220]  you sent me a beautiful picture of your uh beverages you've got the nice ice maker don't you
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:31.100]  yeah yeah i mean i i know there's currently a certain amount of backlash about little pellet
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:37.260]  ice but i love it it's probably the best christmas gift i ever got what what's the backlash the game
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:41.260]  what's the backlash people like to you know everybody's got to have a strong opinion about
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:47.020]  everything and you know fam we need to talk about tiny ice it's not that good man wow i like me i
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:53.020]  like baseball ice man and all that kind of stuff i i love it and it's a source of ice for me which
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:43:00.460]  means that in this case you can see i'm having a cold brew coffee on ice i'm having and and i and
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:07.340]  iced tea on ice and i got it i got a can of fizzy water um and it's changed the game because it also
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:14.700]  means i can bring ice to the house if if if sorry ice maker is a little bit anemic um i love it john
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:21.020]  i love it so much it's not for everybody but it's really changed and i don't have to order ice from
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:26.780]  instacart like a monster i forget her last name helen the food writer at the new yorker had a
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:34.460]  lovely little article about pellet ice uh sometime this summer and i and and what the thing that it
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:39.340]  never occurred to me i i realized is one of these things that i i have been a fan of it my entire
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:43.900]  life but i really hadn't given it it's one of those things we were just talking about earlier
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:48.380]  it's not for everything it's really it's really good for like fizzy drinks and it does melt fast
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:54.220]  it's probably not ideal for a drink where like like i would not put it in a glass of your uh
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:44:00.380]  what's his name pappy mcdaniels or whatever i would not put this in in in a fancy drink but
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:05.820]  helen helen oh i think i know who you meet rosner yes helen rosner had a wonderful wonderful she
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:09.100]  had a wonderful thing about the pellet ice the thing i didn't realize until i read her article
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:15.260]  about it though is i'd i'd i've always known the type of ice that pellet ice is but i just assumed
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:21.420]  it was chip chopped you know that you you would oh oh you start with you start with gross grand
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:26.060]  ice and break it down like like you would on a chain right that you would make regular ice cubes
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:32.780]  and then the pellet maker was a thing that you put ice cubes in it's totally reasonable and then
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:40.300]  like a coffee grinder spits out the chip ice but that's not how pellet ice is made pellet ice you
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:47.020]  put water in and it's a right it's a machine it's a signed pellet at birth right and and it's made
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:52.300]  it's like rings of a tree where it's there's a little bit of ice and then a new layer of ice
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.620]  forms around that layer of ice and then a new layer of ice forms around that layer of ice and
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:04.300]  that's why pellet ice is uh entirely different than any other ice you can get i believe that
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:10.780]  perhaps the most uh the the biggest national chain that serves pellet ice might be sonic do you have
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:15.740]  the sonic out in california i've been to sonic um but but i know i know what you're talking about
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:20.060]  it's also the kind of ice they give uh to pregnant ladies in the hospital yes it is it's a little bit
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:25.020]  soft yes yes that's that's actually i mean it's it's it's okay for us to like things also i know
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:31.900]  we don't have time but i did in notes i did slip in when i do make so when i do make seltzer at
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:37.580]  home i generally prefer the cans because it's just easier but i'm i'm off the uh off the soda stream
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:42.380]  i don't hate it but the it just became too costly and annoying but you know what i will suggest i
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:46.540]  put a thing in your in your document if you're looking for a change i don't know if i've sold you
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:53.740]  on this before but uh but what is it it's the um let me find it here it's the oh yeah it's the east
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:59.500]  isi ec classic mesh soda maker for making carbonating beverages one quart stainless steel
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.940]  and it's like a thing a clown shoots you with and it's a real fun way it's a real fun and quiet
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.740]  quiet as a church mouse you can make seltzer right in your home without the crap
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:16.540]  you can still make it as fizzy as you want i'm off the soda stream as well uh this is as good
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:21.740]  a time as ever to to talk about it i've i've i've i i i i i have nothing against the brand
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:29.820]  but uh i my second one broke it i don't know how but it's you know both of them after years of
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:37.340]  service but after the second one broke uh i i just never re-bought it it's expensive yeah
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:41.980]  all those like and i of course i have a spreadsheet about it so i know how expensive it gets and then
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:46.140]  you got to return them and it's like a whole thing well the other this you get you get like you ever
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:51.820]  this you get you get like you ever done whip no don't answer that um we've build off you of course
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:57.420]  but um you get these uh you get those little it's like a whippet and you put it in yeah and it's co2
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:02.380]  and you make the water and you shake it and that's it you're done and you you got a uh you got a
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:07.420]  quart of uh of seltzer well the other the other factor that was the the deciding factor is that
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:12.700]  we got turned on there's a brand i i've mentioned them on the show before howl's new york seltzer
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:17.900]  oh is this super fizzy one it's it is this physicist i i think i tried to find it after
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:22.540]  you mentioned it i think marco talked about it too that's just burns it's so hard that's where
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:30.380]  we first got it is we were okay we were vacationing with the arments uh uh up there in the the beach
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:35.580]  whatever beach town i forget the name of the place but wherever it is we were up there and and they
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.580]  had this howl's new york fizzy water and you know it's like well i like you know i just figured it
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:45.420]  was like regular seltzer water and i had some and it's like instantly it's it's like uh winston wolf
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:49.900]  and pulp fiction when he takes a sip of the coffee and and in the midst of trying to clean up this
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:56.380]  this terrible you know he talks fast and he drives fast but he even he notices if he seems
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:00.540]  current with you yeah because he just wants to get that fizz happen yeah even though he's he's
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:05.020]  ready to go and needs to get this you know let's get this mess cleaned up he takes a sip of that
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:09.020]  coffee does a double take and says hey that's good coffee you know that's what i thought with
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:13.420]  this howl's new york seltzer where i was just thinking you know i'm sure it's fine but it's
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:18.060]  actually like whoo this is something special you can't and that's the thing with the soda stream
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:25.100]  is i i would i would make my seltzer with the soda stream much more fizzy than uh typical
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:29.100]  we talked about this john i i'm pushing the envelope i'm telling you right now if you can
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.900]  get your hands on it i i it's hard right now they're online retail partners uh oh i i buy
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:39.900]  it from a place called oasis snacks if you oh i see it on there ten percent off use this code
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:47.500]  okay all right well okay all right and so as you know what i'm so sorry while we're sorry you ever
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.700]  met me all right number one number one their original which is you know just plain unflavored
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.180]  is just fantastic plain seltzer water you can flavor it however you want put it where you know
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:01.660]  if you're making cocktails with soda water or something like that it's fine but the black
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:09.180]  cherry has is sort of a uh you know it's in the dr pepper uh uh pie chart it it's slightly pruney
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:13.740]  it never it never gets old though it's like we've been drinking it for years and sometimes you know
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:18.460]  we'll mix in some various other flavors but the black cherry it's it's like the greatest thing
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:24.460]  ever but a it's fizzier than even the soda stream would allow me to make it and i think that's why
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:30.300]  i broke my soda stream is it it's like i pumped it up so much it's like a bottle used it i abused
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:35.180]  it i don't know what they're doing up there at the house factory to get that much carbonation
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:40.780]  into their uh into their beverage but i mean you can like leave one open overnight and forget to
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:45.180]  put the cap back on this on the bottle and then you come down in the morning and there's still
[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:50.380]  half of a house there if there's a brand of seltzer that produces chuck norris style anecdotes
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:55.980]  i will be ordering that please and thank you that you you can have one that has been left out
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:02.700]  overnight and gotten flat and it's still fizzier than most brands of of pre-carbonated seltzer
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:07.500]  water anyway it's it's really good stuff and that's really what got me off the soda stream is
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:13.100]  i can't beat it you know can't beat them join them anyway i i want to talk to you about the
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:21.020]  get back documentary and yep it's it i i people are i saw one bad review did you see this it was
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:26.620]  like the guardian was like it's like meandering you you're you'll lose your mind in peter jackson's
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:31.580]  meandering eight hour get back documentary and i'm like amy jane but i have i have a lot to say
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:36.300]  about opinions like that i i i everybody like i say everybody should think what they think
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:42.220]  but if you watch this and didn't get how important it is that it be what you consider long or boring
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:48.620]  you missed the point the point the very point of this is it's not and he says this in the title
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:53.340]  card at the beginning i think in kind of a cool way which is like yeah anytime you make something
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.820]  you have to make editing decisions we did our best you know to make this portray like what we what we
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:04.620]  saw happening and my biggest takeaway from so much of this was facial expressions body language so
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:08.940]  much stuff that you wouldn't get if you added edited this within an inch of his its life to
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:14.540]  make it entertaining so i let me just say this up front i i we will talk technically what you would
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:19.580]  call spoilers we're going to talk about what we saw but it's it is sort of spoiler proof right
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.380]  like if you were watching if you're watching a movie called the hindenburg you you already know
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:28.860]  how it ends right you knew how titanic ended right it was the biggest blockbuster movie of all time
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:33.980]  the perfect example is all the president's men another movie that by today's standards well it
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:39.740]  contains some pretty big spoilers for 1972 but it also is the kind of movie you wouldn't see today
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:45.740]  it's a procedural right it's very very slow and it gives you the feeling of what it meant to like
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:51.820]  ben bradley is he was right on the on the bubble about like this but like go show your work do this
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:57.580]  go do the shoe leather reporting which is what makes it such a terrific movie i it's so you
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:03.180]  again if you really want to and and you're out there listening and you you've had let uh get
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.260]  back on your list and you don't want to listen to us talk about it you can pause the show and
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:13.660]  wait and come back but i would say to you i i read a couple reviews beforehand they spoiled
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.220]  certain scenes and it doesn't matter right it's a spoiler like there's there's a famous
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:24.140]  bit in the first of the three segments where paul's wearing a yellow shirt and he's playing
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:28.860]  the hoffner bass and he kind of plucks his way towards something that you're now familiar with
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:33.660]  and it is more fun to go into that right kind of not knowing about it right but and it's it's
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:40.460]  unbelievable i i've i the other thing too i will say this i i would peter jackson is not my
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:47.580]  favorite director and i'm on the record famously in in our nerd sphere i despised the fellowship
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:54.380]  of the rings i despised it at a level that was so profound i like nine of the 13 endings i i i
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:53:01.660]  really did not like it ever gonna end my this is a true story my wife my lovely wife we we went to
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:08.060]  the theater to see fellowship of the ring and i didn't like it she disliked it so much that
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:13.900]  halfway through she fished through her purse to find a sleeping pill ah that's my wife and last
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:21.180]  night in soho i've never seen her so angry at a movie and at me for loving it she was so goddamn
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:26.300]  angry and there's exactly one funny tweet that about this about get back that i did think was
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:33.260]  funny and you know funny's funny and the person said um peter jackson is the only director where
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:42.460]  i would like to see an editor's cut let me say this i'm not a fan of peter jackson's body of
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:47.420]  work is fiction this stuff is really really terrific it's obviously he cared a lot i can
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:52.620]  see that he i've always been able he's clearly talented but his style of fictional narrative
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:57.340]  filmmaking is not to my liking he he does the he's he loves his world war one movie
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:02.540]  uh i don't think i did i think that's him yeah where he did took got colorized
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:07.820]  footage of world war oh yeah that's another one that's a documentary now i'm way more interested
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:13.020]  in watching it now that i've seen this what he did with this footage i think that so the basic
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:17.740]  backstory is everybody should know i've i never saw it we talked about it before we started
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:23.260]  recording i have not seen the original let it be documentary because i was always told it was
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:30.140]  terrible that it was dreadful and and depressing and just not entertaining and so definitely it's
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:35.740]  not it's certainly not the way that one would if you are a beatles fan which i a thousand percent
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:40.780]  yeah i'm i'm still in the bag for the beatles in a way that's just excruciatingly boring white and
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:47.740]  middle-aged but um it's certainly not the way you would want to remember them right it's not like
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:52.060]  howardton talking about seeing the dead body at a funeral like do you really want to remember the
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:58.540]  person this way you know um and i don't think that but no but you know what i mean and it's it's um
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:04.140]  it's very dreary um that is a great analogy though right that is true that the last time you see
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:08.300]  your everybody's different like some people need that closure and other people are going to be like
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:14.940]  no i'd rather remember grandma like not wearing a wig in a box yeah no it it's it's an important
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:21.740]  moment i remember the one i remember very vividly was when my dad's dad died in i believe 1991 i
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:27.580]  think it was like a senior in high school and my dad had a brother and a sister and everybody was
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:31.740]  there and we had a funeral and you know my grandfather lived to be i think he was 89 i
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:39.820]  mean you know long nice long life um yeah yeah uh but my dad was a blubbering mess and his brother
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:45.340]  his my uncle and and i thought my aunt my dad's sister would be the one who was a messy and she
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:50.380]  she was super close but my dad was the one who really was just a blubbering mess and he was the
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:56.060]  last one out of the room and said good said goodbye said goodbye to him like like he could
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:56:01.900]  hear him but it was you know but i could see i everybody grieves differently you should not police
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:08.220]  these things i just remember being 17 and being sort of a jerk because i was 17 and i wasn't you
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:13.100]  know uh i wasn't a jerk about going to the funeral but i was sort of annoyed you know it was like
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.180]  clear you know he didn't die as a surprise it was like uh you know now i gotta go to a funeral
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:22.460]  and but i remember being blown away by that moment and thinking because i love my dad so much and i
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:27.580]  just remember like hey that was a moment that was a thing you know and and then we all went out to
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:32.940]  eat afterwards and my dad his mood was suddenly better right and you know but that's what i've
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:37.180]  always heard of let it be that let it be is like that you know that there's this and it's pretty
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:42.700]  difficult to find these days i think it's probably out of print my two quickies my uh Syracuse and
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:49.580]  opening statement just a quick two-parter is that first i mean yes so the let it be movie well let
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:56.380]  me just first say first say this i wish this had come out like around the time of like tiger king
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:01.900]  or i wish they'd come out around the time of like when i first got obsessed with him robinson's i
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.820]  think you should leave show which is you know those are you know some favorite finds because
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.340]  you know during lockdown you wanted stuff to do this would have been and i know should have
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:14.940]  but didn't it would have been so neat to have had this to pour over for months when i didn't have
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:20.300]  anything else to do rather than trying to like in this case last night jamming in the whole
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:26.060]  last episode because i wanted to visit with you uh i would really rather have taken my time with
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:31.660]  this and it's it's it is the kind of movie one doesn't want to be unkind it's the kind of movie
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:35.580]  that i yell at my family about or i'm like just put down your goddamn phone and please watch this
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:40.460]  because not even this in particular but there's so many things where like you really need to it's
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:46.060]  a visual medium that we're looking at here and just at the very least you're going to miss a lot
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:52.860]  in you know j random movie if you're if you're playing genshin impact and and so but in this
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:58:00.060]  instance a lot of information is well and tastefully conveyed through and not intercards
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:05.900]  but you know text on the screen not in a like avengers oh you know we're we're on or like star
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:11.580]  wars were on this planet kind of annoying way but in a but in a but he'll say like at this point just
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:16.780]  so you know they have this many days left and they can't get that venue or whatever just explaining
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:22.540]  background stuff that you know you can luxuriate in the relationships you're watching play out
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.940]  with enough information to understand how the valence just changed in a way that would not be
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:32.220]  obvious unless you were there okay so you i mean if you don't want to watch it it's fine like just
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:36.300]  go do your thing but like if you're not going to really pay attention to this as somebody who's
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:40.620]  steeped in beatlesdom well you know don't be too flustered about us getting the thing we've
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:46.620]  craved forever second and super importantly to your point when the trailer or the whatever the
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:52.620]  early trailer the long like early trailer came out a few months ago uh i instantly knew it was
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:57.900]  going to be my shit for the reason you just stated which is i've seen let it be i've watched it all
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:05.500]  the way through probably once and it's really not fun to watch it's like watching a movie about
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:12.140]  divorce and it's it's really it is really sad but like seeing that footage of john lenin dancing
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:20.940]  with yoko or dancing with paul seeing john lenin in the late 60s whatever his chemical and emotional
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:28.460]  situation was he's obviously utterly charming and wait a minute did that guy just not have any of
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:35.180]  this footage because let it be is dreary it's mostly it's mostly at twickenham it's mostly at
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:40.220]  the cold terrible place and i sent you those screenshots of the famous very famous scene of
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:45.260]  george saying paul i'll play whatever you want if you don't want me to play i won't play at all i'll
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:52.620]  do whatever pleases you and that basically is the tone of the movie paul is a hectoring asshole yoko
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:58.380]  is is a cold manipulative bitch i'm sorry i would not say that about a person but that's the tone
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:05.260]  of that movie everybody hates obviously hates being there and it's utterly bereft of any feeling
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:13.660]  that these guys in this job have any affection for what they're doing let alone for each other
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:18.380]  so when that early trailer came out and it looked the footage looks so crisp and beautiful
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:24.700]  and i immediately thought oh my gosh i've got to see this because i want to wash that out of my
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:29.020]  mind i put a link i have a final thing on this i put a link in the doc to i'm sure you've heard
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:34.700]  it from one of the anthologies and there's a super interesting second take with a different
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:40.700]  arrangement of and your bird can sing this much more rickenbacker 12-string power pop kind of
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:46.060]  feeling and when you listen to it even my kid from the age of three when we would listen to this would
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:50.220]  go like they're high aren't they and i'd say i think john and paul are a little bit high because
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:55.180]  they're trying to do the backup vocals for and your bird can sing and the thing completely falls
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:01:03.340]  apart right so that would be 66 till this week in my head in my head canon i've always kind of
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:07.900]  figured i've always had a real warmth for that outtake because you can tell they're they're
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:14.300]  still having fun even if they're high or whatever they're making revolver and i i've always thought
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:20.540]  in my head i'll bet that's the last time that the band but especially i bet that might be the last
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:28.620]  time we ever hear john and paul kind of not hating what they're doing and not feeling and then us as
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:35.340]  the listener or viewer not feeling a just a this this gut-wrenching sense of like nobody wants to
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:41.900]  be here so you know we all us who have sought out let it be and watched it and been sad about it
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:46.700]  just to be clear let it be is up there with magical mystery tour as easily my least favorite
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:53.420]  beatles out just just to get that out of the way oh boy there's four or five other beatles out every
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:57.020]  other beatles album i would put above this including the one they recorded after ivy road
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:02.860]  which we'll get to but you know it's it was such a salve for me to see that trailer because yeah
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:09.020]  i'm excited to see this but also to go like oh my gosh maybe i maybe the last photo of grandpa
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:14.780]  doesn't have to be him dead in a box and so i went into this with a fairly jubilant idea i had
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:20.060]  no idea it was going to be this long or this exhaustive and and you could be forgiven for
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:26.060]  thinking this director and his team just took every stitch of footage they had and just shat
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:33.580]  it onto the onto a onto a digital device but now there's a lot of good filmmaking in this
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:39.340]  and but it does you are going to have to sit with it and appreciate what it is rather than what you
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:44.060]  think it should be that that is you need to literally let it be that that is so well said
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:50.620]  i agree with every word of that my my preconception coming into it was slightly informed by my general
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:56.620]  distaste for peter jackson's films and i sort of thought okay sure the trailer why doesn't the
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:02.700]  eagle just carry them the trailer looks amazing but i my gut feeling was look if they made this
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:09.500]  movie back then and it was sort of dreadful and nobody really has any affinity for it and it was
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:13.820]  two hours ish i don't know how long how what was the running time and let it be probably like i
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:18.540]  can i can look it up yeah it's um i think it's fairly brisk yeah it's probably under two hours
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.900]  but in the copies that you can get like i've got i think what was a dvd copy and it's it's real
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:27.580]  muddy but if you just think about imagine the scenes in twickenham like when they're in that
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:30.780]  when they're bright clothes that somebody's obviously picked out for them right when they're
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:36.780]  at twickenham and they're in that horrible room now imagine that except it's the the print is
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:43.420]  muddy it's mostly just them being sad the crazy room with the weird wall wall wash lights yeah
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:49.020]  yeah where mal's going and he puts up the drum head and all that yeah yeah but my gut feeling
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:53.580]  and i think this you know i don't think this was unreasonable but i thought if if originally they
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:04:00.220]  made a pretty dreary two-hour movie what what are the odds that an eight-hour cut is going to be
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:06.140]  better right like so i like i get it with peter jackson too like where people who love the the
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:10.380]  lord of the rings trilogy and i know that people do say and you know no accounting for taste and
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:14.060]  the fact that i don't like them doesn't mean i think they're bad movies i just they're not my
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:19.100]  style but i get it but they're well they're very ambitious but i get it i admire that i get it
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:23.900]  though why somebody who loved the theatrical versions just loved them that they were over
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.780]  the moon when peter jackson released a 30-hour cut of the whole thing you know it's like oh
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:33.580]  just give me more give me all of it give me the 30-hour version i thought that that was what this
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:40.540]  was you know it's the four times longer version of let it be whereas instead it is altogether
[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:45.820]  different and it's like the most amazing thing is this footage was shot and it's been sitting in the
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:51.900]  can for 50 years yeah it was like it was like over 100 hours of audio but i think it was 50
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:56.940]  hours of footage something like that what other miracles like this are out there sitting in cans
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:02.140]  around the world right there's the the orson welles movie that that never never came out
[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:07.420]  oh chimes of midnight uh for something with the wind or i don't know oh yeah i know what you mean
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:11.580]  but one of his like lost right yeah because supposedly they burnt the negative or something
[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:18.140]  like that and uh you know but they're you know it it's it is it it's almost you know or like
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:23.500]  infinite jest you know it's like mythical that that there's this yes this thing is just out there
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:30.140]  had has been out there ready to be found and discovered and i think that the way that i i will
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:36.940]  just say this the way that peter jackson put this together and to fish through now that i've seen
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:44.700]  this eight hour movie i can imagine what the 50 hours of footage were roughly like like
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:49.420]  you know just as a general idea to put this well a lot of it a lot of it was probably regarded as
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:55.180]  unusable i know some of my favorite parts are like eventually yes it does become tiresome as i will
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:06:01.580]  as i will opine in the fullness of time i think the thing that we that maybe i don't
[02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:06.860]  one one of the beautiful parts of this i feel like and by the way the original is 80 minutes long
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:12.620]  which i think wouldn't even barely qualify it as a feature but but but like but the the idea that
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:18.540]  and here's what it says so this is let it be 1969 uh by michael lindsey hog uh who is not
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:22.700]  sir dennis eaton hog uh a documentary showing both how the beatles made music together and
[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:27.660]  how they split up now get this hundreds of hours of raw footage was condensed into the final
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:31.980]  product well that was an interesting series of choices if he arrived at let it be from that
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:41.180]  footage i'm not trying to drag the guy but but the i think uh there's a light hand at work here
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:46.940]  in credit to mr jackson and his team in that there's very much like pretty great storytelling
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:53.260]  going on but it's it in order to really get a feel for what makes this special and different
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:57.340]  you you are going to have to sit with it and you're you're going to have to have your heart
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:03.420]  open see now i feel like i'm hectoring people i i love this i'm glad it exists but i feel like you
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.340]  have to understand it in a certain context john one of the great things that's included in this
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:11.660]  whatever you say eight hours like that sounds about right one of the things that's great in
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:17.580]  this is the meta talk that i'm certain i would have to imagine michael lindsay i would never
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.660]  include in his movie which is talking about the process of what they're making right now including
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:27.020]  the movie and the fact that like i never really completely understood the hardness of that
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:31.820]  deadline you know and that ubiquitous calendar starts to feel like the new york times election
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:35.020]  needle at a certain point we were like oh they got to do this and they got to do that and they
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:39.820]  got why did they put this pressure on themselves at this time that's so nuts but when you hear
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:47.420]  paul and john really all of them talking about decision making about what should happen next
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:54.140]  and what we can do you know what i mean i think that's really valuable to to know it's the other
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:08:01.980]  thing that's mind-blowing about it is there there's a whole a whole wing of the current
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:09.020]  media industrial complex devoted to quote-unquote reality shows right there's the you know
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:15.180]  bravo is a very popular cable network and all they do discovery whatever happened to like you know
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.380]  a and e in history it used to be hitler and sharks and now and now it really is
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:25.820]  like like drunk people in the southeast being arrested right but this was not a thing back then
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:32.220]  of shooting real life as it happened that didn't really happen till the loud family in the 70s
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:39.100]  uh accumulating lots of footage and then making something interesting out of it in the editing
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:44.060]  room right that the editing room is literally where the the creation of the final thing is
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:51.340]  happening like there there is no i've never seen anything like this that was shot prior to this
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:55.340]  footage being shot i i i don't know what you i mean there are certainly documentaries that were
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:09:02.140]  made prior to 1968 but they weren't like this right and and oftentimes documentaries are made
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:07.740]  after the fact you know like let's document what happened at pearl harbor you know and you go back
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:15.580]  and yes yes like these filmmakers the people who shot it they they captured these extraordinary
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:21.340]  moments in the most humble way possible and just just how much do you fall in love with kevin
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:25.500]  bringing tea and cigarettes like how who would have guessed that but the reason i bring all
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:33.660]  this up john is that is the point i'm struggling to make here is that with an insight what so much
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:38.300]  well think about kevin so much tea so many cigarettes cigarettes everywhere and now
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:44.540]  and it's like no but it's it's valuable to understand that john because why well let's
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:50.380]  state them the elephant in the room which is i think especially john but everybody to an
[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:57.100]  extent they're on camera for a lot of this time and they want to be amusing these are the guys
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:04.460]  these are your your beloved mop tops from uh hard day's night into a far lesser extent help
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:09.420]  like hard day's night was boy that's a special movie i don't know how much you can appreciate
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:14.540]  what a special movie he's a very clean old man like that that movie is unbelievable because
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:18.620]  you're like oh my god these guys are exactly as hilarious as i would expect them to be they were
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:24.220]  always on they lived in public and so when john's shucking and jiving and playing chuck berry covers
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:29.740]  i think he's trying to like fill air and be amusing it's ironic that paul gets the rap for
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:34.060]  being the one who's so bossy and mean and when it's like john who's utterly disrupting the whole
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:38.620]  thing maybe he's trying to keep it light but i think they all also are realizing this camera is
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:43.180]  seeing everything that we're doing but i think people are watching the beatles have a hard time
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:47.820]  i think that when when when they're just filling time and john is ripping through a chuck berry
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:53.740]  song or or like every once in a while they just go back and you they play one of their own old
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:59.260]  quote-unquote old songs and everybody knows this part everybody knows that that the trajectory of
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:05.820]  the beatles from the moment they the lifespan is ridiculously short i said this last night on
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:12.220]  twitter the amount of time between love me do and then breaking up is the equivalent of june 2014
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:18.060]  till now it's it's they went they went from love me due to the end right mind blown in seven seven
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:23.500]  six six or seven years we all know that but it's you you kind of get a palpable sense of it though
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:27.180]  watching this when they go back there was no beatles before the beatles right the beatles
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:35.660]  invented the beatles it's uh among the things that i i would like to talk it it there's there's the
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:41.500]  the basic story i've always been told and the mythology everything every complicated story
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:49.660]  gets reduced to a a sentence and the sentence is the beatles broke up because of yoko ono
[02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:53.740]  right and that they hated each by the end they hated each other and who came in and
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:59.740]  deliberately quote-unquote broke up the beatles because she was not even envious jealous right
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:04.300]  of john and she went in and deliberately again this is a story this is all in air quotes here
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:10.460]  but we were raised to believe that this horrible japanese woman was the one who undid this group
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:15.420]  with with her with her typical you know oriental villainy and i really think that's the story that
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:20.220]  we were told for the whole time yeah including this including the shot in the original movie
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:25.340]  when george quits and she goes and sits in sits in his chair another very famous scene like all
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:31.820]  that yoko she broke up the beatles and it's so much more complicated than that i mean you said
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:37.180]  it's like almost like it is it it's not almost like a movie about divorce it is it this is a
[02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:41.580]  movie about divorce but this is not a divorce where they just hated each other and which is
[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:45.740]  what i because you love each other doesn't mean you can be together forever and that's a sad adult
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:51.980]  fact right part of the the trajectory of get back is you can see that the band is disintegrating
[02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:58.540]  right and it certainly starts with george at least in terms of what he says right he's like
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:01.500]  i'm just going to take a vacation i'm going to get out of here and he disappears and they don't
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:07.260]  know where he is he doesn't come back for a while um he said he says it like he's going out to have
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:13.660]  a cigarette right well i forget the exact line because yeah well i'm gonna go now and so it is
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:21.340]  the story of the disintegration of this extraordinary group but they don't hate each
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:27.500]  other there is contention there it is not you know they are disintegrating but it's so clear that they
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:33.980]  all love each other truly love each other especially as it goes on and you you see just
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:40.380]  again i can't get away from those shots of just like john looking at paul and listening to what
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:48.460]  he's saying and nodding and paul listening to what george is saying and nodding and you can see that
[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:53.180]  they're they're they're not just civil with each other but they they generally want to like hear
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:57.180]  each other out and try and find a solution that'll work for everybody they're so even when the
[02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:02.620]  friction is really rough they're so kind to each other there's a extraordinary moment one of the
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:06.700]  one of the moments that truly brought tears to my eyes i'm tearing up just thinking about it is
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:13.580]  one of the many stresses involved here is that the beatles clearly everybody knows that there
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:19.260]  are that songs are all lennon mccartney and and it was john and paul's band right oh you talking
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:24.940]  about ringo and george well the a couple things about ringo and george but number two we we do
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:31.740]  know this from the rest of his life that george harrison was an extraordinary uh guitar player
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:38.780]  songwriter and i you know sad just he had such an eye for talent and arrangement right all those
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:44.060]  things but he lived in the beatles he lived as the same way that wringle would always be the new guy
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:48.780]  george would always be the little brother right and he got to have one song you know they every
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:54.700]  time they'd do an album there'd be a george song and he he goes to john and he says hey you know
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:15:00.700]  i i i i'm really feeling i'm paraphrasing but i've been really productive and i've i've got
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:07.260]  a bunch of really good songs and you know i know my role is i'm gonna get one song on an album but
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:12.300]  i'm i've got some really good stuff here i i'm thinking what i would like to do is do an album
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:18.700]  on my own and john says oh my god george that is a wonderful idea you should do that because this is
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:25.900]  good stuff you should you know and and that's so contrary to the narrative of john lenin as the
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:32.540]  selfish bastard especially towards the end right like in the latter the you know oh absolutely it
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:37.820]  and he means they're loosening up and but like there's some of the john had a fierce sense of
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:43.980]  humor and was i think as we as the the real heads know was frequently taken deeply out of context
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:48.620]  because there's no context i mean in the case of we're bigger than jesus christ that's continued
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:52.700]  to be one of the most ridiculous dust-off cyber that i was saying to my daughter while we were
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:58.780]  watching this like it's so brutal that the very point that john was trying to make in that remark
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:03.500]  when you take it out of context it sounds like he's saying the opposite of what he's saying oh
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:07.740]  so what he's saying is we're bigger than jesus christ and that's crazy right that's wrong this
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:12.060]  isn't that's not the way it should be we're just we're just these four four lads from liverpool
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:20.860]  playing rock and roll context you appreciate so much more about his uh almost compulsive need
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:26.540]  to make silly faces and like you can tell he's not comfortable with himself he's just a jealous guy
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:30.620]  like he you know what i mean and there's that one part that's just audio where he's just really
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:36.860]  being very raw in a way that would come out you know obviously in in stuff like again like jealous
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:42.380]  guy or stuff like you know something about his mom but like you can tell he's a really he's a really
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:49.100]  damaged guy and he's dancing to keep from crying and that's and i think fundamentally that's the
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:55.180]  the fisher that started the breakup was john and it wasn't that yoko broke up the beatles it was
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:17:00.380]  john ultimately and maybe it would have happened anyway you think because i mean there's also stuff
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:06.860]  about like when they like stuff like paul every i mean paul's the one who john's seen as in from
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:12.620]  the outside um at the 101 level john is seeing is seeing always seen as the really extreme guy
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:16.620]  who did brought in all the crazy stuff number nine number nine but the truth is that paul
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:20.460]  was the one who was bringing in a lot of continental culture he's the one that was
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:25.660]  dating fucking jane asher he was the one that's going to all the cool parties he's the one that's
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:31.820]  bringing in uh musique concrete like maybe not to a zappa level but he's bringing in a lot of very
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:36.540]  interesting stuff and the truth is john was the rock and roll guy it yep you know and it's just
[02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:44.140]  not simple it's so multivariate and each each of the well of john paul and george had their things
[02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:51.020]  that were creatively different the other thing that i have to talk about is his ringo who comes
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:56.460]  across amazingly well i love the guy i mean if you don't want to hug ringo star don't you want
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:00.460]  to be friends with him oh my god like wouldn't it be amazing to show up you show up at drexler
[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:04.300]  and like you go and go oh how's it going is it okay that i picked this bed like he you can just
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:09.180]  tell he's he's like a really decent guy like when he goes and gets a cookie and holds it up to the
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:13.900]  camera and you're like god fucking ringo i love you so much but ringo obviously saw what was
[02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:19.100]  happening around him and he could see it coming to an end and he's the one who really doesn't want
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:26.220]  this to end and like amy amy's note to me is that he looks constipated his fate you said their faces
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:31.820]  right but ringo which throw a lot of it george and ringo who end up being like the uh sort of
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:36.620]  ad hoc babysitters for these two idiots like you can see both of them are just like we should
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:41.900]  probably just play some songs ring but ringo's got this like constipated pained look he he's
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:47.900]  the kid watching his parents divorce and he realizes it's happening before the parents do
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:55.260]  you know he see he he's you know and i think that's true uh most people i know whose parents
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:00.140]  got divorced while they were kids they knew it right i i you know it's the kid knows it before
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:06.380]  the parents do because they think they think they're pulling it off right or so not right
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:13.100]  and and they're not and ringo sees it but ringo's got this look like man this this is we got a good
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:17.820]  thing going here you know what i mean right but then also the story about when you go like you
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:21.980]  know and i don't know if you've you're probably not as much of a dork as i am but i've got all
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:26.620]  the like the anthology documentaries and when they release and they've got short document
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:32.140]  i've got the anthology albums i mean that was it i thought that was the last video is actually if
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:37.660]  you look them up on it on itunes look at apple music the documentaries are included for each
[02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:41.980]  re-release the 2009s and so you can see for example you can hear that wonderful story about
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:46.540]  like when he quit when ringo quit during the white album and then they welcomed him back and said
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:51.020]  look we do love you we do appreciate you we didn't appreciate you enough and george had covered his
[02:19:51.020 --> 02:20:01.900]  entire drum set and flowers it's amazing uh it so george and ringo it they're both amazing they're
[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:09.740]  caught in this terrible it and maybe maybe it it's so multivariate and and the beatles were never in
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:14.620]  equilibrium right that that we talked about the fact that they went from hard day's night or
[02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:20.540]  whatever the first hit single in 1964 love me do love me do 62 was love me do so love me do to this
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:27.740]  but there was never a point where they were in stasis right and and closest to that would be 67
[02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:32.220]  which was a anis horribilis for the beatles they lost brian epstein they had the whole thing with
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:37.580]  the sexy sadie in india they went through all of this shit i think that's also i think that's when
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:43.180]  the jesus christ thing happened they had a terrible terrible year i mean you could maybe
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:48.860]  say that about magical mystery tour but they reinvented them i mean this is hazy graphic but
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:55.020]  they reinvented themselves every record they were never static every band with one very notable
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:21:02.060]  exception every great band broke up and sometimes it was from tragedy right zeppelin zeppelin broke
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:07.740]  up and i don't i don't think zeppelin was long for the world though even if bonham hadn't died
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:13.740]  in an accident well i agree uh i i they're in through the outdoor is a band that's that's
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:18.220]  obviously going a different direction right there they're i i i don't think they were long for the
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:22.860]  world i mean maybe they they would have gotten back together at some point 80s as led zeppelin
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:26.940]  as opposed to jimmy page and robert plant or you know page and plant or whatever they toured
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:34.700]  briefly for um you know the who broke up every band but the stones broke up and the stones are
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:40.780]  the exception clearly not the norm it's it's the way that creativity works in a way that the type
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:44.860]  of people who can make good the way that businesses work when you're when when the guy who leads the
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:51.180]  band has been has been scalped by uh alan klein and also has a degree in business they know how
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:57.740]  to treat that like a company so you know i i i i i don't think the beatles had a chance and you know
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:02.220]  like like so let's just toss this out there as a hypothetical let's say that john lennon
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:08.220]  and yoko ono had never met yeah whatever whatever the circumstances are that led to them meeting
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:13.500]  each other let's you know a butterfly flapped its wings in china a decade before and they never even
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:18.300]  met i don't think the beatles were going to make it anyway so it the whole yoko broke them up is
[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:24.860]  really and it comes across in this but but like many good stories she might have been a catalyst
[02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:32.060]  but she wasn't there there is a kernel of truth there where she she was a problematic presence
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:39.580]  in the studio like i sent you a screenshot from this week ago where they're playing and she's
[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:47.340]  reading the newspaper in the most i love that ostentatiously dismissive way and i think you
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:53.420]  quipped that she was like checking the box scores checking the box scores very interested in the nl
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:59.660]  west right but but it's also like ask yourself this having watched this ask yourself who probably
[02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:06.540]  asked nay demanded that yoko be there like if you watch that in 69 movie you might go oh obviously
[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:11.740]  yoko went in there so she could exercise her dark arts but i feel every bit of confidence that john
[02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:18.620]  was like please come in here and literally lean on you yep yep yep and he he obviously he needed her
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:25.820]  his mind was obsessed with her in a way that it you know it was him who wanted her there and then
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:33.100]  she was yoko when she was there which was weird but it's just so amazing because we we now in 2021
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:39.340]  get the gift of seeing this remarkable footage and seeing some of these songs that are part of
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:46.300]  our lizard brain at this point come together and she was literally not just in the room but was
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:51.340]  granted the privilege of a seat right next to john in the middle of the circle while they made
[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:57.260]  it and read the newspaper and didn't see it and also like you must have you must imagine at one
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:01.740]  point and this is nothing against anybody but you know toward the end i really want to talk about
[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:07.820]  this i really want to talk about um oh my god the wonderful scenes with linda and linda's daughter
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:15.500]  who's just so cute but but like if anybody man woman otherwise we're in every shot like if you
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:20.140]  were the director wouldn't there be a point where you would go to like neil aspinall or whatever and
[02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:27.340]  go like hey do you think you could talk to them about this this person not being here all the
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:32.060]  time right like no seriously think about that like in retrospect we look back and go oh we've all
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:36.860]  seen the ruddles we've all seen mr show talk about the fad three we know all the jokes of course in
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:42.060]  the ruddles the yoko character is a woman dressed as a nazi with a hitler mustache which is very
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:47.500]  subtle but um still funny though ruddles very funny but but no but like i mentioned any but
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:52.620]  it's a movie about the fucking beetles why is there another person here who's not involved
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:25:00.140]  it must have been really disruptive it it and uncomfortable right and and and they clearly in
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:07.100]  other moments it's so clear that they have a brother-like comfort with each other uh and here's
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:13.660]  this foreign person who foreign in every sense foreign the sense of being what we now call
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:18.940]  international gratefully right but also foreign in the sense of like she's she's she's a fly in
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:24.300]  the ointment right and and is not part of the beetles at all right it's it's and it's like
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:28.940]  having a splinter you know like your body knows that that splinter is not supposed to be there
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:36.140]  and the skin gets red and irritated around it because oh god it's so true right horrible but
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:42.940]  it's yeah it's like it's just a foreign object that the body works so well for that story though
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:50.460]  it works so well not this story but the story of yoko is the the spanner in the works who comes in
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:56.540]  and deliberately and it's but it's it's yeah i've got i had a whole list of these of things that i
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:26:04.220]  came up believing to be true that at least in some part this movie gave me so much context
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:08.860]  to see differently it's always broken my heart because i'm a paul guy i mean i love them all but
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:14.860]  yeah i'm a paul i mean i really i really like i like it's we don't have time for this um i i love
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:19.340]  so much about paul in general yes he became kind of annoying and why is he driving a boat in the
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:24.060]  documentary of the anthology why is he why is he looking through a window on a boat like hey i'm
[02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:31.020]  gonna do the school let's go drive around in a boat okay whatever um but like the story that you
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:36.540]  get out of the original and a story that has stuck to paul in a way that i've always felt well at
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:41.580]  least made me feel icky is the whole like well you know paul's the asshole who broke up the beatles
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:46.380]  paul's the one now we learned that didn't want to sign with alan klein who by the way totally ripped
[02:26:46.380 --> 02:26:52.380]  them off same guy memory serves i think he's also the guy that made the stones have to move to france
[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:58.060]  like alan klein was not a good guy i mean you know exile and main street are our favorite i
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:01.980]  think it's yours right oh yeah without question yeah there'd be no rocks off without alan klein
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:07.980]  and heroin sorry and um but but okay so so but i'm a paul guy i like paul and you know what because
[02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:13.820]  i'm like paul i'm like the puppy dog that wants to be loved and i love his pop sensibilities and my
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:18.380]  god go back and listen to a song like here there and everywhere like i know you get this but like
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:24.060]  the first verse starts with here the second first he's so but he got the rap for being the guy who
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:30.700]  after yoko we can most blame for the beatles breaking up because he was so uncool and hassling
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:39.100]  everybody all the time and with this i see paul in a role that i i i couldn't even have guessed
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:44.460]  which is guys we we need to do this and we need to plan and we need a work ethic and i think in
[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:49.100]  a lot of ways in a way that george and ringo would probably not pipe up about for years
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:54.860]  i think he needed to be john's wrangler and i think he needed to find a way to
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:28:02.220]  attach that wild horse to the most useful cart and we got to keep john happy but we all guys we
[02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:07.660]  really need to get to work right we we can't just play kansas city all day like we we've got we've
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:14.940]  got stuff to do here and like i i that was one of the big ones for me just personal point of personal
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:19.580]  privilege is like it was nice for me to see you know what paul wasn't a jerk paul was trying
[02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:23.980]  really hard i can't get away from this the scenes where it's just you just see the reaction shot
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:29.980]  of paul nodding and like with big eyes and like i am getting all the body language of i hear you
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:33.900]  and i'm listening to you and even though i may not agree with you i'm not going to say anything
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:39.420]  about it because i want to keep things going he's he's like the project manager nobody likes believe
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:44.300]  me i'm a retired project manager nobody likes the project manager you're vice president in charge of
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.620]  bad news nobody likes you because you're the one with the shoulder you're on the hand between the
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:54.220]  shoulder blades saying let's keep moving toward the exit right that my job is to keep this moving
[02:28:54.860 --> 02:28:59.100]  that calendar we're looking at an x on that calendar every day and i don't know how long
[02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:05.420]  we're going to spend perfecting polythene fan pam if like you're going to be over here you just
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:09.820]  want to shuck and jive for an hour yeah fucking around well some of it is like oh alex has got to
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:14.220]  go set up his studio that didn't work god that shit is so hilarious but but then also just the
[02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:20.300]  stuff of like anyway that was a big one for me the you know that i'd always heard john i think john
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:25.820]  was at this point i can't i don't want to say anything about the man but i think he was into
[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:30.140]  some of the problems that would bedevil him in the early 70s i think he might have been doing some
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:35.820]  heroin then i'm not sure yeah point is other story more conventional wisdom john was a fucking
[02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:41.740]  gacked out zombie and fucking yoko put her hand up his ass and like made him walk around and go
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:47.180]  kiss kiss be rough or whatever like and but you know but also the final one the huge one the
[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:52.940]  beetles hated each other and every minute with of this was terrible no it wasn't they're like there's
[02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:58.060]  more there's more friction on succession they were in the making so kind to each other as they were
[02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:05.020]  so kind so patient generous good listeners my my wife even said uh one of her notes was that
[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:09.900]  she wishes the beetles were her parents because they got along they got along so much better
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.980]  yeah yeah yeah yeah and like you know
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:21.900]  there's there's a big part of the third episode maybe it's sort of the whole i
[02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:28.380]  i one thing for me is that the as i watched we watched one you know one segment per night at a
[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:33.340]  time we didn't binge you know to four hours of it at once but they all it all blurred together for
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:41.260]  me and and each one put me into a hypnotic state where it compelled me to just sort of just it in
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:46.300]  the best possible way that cinema just pulls you in and then the credits roll and you're like i
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:50.780]  can't believe that's over and you're like oh that was two hours i can't that's godfather too right
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:55.900]  in a nut yeah it it pulls you in how was how was that three hours but the the third one is mostly
[02:30:55.900 --> 02:31:00.860]  about the the rooftop concert everybody has seen the footage of and knows that they did it but
[02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:07.020]  my god they were so nervous about it oh my god like but just like little dumb things like jumping
[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:11.660]  up and down on the boards because they're not sure if the roof can hold all of the weight yep
[02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:16.700]  there's nowhere else that they can go right this is the absolute last resort right and freaking
[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:21.820]  dennis eaton hog has 10 cameras he needs to be doing stuff with across the street three cameras
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:27.020]  downstairs like like all of that stuff and it's a quickening like this is it guys it's go time
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:31.660]  however they came up with that dumb date like i don't know but but the meta talk again the
[02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:37.100]  meta talk all along is okay so where are we today well we got these songs we're getting pretty good
[02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:41.900]  with you know get back or amazing don't let me down we're getting there but like where are we
[02:31:41.900 --> 02:31:46.460]  going to stage this how's it going to happen are we still doing this as a tv show because
[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:50.300]  let me ask you here's the thing here's how merlin man thinks about it wait a minute so
[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:57.020]  as of today what are we making is this mainly a movie is this mainly a tv show is this mainly
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:32:01.900]  because the decision making that like glenn johns is going to need to know about in order to
[02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:06.940]  if you want to record live on a roof in london wow that's a really different setup than being
[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:13.660]  in this studio versus the apple studio on several several road but the and and and they were so
[02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:19.660]  focused on the set list and and you think i don't know there's a part of me that is it okay if we
[02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:24.940]  play an acoustic guitar right like they had to think about that there was a part of me that
[02:32:24.940 --> 02:32:31.260]  always assumed and one of the weird things about the beatles is that they stopped touring relatively
[02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:36.140]  early you know and and all you know what we think of as the best of the beatles they didn't tour
[02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:41.820]  and do rock concerts like we think that's what a major band they would do studio things but 65
[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:45.660]  right when that ended and they went into the studio for revolver but yeah they would do
[02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:49.980]  occasional they would do the all we'd uh all we need is love they would do the lead you know but
[02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:55.740]  no they they couldn't hear anything but they but they clearly uh you know and famously i don't know
[02:32:55.740 --> 02:33:01.020]  if you've ever heard of this fellow malcolm black gladwell but uh oh no no you better not there
[02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:06.940]  better not be a five-finger estimate five-figure estimate coming here but you know he's but what
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:13.740]  if you practice 10 000 hours and you still suck is that a thing but the thing is he is sort of
[02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:19.900]  shit hate that guy he is sort of right about um that the no but he's right that that they honed
[02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:25.340]  they they honed their chops playing live in dive bars eight hours a day the owner would yell mok
[02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:30.780]  xiao mok xiao go out and make a good show and they would play for eight hours totally totally
[02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:35.580]  like totally on speed and like having to amuse drunk people for eight hours a day
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:43.340]  and but that they they they still were even if they stopped playing live shows in 65
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:51.820]  they still prided themselves on it and they wanted that thing to be perfect and they sweated the
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:56.940]  everything how we're going out it better be good and should they all be rockers like what right
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:34:01.740]  should we play our old stuff like how would you leave people with the last impression of the
[02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:06.300]  beatles and and you're deciding that on the tuesday before the wednesday when it happens
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:15.420]  all right do do we do we have time for a special guest um i think we do i think yeah all right my
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:23.100]  wife wants to talk to you about about debbie debbie okay amy are you there here why don't you take
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:27.020]  over we don't we don't have time i don't want to no you got it you got to talk you come on and talk
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:33.340]  about debbie we haven't spoken about it oh you haven't talked about debbie but debbie was the
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:39.980]  star of the show wait remind me who debbie is oh you don't remember debbie so debbie was the person
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:46.700]  tasked with holding off the cops oh my god the girl with the highliner and the hidden camera
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:56.140]  oh my god and her her her thing was just repeat whatever they say to my time which is sort of a
[02:34:56.140 --> 02:35:03.420]  great strategy and she'd be like oh so you want to come in right and they'd be like yes yes yes
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:08.380]  we would be much obliged to come in and she's like so everyone's so polite don't you wish black
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:16.300]  people got a chance to pick their cops and they're so polite and then when they finally do go up and
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:23.660]  they just stand there oh my god oh my god because i i sort of suspected that um the cops just wanted
[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:29.580]  to get in to see you know like did i sort of very much had that they waited a pretty long time
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:35.020]  they were just like can i go upstairs and debbie was like well you know there's a weight limit
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:43.340]  so you might not want to go up there because the roof might fall in and oh my god i i would watch
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:48.220]  a whole documentary i'm not sure her name is debbie now but i would watch a whole documentary
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:52.060]  about debbie ten years ago you would have called it a web series like give me just something like
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:56.540]  a children's hospital like just give me give me 10 episodes about debbie i would also and i can
[02:35:56.540 --> 02:36:00.780]  understand if you're not a parent that you would think this is annoying but like how much do you
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:07.980]  love little heather doing some pretty serviceable hi-hat work and ringo does not say a peep how
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:13.660]  awesome was that kid how i mean like she was she was like keeping a rhythm on the hi-hat it was
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:22.380]  crazy right but didn't didn't you sort of feel like paul bringing a kid was his answer i've done
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:27.500]  that when i asked john being there yeah yeah i totally do like that was his answer this is this
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:33.420]  is my human shield you're gonna bring yoko well i'm gonna bring a child and let's talk about that
[02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:37.580]  i don't know if it's here or the anthology but george talks about how everybody's on such better
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:42.380]  behavior once they bring in billy preston same way that when they brought in eric clapton everybody
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:47.260]  oh yeah yeah to each other yeah yeah yeah i've held divorce this is how divorced people stay
[02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:52.060]  together amy but gotta bring another party we were witness we were actually super worried about
[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:57.020]  billy preston we were like is he a hostage like why aren't they letting him go billy preston has
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:03.740]  been there a long time oh he's the load-bearing load-bearing pianist yeah yeah because he just
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:11.500]  smiled and did great he seems so cool oh didn't he didn't he but oh okay this is something did you
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:17.500]  guys talk about the cops yet so the cops mean super civil like first of all that was the thing
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:24.380]  that oh my god yes broke me again like we've we've received some complaints they they must have been
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:28.620]  utterly disruptive 10 or 13 or however many cameras the whole thing must have been so
[02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:33.260]  disruptive oh my god it was your impression you think you think you might like some of those in
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:39.260]  philly get some bobbies yeah we we don't have any of those and first of all why do they tolerate the
[02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:44.140]  strap under their lip the strap under the lip would make me lose my goddamn mind i i kept it
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:50.220]  was like seeing somebody with a stain and the one young kid who looked like my son's age or younger
[02:37:50.220 --> 02:37:55.660]  like 12 kept licking it and i was like god covet oh my god stop licking your strap
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:38:03.020]  but um like it was like bad breath you get stinky strap oh i would hate that oh my god your strap
[02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:11.180]  stank so bad but i also thought too like in the current era that the cops would bust in and think
[02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:17.660]  well billy preston is kidnapping the beatles and making them play and would just hello hello hello
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:25.420]  why are you stealing this brand new fender roads piano what's all this thing bang bang bang that's
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:32.060]  not funny but it is true but that's how we live now like seeing the cops be and they were probably
[02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:39.180]  overly civil and i i i don't know you know what the beatles were like then but like it's here but
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:43.100]  here ringo again i don't know if it was here i've watched so much stuff lately but where ringo's
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:46.620]  talking about oh in fact they let us play too long i was really hoping they'd bust this and
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:52.460]  i'd be dragged away in handcuffs like oh man and didn't they sort of say that they said at the end
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:58.780]  like um we wanted more of a spectacle let's just say the cops made a stop when in reality i think
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:03.660]  they felt they weren't up to snuff didn't they say that at the end they said like the fact that
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:07.900]  they do all those sort of multiple takes to get like the best take and john was just saying a
[02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:13.500]  minute ago you can tell they're so nervous about having to do this and like i just as i say like
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:18.140]  as a project for a project manager i just think about how many things could go wrong and how
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:23.980]  under planned this whole thing is and it really could have been such a debacle but it was new
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:32.540]  material it was so amazing and so for the whole thing you realize that like paul to me paul was
[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:39.660]  the dad you know he was the one and it was so exceedingly civil to me the way he said like
[02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:45.580]  let's you know hey we're gonna do this tomorrow maybe we should practice lads you know like he
[02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:49.980]  was so exceedingly yeah i don't want to be a dick about it but this is probably our last show so
[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:54.460]  maybe we should learn and then maybe we should play it all the way through like without without
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:40:00.140]  doing an everly brothers cover maybe we could do right but i grew up thinking that the beatles
[02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:06.380]  breaking up was this diva huge this is my question this is my question for you um i asked i was
[02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:10.540]  talking to john about this but we're talking about sort of at least for me as somebody who's
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:16.220]  a midling level beetle yes that's exactly where i am like i am all the stories though yeah but
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:20.140]  you know yeah you know yoko broke them up and paul's the jerk what were your as we say on
[02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:23.980]  political twitter what were your priors coming into this what were the things that you expected
[02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:29.100]  or didn't expect to see what what was different well give me your impressions just in general
[02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:32.780]  like what you came in with as somebody and we've talked about this about you know jonas levingale
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:37.740]  a submarine as a kid whether we talked about that in new zealand but like your priors coming into
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:43.740]  this were what were you expecting out of it well i thought that john was this huge diva and that
[02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:51.980]  he brought in yoko and and i'm not saying that i thought yoko broke up the beatles because even
[02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:58.780]  to me as a kid that smelled uh misogynist and racist yeah but i did i wish i smelled that
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:04.380]  better because i believe that until no more recently than no i i'm being dead honest i
[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:09.260]  believe that because i grew up with it it became that's how we grew up it that was the thing yoko
[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:14.300]  broke that was the explanation instead of like oh paul moved to a different part of london like
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:16.860]  there's all kinds of things you're like oh i didn't know about that oh you know when john
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.580]  broke up with cynthia and that was really painful and john barely left his house for a fucking year
[02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:25.820]  because he was so depressed we don't talk about these things as much as the asian lady with the
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:33.900]  hat no john was a weirdo i mean john john was to me the off thing and but they were so civil in
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:38.780]  dealing with him like to me like i can't tell you how many times i thought someone needs to punch
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:45.980]  john in the face right now like they're doing let it be stick a ritalin into john's cats yes
[02:41:45.980 --> 02:41:52.060]  yes you know you need to pump the brakes this nervous energy is not helping can i say that that
[02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:58.780]  john is sort of the undiagnosed kid because we grew up in that era where kids were undiagnosed
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:03.900]  where i think i think john needed some medication i think he was a genius i think he was a super
[02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:09.500]  nice person and that's the overriding thing he wasn't this diva he was a nice aspect you know
[02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:17.980]  his mom died and like yeah and paul's too right paul's mother died too but john's whole i mean
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:21.740]  again i'm not going to be the armchair guy but i'm just curious so you come into that and so
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:25.980]  i was telling john how excited i was when i saw the trailer a few months ago because it was so
[02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:30.700]  different from what i'd seen in the movie let it be like what what was your feeling when you saw
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:33.740]  this was coming did you think oh no it's going to be another lord of the rings movie with nine
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:39.100]  endings like what was your what was your feeling i was sort of i know you're a huge fan of peter
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:47.180]  jackson in general yeah you love music about uh in the middle of the yeah about coin you love coins
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:54.780]  you love dwarfs we don't say midget anymore you merlin i you can't say the word midget onto you
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:43:04.700]  i took a xanax and yelled i'm out really yeah yeah not only did i take the xanax during that movie
[02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:10.140]  and i was so happy it was still in my purse we must have traveled you know so i was like what
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:14.780]  a gift i screamed yeah no it was a great gift and i was like wake me up when this is over it's
[02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:19.820]  terrible and i love the books so i'm not you know right and you just you just turn and look him dead
[02:43:19.820 --> 02:43:28.460]  in the eyes and go you owe me it's like i'm out no but but thinking this i i sort of always thought
[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:36.940]  like paul was the diva you know that maybe i was always team paul he's very supposed to be like
[02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:42.140]  very ego assertive yeah in a way that like he steps on everybody else's contributions and makes
[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:48.380]  them play his i think the phrase john used was his granny shit yeah and i also thought too that
[02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:55.260]  when this came out because paul's the only one left well i mean ringo i mean i could do a whole
[02:43:55.260 --> 02:44:03.340]  show on ringo and his faces he was so concerned and constipated um but i it's fun to it's fun
[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:11.580]  to be reading this all on twitter that's where rico was so calm i want to just hug him he's like
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:17.100]  he's like a cabbage patch doll or no or like what he's like uh everyone like a like a foster pet
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:24.220]  they were all so they they were all so nice like he wasn't he wasn't i i don't know he was a
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:29.020]  sweetheart i loved ringo but yes he was very constipated and he sort of was the only one
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:35.340]  who knew like we're fucking this up we're messing yeah ringo's it's so interesting because like when
[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:41.020]  we go back and i watch a youtube video the other day of you know i i know that ringo is one of the
[02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:46.060]  great drummers and i mean the real heads no but there are a lot of people who are like oh yeah
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:52.060]  ringo whatever he's no no he's not tom petty used him as a drummer for at least one album but they
[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:57.820]  were friends but he was friends with george harrington and uh ringo very low key he was
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:02.460]  there oh yeah when prince throws his guitar in the air but he's very very low key and but like
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:09.180]  what ringo brings to a song my guess is as a as a former musician is that a lot of what ringo brings
[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:15.500]  to the process is not going to fully bloom until the songwriting is done until the arrangement is
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:18.940]  done and when you go through this youtube video i'll try and find out for notes but like it was
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:23.180]  a guy explaining like well here's how anybody else would have played ticket to ride here's how
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:28.860]  anybody else would have played um i'm only sleeping or whatever and here's how ringo played it and you
[02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:33.740]  would never in a million years think that that's the drum beat that worked there but i i'm guessing
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:40.300]  that he what he really brought to the band apart from an insane meter and like sense of rhythm was
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:43.900]  that you know what i mean though like if they're still fucking around going like i don't know if
[02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:47.900]  this song is called scrambled eggs or what or they're saying like i can't decide about like you
[02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:53.420]  know uh what's the one get back is the one that takes forever you know i bet i bet a lot of the
[02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:59.420]  art for ringo comes in at the point where they're recording yeah where he can really hear what he's
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:05.340]  doing with the actual song right what i mean and i i know nothing about music but that is something
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:11.740]  you know a lot always said about drummers though like well charlie watts has recently died and the
[02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:19.180]  you know the stones say he was the heartbeat of the stones so i believe that i believe that you
[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:26.060]  know i don't think that you know ringo was terrible but but i love it but he's not flashy
[02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:30.380]  well because like you're nothing i mean he's not out there doing like i mean i don't uh
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:35.740]  stewart copeland i mean for me as an all-timer but not everybody can or should be stewart copeland
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:40.780]  and you don't become stewart copeland unless under you let's you understand a whole lot of things
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:47.660]  that are about more than playing when the levee breaks mostly right right oh even dave grohl you
[02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:54.460]  know we didn't oh jesus i mean my god the drum for the drum fills dude the drum fills on no one knows
[02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:58.060]  i just made my kid put down her phone and just watch no one knows just listen listen the drum
[02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:03.820]  fills on on the on the on the second of course do you do that to your kid i do that shit to my kid
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:09.980]  and my kid is like who cares you know yeah like no they're not obligated to care but it would
[02:47:09.980 --> 02:47:14.460]  really help me i would have more affection if i'm being honest if you could just if you could just
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:18.140]  sit down and not play against an inch impact if you could just sit here and watch the big
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:22.780]  lebowski like a gentleman i think we'd get along a lot better yeah yeah i'll let you i'll pay for

[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:43.180]  is that correct oh no no well it's just a pile i mean he he doesn't bring in the mail he just
[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:47.420]  looks through it if there's anything that interests him he brings it up and then it's
[02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:53.020]  jerry picker yeah he's cherry picker i'm telling john we gotta we're talking about catalogs because

[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:53.500]  road you think he's saying fuck because i think he might be i think john might be saying the
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:50:00.620]  endlessly until she falls asleep yes yes i need i need to hear why don't we do it in the road
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:05.180]  and it is well no one will be watching us no one will be watching us so why don't we do it in the
[02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:12.620]  road and those are the only words and if i get drunk enough which you know well you know it's
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:19.500]  you gotta you gotta it's called self-care i also love i dig a pony that's not bad let it be as far
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:24.460]  in a way my least favorite do you know what i learned to hate the long and winding road during
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:31.100]  this documentary i was like hey that's a beautiful song like in theory but when i have to hear it 50
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:36.700]  fucking times i i also got sick again george needs to pump the brakes on that well that that leslie
[02:50:36.700 --> 02:50:41.660]  organ effect that like phaser e sound pump the brakes george you got your you got your cool
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:46.860]  s like an alex strata caster just play it like a gentleman don't be cute about it yeah but hey did
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:51.260]  you guys talk about the part so this is something that like so struck me because we were talking
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:58.140]  earlier about how i thought the beatles breaking up was like so dramatic but then when george says
[02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:03.900]  to john like hey i'm thinking about putting out an album since i have so many songs and john's like
[02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:10.220]  yeah you should do it that would be cool and i'm like they were so it feels sincere like when
[02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:16.460]  george is helping ringo ringo plays guitar so amy i pioneered a style of piano that i call
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:22.460]  wolverine style because imagine wolverine's three claws and i can play a major chord or a minor
[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:27.740]  chord in several white keys but i'm not a piano player and that's roughly i think where richard
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:33.500]  one richard starkey is he's doing wolverine piano for octopus's garden and then george comes over
[02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:37.260]  and then the nicest way is like yeah but then you got to bring it back around you got to go to the
[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:42.540]  f and then the g and you bring it back around i love that scene they love each other they were
[02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:47.340]  they loved each other so much there's always it's always been presented as i said this john earlier
[02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:52.860]  but like so much john lennon stuff yeah it's like taking way out of context my favorite john quote
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:56.940]  of all time which is the meanest most horrible thing anybody could ever say but i would like
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:01.100]  to think it's taken out of context when somebody said do you think ringo's the best drummer in rock
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:05.980]  and roll and he said uh ringo's not even the best drummer in the beatles oh so that's the kind of
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.740]  thing no he's talking about paul who is the best everything in the band but but but that's what
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:14.140]  that's the rep the rep is that john is the most cutting evil person in the world that george is
[02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:20.780]  the standoffish like slightly spectrumy like you know meditation man right right i'm thinking about
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:24.220]  who me i mean mine and you're inside when you go the whole point of going there was to figure out
[02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:30.300]  who we are oh my god you've got that lilt so i don't really i started talking like that after
[02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:34.940]  watching it like four nights in a row i started oh god that's insufferably did you go any place
[02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:41.260]  in public talking like that oh yeah well no well throw a mask okay now we bring it back around to
[02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:46.540]  to hour one or hour three um hop sing if you went in there and started affecting a british accent
[02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:52.780]  maybe you're like you know how would that go you hand over your license and then you start talking
[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:56.380]  like you imagine paul mccartney sounds like would you be put on the list would you go in the
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:53:01.900]  spreadsheet for that yeah probably especially since uh the owner knows that that is not how
[02:53:01.900 --> 02:53:07.820]  i speak but i have this weird thing where if people have accents i sort of start remember
[02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:14.300]  when we were in new zealand and everyone had a lovely accent but i sort of start when people
[02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:18.060]  talk like this and there was a kids show that was always on where the guy would talk about being sun
[02:53:18.060 --> 02:53:24.300]  seeth but i sort of do that in my head oh that's terrible and then you're like somebody i knew in
[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:29.420]  junior high that's awful yeah well i'm not the person who like vacations in south carolina and
[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:34.780]  then comes back with a southern accent for a week yeah but like remember when madonna got an english
[02:53:34.780 --> 02:53:39.180]  accent for a while that was pretty that was hot that was hot she wasn't well you know i wouldn't
[02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:45.900]  toss her out of bed for eating i could do a whole podcast on uh pictures that madonna released last
[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:52.540]  week oh i would love that i would listen to that you should a look them up because okay what the
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:58.460]  fuck are they old no no no she just released pictures where suddenly she looks like kim
[02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:04.780]  kardashian but 10 years younger oh no did she do a katelyn olson she has her ass out i mean
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:09.580]  oh good for her that's terrific i mean good good arm tone yeah good for you know what i celebrate
[02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:17.180]  all people of all shapes sizes accents uh whatever drugs people though the internet's clamoring
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:20.300]  amy jane i don't know if it's you and paul i don't know what what should happen but people
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:24.300]  are clamoring for you you should you should do more podcasting i i thoroughly enjoy visiting with
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:28.460]  you even when i'm not in the conversation and i know you enjoy it especially when i'm not in
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:33.180]  the conversation you should do a podcast you're really fine at it so for like a week i've been
[02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:39.420]  saying to john you have to talk about debbie on the podcast the woman who calls off the police
[02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:44.380]  and i'm like you have to talk about how civil the police are and i was like you have to talk about
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:53.660]  even though you know john is in my mind john was sort of the problem and he's not he's a nice guy
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:55:00.940]  i mean he's undiagnosed and he's got some issues but he he was just he was a nice they're all nice
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:05.900]  people it just didn't work they're all there's a there's i don't know who said this but one of the
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:10.540]  great purported quotes in the history of rock and roll there are many great ones but one of my
[02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:15.980]  favorites is and it's probably attributed to somebody like a pop or alex chilton but the quote
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:19.660]  is that all great rock and roll is on the verge of falling apart which may not always be true
[02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:25.340]  because you can be a professional about it but but really the the the alchemy of a group of people
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:30.780]  that becomes incredibly interesting comes out of a point in time usually when people didn't have any
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:36.220]  other choice but to collaborate with this group of people that was their best bet but like like
[02:55:36.220 --> 02:55:39.820]  you know do you want to be mick i mean with all respect do you want to be mick jackerson's
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:47.980]  satisfaction when you're 95 like do you want to be like i kind of do you do huh no i kind of do like
[02:55:47.980 --> 02:55:53.020]  i'm sort of like having a love affair i just want to make jagger right now but you're right you're
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:57.100]  right verse of rocks off all the time i just want to sing the sunshine bores the day's lights
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:56:03.420]  daylights out of me part that's sean's favorite stone song rocks off it's the best song what's
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:09.020]  your favorite stones oh oh you know what it's keith's song um i can't decide if it's happy
[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:16.140]  or before they make me run what's your favorite time petty song don't overthink it don't over
[02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:21.580]  think it the waiting i bet it's the waiting it's the way it's the best song it's in the video the
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:28.700]  fucking music video oh the video's sad it's so it's so it's so it's what them in a white room
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:35.500]  right uh well the all the records so that's is that um hard promises or yeah it's waiting is so
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:41.580]  yeah yeah so they did um they also did a florida boy who's a florida boy come on he's a florida
[02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:47.020]  boy he's a gator i forget that you are a florida boy until i hear you talk my band played in
[02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:51.660]  gainesville exactly once at a place called the covered dish uh but that's what they have there's
[02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:58.860]  one video the covered dish yeah yeah yeah but but like so the waiting is like something from a dream
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:02.620]  is that the one where he slashes the paper with the rickenbacker i think that's the way yeah i
[02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:05.980]  think that's the way oh but then the other one that was on mtv all the time which is a little
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:09.580]  sillier is letting you go where the cameras are nodding up and down do you remember that oh my
[02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:18.060]  god i can't really remember that i'm having trouble letting you go i love that but i can't
[02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:24.860]  believe because he you know he had so many iconic videos like you know the alice in wonderland one
[02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:31.420]  you know so but i can't believe that you remember letting you go and the way that's so i'll tell you
[02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:34.540]  i'll tell you a secret one of my i have a few great shames in life that i don't like to talk
[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.900]  about because in america now the only shameful things are private things and the only private
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:41.580]  things are shameful things and that's a goddamn tragedy talk talk to me about that on your podcast
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:45.820]  but here's what i'm ready to tell you you have a few regrets bummers that came along one is when
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:49.260]  we cleaned out our house around the time our kid was born i should not have thrown out all my all
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:54.220]  my old rock and roll t-shirts that was a bad idea it felt like a good idea at the time the other one
[02:57:54.220 --> 02:58:01.020]  is that i had a guitar my dream guitar that i got in college and i needed rent money so i had to sell
[02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:08.380]  it and it's the 12-string rickenbacker not the one you're thinking of like john would play yeah the
[02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:14.940]  12-string rickenbacker on the cover of the other album not hard promises but he's playing at 12
[02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:20.540]  he's got a 12-string he always has a 12-string you know what i used to go to see him in concert and
[02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:26.220]  i would know i would yell and john found it so annoying and it was super annoying but i could
[02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:31.260]  tell what song he was going to play by the guitar he pulled out oh my god you're that guy yeah yeah
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:35.980]  and job is like you're such a loser oh my god you get no points for that yeah but i was like
[02:58:37.980 --> 02:58:41.260]  you might have become unfuckable oh my god that's a shame
[02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:53.100]  you know i just knew and especially it's all right if you don't
[02:58:53.100 --> 02:59:00.700]  i don't know why i'm singing like that that's terrible and the combination of mike's guitar
[02:59:00.700 --> 02:59:08.380]  and tom's guitar i'd be like oh yeah you know i love that boy's summer song just because oh
[02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:13.820]  mike campbell wrote that solo and he wrote the whole song tom petty passed on it tom petty said
[02:59:13.820 --> 02:59:19.100]  this doesn't feel like a tom petty song and so he's so tasteful amy he's so tasteful
[02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:25.900]  the guy's amazing oh so wait i gotta wrap this up okay i keep telling john i will give this back
[02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:29.420]  to you in one second no no he's fine don't worry don't worry fine by the way you guys are gonna
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:33.100]  start a steakhouse and you're gonna be the hostess just so you know he'll tell you are we
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:38.460]  gonna have a cream spinach because my god i love god yes john look look there's not a lot of things
[02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:42.700]  i like about john okay there's virtually nothing i like about john but he does have a pretty good
[02:59:42.700 --> 02:59:47.020]  internal he has a good internal barometer for how to make a steakhouse and i think he might want to
[02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:52.460]  go with it he does he does yeah yeah that might be our by the way if there's vodka and it's not a
[02:59:52.460 --> 02:59:59.980]  martini stop living a lie i don't like me i feel like that was a little mean i don't like jin but

[03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:08.140]  going to talk about oh you have to talk about that with him because um you know i i thought
[03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:12.300]  i wouldn't like it i was like uh and then i listened to it and i was like oh my god this

[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:27.580]  i'm back oh hey how's it going bud half of this conversation was fascinating to listen to
[03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:32.060]  oh well believe me it was the only half worth listening to oh definitely you would think though
[03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:35.820]  that at this point i would have some way to plug in a second set of headphones but
[03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:38.620]  oh you don't want to do that because then now you're going to hell and bring it all back to
[03:02:38.620 --> 03:02:45.180]  skype my friend skype does a cool thing that i learned about one day which is skype appears to
[03:02:45.180 --> 03:02:49.180]  be hearing and listening and recording and sending a signal for a mic but just because
[03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:54.220]  it looks like it doesn't mean it does you're gonna have to do a loopback or similar to get
[03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:59.180]  skype to do that and please test it before you actually deploy it because it's the worst
[03:02:59.180 --> 03:03:05.340]  any any closing thoughts on uh on get back uh but i i it seemed like from part of your
[03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:10.460]  conversation with the with uh amy that you you were talking with your with your account you can't
[03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:13.420]  yeah my my uh the front of the house my my mator d

[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:32.780]  have a favorite can you can you name one favorite beatle song it's really it's really difficult
[03:03:32.780 --> 03:03:36.620]  last night so i was watching those documentaries after i finished this because why would i go to
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:43.020]  bed like a person and so i i always find myself landing back on the white album um and there's i
[03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:47.340]  mean like some of the paul stuff you know what i it's difficult for me to answer don't put me in
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:53.820]  a corner i do love i i love i will a lot all right i wait well you know what hang on fuck it's
[03:03:53.820 --> 03:03:59.500]  got to be something that's good fuck here they're everywhere i don't know what's yours uh can you do
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:04.700]  it off the dome is it it's like always the same song for you for me it's all well i don't know if
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:09.180]  it always is it why is it why don't we do it in the road no not for me that's i i can't hear that
[03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:15.500]  song because of the aforementioned the way it pops up and again once it comes on like oh god
[03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:21.260]  forbid our home pod ever play that song because once it comes on all she does is play it again
[03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:25.980]  you know play hey dingus play it again and it never stops john you should get that looked at
[03:04:25.980 --> 03:04:33.900]  that's awesome no for me it's uh two of us really i love from let it be i love it i love that song
[03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:41.580]  that's cool and i also it to me and and hearing him do it on the in the movie uh i've always had
[03:04:41.580 --> 03:04:46.140]  the thought and i know it's right there in the title two of us uh but you know like i told you
[03:04:46.140 --> 03:04:50.540]  i'm a paul guy i think that's a really old song didn't they originally write that i think so early
[03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:56.220]  on but when when i was mainly a paul song as john when i was a kid a little kid growing up my mom
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:05:02.460]  had the best she had all the beatle stuff and and it was one of those things where uh my mom you
[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:07.180]  know because the beatles broke up right before you know before i was born and she had them all
[03:05:07.180 --> 03:05:12.140]  and that's sort of where she tuned out of popular music so like all my mom's stones albums were from
[03:05:12.140 --> 03:05:17.100]  the 60s which is great and it but she didn't have any of the 70s stuff which is really like into
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:20.860]  the like bigger banquet and beyond kind of stuff yeah i think like sticky fingers might have been
[03:05:20.860 --> 03:05:26.780]  the last the last she had but uh i was a hey jude kid growing up which is the paulest of paul songs
[03:05:26.780 --> 03:05:32.860]  and i know it's super obvious and also again it's beside the point but how amazing i was i was like
[03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:39.180]  35 years old until i realized that hey jude and revolution were not on albums that was just they
[03:05:39.180 --> 03:05:43.020]  just put a single out where on the one side george martin talks about this they were really
[03:05:43.020 --> 03:05:47.020]  unconventional usually you have a single as a way to promote an album right they would willfully
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:51.740]  deliberately have the single be something that's so imagine having enough shit where you could just
[03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:57.420]  do that we could just say oh here's lady madonna what like this isn't on an album oh my god hey
[03:05:57.420 --> 03:06:02.940]  jude and revolution and they just put about a single right oh let's do revolution again and have
[03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:06.780]  it be completely different but again it but it but it was super awesome but hey jude and revolution
[03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:11.980]  as a single is both amazing in terms of the quality of the songs per oh you mean like a double
[03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:17.180]  eight like a like a hound dog um and uh the other one but yeah yeah i know what you're right but
[03:06:17.180 --> 03:06:24.780]  also hey jude is super super paulie and revolution is super super johnny right it it is there's paul
[03:06:24.780 --> 03:06:29.740]  on one side john on the other the thing about two of us that always gets me is that to me i
[03:06:29.740 --> 03:06:36.060]  i can't tell if it's a paul song or john song i it is and that's just there's a this does not even
[03:06:36.060 --> 03:06:42.380]  work as a rule of thumb but i have read numerous books about the known and purported song writing
[03:06:42.380 --> 03:06:48.300]  of of beetle songs and one of the things i always loved is the tension it's like paul to me writes
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:53.020]  some of the best bridges in rock and roll but john also like but you get the classic example
[03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:57.660]  example maybe and one of my favorite beetle songs is we can work it out try to see it my way uh
[03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:01.980]  just keep on talking until i can't go on and then john says yeah but life is very short and there's
[03:07:01.980 --> 03:07:07.340]  no time for fussing and fighting my friend the way that they could both yeah that's like bring
[03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:13.580]  a different feeling to the song that like makes it richer for both of their contributions i i
[03:07:13.580 --> 03:07:18.060]  this is like the cornea it sounds like a cop-out and a way you know to bring an end to this this
[03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:24.700]  long rambling long unwinding road but it sounds like a cop-out to say that my very very favorite
[03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:30.860]  handful of beetle songs are the ones where they clearly collaborated the most right oh like like
[03:07:30.860 --> 03:07:35.740]  a ticket to ride or paperback writer i don't know and you know maybe paul wrote all of two of us i
[03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:39.980]  don't know but it seemed to me from even watching a movie that that was and and again that was one
[03:07:39.980 --> 03:07:47.100]  that had been in in the can steven berlin johnson wrote about this recently about the the the get
[03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:52.460]  back documentary that and he spent his whole career or a lot of it writing about the creative
[03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:56.380]  process and that one of the most fascinating things about this is how some of these songs
[03:07:56.380 --> 03:08:02.060]  took them years to write you know that they they pulled songs from like a decade before and just
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:06.620]  never were capable of finishing them at the time but then they dusted off and all of a sudden
[03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:11.820]  you're a different person and you suddenly you don't you know how to bridge that part to this
[03:08:11.820 --> 03:08:16.860]  part and it comes to your mind i don't know two of us would be the one for me and it and that's a good
[03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:23.740]  one uh anyway it's a it's a hard question to put somebody on the spot for you know anyway
[03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:26.540]  i feel like we've gone on i think the beetles are good
[03:08:29.820 --> 03:08:36.380]  i'll tell you i will tell you who else is good who else is good is uh
