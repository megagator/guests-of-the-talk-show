[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  All right, I'm just gonna say this, right? I want I want
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.160]  everybody listening to know you do not have to hit pause, you
[00:04.160 --> 00:05.080]  don't have to skip.
[00:06.480 --> 00:08.600]  Gonna talk a little bit about the last Jedi right here, but it
[00:08.600 --> 00:11.920]  will be the most spoiler free discussion you could possibly
[00:11.920 --> 00:14.520]  imagine. I totally understand that the movie just came out.
[00:14.840 --> 00:17.640]  And that many or most of you listening to this probably
[00:17.640 --> 00:18.400]  haven't seen it yet.
[00:19.560 --> 00:22.080]  But I do want to talk about it briefly in the most completely
[00:22.080 --> 00:23.520]  spoiler free way possible.
[00:24.960 --> 00:27.400]  But you don't have to skip I promise you, you have my word.
[00:27.400 --> 00:31.880]  Matthew, you had a very exciting story of seeing the movie,
[00:31.880 --> 00:32.200]  right?
[00:34.600 --> 00:41.880]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I ended up seeing the movie on the Disney
[00:41.880 --> 00:47.600]  Studios lot on Monday, because they had a couple of press
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.200]  showings. I didn't go to the premiere, which was on, I think
[00:52.200 --> 00:55.160]  Friday or something, the red carpet. But I did get to see it
[00:55.160 --> 00:57.560]  on the lot, which was fun. I mean, there are theaters
[00:57.560 --> 01:02.200]  obviously top notch, you know, salmon and visual quality, all
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.080]  of that stuff. But getting getting to see it on the lot was
[01:06.120 --> 01:06.960]  was a lot of fun.
[01:07.080 --> 01:09.920]  That's pretty cool story. I saw it last night. And the first
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.480]  showing a regular centerplex here.
[01:14.320 --> 01:16.520]  liked it a lot. Yeah, I saw it last night for the second time.
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.320]  I went into it. And this is why I am sensitive to the spoilers.
[01:21.320 --> 01:25.920]  I went into it knowing less about this movie than any Star
[01:25.920 --> 01:29.320]  Wars movie I'd ever seen in my life. And I've always tried to
[01:29.320 --> 01:32.200]  remain spoiler free. But for some reason, my media blackout
[01:32.200 --> 01:36.880]  strategy was more successful this time than any previous
[01:36.880 --> 01:43.560]  movie. I I had seen the poster. But I did not look because it
[01:43.560 --> 01:46.840]  was it's like unavoidable to not see the poster. But I never
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.640]  looked closely at the poster. Didn't see a single
[01:50.640 --> 01:52.200]  you just looked at the corner of your eye.
[01:52.240 --> 01:53.040]  Yeah.
[01:55.040 --> 01:58.120]  But I won't even describe any aspects of the poster. This is
[01:58.120 --> 02:01.160]  how sensitive to spoilers I am. And anybody who has the media
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.600]  blackout strategy that I do for this, that I won't even describe
[02:04.600 --> 02:07.600]  any any visual elements of the poster just in case somebody
[02:07.600 --> 02:10.440]  more successful than me has not even seen the poster. That's how
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.400]  sensitive to the spoilers I am. And then and then the last the
[02:15.400 --> 02:19.760]  biggest break the biggest crack in the dam of my media strike
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.880]  blackout strategy was I was in New York Tuesday night for the
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.280]  Wednesday morning briefing for the iMac Pro that we're we're
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.120]  about to talk about. And I had dinner with a dear friend of the
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.680]  show Renee Ritchie. And coincidentally, while we're at
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.640]  dinner, you texted me Hey, are you down a little slightly too
[02:40.640 --> 02:43.960]  late to throw you into the mix for dinner. But I got a cab to
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.040]  go back to my hotel after dinner and the stupid little TV in the
[02:48.040 --> 02:54.040]  back of the backseat of the cab starts. It's the way it like
[02:54.040 --> 02:56.560]  your cap. It doesn't kick in until you're like 30 seconds
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.120]  into the cab ride. And it cuts into a commercial for the last
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.560]  Jedi. And I had to look at it so that I could figure out where to
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.920]  jab my finger to shut it off. And I saw you button there the
[03:07.920 --> 03:15.800]  off. Yeah, I saw one shot from the movie. That I again, I won't
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.160]  describe it at all. But I saw a shot from the movie that I would
[03:19.160 --> 03:24.640]  consider a very, very, very mild spoiler. But still was more of a
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.360]  spoiler than I'd gotten. And I can't believe that it gets you
[03:27.360 --> 03:33.520]  thinking then that your brain's like, what does that mean? It
[03:33.520 --> 03:36.680]  was a shot. It was like a two shots. It was like a two shots
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.680]  of a scene that put two characters in a certain
[03:38.680 --> 03:41.640]  situation. And it made me think, how did they get in that
[03:41.640 --> 03:48.880]  situation? And the most amazing part about the success of my
[03:48.880 --> 03:55.840]  blackout strategy was that we were even at Disney World for a
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.080]  day. Over Thanksgiving, we were down in Florida and and spent a
[04:00.080 --> 04:02.160]  day at the Magic Kingdom. And I thought, Oh, this is gonna be
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.080]  this is this is where it all breaks down. So Disney's gonna
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.400]  put something up here that, you know, breaks it. But I didn't I
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.800]  didn't see anything. I didn't see any toys. I didn't see I
[04:11.800 --> 04:14.840]  didn't see anything that ruined it. So I was super successful.
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.240]  Anyway, anybody, nice. Last thing I want to say about it, I
[04:19.240 --> 04:26.640]  thought it was good. I think I enjoyed it more than the Force
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.720]  Awakens, which I also enjoyed. But I do want I do want
[04:31.720 --> 04:34.120]  everybody who's a Star Wars fan who listens to the show, you
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.720]  gotta go see it soon. You cannot wait. Because I do want to have
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.800]  a Star Wars spectacular episode of the talk show. Probably, you
[04:42.800 --> 04:45.920]  know, tradition would would put it around New Year's. So before
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.920]  the end of the year, you got to see this movie or else you're
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.760]  gonna have to skip the Star Wars spectacular episode of the show.
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.160]  Yeah, I mean, I've got I've got so many things to say about it.
[04:55.160 --> 04:58.720]  I mean, I've been talking, I have a private chat group that
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.040]  I've been talking with about this. And we've been going back
[05:02.040 --> 05:05.760]  and forth with about it since since everybody saw it. We sort
[05:05.760 --> 05:10.480]  of like created a branch of our normal chat group to talk about
[05:10.480 --> 05:13.240]  Star Wars so that people who didn't who hadn't seen it didn't
[05:13.240 --> 05:16.760]  have to, you know, get spoiled. And that the branch has been
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.080]  going nuts. We've been like kind of going back and forth, because
[05:19.080 --> 05:23.120]  I guess, you know, we should just like, stop it there. But I
[05:23.120 --> 05:25.760]  just did that all over Twitter this morning. People are like
[05:25.760 --> 05:28.080]  reacting to the movie, obviously. But there's a sort of
[05:28.080 --> 05:31.520]  meta reaction to the reactions, because I guess, you know, like
[05:31.520 --> 05:34.520]  it's rated very well by the critics, but the audiences
[05:34.520 --> 05:38.160]  aren't liking it so much, you know, like the rating wise. But
[05:38.160 --> 05:40.600]  I think that's that's about as far as we need to go with that.
[05:40.600 --> 05:43.680]  But I found it interesting, you know, that the audiences were
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.600]  like, you know, had some feelings about it that weren't
[05:46.600 --> 05:50.440]  as positive as the critics did. But I think that that, in my
[05:50.440 --> 05:54.360]  opinion, obviously, it's it's a it's a good movie and definitely
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.360]  worth seeing. That's as far as I'll go with it. Yeah.
[05:56.600 --> 06:01.360]  And then, you know, I'll just mention it. But the remarkable
[06:01.360 --> 06:05.680]  tie in to this podcast is that the writer and director of the
[06:05.680 --> 06:09.840]  movie is Rian Johnson, who was on my show to talk about his
[06:09.840 --> 06:14.320]  previous movie looper three or four years ago, with coordinated
[06:14.320 --> 06:18.320]  with friend of the show, Adam, lonely sandwich, Lisa Gore,
[06:19.520 --> 06:23.080]  which was amazing. And it's funny, and I know I get emails
[06:23.080 --> 06:26.040]  about this. And I have to fix it, I will fix it. I have those
[06:26.040 --> 06:29.320]  episodes. That episode was in the era when I was on the mule
[06:29.320 --> 06:34.440]  network. And the idiots at mule, they're good friends. But I
[06:34.440 --> 06:36.920]  think it was I think it's stupid to let the website lapse, but
[06:36.920 --> 06:40.200]  their website went away. So right now, like the canonical
[06:40.200 --> 06:45.040]  archive for that show is like a 404. And I have the files, I
[06:45.040 --> 06:48.480]  just need to integrate it back into the thing I hosted during
[06:48.480 --> 06:50.480]  fireball right now. But anybody who does want to listen to it,
[06:50.480 --> 06:54.720]  you actually can if you just go to the internet archive and look
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.680]  up the old talk show on the mule mule radio. I'll put a link in
[06:58.680 --> 07:02.200]  the file still. Yeah, out there. Yeah, I'll put a link in the
[07:02.560 --> 07:07.360]  show notes, I swear with a link to that episode in the internet
[07:07.360 --> 07:10.280]  archive, so you can listen to it, which was, it's just an
[07:10.280 --> 07:13.520]  amazing thrill to me that I've actually met because we actually
[07:13.520 --> 07:16.800]  recorded that episode in sandwich videos office in LA. So
[07:16.800 --> 07:19.280]  it was actually face to face, you know, which I think makes
[07:19.280 --> 07:23.200]  for a better episode. But anyway, it's still thrilling to
[07:23.200 --> 07:26.880]  me that I actually did an episode of the show with the
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.600]  writer and director of the movie. Pretty cool. He's doing a
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.680]  cool thing on Twitter to Ryan Johnson, where his you know,
[07:33.680 --> 07:38.160]  it's obviously the biggest movie he's ever directed. And it's the
[07:38.160 --> 07:41.200]  opening weekend. And he's using his Twitter account to like,
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.040]  link to a couple of other movies that are opening this weekend
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.800]  and telling people to go see him. So it's just a really cool
[07:48.800 --> 07:52.160]  thing. Again, I can't say that he's my friend. He's a guy who I
[07:52.160 --> 07:55.960]  met for three hours in LA one afternoon. But everything I know
[07:55.960 --> 07:58.360]  from reading interviews with him, and from the time I did
[07:58.360 --> 08:01.960]  spend with him, he honest and Adam, Lisa Gordon knows him, you
[08:01.960 --> 08:07.880]  know, better than I do. He really is, by all accounts, a
[08:07.880 --> 08:10.280]  genuine, you know, the type of person who would just do that,
[08:10.280 --> 08:13.960]  like want to, you know, help somebody whose movie might get
[08:13.960 --> 08:18.280]  lost in last Jedi hoopla weekend, which is pretty cool.
[08:22.480 --> 08:25.400]  So anyway, I was in New York, you were in New York, there was
[08:25.400 --> 08:28.680]  a briefing. How many people how many people in the press were
[08:28.680 --> 08:29.560]  there? But it doesn't.
[08:31.640 --> 08:33.720]  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to tell because there's several groups
[08:33.720 --> 08:35.880]  that went through but seemed to be about that.
[08:35.880 --> 08:43.560]  Yeah, maybe it doesn't maybe 20 members of the press. And it was
[08:43.560 --> 08:45.560]  pretty I thought it was well done. I thought it was a really
[08:45.560 --> 08:49.880]  good rollout. And I also liked the way that like, this was
[08:49.880 --> 08:55.240]  Wednesday of this week. And then on Tuesday, the day before, was
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.160]  it Tuesday? Was it Monday when a bunch of reviews came out? I
[08:59.160 --> 09:02.920]  forget, but it was a day or two before she Yeah, Monday, I
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.280]  think. Okay, so then Monday, a bunch of reviews of the new Mac
[09:08.280 --> 09:13.160]  Pro came out. And I thought it was a really interesting
[09:13.160 --> 09:16.040]  selection of people who got seated, they all got it for
[09:16.040 --> 09:22.680]  about a week. Among them, Craig Hunter, who I linked to it during
[09:22.680 --> 09:27.000]  Fireball, he's a aerospace engineer and iOS developer. So
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.240]  that ticks sort of kills two birds with one stone, like where
[09:31.240 --> 09:34.440]  he can test it from two different perspectives. Right.
[09:35.080 --> 09:40.680]  Marquez Brownlee, better known as MKBHD. Very well known, very
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.920]  successful YouTube. I guess YouTuber. And who has been
[09:46.920 --> 09:52.680]  clamoring for better high end, professional Mac hardware,
[09:52.680 --> 09:56.680]  because he shoots his videos with an 8k red camera and edit
[09:56.680 --> 10:02.760]  has been editing on a 2013 Pro, which at the time was such a,
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.120]  you know, gorgeous, wow, this is an impressive machine. And it
[10:06.680 --> 10:11.320]  in 20 late 2017 is 2017 comes to a close, it makes you laugh,
[10:11.880 --> 10:15.720]  thinking about editing 8k video in it on it. Right. Who else
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.800]  got it? Oh, cable Sasser from panic was given one. I'm trying
[10:21.800 --> 10:24.360]  to think who else but some developers, some video people.
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.280]  I forget, but it was, you know, and I thought it was a really
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.000]  good rollout. And I thought an interesting contrast, in my
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.040]  opinion, to the iPhone 10 rollout where the that initial
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.000]  batch of here's the first people who've gotten to see
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.640]  iPhone 10 were like these fashion YouTube type people.
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.680]  Yeah, it was it was like a obviously a an iteration on that
[10:52.680 --> 10:55.400]  thing that they did with the iPhone 10 of saying, Hey,
[10:55.400 --> 10:59.560]  here's some people with internet audiences who may not read
[10:59.560 --> 11:03.640]  mainstream publications or even tech industry publications or
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.960]  whatever, that we want to sort of, you know, get an early
[11:07.960 --> 11:10.680]  give an early look at so that they can talk to those people in
[11:10.680 --> 11:13.960]  their own voice. And the people that watch them like TV or
[11:13.960 --> 11:19.480]  whatever, instead of regular TV, will get that you will get
[11:19.480 --> 11:23.560]  that get that look. So it was less I think about, and it may
[11:23.560 --> 11:30.680]  have been somewhat about seeding the early buzz with relatively
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.560]  lightweight, positive hands ons, you know, because they weren't
[11:33.560 --> 11:35.880]  reviews, right? They were like, Hey, look at this thing, right.
[11:35.880 --> 11:38.760]  And then there was a couple of them that actually got to like,
[11:38.760 --> 11:41.800]  use the phone and live with it for a few days. And but not in
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.760]  that first batch, though, very much impressions. But in that
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.040]  first batch, that it was really and it wasn't even clear, like,
[11:48.040 --> 11:50.680]  part of it. It wasn't even clear to me, and I pay close
[11:50.680 --> 11:53.720]  attention to it. But in that first batch, they were at they
[11:53.720 --> 11:56.680]  were in New York in the same building where Apple has been
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.280]  holding all these briefings recently. Sort of like I don't
[12:00.280 --> 12:03.080]  know how you would describe it. It's like a big, I want to say
[12:03.080 --> 12:05.960]  townhouse, but it's so much bigger and wider than a typical
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.280]  townhouse. It's, you know, just a big penthouse three, three
[12:10.280 --> 12:12.920]  stories. Yeah, I mean, I could be wrong. But I think that there
[12:12.920 --> 12:15.640]  were some people outside of that group, though, there was I know
[12:15.640 --> 12:18.280]  what you mean, there was a set of people that they got together,
[12:18.600 --> 12:21.800]  and they brought into that room. And you could tell because you
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.720]  look at the YouTube videos, and they're all the same, right?
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.880]  They're all the same surroundings and everything. And
[12:25.880 --> 12:28.520]  they brought in them in there and had them play with it. And
[12:28.520 --> 12:31.160]  then they cut together what they we would call in the business,
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.640]  like a social cut, right? Like a cut a video that that is primed
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.880]  for social or for YouTube or whatever the case may be. And
[12:39.880 --> 12:42.120]  some of them cut them differently than others, right?
[12:42.120 --> 12:44.040]  There are some some folks who actually I thought did good
[12:44.040 --> 12:46.360]  commentary, like they were sitting there talking to the
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.560]  camera giving commentary, and then they would cut to them like
[12:49.560 --> 12:52.680]  handling the phone in that room, you know, but you could tell
[12:52.840 --> 12:55.160]  that they didn't have it, right? They weren't like, Hey, you
[12:55.160 --> 12:58.520]  know, I've had this and blah, blah, blah. But I think there
[12:58.520 --> 13:01.960]  was some other influencers. And I can't remember off the top of
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.120]  my head right now. But it's that had it, you know, that
[13:06.120 --> 13:09.960]  actually they gave it to but maybe I'm wrong. But I for the
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.920]  by and large, the first batch of stuff that we got was that it
[13:14.920 --> 13:17.640]  was those people that they brought into this room to like
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.240]  handle it for an hour or two. And then they went and cut
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.920]  together a video from it. Yeah. Right. And you know, I had some
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.600]  I had some public snark about that strategy for the iPhone 10.
[13:30.840 --> 13:35.320]  And then a couple of people like when MKB HD video dropped this
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.960]  week for for the iMac Pro, I got a couple of tweets like, ah,
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.680]  youtubers again, how come you know, and I was like, No, no, no,
[13:42.680 --> 13:46.920]  you guys are nuts. MKB HD might have been if they had Apple had
[13:46.920 --> 13:50.040]  asked me like name one person who should get the iMac Pro a
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.840]  week in advance for like the first review, he might have been
[13:52.840 --> 13:55.640]  on my shortlist of people who I would have suggested because
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.360]  what he would do would be exactly what needs to be done,
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.240]  which is truly stress test the the performance of it.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.160]  You know, and it's literally what he does all day, you know,
[14:07.160 --> 14:13.000]  so it's I really liked the the the philosophy of it's not
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.560]  necessarily like, hey, who's a good reviewer of hardware?
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.560]  Because that's fine. You know, that's definitely one way to
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.680]  look at it. But it's, hey, who would actually use this hardware
[14:22.680 --> 14:26.280]  in the pursuit of what they're doing, you know, of whatever
[14:26.280 --> 14:29.640]  profession that they're in. And, you know, in the case of
[14:29.640 --> 14:33.480]  youtuber shooting, you know, high res video, and needing to
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.760]  turn or turn it around quickly with, you know, a lot of visual
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.080]  tricks and cutting and all of that stuff. You know, it
[14:41.080 --> 14:43.320]  definitely fits the bill. And that's, that's why I think it's
[14:43.320 --> 14:46.520]  like a nice iteration of what the iPhone 10 stuff because,
[14:46.520 --> 14:49.320]  you know, iPhone 10, whether you like it or not, whatever, you
[14:49.320 --> 14:51.960]  know, whoever's viewing those videos is definitely different
[14:51.960 --> 14:54.840]  audience than than the typical audience you would get in either
[14:54.840 --> 14:58.920]  print or web publications. And that's fine. But I think that
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.360]  in this case, the the pre seed, you know, or whatever you want
[15:02.360 --> 15:05.480]  to call it, the people that were given the Mac Pros, iMac
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.960]  Pros, excuse me, early, were definitely people that that
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.280]  would use them in day to day, you know, scenarios. And it was
[15:14.280 --> 15:18.840]  a nice spread across from developers, software developers
[15:18.840 --> 15:21.880]  to, they had some people in there doing medical stuff, they
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.240]  had people doing they people doing audio professional work,
[15:27.240 --> 15:30.680]  right, right. Logic Pro, amazing experts, like high end
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.280]  producers and stuff of logic, that use Logic Pro. And they
[15:34.280 --> 15:36.600]  had people obviously doing video and that sort of thing. So
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.000]  it was a nice wide gamut of people. And they did not
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.760]  necessarily just see it to people just love Apple, right?
[15:44.760 --> 15:46.840]  Like, Oh, the you know, well, okay, well, they see it to these
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.160]  people, because they gush about Apple all the time, they seeded
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.240]  it to people who I felt expressed publicly many times,
[15:53.240 --> 15:57.480]  like, you know, frustration or, or, you know, criticism or
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.800]  whatever, not unwarranted and but also not, not necessarily
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.280]  reactionary, right? Or, or unresearched or whatever, they
[16:06.280 --> 16:08.680]  actually look, these people are critics because they care.
[16:09.560 --> 16:11.720]  We're going to give them this thing that we think will solve
[16:11.720 --> 16:15.240]  or or address some of those criticisms about Apple and pro
[16:15.240 --> 16:18.600]  users over the last x days or months or years. And we'll see
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.680]  what they think. So I thought that they did a good job of
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.400]  balancing that out. It wasn't just like, let's give Apple
[16:23.400 --> 16:25.880]  friends this thing. And so they could say it's great, you know?
[16:25.880 --> 16:28.840]  Yeah, that was good. I thought Craig hunters was a good example
[16:28.840 --> 16:31.000]  of that where he was saying like, here's, you know, he was
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.040]  running like aerospace simulation of like, here's a
[16:34.040 --> 16:38.280]  wing from a certain airplane. And let's run these tests to get
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.400]  the aerodynamic properties of this wing, which is, you know,
[16:41.400 --> 16:45.320]  even a layperson can understand Yeah, probably pretty CPU
[16:45.320 --> 16:48.920]  intensive. Right? Or GPU, I don't even know. But you know,
[16:48.920 --> 16:53.960]  one or the other, it's computationally difficult. And
[16:53.960 --> 16:56.600]  is like, here's a bunch of machines I've run the same test
[16:56.600 --> 16:59.880]  on over the last few years. And it, you know, included some
[16:59.880 --> 17:04.040]  Macs, like, like, I think, Mac Pro, maybe a MacBook Pro, but a
[17:04.040 --> 17:06.120]  lot of the other tests that he'd been running in recent years
[17:06.120 --> 17:10.360]  were on Linux servers. You know, which again, shows you that
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.480]  it's not just from a somebody who's only using Apple hardware
[17:13.480 --> 17:15.880]  and only coming from that, you know, whatever it is, it's going
[17:15.880 --> 17:20.360]  to be a Mac perspective. You know, somebody who's who's as
[17:21.320 --> 17:23.640]  just looking for the fastest compute possible, and therefore
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.000]  is, you know, more than happy to be, you know, just run it on a
[17:27.000 --> 17:27.640]  Linux server.
[17:31.240 --> 17:37.000]  Yeah, and there's, I think there is a supposition on the behalf
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.320]  and I tweeted about this a little bit yesterday, because I
[17:39.320 --> 17:44.920]  basically what I said was, you know, that my writing about it
[17:44.920 --> 17:48.440]  was that the iMac Pro is a love letter to developers. And I
[17:48.440 --> 17:51.640]  think people took that to mean that Apple had solved all the
[17:51.640 --> 17:54.360]  developers problems. And this is the perfect computer for all
[17:54.360 --> 17:57.400]  developers and that, you know, some sort of like, you know,
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.560]  he geography of their efforts to build this computer, right.
[18:01.560 --> 18:04.840]  And, you know, if, if you read the article, it's not that but
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.440]  it also the way that I was going with that is that not
[18:08.440 --> 18:11.960]  necessarily that I meant that this computer was the best
[18:11.960 --> 18:14.040]  computer for all developers, which is definitely how some
[18:14.040 --> 18:16.440]  developers took it and took exception to it, which is fine.
[18:17.320 --> 18:19.880]  You know, you gotta gotta be willing to take the heat if
[18:19.880 --> 18:22.920]  you're going to jump in the fire. But the way that I meant
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.760]  it, which felt came through if you actually read the piece, is
[18:27.800 --> 18:32.840]  that it was their effort to, to write that letter, and to send
[18:32.840 --> 18:35.720]  it. And now whether you're not you're in love, or whether or
[18:35.720 --> 18:39.080]  not you believe them, you know, or whether or not you it is
[18:39.080 --> 18:41.560]  right for you is a whole different matter. But I do
[18:41.560 --> 18:44.280]  believe it showed a distinct effort by them to address a
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.680]  market that wants an integrated machine in a machine with an
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.600]  incredibly, you know, great screen and, you know, high res
[18:52.600 --> 18:55.480]  and all that stuff, and a lot of power to do whatever they
[18:55.480 --> 18:59.400]  want, but doesn't necessarily need the modularity and buys a
[18:59.400 --> 19:02.680]  new computer every probably four to five years anyway. And
[19:02.680 --> 19:04.920]  you know, this thing should scale for that period of time.
[19:04.920 --> 19:09.800]  And I think that Apple sees that they see in a, in market
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.480]  terms, so what you would call a product that that goes under
[19:14.040 --> 19:17.080]  another product's umbrella, right? So they have the umbrella
[19:17.080 --> 19:21.800]  of, let's say, the Mac Pro, you have this like high end
[19:21.800 --> 19:24.520]  umbrella where people need modularity or whatever. And then
[19:24.520 --> 19:27.960]  down below that you have things like MacBooks and things like
[19:27.960 --> 19:30.200]  that, which people use professionally, but don't
[19:30.200 --> 19:33.640]  necessarily obviously have the graphics power specifically,
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.640]  for instance, of something like the Mac Pro. And they figured
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.240]  that there's this bolus of people that were taking IMAX and
[19:42.680 --> 19:45.800]  try and fit them into that gap. Yeah, you know, they were using
[19:45.800 --> 19:49.080]  IMAX in professional settings, and configuring them the best
[19:49.080 --> 19:51.960]  that they could to get them into that area. And they're like,
[19:51.960 --> 19:55.880]  Hey, we can just fill this in, right and capture that that
[19:55.880 --> 19:59.080]  portion of the market. So I think from a market perspective,
[19:59.080 --> 20:03.800]  that's the strategy. And that, that offering is to those
[20:03.800 --> 20:06.360]  people. And then I think that the people that take exception
[20:06.360 --> 20:09.800]  to that offering or find that it's lacking in some way, which
[20:09.800 --> 20:13.560]  is 100% valid, they are more than welcome to feel that way.
[20:13.560 --> 20:15.560]  And those feelings are valid. And I'm not trying to shoot
[20:15.560 --> 20:17.800]  anybody down that says this isn't the computer for them and
[20:17.800 --> 20:20.120]  be like, no, it's the computer for everybody, because it's not.
[20:20.600 --> 20:24.840]  But it definitely fits a market that they aren't seeing, but
[20:24.840 --> 20:27.400]  that Apple is seeing, you know, and I think that they're out
[20:27.400 --> 20:32.840]  there. And I ran a little poll, and my poll pointed out my poll,
[20:32.840 --> 20:36.920]  which is obviously biased and limited by my, you know,
[20:36.920 --> 20:39.400]  followers and blah, blah, blah, right. This is not, you know,
[20:39.400 --> 20:43.880]  scientific. But the poll, which you honestly did go out to a lot
[20:43.880 --> 20:46.760]  of people who follow me because I cover Apple. So you got that
[20:46.760 --> 20:51.160]  going for you in this case. It basically came out to a lot of
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.720]  people are going to buy this computer, and they're software
[20:53.720 --> 20:56.680]  developers, and they like it. And then there was a
[20:56.680 --> 21:01.160]  smaller, but very sizable chunk, like half or quarter, quarter of
[21:01.160 --> 21:04.200]  that, you know, in response that said, No, I'm gonna wait for
[21:04.200 --> 21:07.480]  the Mac Pro. And I think that's exactly what Apple sees. I
[21:07.480 --> 21:10.120]  honestly think that ratio is exactly what they see. They see
[21:10.120 --> 21:12.520]  a big chunk of people that will buy this computer, and they see
[21:12.520 --> 21:14.360]  a smaller chunk of people that are we're gonna wait for the
[21:14.360 --> 21:16.600]  Mac Pro. And that's why they're building it. Yeah. All right.
[21:16.600 --> 21:19.720]  That's a longer, longest thing. But no, that's what I think. And
[21:19.720 --> 21:22.760]  it's, it's some good points to take off from there. But in the
[21:22.760 --> 21:25.480]  meantime, let's just take our first break and thank our first
[21:25.480 --> 21:28.440]  break and thank our first sponsor. It's a our good friends
[21:28.440 --> 21:35.720]  at away. I love this company. I love their products. away bags
[21:35.720 --> 21:39.960]  and accessories make the perfect gift for the holidays. You still
[21:39.960 --> 21:44.520]  have time to get one. Listen to the show right now, go jump on
[21:44.520 --> 21:48.280]  their website. And you can definitely still get an away
[21:48.280 --> 21:52.200]  travel bag for someone in your family, or ask for it yourself.
[21:52.200 --> 21:54.520]  If somebody is looking to because to me, that's always the
[21:54.520 --> 21:57.720]  problem is people in the family will say, Hey, john, what do you
[21:57.720 --> 22:01.960]  want for Christmas? And it's, it's always hard for me, because
[22:01.960 --> 22:05.240]  I as soon as I think that I want something, I tend to just go and
[22:05.240 --> 22:08.280]  buy it for myself. So there's really little left in the world.
[22:08.280 --> 22:10.360]  But if you're in the market for a new suitcase, and somebody's
[22:10.360 --> 22:14.040]  looking to get you a gift, this is a great idea. And I'll tell
[22:14.040 --> 22:17.480]  you why I've said this before, too. I suffered for years. I
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.400]  mean, years until I got the suitcase from away and realize
[22:21.400 --> 22:24.040]  what an idiot I was that I'd been using the same carry on
[22:24.040 --> 22:28.600]  bag since like, God, I don't even know when I might have
[22:28.600 --> 22:31.400]  even been like in the late 1990s or something like that the
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.000]  wheels barely rolled, it was more like I drug it through
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.640]  airports. Most of the pockets were ripped, it was frayed, I
[22:39.640 --> 22:42.920]  looked like some kind of traveling hobo or something.
[22:43.960 --> 22:46.120]  Getting a new suitcase, boy, does it make going to the
[22:46.120 --> 22:50.040]  airport easier. So away bags and accessories make a perfect
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.080]  gift. They have a lifetime guarantee they have 100 day
[22:53.080 --> 22:56.840]  trial. And there's a perfect size and color for everyone on
[22:56.840 --> 22:59.960]  your list this holiday season or you can grab an away gift
[22:59.960 --> 23:03.320]  card if you can't make up your mind or you don't know you
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.560]  don't want to pick a color for somebody else or something like
[23:05.560 --> 23:08.120]  that because they really do have a wide variety of colors.
[23:08.120 --> 23:11.320]  away uses high quality materials. And they offer a
[23:11.320 --> 23:15.640]  much lower price for a comparable high quality brand
[23:15.640 --> 23:18.360]  because they cut out the middleman and they sell direct
[23:18.360 --> 23:21.560]  to you you just they make it they ship it right to you and
[23:21.560 --> 23:25.160]  there's no retail markup. They've got over 10 colors and
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.320]  five sizes the carry on the bigger carry on the medium the
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.320]  large and the kids carry on for smaller travelers. And they're
[23:33.320 --> 23:36.200]  exactly what you think. You know, the carry on and the
[23:36.200 --> 23:38.920]  bigger carry on the bigger carry on is like the maximum
[23:38.920 --> 23:42.600]  carry on you could possibly fit in an overhead on an airplane.
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.160]  But it would have you know, one of those carriers that doesn't
[23:45.160 --> 23:48.040]  fit on the overhead on like a medium sized airplane.
[23:48.040 --> 23:50.600]  Medium large exactly what you think they are all of their
[23:50.600 --> 23:53.960]  suitcases are made with premium German polycarbonate. That's
[23:53.960 --> 23:57.560]  very lightweight, never bends, never breaks. I've had mine, I
[23:57.560 --> 24:00.600]  think for two years, maybe a little longer, something like
[24:00.600 --> 24:04.040]  that still looks brand new. I thought I had a scuff on it the
[24:04.040 --> 24:07.080]  last time I looked at it and I just like rubbed it with my
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.560]  thumb and it came right off. I don't know what it was. Really,
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.960]  really great. The interior features a patent pending
[24:11.960 --> 24:15.160]  compression system helpful for over packers. They've got just
[24:15.160 --> 24:17.080]  the right number of compartments inside you know,
[24:17.080 --> 24:19.640]  compartments inside you don't have to like read instructions
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.880]  to figure out what's what but there's like an area for your
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.240]  shirts and then you put a thing on top of it, hold it shut and
[24:25.240 --> 24:27.240]  then your shirts won't get wrinkled. Nothing else will
[24:27.240 --> 24:30.840]  touch them. They have a little bag in there that you can put
[24:30.840 --> 24:33.160]  your dirty clothes in to keep them separate from the clean
[24:33.160 --> 24:38.440]  clothes for 360 degree spinner wheels, a TSA approved
[24:38.440 --> 24:44.040]  combination lock. And, and here's the kicker, the carry on
[24:44.040 --> 24:50.040]  and the larger carry ons have a built in charger with two USB
[24:50.040 --> 24:52.680]  ports. So you're at any seat at the airport while you're waiting
[24:52.680 --> 24:55.560]  for your flight, you've got a charger right there available to
[24:55.560 --> 24:58.280]  you with your suitcase right by you so you don't have to hunt
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.040]  around the airport for like the two seats that have like a USB
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.200]  socket or a wall socket nearby. Cannot tell you how convenient
[25:06.200 --> 25:10.920]  that is really, really great. I just love that feature. And
[25:10.920 --> 25:13.320]  again, there's 100 day free trial, and they have free
[25:13.320 --> 25:17.640]  shipping on any away order within the contiguous 48 US 48
[25:17.640 --> 25:23.480]  states. So there you go. It's a great product. I really love it.
[25:23.480 --> 25:27.560]  You can get $20 off a suitcase if you visit away travel.com
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.560]  slash talk show and use that promo talk show during checkout.
[25:31.560 --> 25:34.920]  So not only is it a great product, not only right now
[25:34.920 --> 25:37.400]  today is it literally still in time for the holidays, but
[25:37.400 --> 25:40.440]  you'll save 20 bucks if you use that promo code talk show and go
[25:40.440 --> 25:49.720]  to away travel.com slash talk show. My thanks to away. I
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.200]  really like that product. Anyway. I'm Mac Pro love letter
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.520]  to developers. And then the developers who pipe up and say
[25:58.520 --> 26:03.560]  well, it's not for me. Yeah, I feel like I'm not in love.
[26:03.560 --> 26:10.120]  Right. Okay. I feel like it's an interesting contrast to
[26:10.120 --> 26:16.280]  Apple's current laptop market, which is there is no way to make
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.120]  one computer that makes everybody happy. Because if
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.000]  somebody would somebody really wants and I don't know what
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.680]  specific complaints you heard from people who don't want a
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.520]  pro machine from hardware, aren't complaining about the
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.040]  price per se realized that that the pricing of the iMac Pro is
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.800]  in line with what it's actually offering. But simply don't like
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.360]  it. The thing I've heard already is and it shouldn't be a
[26:42.360 --> 26:45.320]  surprise. I don't even think this was news this week. But I
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.120]  think now that it officially shipped, they're willing to
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.840]  bark about it is the lack of internal expandability. And you
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.960]  can't even upgrade the RAM. As a user, there's no little screw
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.880]  panel that you can unscrew and add more RAM or change the RAM.
[27:01.880 --> 27:04.920]  Although you can if you buy one that's not like maxed out on
[27:04.920 --> 27:09.960]  RAM, you can take it to like a service center or an Apple store
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.040]  and get it upgraded, you know, as like an official service
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.800]  thing with Apple. So it's not like you literally can't it's
[27:17.800 --> 27:20.760]  not like RAM is soldered onto the motherboard like it is on
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.720]  some laptops. But it's just not user accessible. That's the
[27:25.720 --> 27:30.200]  complaint I've heard about. But it's like that's, that's the
[27:30.200 --> 27:33.960]  iMac. You know what I mean? It's, it's, there's no way to
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.200]  have everything. And so the difference I see, it's like,
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.320]  it's like blaming a platypus for having a bill. You know, they
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.920]  have bills. And I realized that the new Mac Pro is not yet
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.160]  shipping, and they're not even suggesting when it might be. And
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.520]  as usual for Apple, even off the record, they had, you know, I
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.680]  asked and they had no comment. We're here to talk about iMac
[27:54.680 --> 27:58.360]  Pro today. I knew that that was gonna be the answer. You know,
[27:58.360 --> 28:00.920]  any hint, any hint? I don't want to quote you. I'm not gonna say
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.240]  just like a hint as to like maybe what quarter it's coming.
[28:05.960 --> 28:08.760]  And the answer was, we're here today to talk about the iMac.
[28:08.760 --> 28:10.040]  Rime with Flanuary.
[28:10.040 --> 28:16.600]  Right. So I have no inside juice on when the new Mac Pro might
[28:16.600 --> 28:20.680]  ship. No little birdies, no hint. It literally could be
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.560]  February, or it could be next December, or it they might even
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.280]  be worried that it won't ship in 2018. I honestly don't know. It
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.840]  could be imminent. It could be far off. I don't know. My guess,
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.680]  though, is that it is not imminent. My guess would be that
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.680]  the best case scenario, this is a pure guess, would be
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.320]  something parallel to last year, where they announced the iMac
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.760]  Pro at WWDC and shipped at the end of the year, where maybe by
[28:50.760 --> 28:55.480]  WWDC, they'll be willing to show it and say what it does, and
[28:55.480 --> 28:59.320]  give a later this year estimate. But I don't think it's coming
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.160]  anytime soon, and I definitely don't think it's shipping in the
[29:03.160 --> 29:06.120]  first half of the year, because I don't think they would have
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.520]  rolled out the iMac Pros the way they did if it were. But that's
[29:10.520 --> 29:13.080]  just, I could be totally wrong on that, and I'd be happy to be
[29:13.080 --> 29:16.840]  wrong. Yeah, I don't know anything further either,
[29:16.840 --> 29:20.040]  obviously, and I don't, I can't really disagree with you. I
[29:20.040 --> 29:24.120]  think that sounds reasonable. I don't get the feeling that it is
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.640]  like right around the corner or anything like that either. I
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.960]  think they're giving this thing some breathing room in terms of
[29:31.960 --> 29:35.000]  announcing it and letting it fly and all that. They obviously
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.120]  wanted it out. They promised it out this year. They wanted it
[29:38.120 --> 29:41.800]  out this year, and they got it out this year, the iMac Pro. But
[29:41.800 --> 29:46.200]  as far as how much that matters for their holiday
[29:46.200 --> 29:48.360]  quarter or any of that, I really don't think that they're
[29:48.360 --> 29:51.480]  counting on it, mattering a ton. No, I don't think so. They just
[29:51.480 --> 29:54.520]  wanted to get it out, and so it's out. And that's why we have
[29:54.520 --> 29:57.880]  this late December kind of, hey, it's out, you know, and
[29:57.880 --> 30:01.800]  here's the sweet spot, you know, 10 core. You can get that now.
[30:01.800 --> 30:05.640]  Yeah, most people, that's great. And then for science or,
[30:05.640 --> 30:09.480]  you know, ML or other specialists, the higher core
[30:09.480 --> 30:12.440]  options will be shipping in January. Yeah, and so I think
[30:12.440 --> 30:15.800]  the interesting contrast with their laptop line now is that
[30:15.800 --> 30:20.360]  even not knowing the specifics of the new Mac Pro or knowing
[30:20.360 --> 30:23.080]  other than that they're working on it and that they took that
[30:23.080 --> 30:26.600]  truly unusual step of talking to us about it last April and
[30:26.600 --> 30:30.840]  saying, you know, you know, talking about having gotten
[30:30.840 --> 30:34.280]  backed into a thermal corner with the trashcan Mac Pro
[30:34.280 --> 30:37.080]  design and saying, look, we're hitting a reset button, but
[30:37.080 --> 30:39.160]  we're committed to the Pro market. We're coming out with a
[30:39.160 --> 30:43.080]  new Pro machine. We're coming out with a new Pro standalone
[30:43.080 --> 30:46.920]  display for this Pro machine. But we, you know, it's in the
[30:46.920 --> 30:51.640]  future, and we also have, you know, a Pro config iMac also in
[30:51.640 --> 30:53.880]  the works that will come out sooner. But I think it's
[30:53.880 --> 30:56.920]  interesting today. It's two different things. It's you've
[30:56.920 --> 31:01.640]  got the iMac Pro for the people who the pros who are perfectly
[31:01.640 --> 31:07.560]  fine with the sealed box, limited, you know, you know,
[31:08.520 --> 31:10.600]  you've got some options up front to buy. And then once you
[31:10.600 --> 31:13.720]  buy it, that's it. And pretty much whatever you do to, quote,
[31:13.720 --> 31:18.200]  expand it is going to be through Thunderbolt three, or USB.
[31:18.200 --> 31:21.000]  And on the other side, for the pros who really want
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.440]  configurability inside the box is this upcoming Mac Pro. And I
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.560]  think that's interesting to compare with the laptops, where
[31:29.560 --> 31:32.760]  the complaints can put the keyboard aside, which I think
[31:32.760 --> 31:36.520]  is, to me, the biggest complaint about the new Mac MacBook Pros.
[31:37.080 --> 31:41.160]  But the other complaints like, hey, I don't need a thinner
[31:41.160 --> 31:44.600]  machine, I'll take a thicker machine and keep a bunch of USB
[31:44.600 --> 31:51.000]  ports and keep the SD card slot, and etc, etc, that they've
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.200]  really only that they're pro laptops right now really only
[31:54.200 --> 31:58.280]  fit the side of the pro laptop market that doesn't want
[31:58.280 --> 32:01.080]  expandability that doesn't want a whole bunch of ports that
[32:01.080 --> 32:05.640]  doesn't would take a thicker case to have a bigger battery.
[32:08.120 --> 32:10.760]  Like there's room, like I feel like the problem with the
[32:10.760 --> 32:13.640]  MacBook Pro lineup is that I don't have a lot of room to
[32:13.640 --> 32:16.520]  worry about. But the problem with the MacBook Pro lineup is
[32:16.520 --> 32:18.920]  that I really feel like there should be two types of MacBook
[32:18.920 --> 32:22.280]  Pro, like the MacBook Pro that is this thin and sleek as
[32:22.280 --> 32:26.360]  possible. And the MacBook Pro that is physically bulkier,
[32:26.360 --> 32:29.880]  like, you know, not fat, but let's just say, sort of like
[32:29.880 --> 32:36.360]  the 2013 2014 era MacBook Pros, but still has a bunch of old
[32:36.360 --> 32:40.120]  school USB three ports, in addition to USB C ports, etc.
[32:40.120 --> 32:43.800]  Yeah, sort of the, you know, as powerful as you can get it and
[32:43.800 --> 32:47.560]  still be portable right version. Yes, exactly. Like the
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.720]  as close as you can get to a portable workstation.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.760]  So I feel like desktop users basically arguing for like an
[32:56.760 --> 33:00.920]  like an iMac Pro portable, right? Like, like, you know, the
[33:00.920 --> 33:06.040]  MacBook Pro should be like, hey, we have the MacBook Pro.
[33:06.040 --> 33:10.600]  And, you know, it'll get you where you need to go iMac style,
[33:10.600 --> 33:13.400]  where you can configure it pretty powerful. But then we
[33:13.400 --> 33:19.320]  have this other MacBook MacBook Pro Pro, that can make it really,
[33:19.320 --> 33:22.680]  you know, maximize your battery life. And you know, you can
[33:22.680 --> 33:26.520]  configure it with massive, massively powerful processors
[33:26.520 --> 33:29.960]  and all that. Yeah. But anyway, you know, iMac Pro is obviously
[33:29.960 --> 33:32.680]  what we want to talk about this week. But and I really do feel,
[33:32.680 --> 33:35.400]  if there's anything I want to convey to the listeners of the
[33:35.400 --> 33:39.080]  show, or the readers of my site is that if you're just trying to
[33:39.080 --> 33:43.000]  get your head wrapped around the basic story is do not be
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.280]  fooled by the external appearance of the machine. And
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.360]  think that it's an iMac with a darker, cooler looking
[33:54.360 --> 33:59.080]  anodization. And, you know, slightly speed bumped CPUs and
[33:59.080 --> 34:04.520]  components like inside, it is truly a completely different
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.200]  architecture. There's, there's, I there's, it's really a
[34:08.200 --> 34:11.160]  different computer. They I mean, an apple in the briefing really
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.840]  spoke about it as though it was a different line. You know, it's
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.120]  called iMac. But it's, it's really in their minds, a
[34:18.120 --> 34:20.440]  completely different line of computer from the iMac.
[34:20.440 --> 34:26.120]  Mm hmm. Yeah. And they, they said that the the kind of like,
[34:26.680 --> 34:29.880]  impression that you get was that they were designing this as an
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.000]  entirely new machine, and that they wanted to make it as
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.520]  powerful as possible. And the only constraint that they had, I
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.320]  guess, in some ways was like, hey, that display. We just came
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.080]  out with it. It's brand new. We love it. Everything. Everything's
[34:45.080 --> 34:48.040]  fine with that. We have no problem with it. We have no
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.680]  problem with it. So we're going to use the same casing and
[34:50.680 --> 34:54.200]  display. And then everything else from then on is like, okay,
[34:54.200 --> 34:58.120]  so how do we make this the absolute most powerful,
[34:58.120 --> 35:03.240]  ridiculous iMac ever, and then go from there. And honestly,
[35:04.280 --> 35:06.360]  just speaking from this perspective of somebody who
[35:06.360 --> 35:09.960]  keeps a PC for gaming and VR, and it sits right next to my
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.720]  Mac, like, you know, I have a 4k monitor hooked to my PC that
[35:13.720 --> 35:17.960]  sits on my desk, and a tower, a PC that sits on my desk, and
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.000]  PC tower under my desk, and then an iMac next to it for for
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.480]  most of my daily work, I can tell you that it has been years
[35:28.360 --> 35:33.320]  since the Mac competed on any real level with what I could
[35:33.320 --> 35:37.960]  buy off the shelf graphics wise, you know, on a PC. And
[35:37.960 --> 35:42.360]  now you can argue about price or specific capability or
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.600]  whatever. But right now, the iMac Pro is something that you
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.320]  could buy and comfortably expect to game at top level graphics
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.520]  settings and use for VR. And that's a massive like it's new.
[35:57.080 --> 35:59.240]  For in many years, it has not been the case.
[35:59.800 --> 36:07.160]  Yeah. And it really is a jump from all the way from absolutely
[36:07.160 --> 36:13.960]  can't even can't even use a Mac. It's not like you can limp
[36:13.960 --> 36:19.240]  along like you just you couldn't even do the like Oculus
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.200]  or HTC Vive VR with a Mac, any Mac, right?
[36:24.200 --> 36:27.080]  And I tried it I did. And I mean, I did it very, very early.
[36:27.080 --> 36:29.640]  And it was terrible, right? You couldn't really it was
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.680]  unusual to these machines being not just credible, but very,
[36:34.680 --> 36:37.240]  very good machines to drive these experiences. Well,
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.560]  specifically the HTC Vive. Right now, I don't think Oculus
[36:41.560 --> 36:44.760]  works with it. It's not just that all the demos that we saw
[36:44.760 --> 36:49.480]  this week were on the HTC Vive. And I think it goes through
[36:49.480 --> 36:55.320]  they all go through the Steam Vive VR thingamajig that I
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.280]  don't really know much about. But yeah, yeah, they will the
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.960]  Mac, just to fill in the gap, the Mac got official Vive
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.560]  support via Steam as of WWDC. So and I think they shipped it I
[37:11.560 --> 37:13.240]  can't remember where they shipped it in beta or full
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.880]  version at WWDC. But basically, they were as of dub dub, you
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.040]  were able to launch Steam, get your update, plug in your Vive
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.600]  to your Mac and start using it for VR. That is, of course,
[37:26.600 --> 37:31.480]  theoretically, because the top tier, you know, VR applications
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.240]  really didn't run super well on most IMAX, you know, in the
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.480]  modern, if you bought an IMAX this year, you know, with the
[37:41.480 --> 37:48.760]  best capabilities stuff, but he was definitely not going to
[37:48.760 --> 37:52.520]  give you what we would consider a top tier VR experience. But
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.680]  obviously, they were planning because they knew this was
[37:54.680 --> 38:02.360]  coming out. So it really was. And I'll just say this, you
[38:02.360 --> 38:04.200]  know, and you're, you know, one of the reasons I really wanted
[38:04.200 --> 38:07.480]  to have you on the show this week was that you know more
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.880]  about VR than anybody I know. And so, you know, and I, I don't
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.920]  have to say I know the least, but I know little. And so I want
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.760]  to I want you there to double check my impressions of the VR
[38:20.760 --> 38:27.240]  stuff that I saw this week, you know, demoed. Another thing I
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.520]  didn't really mention it, I wish I had in my write up yesterday.
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.040]  But after all, most of the demos that we had, it was sort of
[38:34.040 --> 38:36.280]  like you'd walk around, you know, we were in smaller groups
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.160]  broken up. And it was like little demo stations throughout
[38:39.160 --> 38:43.080]  Apple's building. And we go see the demo from this company, you
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.280]  know, for 1520 minutes, and then, you know, times up, we'll
[38:46.280 --> 38:49.480]  go, you know, just round robin will rotate to the next group.
[38:49.480 --> 38:51.800]  And after most of them, especially the ones that I
[38:51.800 --> 38:54.680]  thought were the most technically impressive, I had
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.000]  walked behind the machine and like put my hand to see if I
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.720]  could, you know, hear the fan if I could feel it did it feel
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.720]  like the machine was red hot or anything like that. And in none
[39:03.720 --> 39:06.120]  of the cases, even the ones after you know, where we were
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.400]  like the third or fourth group to go through the demo on the
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.120]  same setup, it never felt hot, I never heard the fan. I'm not
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.680]  saying the fan wasn't blowing, I'm just saying that if if there
[39:16.680 --> 39:20.360]  was something going on to, you know, push heat out, it wasn't
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.040]  noisy. And it definitely wasn't hot. And in fact, today I even
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.440]  tried it. I know I've still got the 2014 the original 5k iMac
[39:28.440 --> 39:31.880]  is still my desktop machine here. I put my hand at where the
[39:31.880 --> 39:35.000]  fan is on my iMac. And it was hotter. And I'm not even doing
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.200]  anything. I mean, I've just got, you know, a bunch of Safari
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.120]  tabs open and mail and just running. And it is silent. My
[39:42.120 --> 39:47.640]  iMac can cook an egg on it, right? My iMac is silent. It's
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.360]  not making any noise. But it I put my hand back there. And it
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.320]  was warmer than the Mac, the iMac Pro in the demos on on
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.000]  Wednesday. So the thermal stuff that they're doing is
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.240]  incredible, given that it's it's got this high end
[40:01.240 --> 40:05.080]  performance. Yeah, I have the same Mac. Well, I mean, I don't
[40:05.080 --> 40:06.920]  know if it's the exact same configuration, but the late
[40:06.920 --> 40:13.160]  2014 retina 5k, and it's the i7. And that it definitely, you
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.320]  know, yeah, it gets hot, it gets warm. I mean, I can feel the
[40:15.320 --> 40:18.440]  heat coming off of it. Because it's kind of next to a wall. So
[40:18.440 --> 40:20.600]  it vectors out and I can feel the heat coming from behind us
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.080]  sometimes.
[40:21.800 --> 40:28.200]  Yeah. And I do think that this ties into I for anybody out
[40:28.200 --> 40:30.440]  there who's frustrated that this machine isn't more
[40:30.440 --> 40:33.880]  configurable isn't user configurable that you're Why am I
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.480]  going to spend $12,000 which you can easily do you can easily
[40:37.480 --> 40:41.400]  configure one of these things to run 1011 $12,000? Why am I
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.800]  going to spend $11,000 on on a workstation that I can't change
[40:45.800 --> 40:50.680]  the graphics card in or whatever. I think the way that
[40:50.680 --> 40:54.280]  they got this thermal performance where it stays quiet
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.560]  and cool is that by limiting it to these, you know, two graphics
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.280]  cards for CPU options, that they, you know, figured out
[41:04.280 --> 41:08.200]  exactly what the thermal aspects of these specific components
[41:08.200 --> 41:11.160]  are and designed a system just for them, you know, like I feel
[41:11.160 --> 41:15.560]  like the close nature of the of the system, the remarkably
[41:15.560 --> 41:18.680]  small size that it really just looks like a monitor with a
[41:18.680 --> 41:21.320]  bulge on the back. It's no bigger physically than a regular
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.960]  iMac. It goes hand in hand with the limited configurability.
[41:25.960 --> 41:33.160]  Yes, it's sort of like a custom built is is the wrong word, but
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.200]  sort of bespoke hardware in a way. Yeah, where it's like, hey,
[41:36.200 --> 41:39.400]  look, if you need to accomplish these tasks, here's the minimum
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.400]  amount of hardware, space, and the maximum amount of power we
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.680]  can give you to get this thing done. And it really, you know,
[41:46.680 --> 41:49.480]  now that it is visa mountable, because you can remove the foot
[41:49.480 --> 41:51.640]  now, which you didn't use to be able to do yesterday, had to
[41:51.640 --> 41:54.520]  order it from the factory that way. So, you know, it's not
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.240]  going to be able to do it from the factory that way. You know,
[41:57.240 --> 41:59.320]  people will be mounting these things everywhere. And they'll
[41:59.320 --> 42:02.840]  have like an incredibly powerful workstation in the size of a
[42:02.840 --> 42:06.520]  monitor. And I think that that is overlooked by a lot of people
[42:06.520 --> 42:09.960]  who want maximum modularity, which once again, I understand.
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.120]  But a lot of people don't want modularity. And I think that a
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.680]  certain audience of people underestimates how many
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.680]  professional users there are that don't give a crap about
[42:20.680 --> 42:23.880]  modularity and just want the maximum amount of power with the
[42:23.880 --> 42:29.080]  possible, like no cables besides power, right? No, no messing
[42:29.080 --> 42:31.320]  around with towers. And where do I mount this? And where do I
[42:31.320 --> 42:36.200]  mount that, and all of this. And the applications for that are
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.040]  very, very widespread. You know, one of the ones that we saw in
[42:40.040 --> 42:42.360]  the demos was medical application, for instance,
[42:42.360 --> 42:48.120]  right? These, these guys were doing, taking CT scan slices,
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.880]  and then turning them into a model in near real time,
[42:51.880 --> 42:55.160]  essentially. And then your surgeon can look at that 3d
[42:55.160 --> 42:58.120]  model and rotate it and say, look, look, here's a vascular
[42:58.120 --> 43:01.640]  system. And from this CT scan, which these things were
[43:01.640 --> 43:04.360]  possible, for sure. They've been possible for a long time. So
[43:04.360 --> 43:07.240]  it's not like, Oh, this is brand new. But the real time
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.640]  nature of it, how quick it is for them to dump a folder full
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.880]  of CT scans into this program, and then pop open a 3d model
[43:15.880 --> 43:18.920]  seconds later, and then rotate that model in real time in high
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.840]  res. You know, that kind of thing mounted to a wall in a
[43:22.840 --> 43:26.200]  briefing room or in an office where they can instantly show a
[43:26.200 --> 43:28.200]  patient what they're talking about to try and give them
[43:28.200 --> 43:31.480]  better understanding and alleviate some anxiety, or to
[43:31.480 --> 43:35.000]  give them better, better knowledge going into a surgery
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  that it at that point, those 1000s of dollars that people
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.800]  say, Oh, you got to spend x, y and z on this on this computer
[43:43.800 --> 43:46.760]  and blah, blah, blah. That's nothing. That's nothing. CT
[43:46.760 --> 43:50.360]  machines are in the 10s of millions of dollars. Well, you
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.360]  know, what do you think? And what do you think is an
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.240]  accessory, right? And we it was this company is called OSIRIX
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.520]  OSIRIX of the capital X. And they've been around they said
[44:02.520 --> 44:05.000]  they're a Swiss company, I believe. They've been around
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.240]  for 14 years, and they're Mac only, or really Apple only
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.880]  because they have an iOS app too. But they're, to me, they're
[44:11.880 --> 44:13.560]  all I've never heard of them before, because I'm not a
[44:13.560 --> 44:16.200]  medical professional. But to me, they're like the poster
[44:16.200 --> 44:19.720]  children for like the type of developers Apple loves to talk
[44:19.720 --> 44:24.280]  about where their app looks like a real Mac app. And it
[44:24.280 --> 44:28.920]  told it's all modernized for you know, the Sierra high Sierra
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.240]  look. And you know, if you've ever been if you've ever like
[44:33.240 --> 44:36.360]  me, I cannot help it. I look at the user interface of
[44:36.360 --> 44:39.880]  everything, right. And I think about the user interface of
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.480]  everything I ever see. And whenever I'm in like a doctor's
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.720]  office, or the dentist's office or whatever, and I look, it's
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.280]  usually always these janky Windows apps that are just
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.200]  horribly designed and look like they were probably were in fact
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.760]  designed for like Windows XP in 2001. And it just still running
[45:00.760 --> 45:04.440]  now. Like their app looks like a real Mac app like that, you
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.440]  know, like the type of thing that that like a consumer if it
[45:08.440 --> 45:10.680]  was you had a consumer, you know, that would be like a
[45:10.680 --> 45:13.080]  consumer app that would look great on the front page of the
[45:13.080 --> 45:16.600]  App Store. But they mentioned it. So they've been around for
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.840]  14 years, or they've been shipping for 14 years. So
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.840]  obviously, the thing that they do, you know, they were running
[45:22.840 --> 45:28.680]  14 years ago, obviously, on far less powerful hardware. But
[45:28.680 --> 45:31.400]  then the big difference between what they could do now on the
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.680]  iMac Pro and where they've been before is that it's gone from
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.360]  like a 2d experience where you're like, let's say somebody
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.720]  has a knee injury, and you're like a orthopedic surgeon, and
[45:41.720 --> 45:44.760]  you're looking at these CT scans, instead of like, going
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.400]  between a bunch of still images at different depths of the knee
[45:49.400 --> 45:53.400]  in three dimensions, it now can be like a 3d viewing experience
[45:53.400 --> 45:56.840]  where you're kind of, you know, moving the camera, the camera,
[45:56.840 --> 45:59.720]  for lack of a better word, through the knee in three
[45:59.720 --> 46:02.760]  dimensions. And they, you know, these, you could just see the
[46:02.760 --> 46:05.000]  enthusiasm of the developers. They were like, Yeah, we were
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.320]  blown away. We never really thought we never thought when
[46:07.320 --> 46:10.120]  we'd started this app over a decade ago that it would be a
[46:10.120 --> 46:13.720]  3d viewer for this stuff. And like I said, their initial
[46:13.720 --> 46:16.760]  version was literally just an image viewer. It's just like,
[46:16.760 --> 46:19.240]  hey, look, here's a JPEG that you can look at.
[46:20.840 --> 46:24.920]  Right. And it's exactly like you said that, you know, in terms
[46:24.920 --> 46:27.880]  of Well, you know, geez, that must be nice to run on it, you
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.200]  know, $10,000 iMac. But for the cost of the medical equipment
[46:32.200 --> 46:35.880]  that's in like a radiologist lab, the $10,000 iMac is
[46:35.880 --> 46:42.120]  nothing, right? Like, right. Yeah. And so like, just so just
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.280]  so people don't at me, I looked up the cost of a CT machine.
[46:46.280 --> 46:49.960]  Because I was like, wait a minute, because I remember them
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.320]  costing this much a while back, because I have my wife's in the
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.080]  medical field medical industry and has been for a long time, 15
[46:57.080 --> 47:00.600]  years. But so right now at 360 slice, which is sort of like
[47:00.600 --> 47:04.200]  high end CT scanner will cost you like two and a half to $3
[47:04.200 --> 47:07.400]  million. So let's call it through a $3 million rounded up.
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.960]  If an iMac Pro with this piece of software on it, which is like
[47:13.960 --> 47:18.600]  $700 a seat for the software, and then like $4,000 for the
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.280]  iMac Pro, like a bit of $5,000 for the base model, like 10 core
[47:22.280 --> 47:24.840]  or whatever it is, or, you know, something like that. Let's call
[47:24.840 --> 47:28.600]  it five to 7000. This is literally an upsell accessory
[47:28.600 --> 47:30.920]  that they throw in. You know what I mean? Right? Like they're
[47:30.920 --> 47:33.160]  like, Oh, yeah, and we'll get you a full 3d view of the
[47:33.160 --> 47:35.720]  software. And then we'll get you a full 3d view of it within
[47:35.720 --> 47:39.480]  seconds, with our proprietary software, or, you know, whatever
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.840]  white labeled software and and or the software package, and
[47:42.840 --> 47:46.280]  this iMac in mounted to the side of it, like with zip ties or
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.160]  whatever, you know what I mean? Like, that comes with, so to
[47:49.160 --> 47:51.640]  speak. And I think that people lose perspective on that,
[47:51.640 --> 47:54.680]  because a lot of the people that are very vocal about it, which
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.400]  I understand, are, you know, enthusiasts or independent
[47:59.400 --> 48:04.200]  investors, where the budget very much matters to them. And I
[48:04.200 --> 48:06.920]  get it. And you know, this may not be the machine for them,
[48:06.920 --> 48:09.240]  they may want to maximize something where they can make a
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.880]  large investment up front, and then smaller investments over
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.400]  time upgrading it, you know, as parts or modules can be
[48:15.400 --> 48:20.120]  upgraded, which is 100% valid complaint or not even complaint,
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.760]  but just statement to make like philosophy to have about your
[48:22.760 --> 48:28.040]  computing purchases. But in many cases, like this will, you know,
[48:28.040 --> 48:33.320]  iMac Pro will do some jobs for such a long time that they
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.440]  amortized out in is a incredibly negligible expense. And I think
[48:38.440 --> 48:40.520]  that there's a lot of people that this will do a lot of good
[48:40.520 --> 48:41.480]  work for over time.
[48:41.640 --> 48:44.440]  Yeah. And I thought it was also interesting. I mean, again, you
[48:44.440 --> 48:47.320]  know, in addition to showing off the iMac Pro, the developers
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.880]  who were invited were, you know, part of the quid pro quo of
[48:51.880 --> 48:54.760]  okay, well, you're going to give Apple your time to travel to New
[48:54.760 --> 48:57.480]  York and to spend the time to rehearse and put these things
[48:57.480 --> 49:00.520]  together as they can, you know, brag about and promote their
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.640]  products. And these guys mentioned that the in 2016, they
[49:05.640 --> 49:09.400]  had 35% growth there. And again, this is a 14 year old app. And
[49:09.400 --> 49:14.840]  that this year 2017, they're on pace for 45% growth. You know,
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.360]  which is to me super impressive for a 14 year old app that it
[49:18.360 --> 49:22.760]  still is obviously rapidly growing in the market. I mean,
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.320]  45% growth in a for a 14 year old app is incredible. But I
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.520]  think it shows that it's paid off for these guys to commit
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.680]  themselves to the Mac as a platform.
[49:35.400 --> 49:40.920]  Yep. And I think that there's a segment of people and I think
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.320]  that some of them are represented, of course, no, no
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.720]  surprise in these groups of people that were demoing, you
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.360]  know, that Apple had brought in and say, Hey, like, these people
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.840]  are building really cool Mac apps that will benefit from the
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.240]  Mac pros, iMac pros increased power, you know, very, very
[49:58.280 --> 50:01.320]  evidently, they will benefit very quickly. But then you'll
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.520]  have a long tier of people a long tail of people, where you
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.080]  have market segments that are have been served by PCs. And I
[50:10.080 --> 50:12.400]  think I don't think Apple's blind to the fact that if they
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.000]  were to introduce something like the iMac Pro, that it might in
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.080]  fact, take some of that market as well. In other words, they're
[50:20.080 --> 50:23.320]  not just eating the market of people who are buying high end
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.560]  iMacs. They are also going after certain segments of the market
[50:27.560 --> 50:31.080]  where they can fill gaps. Gravity sketch, which is one of
[50:31.080 --> 50:33.920]  the other apps that was demoed there. I had spoken to these
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.040]  folks previously that spoken to the co founder a while back, and
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.080]  he was there demoing the apps in demoing the app rather. And
[50:43.360 --> 50:47.960]  they, he comes from an automotive background. And that
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.280]  that background basically was in the design and modeling phase.
[50:53.280 --> 51:03.080]  of automotive in the the issue that they have with that is with
[51:03.080 --> 51:08.440]  the with that industry is that if they want to, by the way, I
[51:08.440 --> 51:11.800]  mean gravity sketch, if they want to appeal to these people
[51:12.200 --> 51:17.120]  with their virtual reality, 3d sketch and modeling application
[51:17.120 --> 51:19.360]  for the automotive industry and other industries that are
[51:19.360 --> 51:23.560]  looking to design straight into 3d. Their issue for a long time
[51:23.560 --> 51:26.920]  had been, hey, we've got these people, these designers who are
[51:26.920 --> 51:29.760]  working on Macs through the whole process, like designers
[51:29.760 --> 51:32.800]  love Macs, everybody knows this. So you've got an automotive guy
[51:32.800 --> 51:38.600]  who's working on Mac through his whole process, and then, you
[51:38.600 --> 51:45.640]  know, gets to this point in the process where they want to try
[51:45.640 --> 51:48.600]  this gravity sketch thing, which is in VR, and they have to switch
[51:48.600 --> 51:53.440]  to a PC, because this, you know, this program runs on PC. And it,
[51:53.640 --> 51:56.240]  you know, it needs the power of a high end graphics card and
[51:56.240 --> 52:00.840]  high end CPU to really get them flowing and, and sketching in
[52:00.840 --> 52:05.920]  3d and all of this, to eliminate a lot of cost in the clay
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.880]  modeling segment of a car development. So if you don't
[52:09.880 --> 52:11.560]  know anything about car development, essentially, they
[52:11.560 --> 52:14.440]  go through a bunch of design phases, including sketching. But
[52:14.440 --> 52:17.800]  in between each of those, they typically do a clay model. So
[52:17.800 --> 52:20.600]  they'll do like a sketch, and then a clay model, and then CAD
[52:20.600 --> 52:23.680]  and the clay model, and then aerodynamics, and then a clay
[52:23.680 --> 52:26.560]  model, and you know, so on and so forth. And so one car can have
[52:26.600 --> 52:29.760]  like dozen clay models made of it at one point or another. And
[52:29.760 --> 52:32.880]  those are expensive and time consuming. And so they're trying
[52:32.880 --> 52:35.760]  to like supplant a lot of that where you can kind of go into
[52:35.760 --> 52:40.000]  gravity sketch, really model it out as you would in a clay model,
[52:40.080 --> 52:42.360]  and then dump that into an environment where you can get
[52:42.360 --> 52:45.560]  precise like CAD or something like that. So they are very much
[52:45.560 --> 52:49.640]  a sketch application that takes the place of a lot of physical
[52:49.640 --> 52:52.680]  modeling that wouldn't normally take place in the process of
[52:52.920 --> 52:58.600]  creating a new vehicle. But in the case of, you know, selling
[52:58.600 --> 53:01.120]  into a company that you already use a bunch of backs, they would
[53:01.120 --> 53:04.080]  have to go like, Oh, and you have to get PCs, you know, to
[53:04.080 --> 53:06.640]  use here. So instead, I got this now,
[53:06.680 --> 53:10.880]  I thought their enthusiasm as look, we know that the people in
[53:10.880 --> 53:14.400]  our target audience are longtime Mac users, because they're
[53:14.400 --> 53:17.200]  creative professionals, and they love their Macs. And we like
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.520]  Macs, you know, that their enthusiasm for getting this
[53:20.520 --> 53:22.960]  running on the Mac to integrate, you know, for exactly the
[53:22.960 --> 53:26.600]  reasons you said I thought was palpable. And it's the sort of
[53:26.600 --> 53:28.960]  thing that you could say, well, of course, they were pro
[53:28.960 --> 53:31.320]  Macintosh, because they were at an Apple hosted briefing, but
[53:31.320 --> 53:34.920]  it really doesn't work like that, you know, like, it was, I
[53:34.920 --> 53:37.440]  thought it was legit. And it makes it makes sense for the
[53:37.440 --> 53:40.440]  reasons you said. Yeah, I got to play with gravity sketch
[53:40.440 --> 53:46.560]  Wednesday, you insisted that I try all the VR stuff. Yeah, I
[53:46.560 --> 53:49.640]  found I was like, so you know, wait, I want to know, because I
[53:49.640 --> 53:52.560]  at the time you said, Oh, I hadn't tried it much. So what
[53:52.560 --> 53:55.760]  experience had you had in VR before you put the headset on
[53:55.760 --> 53:59.080]  for the first time at that gravity sketch demo, I had I
[53:59.080 --> 54:01.840]  forgot about the one, which is actually the one I've probably
[54:01.840 --> 54:08.760]  spent the most time in. So a year or so ago, I got a backstage
[54:08.760 --> 54:16.600]  tour at MLB in New York, people who make that bad app. And
[54:17.240 --> 54:20.760]  actually, you know, like Disney's bought like, a majority
[54:20.760 --> 54:24.920]  stake or above all of their media thing. Yeah. But they're
[54:24.920 --> 54:28.600]  part of Yeah, MLB am which is advanced media that I don't know
[54:28.600 --> 54:31.280]  what they're called now. But yeah, they spun out their own
[54:31.280 --> 54:33.560]  company now, right? If some of the best iOS developers in the
[54:33.560 --> 54:37.400]  world in my opinion, they also have some of the best streaming
[54:37.400 --> 54:41.840]  video technology in the world. Because if you remember, if you
[54:41.840 --> 54:45.040]  go back a few years, when HBO first started trying to stream
[54:45.040 --> 54:48.640]  their stuff, it would fall apart every time a new episode of Game
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.160]  of Thrones came out. Right. And when they like hit the reset
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.400]  button, and redid it, what they really did was outsource it all
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.480]  to MLB media. And the fact that everybody can watch, you know,
[54:59.520 --> 55:03.000]  the fail whale isn't a thing for Game of Thrones streaming
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.640]  episodes anymore is all because it's on the MLB back end. But
[55:06.640 --> 55:09.400]  anyway, I was there took a tour. And one of their developers was
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.320]  working on a VR thing. I think it was like simulated view in a
[55:14.320 --> 55:19.200]  ballpark type thing. So I tried that for like five minutes. I
[55:19.200 --> 55:21.480]  forget what hardware it was, but it wasn't great. I think it was
[55:21.480 --> 55:24.720]  like a first gen Oculus or something like a developer kit.
[55:25.760 --> 55:29.920]  But I bought the thing when I bought the pixel one over a year
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.560]  ago, I bought the headset that Google sells with it. It's like
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.360]  a six. It's not like the cardboard box thing. It's a step
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.880]  above that. But it's pretty much just put your pixel in this felt
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.360]  visor. And I don't know spent an hour or two playing around with
[55:45.360 --> 55:50.400]  it. And the last thing which I forgot when we were talking
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.080]  Wednesday is that my son Jonas has the PlayStation VR. And I
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.240]  haven't played it. I'm not a I'm not I don't I'm not a gamer.
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.280]  But I was interested enough in it as a technology where I was
[56:01.280 --> 56:03.760]  like, well, give me this thing. I got to I got to see what this
[56:03.760 --> 56:06.560]  is like. So I've used PlayStation VR. That's my
[56:06.560 --> 56:10.520]  experience. Yeah. And so so far, I mean, in just this is like a
[56:10.520 --> 56:13.560]  setup, right? So, so far up until this point, your
[56:13.560 --> 56:16.960]  experience with it largely been, you know, okay, early rough,
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.640]  then the mobile portable, right, which are definitely have a lot
[56:21.640 --> 56:24.560]  of a lot of downside still right there. They've come so
[56:24.560 --> 56:28.680]  far, but still very much not a top of the line experience. And
[56:28.680 --> 56:31.440]  then the PlayStation VR, which is actually pretty damn good, but
[56:31.440 --> 56:35.240]  it's it's a purely single viewpoint camera based
[56:35.240 --> 56:37.960]  experience. So it's got these colored markers, these lights on
[56:37.960 --> 56:40.280]  it, and the camera sees those markers. And that's how it
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.480]  tracks like your head movements and all that. So then the going
[56:43.480 --> 56:47.360]  into this experience with the Vive, which you did a couple at
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.520]  this event, you've got what they call lighthouses, which are
[56:50.680 --> 56:54.960]  infrared sensing cameras that are mounted, kind of up and at
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.920]  angles. And so they can see all sides of the headset, and the
[56:58.920 --> 57:02.760]  controllers. So you've got hands and head in the world being
[57:02.760 --> 57:05.880]  tracked. So it's like kind of another level of VR. So what how
[57:05.880 --> 57:07.760]  does your how's your gravity sketch they go?
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.040]  It was pretty good. I certainly am not susceptible to like
[57:14.040 --> 57:18.080]  motion sickness. Never have been really like you on boats and
[57:18.080 --> 57:20.920]  roller coasters and stuff like that, or I never really gotten
[57:20.920 --> 57:26.160]  carsick. And like 3d movie, I don't like watching 3d motion
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.160]  pictures because I find cognitively I've bitched about
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.800]  it. And I think there's something to it. There's a lot
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.440]  of people there's research that shown it that it's it I can't
[57:33.440 --> 57:37.000]  follow the plot, but I don't get sick. So I didn't find it
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.120]  bothersome. I thought it was pretty neat. And and with
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.080]  gravity sketch in particular, I could totally see right away
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.760]  that describing it as less like sketching and more like
[57:46.760 --> 57:52.640]  sculpting was totally true. Like it's, it's very hard to explain
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.240]  and put into words and to make you believe it. Because at the
[57:56.240 --> 58:01.000]  same time that that that one person can have the VR headset
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.920]  on and get the actual VR experience. They were
[58:04.920 --> 58:08.800]  simulcasting it to like a big 16 inch TV so that everybody else
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.000]  in the room could see what the person was seeing. But when you
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.400]  see it on a 2d TV, it doesn't really look any different than
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.520]  any 3d app that you've seen for 25 years, you know,
[58:21.480 --> 58:24.000]  but if you've seen any 3d modeling app, you're like,
[58:24.040 --> 58:28.280]  okay, but when you have it on and and, you know, you can just
[58:28.280 --> 58:32.720]  move your head around a, you know, it is very different. And
[58:32.720 --> 58:36.240]  it absolutely comes across more like sculpting than, than
[58:36.360 --> 58:43.320]  drawing. It is, you know, even while just making one, you know,
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.600]  putting one thing into the model, you know, it feels it
[58:47.600 --> 58:49.280]  totally feels 3d at all times.
[58:50.360 --> 58:53.400]  Right. And, you know, he was he was talking about how people
[58:53.560 --> 58:56.280]  adopt it quickly and stuff. And I think some people laugh
[58:56.280 --> 58:58.360]  because they know, you know, like, hey, VR, there is an
[58:58.360 --> 59:00.560]  adoption curve, which is true, you know, it takes some time to
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.160]  get used to the controllers and all that. But I mean, honestly,
[59:04.160 --> 59:06.480]  the controllers are a big barrier, because they're fairly
[59:06.480 --> 59:09.320]  clunky. Now, almost all of them are the Oculus ones are probably
[59:09.320 --> 59:15.520]  the best. The more ergonomic, but all of the controllers are
[59:15.520 --> 59:18.000]  pretty subpar. And until we get full hand tracking, we're not,
[59:18.040 --> 59:21.160]  you know, we're not going to be seeing the true potential. But I
[59:21.160 --> 59:24.640]  will say that, like, I put my dad into a VR headset, and he'd
[59:24.680 --> 59:28.680]  been never been in one before. And I put him into a headset
[59:28.840 --> 59:35.600]  with the controllers and a copy of Google's sketch. Well, it's,
[59:35.920 --> 59:39.000]  I think tilt, it's called Tilt Brush, right? So it's, it's
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.800]  like a sketching and painting app, with far less precision.
[59:43.800 --> 59:46.360]  It's really about expressive, you know, painting and things
[59:46.360 --> 59:50.800]  like that. But it's, it's quite cool, very, very rich, complex
[59:50.800 --> 59:55.040]  stuff with it. And he picked it up like that. And like, within
[59:55.040 --> 59:57.600]  minutes, he had produced a piece of artwork in there that I was
[59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.680]  like, how do I see this? Like, I can't even say this. And it's
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.840]  because it translates incredibly well to people that have a great
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.920]  handle on spatial relationships, like designers, you know, the
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.000]  designer industry, especially and architects and things like
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.040]  that they have just in their head, they've got these
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.880]  frameworks that allow them to have to imagine and understand
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.480]  spatial relationships. And so to them, being able to sketch in
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:32.720]  3d is not necessarily it's not an it's not a barrier to them.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.000]  It's a release. Right. And I think a lot of people assume
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.240]  like, oh, they're gonna have to get used to this new way of
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.160]  doing it. And they're like, no, finally, like I've been, you
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.520]  know, I've been tied by pencil and paper or by 2d plane this
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.280]  whole time. And all I wanted to do was sketch in 3d. You know,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.600]  like, all my sketching up to this point has just been trying
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.000]  to get a 3d. That's what I think VR does is it unlocks these new
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.600]  experiences.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.480]  Right. It's certainly no surprise that 30 years ago, and
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.160]  prior that all automobile design was done in clay, you know,
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.920]  with actual sculpture, but it's also no surprise to me, even
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.040]  though I'm not a 3d artist or a sculptor, but it's no surprise
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.680]  to me that that stayed through to now long after the CAD
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.960]  revolution, where where the CAD schematics for the design of a
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.440]  car can be projected in 3d on a two dimensional screen and you
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.040]  can, you know, use your mouse or trackpad or whatever, to pan it
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.920]  around as a wireframe or to use shading to make it look, you
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.880]  know, there's all you know, all the ways that you can make 3d
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.720]  look on a 2d screen. But I could totally see though for the
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.600]  creative aspect of it, that doing it in VR is is it really
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.160]  is two three dimensional thinking what the original CAD
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.720]  revolution was to two dimensional where you really are
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.480]  moving from paper and pencil on a sheet of graph paper, to doing
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.400]  it on a computer that VR is really the first time you're
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.600]  doing it in 3d like the 3d that you can get on a 2d screen
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.200]  doesn't really scratch that itch.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.120]  Yep, makes sense. And I really do feel that there's there's not
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.520]  much there's not much you can say to somebody who has never
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.440]  tried it, that will express appropriately the like
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.360]  transportation or sense of place that being in a real 3d
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.000]  environment bounded by 3d can give you. And that's I think one
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.080]  of the things that has honestly hurt VR a lot in terms of
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.840]  adoption. I think there are several large technology hurdles
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.080]  that are the main cause of it not really going wide yet. And
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.800]  those will need to be overcome. But I think that that sense of
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.800]  you have to see it to understand is a real barrier to adoption.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.640]  Because you know, it's impossible to tell somebody No,
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.480]  like, you're really like, it is really 3d. And they're like,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.760]  Yeah, yeah, I've seen 3d shit, you know, you're like, No, you
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.560]  know, not quite. It's, it's more than that, you know, it's
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.120]  something more. And I think that people that are designers who
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.280]  have been really, really wanting this kind of thing in their
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.920]  workflow, when they see it, they get it, and they adopt it right
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.480]  away, it'll take longer for the world at large. But the people
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.080]  that have been really hankering for this, have really wanted
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.440]  this. And now they have a Mac that can actually push it, which
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.480]  is amazing, because then they can go to that same Mac and
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.960]  launch into their other workflows.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.800]  I know, I'm guilty of it. I think anybody who's adept at
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.400]  computers, and the earlier back in interface that you're adept
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.200]  at a computer, like if especially if you're so adept
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.840]  that you're comfortable at the command line, it's easy to
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:06.960]  overlook just how freeing it is every time the industry levels
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.160]  up and removes a conceptual layer of abstraction. And a good
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.440]  example, a really good example is, to me, like the way that
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.000]  that folks on the Asperger syndrome, especially including
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.880]  ones who are really, you know, really severely affected by it.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.520]  And that kids who have so much trouble communicating, really
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.640]  fly on an iPad, and just do amazing things and expressing
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.400]  themselves and, and learning. And you think like, well, why,
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.120]  you know, and and it's really because that that layer of
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.320]  abstraction of moving a mouse pointer around with a secondary
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.720]  controller, it it's like, it's easy to think like, ah, you
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.960]  know, it touching a button with your finger and touching a track
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.960]  pad to move an arrow on screen to get the button and clicking
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.760]  the trackpad. It's effectively the same thing. One's just, you
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.000]  know, direct and once it a layer of indirection, but that layer
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.240]  of indirection is truly profound for some people. And then for
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.560]  for people who aren't affected by like, something like
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.640]  Asperger's or any other disability. It you know, like my
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.760]  dad, my dad is so much better and more effective and
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.480]  communicates and, and I messaged me so much more like from his
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:38.400]  iPad than, than a Mac. And it's just because it, you know, it,
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.040]  it's less to think you don't have to think it through. It
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.000]  just happens. And that layer of abstraction is totally there for
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.720]  3d. Where if you just want to get a slightly different angle,
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.680]  like the model, like when I was using the gravity sketch, there
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.320]  was a car model, and then it was also like a sneaker. And if you
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.400]  just want to get like, a slightly different view on the
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.680]  sneaker, the fact that you just move your head the same way that
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.920]  you would get a slightly different view on a sneaker in
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:14.200]  real life and that the the field of view is exactly the same as
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:20.240]  looking at a sneaker in real life is it. It's, it's just
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.240]  totally different than if I had to do something, click a button
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.440]  or rotate a wheel or move my fingers on a trackpad to rotate
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.800]  the view like the fact that I'm rotating the view the way I
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.440]  always do with everything else in the world by just moving my
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.640]  head is it's just incredible.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.560]  Like there's absolutely and that Yeah, that deletion of
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:47.040]  extraction, as you mentioned, is a huge like, it's a huge help.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.840]  It's a huge assist to people that that have issues already.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.080]  But it is a massively forward to for people who who knew what
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.800]  they wanted it, right, and just have never been able to get it.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.560]  All right. All right. Let me take a break here. And thank
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.480]  our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Warby Parker Warby
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.280]  Parker believes glasses should not cost as much as an iPhone.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.560]  Their prescription eyeglasses still start at just $95,
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.920]  including prescription lenses with anti glare coating. No kind
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.720]  of upsell to get like the good lenses like you get the good
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.040]  lenses and cool looking frames at just $95. And at that price,
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.520]  that's part of the reason that they you know, believe it's like
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.440]  that is that it you know, should be any kind of just like any
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.840]  other kind of accessory like shoes or a bag or a necktie.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.480]  Like you only own one pair of shoes. Matthew pansarino, I know
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:44.920]  for a fact owns at least two pairs of sneakers. A couple. Why
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.320]  not have glasses like that? I think like the old days, like I
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.120]  grew up where if you like needed glasses, you got a pair of
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.920]  glasses, and then you kept them until they broke or until you
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.320]  needed a new prescription. And then sometimes even when you got
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.400]  the new prescription, you just get them popped into the same
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.680]  frames. Like that's, that's just the way it was. Well, why? Well,
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.080]  part of it is that glasses can be super exciting, expensive. If
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.480]  you can get them for 95 bucks, you can get three or four pairs
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.880]  and mix and match, you know, as your mood changes. So new stuff
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.640]  from Warby Parker, do you have an iPhone 10? If you do, even if
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.400]  you don't need glasses, it is absolutely worth doing this
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.280]  because it's a really cool demo of AR kit. Download Warby
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.080]  Parker's app from the App Store and you can try their brand new
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.400]  feature find your fit find your fit uses the iPhone 10 true
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.480]  depth camera to map and measure key facial features using these
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.000]  measurements find your fit recommends approximately 12 or
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.840]  B Parker frames that are likely the best fit for your face. The
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.920]  process is seamless and only takes a few seconds. If you're
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.520]  like thinking with your iPhone 10, like what are some cool
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.480]  things I can do with this true depth camera other than the
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.280]  Animoji stuff that ships with it. This is absolutely a great
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.800]  example of where this is totally making a new thing possible for
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.520]  apps that just wasn't weren't possible before. Something that
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.360]  just like a still camera just having a front facing still
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.920]  camera. It just doesn't do it like like this does. It's
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.000]  really, really cool. Look, I've had a pair of Warby I have a
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.320]  pair of them right here in front of me. These are my reading
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.120]  glasses, but I've had a pair of Warby Parker glasses. I don't
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.000]  know four or five years still have my first pair of Warby
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.400]  Parker glasses is still around. So it's not like they're
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.480]  shoddily made or anything like that and don't last. Really,
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.440]  really great experience with them personally. Again, they
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.760]  start at just $95. lenses include anti glare anti scratch
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.000]  coatings. For every pair you buy this is great. This has
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  always been true right since the first time I've ever heard of
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.120]  Warby Parker, every pair of glasses you buy from them, Warby
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.000]  Parker distribute a pair to someone in need somewhere around
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.240]  the world. So all sorts of people around the world who
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.080]  don't have access to either don't have access or don't have
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.800]  the money for prescription prescription glasses. And so
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.080]  everything they see is blurry. Imagine what that would be like
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.520]  to go through life and knowing that you don't see everything
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.680]  clearly, and that you could if you only could get a pair of
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.240]  glasses. Well, Warby Parker helps make that happen all the
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.440]  way around the world. It's I think that's fantastic. Anyway,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  and they have a free try on program. So if you're not
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.160]  familiar with Warby Parker from previous podcasts where you've
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.400]  heard about them, it you think like, well, how do I buy
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.480]  glasses? Even if I see them in the app, I don't want to just
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.600]  see them in the app and hope that they work for $95. What
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.720]  they have is a free try on program, you order five pairs of
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.120]  glasses from them, they ship them to you free of charge. And
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.360]  they come not with like prescription glasses, just like
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.920]  dummy lenses. So you can just try them on like you do in a
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.520]  store and see if they fit. See if you like the way they look,
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.000]  with no obligation to buy. If you don't like any of the five,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.320]  just put all five back in the box. It's all it's already got a
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.640]  label. So you don't have to pay for anything. It just ships
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.760]  right back to them. But if you do like them, then you're one
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.880]  step away from having a brand new pair of the lenses that you
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.560]  like sent to you with your prescription lenses. So head to

[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.360]  company love their products. So one of the other companies that
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.040]  demoed the iMac Pro, and again, it was VR was a company I had
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.360]  never heard of. But when I came home and talked to Jonas about
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.200]  it, he was like, Oh, yeah, they make a great VR game. A company
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:35.080]  called Servios S U R v iOS. I don't know what the name of
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.200]  their VR game that they previously had was, but they
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.680]  demoed for us. It was hard, hard data, hard data. Okay. Yeah,
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.640]  it's their biggest hit so far. Well, Jonas was very impressed
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.040]  that I met the founder. They had a new app. I hesitate to
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:58.360]  even sorry, raw data, raw data. It's raw data, data, raw data is
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.720]  the name of the game. Sorry, go ahead. Hard data is like the
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:09.480]  Chinese rip off version of it. Yeah. Electronauts is their new
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.120]  app. And I'm going to call it an app, not a game. And I think
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.960]  it's primarily about the creation of music. But it has
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.960]  the feel of a game. It's sort of like, I would say two thirds,
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:30.280]  three fourths music creation, being a DJ, and a one third
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.960]  game, sort of like Guitar Hero. But part of it is that the
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.680]  basic premise was that you don't have to be a musician to do it
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.720]  and that you can't make anything sound bad. So like in a
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.040]  way that like me, an idiot who doesn't know how to play a
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.960]  guitar, if I just pick up a guitar and try to do anything,
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.040]  literally sounds like someone who doesn't know how to play a
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.800]  guitar, just picking strings on a guitar. Whereas you get into
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.880]  this game, no matter what you bang. So you put the goggles on
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.440]  and you got two joysticks. You call them joysticks. What do you
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.160]  call those things? The controllers. There's two. Yes.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.800]  Yeah. The two, the Vive controllers. There's like one
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.120]  for each hand. Yeah. And then that puts, like you said before,
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.840]  that puts your hands in the field of vision of you. And as
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.720]  you move your hands, you see them in real time in the VR
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.360]  world. And you've got the equivalent of like two drum
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.400]  sticks and you can use it to bang on these things to make
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.760]  tones that go along with this background music that's going.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.200]  But then you also use the sticks to poke at the controls.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.880]  It's sort of like you're standing in front of a three-way
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.240]  desk. Like there's a front part. That's the main thing. You turn
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.720]  to your right and there's things to select over there and you
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.480]  turn to your left and there's things to select over there. In
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.240]  the meantime, the entire world around you is moving like
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.040]  you're on, like the best way I could describe it is you're
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.920]  like, imagine like you're on a train and the Tron movie,
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.400]  right? It's you know, it's like you're in the Tron universe and
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.840]  it's, you're constantly moving at high speed on a train, which
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.640]  sort of gives you that guitar hero feel. And then if somebody
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.280]  else is playing with you, you can do it to two people at the
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.280]  same time. You can turn to your side and see the other person at
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:23.240]  the same type of DJ workstation area over to your side and you
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.720]  can toss these sound grenades at each other that, you know,
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.520]  make other types of noise to go along with the music. Super
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.600]  impressive, very, very impressive technically. But I
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.960]  found it fascinating from a user interface perspective because
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.000]  they really were serious that, you know, like real DJs, this
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.880]  is something they envision that real DJs could use to, you know,
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.000]  play and customize music, perform live in front of, you
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.080]  know, like a club or a party type atmosphere. And that seems
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.960]  totally credible to me. But it was really interesting as a user
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.600]  interface perspective, because it's a, it's a pro creation app,
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.920]  like you're creating music, and the only interface to it is VR,
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.960]  there is absolutely no way that you that this thing would work on
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.680]  a two dimensional screen without VR. I, you know, yeah.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.040]  I mean, they're, they're, they've done a couple of things
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.840]  that are really cool with it. And I jumped in because I
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.560]  definitely wanted to try it out. I'm a fan of Serbia, I've been
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.080]  following them for years, I saw one of their extremely early
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.120]  prototypes very, very early on, when they were still doing a lot
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.080]  of hardware, they've since pivoted, or whatever you want to
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.480]  call it, to doing mostly software, because the hardware
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.360]  stuff kind of shook out like, oh, Oculus and Vive, you know,
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.840]  those kind of took the took the lead. And so they're like, okay,
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.440]  that's fine. That's not our strength. Anyway, we're going to
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.800]  go with XY. So they've been making software and some some of
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.440]  the best software for the platforms. But I really like
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.080]  their stuff. I think they have a good handle on what makes VR
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.440]  special, how they've been really pounding the pavement in terms
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.640]  of trying to get trying to figure out what the best
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.240]  locomotion models are, what the best kind of interaction models
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.480]  are, that sort of thing. Because I think a lot of people don't
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.760]  realize that about VR is that nobody really knows what the
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:13.400]  hell's going on. Like even the people that are making the best
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.320]  stuff for the platform. And that's also why it's so
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.720]  exciting, right? It's not done, right? Like, the best way to use
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.000]  a mouse and a pointer that's done, you know, that it's it,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.560]  right? Like, then you go touch, like, what's the best way to use
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.160]  touch? It's not completely done. But there's a lot of that that's
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.800]  done, right? Like, people know how to use touch and how to tell
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.600]  people how to use touch when they're building applications
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.680]  and that sort of thing. But VR is very, very open field. You
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.600]  know, there's a lot of people running a lot of different
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.400]  directions on this. And some people out there doing some
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.520]  really, really good work to say like, Oh, this is how, you know,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.160]  that we think that this is the best way. And then you'll see a
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160]  lot of people sort of funnel into that. And then some other
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.040]  people go, Oh, no, how about this way, you know, but
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.640]  Serbius has been doing this for a while. And I think it shows in
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.240]  the precision, but you know, the good feel of their
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.720]  interactions, you know, how you grab different instruments, how
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.600]  you interact with the instruments, and they do have a
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.080]  bit of haptic mechanisms. Like when you when you pick
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.040]  something up with the stick, there's just a slight amount of
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.640]  haptic feedback and a little visual feedback where now it's
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.120]  glowing. So you know, you've got it. Right. And it's a little
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.600]  tick, like, just so you would feel like, Oh, I'm picking up
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.000]  something light, but I know I have it in my hands kind of
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.080]  thing. And you know, all of those things will get better
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.760]  over time. But they had a pretty good, you know, pretty good
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.320]  base set of stuff in there. Right. What would actually when
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.800]  you go to like, start pounding on stuff, right? Like, it's,
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.280]  it's sort of a, what would it feel like to pick up a, a, a
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.720]  zero weight electrical thing? You know what I mean? Like if,
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.120]  you know, like in the Harry, you know, Harry Potter type
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.560]  universe, like somebody, you know, with a wand, create
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.320]  something that's not real, what would it feel like to pick it
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.440]  up? That's exactly the sort of right haptic feedback you get
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.000]  like it doesn't, you know, they're not simulating weight,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.520]  but it's just like, just enough of a tick to you feel like
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.320]  you've got this thing that doesn't. Yeah, it's that
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.680]  confirmation and feedback loop that you need to make your mind
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.440]  say I have accomplished this task of grabbing this thing, you
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.640]  know, or picking this thing. But then the second thing that
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.800]  they've done, and this is sort of like the underlying
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:28.280]  technology behind this app, is that have created this system
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:36.920]  for synchronizing and sort of up rezzing your musical
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.000]  abilities. So I'm not, I don't have very good innate rhythm. I
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.400]  used to actually sequence to some MIDI sequencing way back in
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.600]  the day with like tracker on the on the PC, like in the 90s,
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.040]  like in the 90s, and do a little bit of DJing and stuff
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.120]  like that. But I am terrible with instruments. So like, I
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.480]  can't really, I'm not very good at holding a beat, I can, you
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.120]  know, blow away Guitar Hero, but don't ask me to play a real
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.960]  guitar, right? But my dad is a musician, he's very good. And
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.560]  you can play all kinds of different instruments and all
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.920]  this stuff. I did not inherit it at all. So going into this, you
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.800]  know, I had it, I was the perfect person to try this,
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.520]  because it's like, I love music. And I know how I want it to
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.360]  sound, but I can never really get it to sound that way. And
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.720]  so when you bang on these instruments, and we use these
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.840]  these tools that they have in there to create music, their
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.720]  special sauce is this sort of layer that takes your inputs,
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.640]  and melds them with the beat and tempo and other instruments
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.440]  and other things that are going on in the song already, and
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.480]  slides them just a few milliseconds one way or the
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.760]  other and slots them in so that they sound beautiful. So it
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.400]  doesn't matter how discordant you try to make it, like you
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.280]  can just bang indiscriminately on the things. It sounds like
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.120]  you're really trying to make music and that you just made
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.920]  something really cool. Yeah, you know, it's that's kind of their
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.600]  special sauce to go with along with the visuals and the other
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.200]  stuff that they've done is to create this sort of, I hesitate
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.160]  to use the word because it's so loaded, but it's like an auto
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.960]  tune for instruments. Yeah, right. So that you can, you can
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.760]  sort of go like, you know, bing, bang, boom, bang, bang, boom.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.320]  And it's like, boom, like slides it into the beat. And it
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.640]  sounds like it was meant to be there. Yeah. And that's and this
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.040]  works with all kinds of different tempos and music and
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.520]  stuff. Yeah, that's exactly what I mean about it being at least
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.520]  one third of the way to being more of a game. Because it does
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.800]  feel like if you're not good enough, and like me, I'm
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.000]  literally have no musical ability at all. There's nothing
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.800]  related to music that I can do. I can't carry a tune. I can't
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.760]  sing. I can't keep to the beat. And even I couldn't make it
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.240]  sound bad. Like I was trying at first to see if I could make it
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.880]  sound good. And then I tried to make it sound bad. And even I
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.840]  couldn't do it. You know, so someone who can't do anything
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.280]  good, trying to be bad still couldn't get it to be off. And
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.840]  then it would, you know, I could see how it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.920]  You know, yeah, it was a fun day. I would say I had great
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.840]  teaching. Yeah. Mm hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you like that? I
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.280]  mean, it's like, you know, hey, I'm transported to this weird
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.520]  platform traveling through this through space, making music,
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.960]  you know, and that that kind of, you know, allowing somebody
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.560]  or I guess at its base level, it's empowerment. And people
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.440]  who are in the VR scene talk about empowerment a lot,
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.560]  because that's sort of what VR does is it empowers you to do
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.240]  things that you can't do, right? Whether that's transport
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.240]  yourself to another world or fly or, you know, be a really
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:32.200]  cool cyborg or be a musician, you know, or whatever that has
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.800]  that feeling of transporting you and empowering you. And so
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.280]  that's what they're going after. I think that, you know,
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.120]  obviously, I only had a few minutes, I thought it was really
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.640]  cool. But they're working with a lot of like professional DJs
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:47.160]  and people who are big names and have, you know, are well
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.680]  respected and are masters of their craft. And they said that
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.400]  they what they do have is a setting that allows them to turn
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.640]  off all of the help and just allow those guys to create
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.360]  music. So that's where the music creation thing comes in.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.640]  There's a bunch of visual music creation tools that are in
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.320]  there, right down to a tracker where you could tweak your
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.040]  beats, like just one to the left or to the right or any of
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.640]  that, like it actually pops up what looks like to most people
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.760]  like a sheet of music, but it's essentially a MIDI tracker
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.320]  where you could like say, okay, I'm going to trigger this sound
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:24.200]  at this point and this sound at that point that's built in. So
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.600]  if you want to get granular, you can want to turn off
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.600]  essentially the auto aim or auto assist, you can. And so
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.920]  whatever sound you make happens right when you want to make it
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.880]  and how you want to make it. And so obviously for music pros
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.680]  or people who are musicians, this is a creation tool that is
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.920]  visual and physical and performance based. So they
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.720]  could, you know, you could perform for somebody in VR,
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.360]  other people could watch you in VR or hell even in the
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.640]  physical world, but see the VR representation of you, you know,
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.040]  like projected on the screen or something. And I could
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.760]  definitely see this being something that people use like
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.880]  in concerts and in group settings and things like that
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.640]  versus a lot of VR, which has sort of an isolation, you know,
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.520]  aspect to it. But I thought that was cool that you could
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.400]  turn off the help and a real musician can go in there and
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.320]  make real music. And yet somebody who's really bad at it
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.040]  like you or I is like could go in there and still have a lot
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.240]  of fun creating something that sounds cool, you know, and
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.960]  sounds great and makes you feel empowered. Yeah. Now they just
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.440]  announced it. We got to see it a day before it was
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.160]  officially announced. So it was officially announced this
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:36.520]  Electronauts app. It's coming in 2018, they say. So who knows
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.280]  how soon? I mean, what we saw seemed pretty, you know, I don't
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.360]  know how much else there is to do, but it didn't seem to have
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.280]  the part that they showed us didn't really have any rough
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.400]  edges. So maybe it's coming soon. And to tie this back to
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.280]  the iMac Pro, it literally cannot run on any other Mac
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.400]  hardware. There's no other Mac that is capable of running
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.720]  this. And the iMac Pro is so good at running it that while
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.600]  they it is cross-platform and will ship for other, you know,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.480]  computing systems, the iMac Pro is going to be like their
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.120]  recommended system for the app when it comes out.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.520]  Which is it's a it's a massive turnaround from just a couple
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.640]  of years ago with VR. Yeah, or heck even earlier this year.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.320]  Like I really does seem like the takeaway for me is that
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.560]  Apple has really jumped from nowhere in VR, completely
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.560]  irrelevant to completely relevant, incredible. And yeah,
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.600]  this is a good way to do it.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.560]  This is a good machine to drive it, I guess would be a way to
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.200]  say it. And again, the machines, it really puts them, it puts
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.840]  them in the game. Yeah, you know, it really does. And I
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.280]  think that that was part of their effort on this part is to
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.640]  get them in that game, because nobody really knows how this is
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.960]  going to pan out. But almost everybody thinks that VR will
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.480]  have some position in the computing platforms of the future.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.320]  And if that is true, then you need to have skin in that game.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.080]  Yep. And things I noticed is that even with the state of the
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.120]  art right now, you still see pixels in the VR display, like
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.320]  the, you know, just the limits of driving these things. It's
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.480]  like you don't get the VR equivalent of retina yet. Right.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.840]  So, you know, there's still massive improvements to
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.200]  resolution to come. I mean, these are the we were talking
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.320]  about this together Wednesday, but things that have to happen
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.560]  to get this to get VR better. Resolution has to improve
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.520]  dramatically, it needs to get to retina where you don't see
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.360]  pixels, latency still needs to be improved, I get the feeling
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.280]  talking to you that latency is way better than it was even just
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.120]  a handful of years ago, in terms of like when you when you pan
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.200]  when you pan your head, how smooth is the visual
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.360]  translation. And it seems like that's a lot of what made people
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.880]  sick in the early days is that just the wee bit of latency
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.240]  would just make your brain say, I'm sick. But latency wasn't
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.040]  bad. I wouldn't say it was bad in any of the demos we saw. But
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.920]  it certainly wasn't photo realistic. It wasn't real world
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.080]  realistic. Right. And again, not in terms of does everything
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.760]  look like it's a real world. Like I'm completely fooled into
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.920]  thinking I'm in a real world. But just the speed of the
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.960]  latency is just not there compared to what I see when I
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.000]  move my head around this office that I'm in right now. And it
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.040]  needs to be it and we'll get there eventually. And then the
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.760]  third thing is it has to be wireless. And right now to get
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.160]  these experiences, you've got to have the headset hooked up
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.520]  with a wire. And there's just no way that there's no way that
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.040]  that's, you know, it has to get wireless. Yep. I think that
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.080]  encapsulates most of the major I mean, the the technical
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.560]  underlying technical issues that will enable those things are a
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.440]  different discussion. But I think that encapsulates kind of
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.760]  where we need to be, right? It needs to be high res, it needs
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.360]  to be wireless needs to have zero latency. And I think there
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.080]  are a handful of other things that go alongside that, that it
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.720]  needs to be, you know, it needs to be lighter and user more user
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.080]  friendly. It is a little heavy.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.840]  It is a little, you know, I can I can see how it's heavy enough
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.040]  that if I were a designer working on sneakers or working
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.000]  on a car, that the weight of it would definitely be a limiting
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.120]  factor and how long like a design session could be like
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  it's going to be it's going to get tiresome after 45 minutes an
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.480]  hour. Yeah, and I have spent, I have spent like five or six,
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.760]  seven hours in VR at once, like in a stretch. And it, you know,
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.080]  it does. It's honestly the larger portion of it, the way
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.760]  you get used to in a lot of the headsets, especially the the one
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.800]  that you use there was a Vive, sort of like a V2 version of it,
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:58.120]  which has like the rear, the rear head strap has like a nice
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.840]  tightening mechanism on it that the first one didn't have. So
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.720]  it's sort of load balances across your head, you know, but
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.120]  it's still extra weight. But the larger portion of it is the
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.000]  cable management, to be honest, like, you know, seven hours in a
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.840]  headset, you spend a lot of time kicking cables around, you know,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.480]  I put a little carabiner on my cable, then I clip it to the
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.280]  back of my belt, like in the belt loop in the back. So sort
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.480]  of keeps it behind me like a tail. But still, if you're
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.200]  moving around, especially in an application where you're
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.520]  sketching in 3D or moving around in circles, get bothersome.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.240]  And so you look at those and you go, okay, for somebody who's
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.680]  going to go to work and sit, you know, go get to their desk and
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.840]  be like, okay, I'm gonna put my headset on and work today,
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.400]  right? And then work until lunch and then work after lunch
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.840]  until they quit in a headset. Some things have to have to
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.080]  improve, obviously, massively in that area.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.160]  Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't mean that it's not useful now. And
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.800]  you know, it's definitely got years, many years probably ahead
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.720]  of it before it really gets there, where there is like, boom
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:03.480]  and explodes and becomes a thing for the mass market. But
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.280]  to me, it's just like every step of computers has that time
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.080]  where it's like, okay, it's good enough to be useful for
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.840]  some, but it's not going to be useful for tons of people yet,
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.800]  you know, like, what did it take for PCs to be something
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.520]  that most people would want in their house? Effectively, it
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.720]  took the internet, because it turns out that the real killer
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.160]  feature for personal computers that would make everybody want
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.560]  to have one was communication. And in the days before the
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.960]  internet, when either you couldn't communicate, you
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.440]  couldn't use a computer as communication, or you had to do
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.520]  so, esoterically through, you know, BBS systems and dial up
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.960]  modems and stuff like that, it just was no interest to people,
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:48.280]  you know. And so you can, you can say, personal computers
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.960]  needed x, y, and z before they'd explode in the mid 90s, and
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:56.120]  become this thing that every household had. But that didn't
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.720]  mean that from, you know, the late 70s, through the early
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.720]  90s, that there weren't millions of us who were enthralled by
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.920]  them and found good uses of them and build careers on them.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.120]  You know, I think VR is the same way where it's sort of like,
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.480]  right now is like a late 80s era PC. You know, it's totally
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.520]  useful. There's people who are totally into it. And, you know,
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.120]  either having tons of fun with games, or doing serious, serious
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:26.120]  work. But it's not, it's like late 80s away from being
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.080]  relevant to most people.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.480]  Yeah, and you could see, like looking at the experiences of
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.040]  the things that happen right now, you can sort of see
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.560]  yourself in the future looking back and going, wow, we put that
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.480]  much effort into doing that task. You know, it's like, you
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:47.320]  know, you look back going, what did we do to put numbers into a
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.320]  spreadsheet and, you know, apply operators to them? You know,
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:56.760]  the process of doing that, you know, in the late 80s was just,
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:00.200]  it was, you know, nearly insurmountable, but you did it
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.920]  anyway, because it was still better than doing it on paper.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.800]  Right, exactly.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.680]  But it was both certainly a chore. And I think that's how
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.480]  we'll look back at VR in the current state, like, wow, all
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.960]  those wires and connected to a big old tower PC or Mac, you
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.600]  know, all of this stuff to just to get, you know, a 3D
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.680]  world running in your face, because, you know, I could do
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.200]  that with my goggles now, you know.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.760]  All right, let me take one last break here and thank our third
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.640]  and final sponsor of the show. Our good friends at Casper
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.160]  Casper is a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.440]  line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:38.600]  experience one night at a time at Casper perfect mattresses are
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.360]  perfectly designed for humans engineered to soothe and cradle
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:46.680]  your natural geometry. You spend a third of your life sleeping.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.840]  So you should be comfortable. I personally have never even
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:54.040]  before Casper was sponsoring this podcast, and I've been
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:59.080]  pitching their mattresses. I've long been a opponent to the
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.120]  theory of, wow, it's not worth spending a lot of money on a
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.040]  nice mattress because you're only you're sleeping, you're
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.600]  not enjoying it because you're asleep. I say the opposite. I
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.160]  say sleeping is some of the best. It's the best I feel,
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.280]  most of the time. And you want to wake up feeling great. You
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.600]  wake up on a nice bed, you wake up, you feel great, you start
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.840]  your day feeling great. You sleep on a crummy mattress, you
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.280]  wake up feeling crummy. It's, I'm telling you, I think that
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.160]  mindset of, ah, put your, you know, I'll spend my money on
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.400]  things when I'm awake, not when I'm sleeping. It's nonsense.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.280]  You're alive 24 hours a day, get a good mattress. And the
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.200]  quality Casper brand mattresses combined multiple supportive
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.240]  memory foams for a quality sleep service with just the right
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.880]  amount of sink and bounce. You really don't have to spend a lot
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.880]  of time when you're shopping for a Casper mattress, picking
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.120]  which type. It's mostly down to which size. It's really great.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:52.840]  You don't have to get into this. And they have a no hassle
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:59.240]  return policy. Free shipping in the US and Canada. So you get
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:03.400]  it, it shows up, they call it a how did they do that sized box,
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.960]  you open it up in a room, sucks all the air out of the room,
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.120]  and then all of a sudden you got a mattress, you got a
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.640]  mattress, you got like 100 days to sleep on it, you don't like
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:15.000]  it, they just call them up or go to the website, they'll send
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.600]  someone to your house, pick it up, get it out. Couldn't be
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.280]  easier. Really couldn't. We've got them here in the house. We
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.240]  love them. Really great. They're just they're just good
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:29.960]  mattresses. Really, really like them. So here's how you do.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.200]  Here's what you do if you're in the market for a new mattress.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.160]  You can get $50 towards any mattress purchase at Casper by
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.640]  visiting casper.com slash the talk show. And then remember
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.800]  that code, same thing as the URL, the talk show, at checkout,
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.640]  you plug that code into the little box casper.com slash the
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.760]  talk show, use the code the talk show. And that gets you the 50
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.560]  buck discount on any mattress. terms and conditions apply. I
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.800]  don't know. I don't know which terms and conditions but they do
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:07.560]  apply. But go check them out at casper.com slash the talk show.
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:10.680]  I'll tell you what the other demo at that at the iMac event,
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.560]  or there's a couple more. But the twin motion one really blew
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:20.840]  me away. Twin motion is like this. I guess it's for
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:24.120]  architects type thing. They call it a real time visualization
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.080]  app. But it more or less like if you're an architect, you can
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.000]  like take your CAD files, put them into twin motion, and it
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.120]  turns them into effectively like a video game world like but with
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:41.400]  really high resolution. They didn't demo it with VR, did they?
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.360]  At least when we were there, but I believe it does. It does have
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:50.120]  a VR angle. But it like they had what they did for the demo is
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.880]  they had like the architectural plans for an airport, and they
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:59.000]  put them into 20 motion. And it it gives you this near photo
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.640]  realistic rendering of the airport that you can move around
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.200]  in in 3d like a 3d shooter, but it you know, it's so you're not
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.040]  waiting for individual stills to render, you're just moving in
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.480]  real time, and it animates and it gives you and you can set the
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.680]  camera to different heights. And obviously, the one that would be
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.480]  interesting would be like the typical height of a pair of human
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.680]  eyes on the pathway. And you just get this sense of what
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.240]  would it be like to be in this airport or to be dropped off
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.960]  outside this airport? Here I am outside the airport.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:36.840]  Sorry, it's my son.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.480]  Hi, buddy. How you doing? Yeah, wow.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:50.920]  Sorry. Be in the airport. Yeah. Apparently not a fan of an
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.320]  airport. And it's got these, you know, you can set what season
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.040]  of the year it is, what the weather's like, like, what's it
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.880]  gonna look like when it's raining? What's it gonna look
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.920]  like at noon, when the sunshine shine is streaming in? You know,
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.560]  what's it gonna look like at five o'clock in the winter when
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.520]  it the sun is setting? Just amazing in terms of visual
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:16.520]  izing. And as somebody who to me, you show me the floor plans
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.480]  of a house, you know, like a two dimensional architectural
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.760]  drawing of the floor plans. It's like, I can get a vague sense of
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.120]  what it would be like to be there. But I really it just does
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.320]  not my mind just does not extrapolate a two dimensional
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.080]  drawing into Well, what would it actually be like to be in this
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.000]  room? I don't get it like software like this would be
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  phenomenal to me. Just absolutely amazing. I mean,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.800]  just absolutely game changing as a just as a client or, you
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.480]  know, you know, if I was commissioning like a new office
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.520]  or buying a new house or something like that, to be able
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.080]  to actually see it before you know, construction starts at
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.360]  this is unbelievable.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.760]  Yeah, I mean, the speed at which it worked was sort of the
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.360]  key is like the it's it was definitely possible to do this
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.680]  before, but definitely not at this speed. And I think those
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.320]  were occurring theme and a lot of the stuff that we saw was
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.000]  that people were quoting things like this happens three 5x 10x
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.240]  faster than we could do it before. And it was definitely
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.720]  repeated. And I think Renee mentioned this in his write up,
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.360]  but it was definitely repeated over and over that they were
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.080]  able to do things now in real time. Yeah, you know that it
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.440]  took them much longer. It took a lot of cycles of either
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.160]  rendering or processing back and forth to accomplish. So the
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.920]  ability to take a client's model and drop it in and open it up
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.800]  and show it to them in a walkthrough, and then make a
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.120]  tweak and show them the walkthrough again almost
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.800]  immediately, is, you know, that's the key, right? That's
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.680]  what you want. And you want to be able to have that power to
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.880]  do that. And they were showing off the iMac Pro's ability to
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.800]  do it. It runs an Unreal Engine, it's nothing exotic, you know,
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.080]  you know, on the technology front. But it's a very clean,
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.560]  very usable tool that allows you to, in real time, take a
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.920]  client through various weather conditions and even add and
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.040]  subtract features like trees and water and that sort of thing.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.880]  And for them to see the results immediately, which is, you
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.200]  know, it's all about that feedback thing. And if you're in
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.800]  an agency setting or design setting, feedback loops are the
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.880]  killer. Like that's what destroys your time and your turnaround
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.320]  and all of that. It's just it's the ability to say, make a
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.520]  change and see it immediately. That is invaluable in that
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.600]  setting. Yeah, I have it in my notes here that it was literally
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.120]  that the rendering speed is five times faster than on the
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:52.600]  current high end quad core i7 iMac. And that that's the
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:57.080]  difference between doing it in real time at maximum quality,
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.080]  or having to, you know, sort of stutter through it at high
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.680]  quality or go through in real time at a much lower visual
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.560]  quality. And they do things they had crazy things in the app
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.680]  to where it was like you could paint trees, you could just get
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.600]  like a paintbrush, and in 3d. So like if you had like the
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.560]  front of the airport, it's like it was just grass. And they
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.720]  were like, Well, what if the client says, Why can't we fill
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.000]  that in with trees? You just, you know, painted in with
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.240]  trees, and then all of a sudden, the trees are there. So
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:28.760]  instead of like, taking a note, render the front with trees and
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.480]  scheduling another meeting and having the client come back to
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.320]  see it again, what does it look like with trees? You know,
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.920]  you're doing it in 1520 seconds in real time, right there.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:45.960]  Right. And that short circuits that whole loop. And I think
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.760]  that's, you know, it's money, right? It's money, you're paying
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.520]  your paying people money to sit around and wait for feedback.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.640]  And you're, you know, you're paying your executives to sit
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.440]  around and wait for the work to be done and all of that. And so
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.720]  it's it really is a domino effect on your effectiveness and
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.680]  therefore your budget.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.840]  Yeah, that was really that really was the recurring theme
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.480]  of the demos was doing things in real time that previously either
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.920]  took a rendering stage where you'd have to go get coffee or
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.240]  take a break to see it. Or if you did it in real time, doing
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.920]  it at a lower fidelity, and then still having to do a final
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.640]  render to get the hype, you know, the the true fidelity
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.600]  version of it, whether it was a visual thing, or like an audio
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.400]  thing with Logic Pro. That was absolutely the recurring theme.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.800]  And I think that I think it's just true for all creative
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.720]  people that doing it doing something in real time. It, you
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.680]  know, makes it feel like it's waiting on your talent, as
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.600]  opposed to when you're not working in real time, and you
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.400]  feel like you're waiting on the computer.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:57.320]  Yeah, and I think that that that is underrated by anybody
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.320]  who doesn't doesn't do it on a daily basis. So I think you'll
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:11.000]  get a lot of people who are commentating on the, you know,
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.360]  the value of that of that real time nature of things or the
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:21.160]  value of the loop being short circuited or clipped or
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.960]  whatever. But I'll tell you, when you were in a creative,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.360]  when you're doing creative work, and I used to do obviously a
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.800]  lot of Photoshop work with when I was doing photography. And
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.000]  you know, I developed a flow, you develop a flow of getting
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.520]  your images imported into Lightroom, making broad
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.320]  adjustments, making minor adjustments, bouncing out to
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.560]  Photoshop to make retouching and then back to Lightroom and
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.640]  on through your process, you know, and then to export and so
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.760]  on and so forth. But I'll tell you, when you get in your flow,
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.200]  being able to have things happen immediately, it stops you
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.520]  from interrupting your flow, it really keeps you more
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:02.520]  productive, it keeps you in that in that zone that you get
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.880]  into. And for like, somebody who's doing video editing, or
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.880]  doing, you know, audio, especially things where the
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.320]  creative nature of the thing that you're working on really
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.480]  feeds into that flow. It's a huge thing to be able to get
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.160]  that immediate response and feedback and not have to wait
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.000]  for it to do what you want it to do. It's it's pretty awesome.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.720]  Yeah. I'm trying to think here, the other demos, we didn't talk
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.640]  about the Cinema 4D one. That was, it was interesting. But
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:42.840]  that was sort of the just the most. Look, this is a thing that
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:49.000]  is super computationally complex. Well, it's the impact of
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.040]  right because like they took something that was literally the
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.000]  level of complexity that you'd find on a feature film, right.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.880]  And we're adjusting the viewport and saying, look, this
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.640]  is happening. But until you see how long it used to take, like
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.440]  physically, it's hard, you know, it's hard. And I, you know,
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.320]  I've seen scenes that complex because I've done like media
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.560]  visits at, at, you know, effects houses and things like that.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.960]  And people have shown me, like, literally the scenes that have
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.040]  gone into a blockbuster and like, hey, I'm moving this
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.760]  around and showing you, I can change this bridge, you know,
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.960]  the way this bridge explodes or whatever the case, and I could
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:27.640]  like I get it like an extremely complex 3D scene rendered with
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.640]  texture and lighting that Matt nearly matches one to one what
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.840]  you're going to see on the screen. But being able to view
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:38.280]  that and show that in in near real time with just a couple of
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.760]  minutes in between, pretty good and fully rendered is crazy.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.600]  You know, that's it's huge. And the the we're stacking up
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.320]  external GPUs to make that happen. This is it could add or
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:53.240]  subtract, depending on the complexity of the scene. But to
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.440]  me, like, I mean, that's cool. It's just a little lower impact
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.000]  unless you're in that industry. You know, somebody in that
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.240]  industry would have been like, holy shit, you know, but for us,
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.240]  it's just like, Oh, wow, that's cool, you know. But I also
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:11.240]  believe that it truly well, in the end, it'll, it'll improve or
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.520]  expand the ability and options of artists in that industry.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.360]  Because as you and I both know, like the moment you expand
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.040]  computing capability, people's desires and ambitions expand to
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.000]  fill app, you know, so when once you're able to stack two or
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.760]  three or four or five external GPUs onto these Thunderbolt
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.040]  ports and access all that compute power. So to render
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.920]  these frames, people will go, hey, my scenes can get two or
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:43.960]  three or four more times come more complex. Yeah. And more
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.640]  detail, like, it did seem like their role in the demo rotation
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.880]  was to be the that that was the one that used external GPUs
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.080]  plugged in via Thunderbolt three, and to show that, you
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.240]  know, hey, you know, they had two of them, or at least two
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:02.200]  boxes, who knows how many GPUs are in those boxes. But, you
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.040]  know, it was, again, it was sort of hard, because they it
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.600]  almost was the one that I think would have most benefited from
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:14.120]  having like, some other Mac, either a, you know, the highest
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:18.760]  end Mac Pro or iMac, regular iMac, or something side by side
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:24.600]  to show just how much faster it was. But the guys from Cinema
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.040]  4D were very excited about the performance that they were
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.400]  getting. The other another demo they had, there was what else
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.800]  was there, there was Adobe dimension, which is an app I'd
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.440]  never even heard of before, because I'm sort of just out of
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.360]  that world. But very cool app. It's it's basically a 3d
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.480]  rendering for regular graphic designers, you know, where let's
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:49.800]  say you're like the example that they had was like the
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.840]  graphic design for a bag of potato chips. So you're doing
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.720]  the, you know, it was an Illustrator file in two
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:01.480]  dimensions that shows what the you know, bag of potato chips
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.440]  would look like coming off the printer as a two dimensional
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.720]  sheet of foil. And then you move it into dimension. And all of a
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.320]  sudden, it's a three dimensional bag of potato chips that sealed
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.280]  up has the crimp at the top. And you can apply different
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:21.000]  lighting effects and get a truly photo realistic rendering of
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.880]  what it would look like as a real package. And that was the
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.600]  one I thought it was pretty interesting that that Adobe's
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.120]  thing is CPU bound, not GPU bound, although they did say
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.720]  that they were looking at, you know, moving some of it to GPU,
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:41.320]  but that the more that was one that the the more cores you
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.080]  throw out at the faster the renderings would be.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.200]  Right. And and they were, I think they were emphasizing to
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.040]  that, you know, you, not every application would benefit from
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:54.680]  more cores. And I think that this has been a constant debate,
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:58.120]  you know, as multi, as hyper threading and multi core
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:01.480]  processors have gotten more common over the last decade, you
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.280]  know, people often judge performance, you know, very
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.000]  differently, right, based on the kind of applications that
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.120]  they're throwing at these things. And the more is not
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.240]  always better debate is the prime example, you know, this
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.000]  scenario is a prime example of that, you know, at 18 core
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.560]  processor may not actually be all that great for somebody
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:22.520]  who's doing something that requires a single thread at a
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.280]  high frequency. And in the case of a render pipeline, though,
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.000]  you know, when you can assign multiple tasks to different
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.080]  cores, and be intelligent about it, it can be very helpful to
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.280]  have those additional cores.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.600]  Yeah, Adobe's the Adobe rep said that it their their scales
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.720]  linear linearly. So you really do every time you add a core,
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.840]  you get increased performance. I thought it was pretty
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.160]  interesting. And then the last demo, or I guess the other two
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.360]  that were from Apple itself, and they had an Xcode demo,
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.080]  were a developer demo, really, because they emphasize that
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.800]  they know that Macs are super popular with developers, but
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.280]  they also know that developer, quote, unquote, developer
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:01.640]  doesn't just mean people writing iOS and Mac applications.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:06.440]  That statistic they quoted was that 60% of all GitHub
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.520]  developer activity is done from a Mac that they worked with
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:13.000]  GitHub to get these stats. And that, you know, means all
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.880]  sorts of, you know, you know, stuff that purely runs on the
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.480]  web, and that sort of stuff. So that's pretty incredible,
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.200]  given the max overall market share that it's up to 60% of
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.440]  all GitHub developer activity. So what they demo, they
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.520]  demoed three iOS simulators running at once, which is not
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.160]  something that you could do before. Like you don't have
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.880]  like one iOS develop, you know, simulator running at a
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.560]  time when they have like two, it was like two iPhones and
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.800]  an iPad running all the same time on screen. Running a
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.080]  bunch of automated tests in the simulator to test the app.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.440]  A couple of VMware, I think it was VMware they were using,
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.000]  but VMware, virtual machines, one of them running Linux,
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.600]  that was like installing, compiling a bunch of software
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.640]  from scratch, like an Apache PHP sort of environment.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:10.040]  Another VMware instance running Windows 10, and they
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.680]  even joke that out, you know, when's the last time you saw
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.800]  Apple running Windows in a product demo, running Chrome,
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:23.240]  which is not known as a, you know, performance, you know,
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.800]  something that's light on the CPU. So running a bunch of
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.360]  automated, automated client side tests of a web app in
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.600]  Chrome, in Windows, in a VM, while in a terminal window on
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:44.360]  the Mac itself, they were using Brew to install like a
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:47.880]  ton of data script, installing and compiling from scratch,
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.720]  a ton of software for the Mac itself.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.040]  Yeah, compiling a Linux install from source.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:54.540]  Right.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:56.920]  Essentially.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.640]  Yeah. So it, you know, all, and all of that running at
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.880]  once. And again, I went behind the machine while it was
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.120]  still running, put my hand there and there's no, you know,
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.680]  wasn't like a hairdryer blowing out the back. So, you know,
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.200]  very impressive. And I really do think that was a huge part
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.440]  of the message. You know, I think that's why one of the
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.280]  people who got, you know, to go back to earlier in the
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.520]  show and who got seated with these things a week in advance,
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.040]  why did David, Hannah Meyer Hanson, you know, the create
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:28.680]  co-creator of Rails and from Basecamp, not really like an
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:33.320]  iOS developer type person, you know, but they gave one to
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.800]  him. And I think he's, you know, very popular individual
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.600]  in that sort of open source web development world. And it,
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.080]  you know, to say, yeah, this is a machine for us.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:52.520]  Yep. And I think that that's, you know, the goal is they
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.640]  wanted to capture a spread and to make sure that they
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:03.800]  didn't pigeonhole the messaging or use because they,
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.520]  there is an appetite, a voracious appetite for a more
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.920]  powerful Mac from a lot of different vectors, not just
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.520]  one, you know, and I think that's so important to remember
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.640]  for a lot of people. And it's definitely something that
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.880]  Apple is cognizant of. Frankly, people like the Mac, they
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.720]  like the software that runs on it. They like the
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.880]  environment. They like the fact that people who build
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:32.680]  applications for it give a crap, unlike Windows. Sorry,
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:36.200]  but it's true. You know, the Windows developer system is
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.480]  anemic by comparison, whether you like Windows or not,
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.480]  it's hard to argue that. And they like all of those
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.520]  aspects of it. What they don't like is it being
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:51.080]  underpowered in relation. And honestly, the cost is one
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.040]  way to look at it. And I think you could look at the cost
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.200]  and some people would say, oh, I could build it cheaper.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.800]  But those people are fine giving up all of the finesse
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.720]  touches, the high security aspects of the T2, the
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.400]  screen being the best on the market, etc., etc. And they
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.680]  go like, oh, well, raw power, I can build it cheaper,
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.200]  whatever. But the people that appreciate those details
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.600]  and need or want them, people in the industries where
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.320]  color correct screens matter a hell of a lot and where
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.960]  screen real estate matters a heck of a lot, those arenas
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.560]  want more power and they are sick of it being
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.600]  underpowered. So I think that they're addressing those
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.160]  aspects of it pretty well with the iMac Pro.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:46.760]  Yeah. And it does all kind of flow together in the Apple
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.800]  product ecosystem. But where if you were editing
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:53:00.680]  5k video with the what's the extra color depth, the P3
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.480]  color space? Yeah, the P3 color stuff. And you're editing
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:09.160]  it in Final Cut Pro on an iMac. And then you go and
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:14.920]  show it to somebody else on an iPad Pro, it looks exactly
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:20.680]  the same. You don't need to worry about that. And
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:23.080]  somebody who's really trying to sweat the details on
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.800]  the exact color grading that you're getting out of this
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.040]  and applying to the source footage, if somebody else is
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:35.800]  looking at it on an iPad Pro or on their MacBook Pro or
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:39.000]  something like that, it's going to look the same. And
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.360]  that's just huge for a professional environment.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:46.120]  Yep, exactly. And people that aren't in that industry
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.760]  are in those industries where you've got a high
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:56.680]  pressure delivery time situation and you need your
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:00.440]  color correction to show up perfectly on an iPad Pro
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.800]  that you hand somebody for approval as the same as it
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.520]  did on your 5k iMac screen. And they're not going to
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:09.000]  get it. But the people that do get it, they're like,
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.800]  finally, you know, finally, I can do that. So last the
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:16.840]  last thing I want to talk about was is the future of
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.320]  this. And it's like I wrote in my piece, like, well,
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.960]  these machines are clearly great. And I think they're a
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:27.720]  solid value. And they're super useful right now today.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.440]  But you could say the same thing in 2013, when the
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.640]  trashcan Mac Pros ship that these are super impressive
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:36.600]  pieces of engineering, it's obvious that Apple put a lot
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.800]  of work and thought into it. And then they never updated
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.840]  it. And, you know, for these things to really put Apple
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.960]  back in the game as as a company that provides truly
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.560]  world class workstation hardware for people, you know,
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.000]  like, across the board developers, designers, 3d
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.280]  people, VR people, it's not enough just to come out with
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:03.880]  one round of IMAX in December of 2017. Like, you know,
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.960]  and Apple is never going to update them every three
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.560]  months, like the way that the component PC industry, you
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.280]  know, it's as soon as new stuff comes out, you can just
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.640]  custom configured into a box and just get it there. It's
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.800]  not like they're going to update every three months. But
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.960]  they need to update like at least roughly every year. And
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:25.320]  that never happened with the Mac Pro. And and I think the
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.640]  reasonable concern people would have is do you want to
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:33.400]  make an investment in this platform? Having to hope, you
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.360]  know, or trust, I guess that Apple is going to remain
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.080]  committed to it.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.480]  Yep. And the pacing of the industries that they're trying
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:47.720]  to target with this definitely remains a concern and a big
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:50.920]  issue, right? You know, if you are looking at VR, the the
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.520]  machines that were running VR top spec two years ago are
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:57.800]  not the same machines as today. And you know, you would
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:00.280]  you would see a significant degradation in your ability to
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.280]  develop for those platforms or run them as a consumer if you
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:07.480]  made a bet on on something that, you know, was not able to
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.640]  advance along with it. So if they are planting a flag in the
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.640]  VR industry, are they going to have that same position in two
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.520]  years if the iMac Pro is not updated?
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:21.480]  Right. And I think, you know, and the concern that people
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:24.920]  have, and you know, I don't think it's unreasonable is that
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:30.760]  Apple let the Mac Pro languish, maybe not because they
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.600]  completely lost interest in it. But like, that they made some
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:38.520]  bad bets on where things were going underestimated the
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:44.040]  importance of, you know, GPUs in 2013. I mean, they more or
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.840]  less said this to us last April, you know, when we talked
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.200]  to Federighi and Schiller, you know, Federighi even said, you
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.960]  know, that they painted themselves into a thermal
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.000]  corner. I believe that's a direct quote, but if not, it's
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.560]  super, super close. So it wasn't like they completely lost
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.200]  interest, it was like they found themselves painted into a
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.520]  corner. But the reasonable expectation that people can
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.760]  have is they're never going to let that happen. Even if they
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.280]  make a mistake with the iPhone, it's too important to them, and
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:12.840]  they make too much money, they'll pay whatever it costs to
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:19.320]  correct the mistake year after year. You know, and that the Mac
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:24.760]  being a less of a financial revenue generator for the
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:29.160]  company means that you you're at the risk that that they're
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.200]  something else is going to take their attention away from from
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.960]  these products. I think, you know, I feel like we have to
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.240]  wait and see. But I feel like they're in a better spot and
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.240]  that the this these Mac iMac pros aren't going to find
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:46.840]  themselves in that trap that the Mac Pro did because I feel like
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:53.080]  they're, they're clearly oriented towards the future that
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:57.480]  they are already very, very strongly geared towards GPU
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.800]  intensive computing. I really do feel like that's the case. And
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:04.600]  I feel like what happened, they made a bad bet with the design
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.840]  of the Mac Pro in 2013. They're correcting it now. And I feel
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:11.560]  like whatever they're going to come up with is, is going to be
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.200]  built for the future. And they'll have that, you know,
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:18.040]  configurable box for pros that you can do what you want inside
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.760]  the box built for the future. And I feel like we've never had
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.800]  an iMac Pro before, because this is really the earliest that
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.120]  they could do it, that they couldn't make a machine that you
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.240]  would think of as an iMac in terms of form that would have
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.440]  the performance characteristics of a high end workstation until
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:34.920]  now.
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.800]  Yeah, I mean, the talk about thermals was interesting,
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:43.400]  because I think this has something like 67% more
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.320]  cooling in it than the previous iMac. Yeah, I think that's
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:50.920]  exactly right. They doubled the amount of fans on it, all of
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:54.840]  that jazz. So they were very concerned about keeping it cool
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:57.560]  and keeping the performance high. And yet, as you mentioned,
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.880]  even though they're, they were really powering through stuff,
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:03.960]  it really didn't seem like it was being taxed or getting all
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.160]  that hot or, you know, outgassing a ton of hot air or
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:12.040]  anything. So that to me, the amount of power that's in those
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.440]  machines, given the amount of heat that's coming out of them
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.840]  right now, I think they built in a lot of overhead in the
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:20.680]  cooling. So I think that, you know, given that we saw all the
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:23.480]  stuff that was going on with those, all the applications
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:25.880]  that were pushing those Macs, they weren't getting very hot,
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:29.640]  the fans weren't going crazy. I think that the current amount
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:32.920]  of power in them has some overhead as far as the thermals
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.320]  go. In other words, I think they learned their lesson a bit and
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:37.480]  have built in a little bit of future proofing. I think we're
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.680]  going to see more power come out of this current iMac casing
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.480]  before maybe they redesign the whole thing, you know?
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:49.800]  Yeah, I do too. And I do feel, you know, sometimes failure is
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.920]  the best teacher, you know, and I feel like they're not, like,
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:56.920]  trying to sweep the 2013 Mac Pro under the rug. It's like, I
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.480]  really do feel like they've learned from it. I really do
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:02.040]  feel like they're not just paying lip service to, yes, we
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.360]  love the professional market, and we really do want to build
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:11.400]  machines that make them happy. I really do feel like they mean
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:14.360]  it, and that, you know, this is, you know, the first tangible
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.760]  sign of that in quite a long time.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:24.360]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's easy to get disheartened if you don't
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:28.360]  see your concerns being addressed or you feel that a
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.800]  whole segment that you belong to is being overlooked. So I
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.320]  think they're doing what they can to sort of counter the
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:39.320]  messaging and then also deliver some, you know, real applicable
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.720]  hardware to a good segment of the market that's been feeling
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.120]  like they've had to make do with whatever they've got.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.160]  Yeah. And, you know, I don't want to get into a systems
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:54.360]  architecture lesson because I'm not fit to lecture it, but it
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.160]  really is clear just at the high level and what you hear from
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.160]  them that this is absolutely, this is a lot like modern day
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:06.760]  Apple is like a head to toe systems maker. Like they're not,
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:10.200]  this iMac is not some kind of box where there's a, oh, we just
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:13.960]  took this CPU from Intel and we took these graphic cards from
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:18.360]  Radeon and RAM from, you know, whatever company, and we just
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:22.920]  stick them all in the back of a display and that's it. Like this
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.600]  thing is in a lot of ways like an iOS device, like an iPhone
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.360]  in terms of being all of these parts are custom designed
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:32.680]  to fit together. And the best example of it, I don't think you
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.760]  and I really talked about it much. I know you mentioned it,
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.040]  but that this T2 chip, uh, the T1 is the, the sort of system
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.360]  on a chip in a Mac book pros with the touch bar and the T2
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.800]  chip is, is running on the iMac. Now the iMac doesn't have
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.400]  any kind of like face ID or touch ID. So there's no
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.840]  biometrics, but it does have a secure enclave. It is
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.440]  effectively an iOS, a little miniature iOS computer running
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:01.800]  in there. Um, but the thing that was most interesting to me
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:08.840]  is the way that the T2 handles the, um, uh, it's the, it's the,
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.320]  it's the flash controller for the SSD. So the, the controller
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.720]  that handles the reads and writes is no longer on the
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.480]  actual SSDs. It's on the T2 chip, which among other things,
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.960]  like the benefit of this is that it handles all the
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:27.480]  security. So all rights to the SSD, all rights are, are
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:31.080]  encrypted. Um, whether you have out of the box, out of the box,
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.720]  there's no way around it. And, and it's one of the ways that
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:36.440]  like, when I wrote about it, like the systems couldn't run a
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.640]  spinning hard disk, even if Apple wanted to, there's no way
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.760]  internally, you can obviously plug one in by, you know, a USB
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.160]  or whatever, but internally, it can't even run an H spinning
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.680]  hard disk. It's SSD only, uh, they're encrypted out of the
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:59.800]  box, whether you're using file vault or not. And it, um, uh,
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.280]  it doesn't use the CPU, the T2 chip handles with a dedicated
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.280]  AES, you know, encryption, decryption chip handles it so
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.960]  that the encrypted decrypted reads and writes are at a
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.760]  hundred percent performance of the SSD. They happen faster
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.640]  than the SSD can read or write. So you still get a hundred
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.720]  percent, a hundred percent performance, even though it's
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.480]  all encrypted. Right. Encryption with zero performance
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:28.600]  hit, which is up to this point, you always said to say, look,
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.840]  look, I'm going to turn on file vault, but I know I'm going to
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.160]  take a little bit of a performance hit, a performance
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.640]  overhead on my CPU in order to do this. And most people were
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.200]  okay with that, that are security minded, but now you'll
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.480]  get it for quote unquote free. Right. It's sort of, you know,
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.000]  honestly, it's to make an analogy, it's like the, the, the
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.120]  convenience hit you take by locking the doors to your house
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.680]  and you have to come up. And now when you go in your house,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.080]  you have to take a key out and put a key in a lock and twist
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:58.520]  it and then turn the doorknob. And most people who I know
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:01.960]  accept that and lock their house when they leave, even
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.920]  though it would be easier if you could just walk up and, and
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.160]  it's, you know, it's the equivalent of like, just being
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.640]  able to walk your, your house is locked, but it, you know,
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:11.720]  authenticates who you are and you just walk up, turn the
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:14.760]  doorknob and go in, you know, you get all the benefits and
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.880]  none of the hits. But that means if you took the SSD modules
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.920]  out of the iMac, you couldn't read or write them once they're
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.720]  unpaired with the T2 chip. So the question I have, I wish I
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.640]  would have asked it. I don't know what the answer is. Is
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.520]  what's even the benefit of FileVault now as opposed to just
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.360]  putting a firmware hard password on the iMac Pro itself, because
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.400]  the reason why it's always in luck, because I asked and you
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:41.400]  probably weren't listening. Oh, did you really? Yeah, yeah, I
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.520]  did. Well, this is why I had you on the show. Actually, hold
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.520]  on, let me find my notebooks right here. So I asked that
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.400]  because I had the same thought like, okay, well, so
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:56.520]  everything's encrypted. If you if somebody managed to like
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:59.880]  grab your machine and take it apart, you know, the SSD will
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.720]  not function separately from that T2 or whatever. So if you
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:07.160]  if it was to get scrapped, you know, whatever the case may be
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:11.480]  couldn't read it. So I asked what the deal? What is the deal
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:15.480]  with FileVault is what I asked them. And basically, they said
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:19.320]  that it handled different cases. Because let's say, for
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.360]  instance, you were to put the machine at the target disk mode,
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:25.400]  FileVault would require that you had your user password as
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:30.840]  well as the system being on and active. Whereas if you were to
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:34.200]  put it in target disk mode, the T2 would see that as a
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:37.640]  legitimate write request or write request, and it would be
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.880]  it would handle those that interaction because it's at the
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:43.560]  very base level of the system. So you're getting encrypted
[02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:47.160]  read writes from the T2. But the FileVault adds an additional
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:50.280]  layer of security by injecting your user key into the
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:54.440]  encryption pipeline. So you have an additional kind of layer
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:59.160]  of I this is me, and I authorize this, whereas the T2 is not
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.200]  really involved with identity at all. It's just saying this
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:05.560]  machine is secure from external rewrite attempts, things like
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:11.320]  that. But if you are in the official pipeline of a read
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.040]  write, the T2 is going to facilitate it. It's going to say,
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.160]  sure, you know, no problem. Absolutely. Right. But the
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:20.200]  FileVault is sort of an additional lock on that. That is
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:23.960]  like, hey, not just anybody that has access to this machine,
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:29.080]  but me specifically, I authorize this to be read and
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:29.800]  written to.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:33.240]  All right. There we go. Yeah. Well, that sounds like a show
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.200]  to me. That's exactly I can't believe that my question was
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:40.200]  actually in your notebook. That's so great. Matthew
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:43.320]  Panzer, thank you for returning to the show. It was good to see
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:47.800]  you this week. Everybody can follow you on Twitter at
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:54.680]  Panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R, and they can read your excellent work and
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:58.760]  the work of your fine staff at techcrunch.com every day.
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:03.080]  Yes, sir. Thank you. Hey, have a good weekend. May the force be
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:10.600]  with you.
