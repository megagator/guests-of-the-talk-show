[00:00.000 --> 00:03.180]  There's a lot going on. Yeah, it's good time to be us
[00:03.880 --> 00:05.880]  Yeah, absolutely. I
[00:06.160 --> 00:08.160]  Don't even know where to start I guess
[00:08.920 --> 00:15.400]  Did I miss anything? I feel like I I had like a I got a weekend list of things. I wanted to write about today and
[00:17.600 --> 00:24.160]  And you know wasn't like extensive I didn't write anything huge I just had a few things we're recording on Monday the 21st and
[00:24.880 --> 00:26.600]  it's like
[00:26.600 --> 00:31.840]  Just like in today. There's like so much new stuff that has come out like and and I
[00:32.480 --> 00:37.480]  Feel like I'm already behind in other words. I was just watching pixel review videos all morning
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.960]  I've hardly even touched the pixel for reviews because I was trying to catch up on the stuff
[00:44.080 --> 00:51.000]  That I wanted to write from over the weekend. Yeah, so I read Dieter bones in the verge didn't watch the video yet. I
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.400]  I don't know. What's the consensus did Dieter's it seemed excellent. It also seemed
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.260]  I'll share my thoughts on it in a second. But what would you what do you take as the consensus?
[01:03.600 --> 01:09.060]  Yeah, so I think the consensus is that it's got you know, still got really good stills
[01:10.120 --> 01:17.080]  Disappointing video the battery life, especially in the small one was bad enough that a few people couldn't recommend it just based on that alone
[01:17.080 --> 01:24.360]  and it it it seemed like I think there was a lot of spoilers that went out before the event and
[01:24.960 --> 01:28.100]  People were expecting more than the spoilers and they didn't get it
[01:28.100 --> 01:32.600]  They got slightly less and the project solely was this huge cool
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.440]  You'd be able to twist your fingers in midair and do things and right now you just wave at your phone
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.760]  So it's like partially a tech demo, but it didn't seem like anyone was that blown away by it this year
[01:41.760 --> 01:48.240]  Yeah, I guess I mean it's the it's the it's almost like an
[01:49.320 --> 01:54.960]  Interesting experiment in pre leaking as much detail as you can, you know
[01:54.960 --> 01:58.080]  and what is that what does the effect going to have on a
[01:59.640 --> 02:01.640]  Reaction, you know, I mean and you can
[02:03.260 --> 02:07.000]  You know you and I are gonna see this through iPhone colored glasses
[02:08.040 --> 02:10.040]  Just from our perspective
[02:10.040 --> 02:12.040]  But you know, there's often
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.360]  When stuff leaks about Apple stuff, there's sometimes an undercurrent of well who cares?
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.080]  It's all just hype. Oh, yeah, or the the conspiracy theory of
[02:23.880 --> 02:31.440]  You know that every leak that proves accurate must have been delivered on Apple's part and they they drip drip drip these leaks out
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.120]  As a way of increasing hype
[02:34.560 --> 02:36.360]  Which is not true
[02:36.360 --> 02:43.240]  Yeah, absolutely not true. And I think part of it is the I think part of it is just personal
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.120]  I really do think that that from Schiller and Jaws on down
[02:48.360 --> 02:51.840]  In Apple, there's just a personal desire to keep this stuff
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.320]  Secret and Steve, you know and and the DNA the company is shaped by its founder, you know, Steve Jobs
[02:57.880 --> 03:05.840]  Absolutely, whether you could have mathematically proven to him that there was financial value to be had in pre leaking stuff
[03:05.840 --> 03:08.320]  He would have said to hell with it. I'm only gonna goddamn thing
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.880]  I want to tell people about it on stage
[03:09.880 --> 03:12.240]  So part of it is personality wise and part of it though
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.320]  I think is that it is the correct PR strategy to surprise people and and to have features come out
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.480]  To have the first impression of the the the features be
[03:25.600 --> 03:32.500]  What you want that first impression to be as the company releasing it as opposed to some random leakers perspective on it
[03:32.500 --> 03:34.500]  Which may or may not be?
[03:34.500 --> 03:36.060]  positive
[03:36.060 --> 03:39.660]  Yeah, and also the talking point after all the events is oh there was no surprises
[03:40.180 --> 03:44.580]  Sort of like reading the script to Star Wars and then complaining you didn't get surprises in the movie
[03:44.700 --> 03:50.860]  but that ends up being the buzz after the event and this one the Android events are weird to me just coming from an
[03:50.860 --> 03:57.260]  Apple background because more and more and I think Google maybe for the first time the event starts and then the hands-on
[03:57.300 --> 03:59.300]  Embargo drops because they bring people in
[03:59.300 --> 04:05.100]  before the event even to show them the phone and they shoot video and then they put up their videos and I don't know what
[04:05.100 --> 04:10.100]  To watch like I'm watching the event and I see like a like an MKB HD video come out or a verge video come out
[04:10.100 --> 04:14.520]  And then I don't know where to put my attention anymore. And I think it makes it harder to follow the the events
[04:16.660 --> 04:18.980]  Yeah, I think so too
[04:20.260 --> 04:25.220]  Did you didn't go to the pixel event, right? No, I had my colleagues go but I did order one
[04:25.220 --> 04:31.740]  I ordered the orange one during the event. I ordered the white one and nice in the process of selling my pixel 3
[04:32.580 --> 04:33.860]  Which is in mint condition
[04:33.860 --> 04:40.100]  I have to say I did keep it in a case most of the year mainly because it was always sort of a secondary camera and
[04:40.100 --> 04:41.020]  so
[04:41.020 --> 04:45.220]  but there were you know were you know, and I'm I don't baby my iPhones, but you know
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.020]  the one of the knocks against last year's pixel 3 was that the
[04:48.020 --> 04:54.780]  The matte finish glass was easily scratched that you know as easily scratched as
[04:55.500 --> 04:58.220]  Like your fingernail and people would be like, well, that's not scratch
[04:58.220 --> 05:03.460]  That's just calcium from your fingernail rubbing off and people were like no no, no, it's actually the glass
[05:03.460 --> 05:07.820]  I don't know big one or the small one. No, I always get the small one because I tried to I
[05:08.820 --> 05:11.020]  Tried to as best as I can
[05:11.620 --> 05:12.500]  by the one
[05:12.500 --> 05:15.580]  you know that I would get if I were going to use it and
[05:15.580 --> 05:18.620]  I you know, I still prefer the smaller of the iPhone
[05:20.140 --> 05:24.300]  10 series phones and I still would prefer the
[05:25.140 --> 05:28.380]  smaller pixel 4 now again, I saw the initial
[05:29.340 --> 05:33.900]  Reviews, you know even Dieter's not even I don't mean that that Dieter pointed out
[05:33.900 --> 05:36.600]  I mean in the even in the sense that I've only read one
[05:37.060 --> 05:42.300]  Yeah, even the one review I read which happens to be Dieter's mentions that has it very, you know
[05:42.300 --> 05:47.620]  It gives it gives a different rating to both phones and and one of the reasons that the XL gets a better rating is that?
[05:47.620 --> 05:48.900]  the battery is
[05:48.900 --> 05:52.740]  Average in his terms. Whereas the battery life on the smaller one is poor
[05:53.900 --> 05:59.180]  Site for the first time said that they couldn't recommend the small pixel just based on but I don't remember them ever not recommending a
[05:59.180 --> 06:02.100]  Pixel before I don't know why
[06:03.100 --> 06:05.100]  The battery life is worse though
[06:05.900 --> 06:10.420]  I'm not quite sure given how limited my my review depth is
[06:10.420 --> 06:14.740]  Are people saying it's worse than the pixel 3 smaller one last year and if so
[06:14.740 --> 06:20.680]  I can't understand why it's worse because I pixel 3 was terrible. The pixel 4 is a small battery
[06:20.680 --> 06:24.500]  But also they have a 90 Hertz display, which is sucking down more power
[06:24.500 --> 06:29.840]  Yeah, I'm doing a lot more of the ML on device which is sucking down more power. Yeah, those might be the explanations
[06:29.840 --> 06:35.960]  I thought that the battery life on the pixel 3 was fine and you know using mostly using the camera which should be a battery
[06:35.960 --> 06:38.260]  you know a draw because the displays on and
[06:38.260 --> 06:45.780]  Yeah, it's reading and writing but we'll see what I think about the pixel 4 but I bought the white one because I
[06:47.420 --> 06:53.940]  Bought the black one last year and it was too it's too hard to tell apart from all my black eye
[06:55.180 --> 06:58.740]  and so I I needed to buy a color that would be
[06:59.860 --> 07:05.020]  Easily distinguishable while they're in front of me and because I wind up doing things
[07:05.020 --> 07:08.700]  it's more than just like two phones side-by-side like when the
[07:09.660 --> 07:11.060]  I
[07:11.060 --> 07:17.820]  Mean, I'm just a mess in September and October really. I'm just sort of coming down from it because I'm testing
[07:18.620 --> 07:21.100]  multiple new iPhones now from Apple and
[07:21.780 --> 07:25.700]  And I you know, as I mentioned talking to Ben Thompson
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.420]  on my last episode of this show, I really didn't even spend much time with the
[07:30.420 --> 07:37.860]  The 11 Pro Max just because I I did enough to trust to verify
[07:38.180 --> 07:42.980]  That Apple what Apple was saying that this is the same phone just bigger and once I verified it
[07:42.980 --> 07:48.940]  Then all I did was test the 11 and the 11 Pro because it's just too much, but I've still got it out
[07:48.940 --> 07:53.940]  It's laying around on my desk, you know, so I've got like new three two or three new iPhones
[07:53.940 --> 07:58.660]  I've got my year-old iPhone that I'm using as like a baseline to measure year over year
[07:58.660 --> 08:03.940]  And then I've just got the pixel three out to like measure. Well, how's this night sight compared with their night sight, etc?
[08:04.140 --> 08:06.620]  So you're having them all be black was just terrible
[08:07.060 --> 08:08.180]  So I got the white one
[08:08.180 --> 08:13.740]  I think it has a nice stormtrooper II look which is what I sort of think about like the addition
[08:14.340 --> 08:17.180]  Apple watch the the ceramic edition Apple watch
[08:19.540 --> 08:23.740]  And I it's funny like the orange seems to be
[08:23.740 --> 08:30.060]  In certain photographs, I love orange and black I went to a high school with colors that were orange and black
[08:30.060 --> 08:33.780]  I think orange and black are underrated colors on sports teams. I
[08:34.500 --> 08:37.220]  Do I think they go very well together? Yeah, they do
[08:39.060 --> 08:44.100]  They're the colors I use for vector it's it's a underused combination I really like it
[08:44.100 --> 08:49.380]  I think you know, I've orange is sometimes difficult to get right and but when you do it can look great
[08:49.380 --> 08:54.620]  But I there's sort of a different photograph show the orange in different light, you know
[08:54.620 --> 08:58.420]  Some of them look a lot more coral and some of them don't look coral at all
[08:58.540 --> 09:01.580]  And I don't really care for coral so I didn't go that way. I got white
[09:01.580 --> 09:03.020]  I'm just a sucker for new color
[09:03.020 --> 09:08.300]  So I'll almost always get whatever color is new the thing that surprised me in Dieter's review though is what you know
[09:08.300 --> 09:14.500]  Google made that big pitch about they have the pixel neural core now and they can do live preview and what I didn't realize it
[09:14.500 --> 09:21.900]  Was just for HDR plus and I really wanted it for portrait mode. Yeah, and then Dieter responded on Twitter that Google
[09:21.900 --> 09:26.580]  Doesn't think that preview on portrait mode is any good and a mutual friend Matthew fans
[09:26.580 --> 09:32.180]  We know if TechCrunch had a mini a mini stroke episode Twitter right after that. I see I missed all of this
[09:32.180 --> 09:35.140]  This is all context that I have missed. I
[09:35.660 --> 09:39.300]  do know I did that is an interesting philosophical difference between
[09:39.300 --> 09:46.140]  Google's internal pixel camera team and Apple's and Apple real Apple's internal team is
[09:46.660 --> 09:51.620]  Very very keen about doing everything live and it's religious
[09:51.620 --> 09:56.340]  Yeah, and in fact that makes the exception that is deep fusion
[09:57.440 --> 10:03.960]  Notable, even though it's in my testing. It seems to be well under a second
[10:04.500 --> 10:06.660]  usually but noticeable like
[10:06.660 --> 10:10.460]  Long longer enough that you wouldn't call it instantaneous
[10:10.460 --> 10:14.980]  But generally less than a second and you can sort of see a little update in the you know
[10:14.980 --> 10:20.240]  You snap your picture the deep focus post-processing takes place and then the preview little
[10:21.020 --> 10:23.120]  Avatar icon whatever you want to call it updates
[10:25.860 --> 10:28.140]  So that's not live in the camera
[10:28.140 --> 10:32.180]  But just about everything else is and and Apple even goes to great lengths now
[10:32.180 --> 10:39.940]  They can't it's it's Matt, you know, the definition of the feature means that night night night mode is can't be done
[10:39.940 --> 10:43.820]  Live because it's it's a multiple second exposure from when you begin it
[10:44.020 --> 10:48.660]  So without the ability to travel into the future a few seconds
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.080]  There's no way to do it
[10:50.080 --> 10:58.020]  But yet that the lie what you do see in the viewfinder on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro for night mode is
[10:58.020 --> 11:05.120]  is a remarkably close to what you end up getting yeah, I don't not quite sure even how they do that whereas that is
[11:05.860 --> 11:09.900]  Absolutely been I don't have a pixel for yet and and I've pre-ordered will be here soon
[11:09.900 --> 11:16.820]  But the pixel 3 as much as they deserve kudos for their night sight last year the live version of it was garbage
[11:17.060 --> 11:18.100]  Yes
[11:18.100 --> 11:19.460]  Yeah, it was really bad
[11:19.460 --> 11:21.820]  I mean you really for portrait mode because I can
[11:22.020 --> 11:24.380]  With it if it's messing around with the glasses or the ears
[11:24.380 --> 11:29.460]  I can just move it a little bit and it fixes it before I waste time taking photos. You could use it for
[11:30.340 --> 11:35.260]  Composition, but it was absolutely useless in terms of finding out
[11:35.320 --> 11:42.260]  What is what is the end result going to look like now that it was it better to have the feature than not have it
[11:42.260 --> 11:44.260]  Sure, you know it
[11:44.300 --> 11:47.420]  But I can also see why and that state Apple wouldn't have shipped it
[11:47.420 --> 11:54.820]  Apple would say that's that's not ready to go because we want it to be a reasonable representation. Uh, anyway
[11:54.820 --> 11:56.820]  I thought that the whole framing of
[11:57.420 --> 12:04.620]  Dieter's review my take on the pixel all along ever since they they rebooted their internal
[12:05.020 --> 12:10.300]  This this is the Google and this is Google's Android phone from the Nexus line to the pixel line
[12:10.300 --> 12:15.900]  And I think it's worth treating as a new line like they changed
[12:15.900 --> 12:19.980]  Philosophically in my opinion not just it wasn't just in
[12:20.580 --> 12:22.500]  Rose by any other name
[12:22.500 --> 12:25.100]  Like they took a lot more in-house
[12:25.740 --> 12:32.420]  It really wasn't it's the pixel phones are a lot more than just pure Android which is what the Nexus phones were
[12:33.180 --> 12:39.400]  They really are Google's version of Android by taking Android and googling it up with extra degrees
[12:40.220 --> 12:42.980]  I've always felt that at a basic level
[12:42.980 --> 12:44.980]  the pixels are
[12:47.380 --> 12:50.580]  Android phones for people who like iPhone hardware
[12:51.740 --> 12:55.060]  That it's not that they're copies, you know
[12:55.060 --> 13:00.100]  But they are the pixel phones have always been a lot more iPhone like putting aside
[13:00.900 --> 13:06.740]  What you see in the software, which is the iOS versus Android, but just treating them as hardware devices
[13:08.500 --> 13:11.620]  Boy they're very iPhone like their iPhone like in dimension
[13:11.620 --> 13:15.060]  their iPhone like in feel sort of
[13:15.940 --> 13:24.180]  Varying the earlier ones were very similar in design. Yeah, you know, they've always put the camera in the upper left corner of the back
[13:25.220 --> 13:31.620]  Which seems like a little thing but an awful especially three four years ago a lot of high-end Android phones still had the camera centered
[13:31.940 --> 13:36.500]  In the back many of them still do they still do, you know, and that those are all you know, uh,
[13:36.500 --> 13:43.380]  You know diff, but it's just you know at a basic level. It just sort of looks like boy if you could just run iPhone on an
[13:44.180 --> 13:46.180]  Android on an iPhone
[13:46.260 --> 13:48.660]  That's sort of the pixel aesthetic
[13:49.140 --> 13:55.380]  so for me, they've always been curious because my understanding is that there was a sort of a shake-up in Google leadership and
[13:56.420 --> 13:59.140]  One of the people in charge really wanted an iPhone
[13:59.140 --> 14:04.660]  They just wanted Google to have an iPhone and they started putting a lot of the elements in place from the back
[14:04.660 --> 14:11.700]  They started putting a lot of the elements in place from internal design groups. They bought HTC. Well, they brought HTC design inside in-house
[14:12.340 --> 14:13.780]  They started working on their own silicon
[14:13.780 --> 14:17.380]  They started doing a lot of things to make an iPhone but at the same time
[14:17.940 --> 14:22.020]  They never made the same kind of choices Apple would like they never or even Huawei or Samsung
[14:22.020 --> 14:27.220]  They never put great camera hardware on there because they figured their camera software was so great
[14:27.460 --> 14:32.340]  They could do with it, you know a less capable camera and they would you know, they had a lot of trouble with screens
[14:32.340 --> 14:37.860]  They didn't make the manufacturing choices that Apple would make but they still sort of wanted an iPhone
[14:38.260 --> 14:41.860]  And then over the last year some of those initiatives didn't really work out the way they hoped
[14:42.100 --> 14:48.020]  So now it just feels like they want a platform to showcase the best of Google algorithms and software
[14:49.540 --> 14:54.420]  Oh and they're definitely keen on the camera angle. I mean, there's no doubt about it and they deserve it but
[14:56.420 --> 14:58.420]  You know you it
[14:58.420 --> 15:03.460]  Sort of feels this year too. And again, I didn't read all the reviews. So I'm not sure what what they're gonna say
[15:03.460 --> 15:07.940]  but it it seems like yet last year was a real high point for
[15:08.580 --> 15:10.580]  their ability to do stuff
[15:12.340 --> 15:13.380]  Computationally
[15:13.380 --> 15:19.620]  You know night sight in particular would be the the shining and super zoom was another good example super zoom was another good example
[15:20.220 --> 15:26.580]  Where they do digital zoom, but by taking multiple exposures and running it through a neural net
[15:26.580 --> 15:27.780]  and
[15:27.780 --> 15:29.940]  It's a great to me. It's a great example of
[15:30.740 --> 15:34.420]  how this AI stuff really does deserve to be treated as a
[15:35.260 --> 15:37.000]  different sort of
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.140]  computing yeah than
[15:42.420 --> 15:48.620]  You know what I mean, it's it's yes, it's like there's all sorts of algorithms that are supposed to make things seem smarter
[15:48.700 --> 15:52.220]  You know, is it AI no not in a classical sense, you know
[15:52.220 --> 15:57.260]  But using a more efficient sorting algorithm when you have to sort something if it makes you know
[15:57.260 --> 16:04.560]  Your spreadsheet faster when you're reordering 10,000 columns of data by having a more efficient sort algorithm
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.580]  You know, that's just classic computer science of being faster stuff like this. Whereas
[16:09.540 --> 16:14.980]  The way that they're doing the super zoom isn't really a human thinking
[16:14.980 --> 16:20.140]  Well, if this pixel is this color and this next pixel in it in a tenth of a second later
[16:20.140 --> 16:28.340]  exposure is within 9% then do this and that it really is just sort of feeding this into a machine learning model and
[16:29.140 --> 16:32.700]  You know by telling it this looks better this looks worse and then you feed these
[16:33.140 --> 16:36.820]  Things in there all of a sudden they come out with a way to very quickly
[16:38.060 --> 16:40.060]  Using the end of the dedicated chips for this
[16:40.740 --> 16:47.900]  Do a digital zoom that is just seemingly way way better than you could expect to get out of a digital zoom
[16:47.900 --> 16:49.900]  Yes, absolutely
[16:50.460 --> 16:57.060]  But it feels like this year. They're on a downside even though they've added, you know extra hardware by adding a
[16:57.780 --> 17:00.760]  2x telephoto lens and going beyond one
[17:02.340 --> 17:05.140]  Camera lens on the back so they've definitely added hardware
[17:05.260 --> 17:08.980]  It just feels like this is a down year for their sort of will
[17:09.340 --> 17:15.580]  Will do most most of the benefit will come from our computational stuff and we don't have to worry so much about the actual hardware
[17:15.580 --> 17:16.560]  like
[17:16.560 --> 17:19.220]  Ideally you want both and I feel like absolutely
[17:20.100 --> 17:22.860]  Because you also mean you can tweak solid Apple is adding
[17:24.460 --> 17:30.860]  Deep fusion and they can tweak battery algorithms and they can tweak but you can't go to everybody's house and put a better
[17:31.080 --> 17:32.300]  Camera system on their phone
[17:32.300 --> 17:35.620]  You can't go to everybody's house and stick a bigger battery and you need a baseline
[17:35.820 --> 17:40.520]  The better the hardware the better the software is gonna work and that's the balance. They seem to be struggling with
[17:40.520 --> 17:47.960]  And you know and Apple is really doing some impressive stuff with video. I mean and that's always been the
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.560]  The weak spot Android wide but pixel in particular, you know that the video stuff just how it you know
[17:54.560 --> 18:00.960]  Whatever you want to wherever you want to argue they rank on still mobile phone photography on video it
[18:01.440 --> 18:03.440]  Everything from Android is way behind
[18:04.160 --> 18:06.080]  iPhone I
[18:06.080 --> 18:08.080]  mean nobody else does
[18:08.080 --> 18:12.600]  The 4k 60 yet or maybe with some I think Samsung done
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.880]  Yeah, maybe something they do the interleaved extended dynamic range. Yeah, I put an asterisk there and it's okay
[18:17.880 --> 18:19.880]  Maybe they do but it's not great
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.080]  Like you pointed I got it from you and gave you credit when I linked to it, but Jonathan Morrison, you know, well-known
[18:25.680 --> 18:27.320]  Yeah
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.200]  Twitter or not Twitter, but YouTube personality
[18:30.200 --> 18:36.760]  Who does great work and usually shoots with you know, really truly professional camera rig? Yeah
[18:37.880 --> 18:45.520]  An Arri Alexa mini which is like I think $85,000. It's just you know, as good as it gets. Yeah, you know, it's super pro
[18:47.080 --> 18:53.120]  Filmmaker style kit had a video with his first thoughts on the pixel 4 and he shot the whole thing
[18:53.120 --> 19:01.120]  Not just with the iPhone 11, but with the iPhone 11 front-facing camera, and it's clearly 60 frames per second
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.680]  It probably clearly 4k, but I looked at it on a 13 inch Mac book
[19:06.680 --> 19:13.000]  So, I don't know if I could I'm not a hundred percent sure that I could peg moving video is 4k versus 1080 on a screen
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.960]  That's ice but you can definitely tell 60 frames per second. Yeah
[19:16.640 --> 19:17.800]  and
[19:17.800 --> 19:19.800]  You know just totally
[19:19.800 --> 19:22.200]  I if I didn't know in advance
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.960]  I don't think I would have guessed and and then at the very end of his video
[19:24.960 --> 19:30.880]  He had some like meta shots showing him shooting at showing that he shot it with the front-facing camera. Like I don't see how
[19:31.560 --> 19:36.560]  He was joking on Twitter when Google announced that he's at there the iPhone selfie camera now shoots better video than the main
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.720]  Camera on the pixel it really does. I mean, it's actually I mean at least by some measure
[19:41.720 --> 19:45.400]  There may be some ways that the that the bigger sensor on the rear-facing camera
[19:45.400 --> 19:52.920]  there might be some scenarios where you get better video on the rear-facing you have really good like their algorithms for color and balance and for
[19:54.120 --> 19:56.920]  Stabilization are amazing like they have again amazing algorithms
[19:56.920 --> 20:02.640]  But today I think they put out a statement saying they didn't do 60 frames per second because they thought they thought it was a waste
[20:02.640 --> 20:04.000]  It was too much storage
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.380]  And that's my biggest problem with pixel in general is that Google doesn't have a strong opinion
[20:08.480 --> 20:13.000]  They in the first pixel they said we don't need a camera bump second year like oh, we need a camera bump
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.200]  We don't need new camera. We don't need two cameras
[20:15.200 --> 20:18.560]  Oh, we need two cameras, but we don't need a wide angle and you just know next year
[20:18.560 --> 20:23.960]  They're gonna add a wide angle and it's the same we have a we have a chin and a forehead because we want to front-facing
[20:23.960 --> 20:25.960]  Speakers that's really important to us and this year
[20:25.960 --> 20:30.340]  they put the speaker right where the iPhones is and it it feels like they sort of go halfway and then
[20:30.480 --> 20:34.180]  rationalize it and then change their mind the next year and I just want them to be super
[20:34.400 --> 20:37.360]  opinionated about what they want a phone to be yeah, I
[20:38.480 --> 20:43.200]  Would have I would have encouraged them to go notchless last year as well
[20:43.200 --> 20:48.680]  Yeah, like I feel like what they've done this year where they instead of having a notch it
[20:49.280 --> 20:54.900]  Just goes across the top and so there's you know in that chin forehead terms. They have have a forehead
[20:55.720 --> 21:01.520]  small by historical forehead sizes, but still a forehead that's effectively the height of
[21:02.120 --> 21:09.400]  You know what a notch would be on an iPhone 10 or any of the other phones that have curiously come out with notches since
[21:09.400 --> 21:11.400]  the iPhone 10
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.760]  It
[21:12.760 --> 21:19.000]  Has a bit of a chin but not it's not anywhere close to the height of the forehead so iPhones have always
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.680]  Been symmetrically designed so that when you hold them sideways the chin if it has a chin and forehead it it
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.560]  Matches and if it doesn't have a chin or forehead, it's the same bezel size all the way around
[21:30.440 --> 21:32.240]  I
[21:32.240 --> 21:38.360]  Think that that's a better design than the weird ugly-ass notch that that the pixels had last year
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.360]  And last year the notch was only on the bigger one the smaller one didn't have a notch
[21:42.360 --> 21:44.440]  So like did they have an opinion on notches, right?
[21:44.440 --> 21:48.160]  Did they do one with a notch just because they wanted to support it in Android and figured they had to do it themselves
[21:48.160 --> 21:50.520]  I don't understand their opinion still
[21:50.520 --> 21:55.760]  Yeah, and they obviously didn't spend a lot of work last year on the corner radius of the rounded off
[21:56.920 --> 22:00.200]  Sort of like a first pass shibbit and this year it's gestures
[22:00.200 --> 22:04.080]  I mean, they're sort of like the iPhone but they don't work the same as the I'm and they just end up confusing
[22:04.080 --> 22:08.180]  It's it's always a little bit of halfway. Yeah, I gotta say I'm not I mean
[22:08.180 --> 22:10.580]  I'll try and I want to prejudge it but the
[22:11.300 --> 22:15.240]  The what they're doing the radar stuff with does not interest me really
[22:15.240 --> 22:20.920]  I don't really I can't imagine I it's so they have a feature now that you can wave your hand without
[22:20.920 --> 22:24.400]  Touching the phone and do a couple things one of them is sense
[22:24.400 --> 22:29.980]  You can fast forward tracks if music is playing by just passing your hand over it
[22:31.120 --> 22:32.840]  you can
[22:32.840 --> 22:41.320]  it the useful one seems to be that it'll sense when your hand gets near and fire up their face recognition sensors
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.360]  So that before you're even pointing it at your face
[22:44.800 --> 22:49.240]  they're already looking because they know your hand has entered, you know, the little sphere of
[22:50.040 --> 22:52.040]  three-dimensional space above the phone and
[22:52.040 --> 22:58.920]  I guess you can tickle your Pokemon or something on your home screen by just waving at it, which really seems weird
[22:58.920 --> 23:04.000]  Is that the whole thing in there was odd to me, too? I think it's a good idea to warm up the camera
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.180]  if it detects you but
[23:05.180 --> 23:11.700]  Apple had the iPhone 11 event and they have a u1 chip in the iPhone 11 and they didn't mention it because there's no compelling
[23:12.120 --> 23:16.480]  User-facing feature yet on their product page at the bottom. It says yeah, it'll help you with airdrop
[23:16.480 --> 23:21.480]  But the the obvious front face the also a the obvious computer consumer facing feature hasn't shipped yet
[23:21.480 --> 23:29.240]  So they stayed mum where with this it feels like they don't it's nothing like the early demos early demo showed people doing very fine-grained
[23:29.880 --> 23:33.800]  Controls of radios video and all these things and none of that is ready
[23:33.800 --> 23:39.800]  So I would have just completely downplayed it just not mentioned it very much at all and everyone left being disappointed
[23:39.800 --> 23:41.920]  Like oh, it wasn't as good as the demo, right?
[23:41.920 --> 23:46.800]  It was the their their white papers on the technology or I don't know if that's their official term
[23:46.800 --> 23:49.280]  but they've you know, they've talked about the technology for years and
[23:49.280 --> 23:55.240]  And they make it sound as though it's as fine-grained as like the touchscreen itself, right?
[23:55.240 --> 23:59.240]  So like in the way showing it. Yeah, so like, you know you can
[23:59.920 --> 24:06.040]  If you're adjusting the volume on your phone by using the slider and your finger and you have this incredible fine-grained control
[24:06.440 --> 24:10.480]  They're showing it that you could just hold your finger above the phone and get the same thing
[24:10.480 --> 24:12.480]  Whereas all they really have here is simple
[24:13.120 --> 24:18.480]  Broad-stroke fast-forward next track which aren't working consistently if you look at the reviewers somewhere
[24:18.480 --> 24:20.560]  I think Marquez was saying it worked 10% at first
[24:20.560 --> 24:26.240]  He's figured out how to make it work 60% of the time and that's not a flagship feature. No, but that's terrible
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.360]  I think anything that's less than 100% is terrible and it gets me to I
[24:30.680 --> 24:34.160]  Mean I have complaints about Apple stuff that works like that. Yeah, you know same
[24:35.720 --> 24:37.720]  Trying to think of of a good one
[24:39.800 --> 24:45.960]  I mean a lot of the stuff with iOS 13 is just still kind of busted. Yeah, I'm trying to think of it
[24:45.960 --> 24:48.600]  I have off the top of my head. I can't think of it, but
[24:49.120 --> 24:55.300]  Maybe some some Apple TV type interactions are pretty good. Like it's it I even though I use Apple TV all the time
[24:55.820 --> 24:58.960]  Me using that little remote to move the selection around the screen
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.120]  I'm still not as precise as I think I should be that's a that's for example one
[25:03.120 --> 25:09.520]  You know one example a big one for me on Apple TV is apparently the longer you press it's whether it'll shoot you back to
[25:09.760 --> 25:13.720]  The episode selector or all the way back to the screen and I could never get that right
[25:13.720 --> 25:16.200]  So I would just always try to go no wrong episode try to go back
[25:16.200 --> 25:21.480]  I'm back on the home screen play the episode again on back on the home screen. It was like a random frustration generator
[25:21.480 --> 25:23.880]  Oh, I could think of a good example. A good example is the
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.760]  Keyboard problems people are having on MacBooks. Yeah, where even if your keyboard isn't completely failed like if it's just that like, you know
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.080]  one time out of 50 you'd hit the e key and get
[25:36.880 --> 25:42.120]  Two E's instead of one E and it's only one out of 50. That's terrible. That's absolutely unacceptable
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.400]  It has to be every time like when you click an OK button in the dialogue. It has to click every time
[25:46.640 --> 25:47.120]  Yeah
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.920]  So like trying to do next track with a gesture and the gesture only works 60% of the time that
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.080]  You'll you'll I mean 60% is so low that you'll stop using the feature
[25:57.080 --> 26:02.600]  There's no way even just like Siri still like if I tell it to call my mom 9 out of 10 times is perfect the 10th
[26:02.600 --> 26:04.600]  time it recommends a
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.480]  Sorry veterinarian, yeah cross town from me. Yeah, you have learned helplessness
[26:09.480 --> 26:14.200]  Yeah, Siri's a perfect example of that too where there's two and there's just stuff and and to me the bar
[26:14.400 --> 26:17.320]  for that is a little bit different than
[26:18.160 --> 26:19.880]  a
[26:19.880 --> 26:26.720]  Physical UI right like a button that you tap on a touchscreen or click on a mouse driven interface
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.400]  Or a keyboard shortcut you invoke to do it is is very very
[26:33.400 --> 26:41.520]  Very it's provable whether it worked or didn't work exactly as expected in that with the latency you expect
[26:42.280 --> 26:45.120]  Whereas the Siri stuff is always going to be a little
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.280]  Nebulous as to you know that where the edge conditions lie, but for the most part to me
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.420]  I think that the standards by which we should judge Siri and the similar voice assistants is basically
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.200]  What if you hired a college kid to be your intern?
[27:01.200 --> 27:07.680]  Yes, you would you expect them to understand what you just said and if you you know, so if you hired
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.400]  Somebody to be your assistant and follow you around and you're like you wanted to call your mom and you don't want to touch
[27:14.400 --> 27:16.760]  The phone you're like get my mom on the phone, right?
[27:16.760 --> 27:23.360]  You expect your mother to be on the phone every single time you don't expect to have like a pizza place open up
[27:24.920 --> 27:27.540]  Joanna's video for the pixel this morning
[27:27.540 --> 27:29.540]  Uh
[27:30.460 --> 27:32.240]  Yeah with the speed talker
[27:32.240 --> 27:38.300]  Yeah, she's always so creative with those videos and she put the because the new Google voice recorder also transcribes, right?
[27:38.300 --> 27:40.140]  so of course she got someone with
[27:40.140 --> 27:44.600]  With a Scottish accent with the West Indian accent with a German accent Atlantic
[27:44.600 --> 27:48.920]  Yeah, maybe we're Australian or something and the world's fastest talker and just let them all loose
[27:49.140 --> 27:55.720]  Yeah, the world's fastest talker or fastest woman talker. I'm not quite sure if she has the the record but that was
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.360]  that I was just cruel, but
[28:00.760 --> 28:06.200]  Yeah, I will yeah and yeah, she had a court a professional court stenographer there does like the the Paul Bunyan
[28:06.680 --> 28:07.720]  Yeah
[28:07.720 --> 28:12.280]  The real-life flesh-and-blood alternative. Anyway, that is a killer feature
[28:12.280 --> 28:18.880]  I have to say for me personally as somebody who occasionally somewhat occasionally needs or wants transcription boy. That's a fantastic feature
[28:18.880 --> 28:26.840]  That I wish I hope the iPhone can follow as quickly as possible the clips does a little bit of that
[28:26.840 --> 28:29.040]  So hopefully Apple can flesh that out into a full-fledged
[28:29.320 --> 28:29.920]  Yeah
[28:29.920 --> 28:32.280]  but something like that you if you have an
[28:32.440 --> 28:37.440]  On-the-record meeting as somebody in the press or if you're a student and you want to record a lecture or something
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.600]  You know that you can that if you can hear it and understand it your iPhone can hear it and transcribe it
[28:43.040 --> 28:47.240]  And hopefully that was baffling for me is that they Google if they have the brand new Google assistant
[28:47.240 --> 28:50.320]  It's only available in the US for now, which you know that happens. That's fine
[28:50.400 --> 28:52.840]  but if you have a Google Apps account
[28:53.320 --> 28:58.900]  Doesn't matter if it's first account second account if you just as long if you have one on the system will not work
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.500]  What if you yeah, if you have a Gmail account is fine
[29:02.500 --> 29:06.280]  But if you but if you have a Google Apps account or a Gmail account and a Google Apps account
[29:06.280 --> 29:07.880]  The assistant just will not work
[29:07.880 --> 29:09.120]  That's a strange limitation
[29:09.120 --> 29:14.560]  They said they're working on a fix but it always seems like Google Apps accounts which people pay for right way shorter shift than the
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.080]  Gmail account. Wow, that's really weird. And it also seems like the sort of problem you do more expect from Apple, you know
[29:20.080 --> 29:22.080]  Yeah, the various ongoing
[29:22.920 --> 29:29.320]  Problems that those of us with two iTunes accounts. Yeah iCloud accounts, whatever you want to call them Apple IDs
[29:30.200 --> 29:35.760]  Still get you know the afraid here. I don't want to go on a whole sidetrack
[29:35.760 --> 29:42.640]  but basically I among other old the longer you've been using Apple products and more likely are to be in this boat where you
[29:42.640 --> 29:47.240]  Opened up a iTunes store account in the early 2000s
[29:48.080 --> 29:51.800]  with email address a and then later on
[29:52.360 --> 29:56.520]  With mac.com created a mac.com or me.com account
[29:57.360 --> 29:59.800]  To use mac.com features
[29:59.800 --> 30:05.760]  But that's not you're not the same thing you use for iTunes and still lo these many years later in 2019
[30:06.320 --> 30:08.320]  You've still got two separate accounts
[30:08.920 --> 30:10.920]  Because there's no way to merge them
[30:10.920 --> 30:17.360]  Yeah, which I understand would be incredibly complicated and and you know that there's all sorts of edge conditions
[30:17.360 --> 30:22.080]  you could run into there because if I want to I can go to a new machine and log in with my iTunes account and
[30:22.120 --> 30:29.360]  It is an Apple ID so I could use iMessage and note syncing and calendar syncing all from that account from
[30:30.120 --> 30:37.080]  And you know, I'm sure there's some people who are somehow using two different things and so merging them would be complicated
[30:37.080 --> 30:41.120]  You know, yeah on the surface. It sounds like geez
[30:41.120 --> 30:47.280]  Why can't I just say I would like to just use my iCloud account for everything and transfer all the iTunes accounts from this
[30:47.280 --> 30:50.640]  Other account over in a one-time transition and then that's that
[30:51.520 --> 30:53.000]  But I get it that's complicated
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.960]  But anyway living life like that is always a little bit more complicated than the people who have it all in one
[30:57.960 --> 30:59.960]  You don't know how lucky you are if you only have one
[31:01.680 --> 31:03.840]  It's good to know Google has problems like that, too
[31:03.840 --> 31:10.960]  Yeah, anyway, I thought I thought Dieter's basic opening is the the the framing of his of his review
[31:11.520 --> 31:13.520]  read very
[31:13.720 --> 31:16.960]  iPhone II to me as well. So I've always thought that that
[31:17.480 --> 31:20.600]  That the pixels were as a whole the whole project is sort of
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.440]  Google's take on iPhone style hardware with stuff like screens that aren't super saturated
[31:26.760 --> 31:29.680]  less blingy more understated design
[31:29.680 --> 31:37.560]  You know, there is a sort of designed in California look to their stuff too that's different than stuff that's designed in Korea or China
[31:38.360 --> 31:41.320]  Or Japan, you know with some of Sony's very cool stuff
[31:43.720 --> 31:50.320]  Dieter's review though made it almost it almost read like the opening to like what kind of product is he reviewing here?
[31:50.320 --> 31:54.960]  You'd almost think it was an Apple product because it was about how specs don't tell the story of
[31:54.960 --> 31:59.240]  The product and you can't just look at the specs
[31:59.960 --> 32:02.800]  You have to kind of look at the actual experience in it
[32:02.800 --> 32:07.600]  You could say well this phone it doesn't have the fastest processor and it doesn't have the greatest camera hardware
[32:07.680 --> 32:12.040]  But you look at the actual photos you get from it and they look better than yeah
[32:12.040 --> 32:16.960]  Then other ones to other phones that might on on paper seemingly have a better camera
[32:17.680 --> 32:20.640]  No, that's absolutely true Huawei and Samsung both have tremendous
[32:20.640 --> 32:27.040]  Some some of the Nokia stuff tremendous optics on them and they just they junk them up with really bad color science really poor color
[32:27.160 --> 32:30.880]  Management the cameras look different from one system to the other and yeah
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.320]  Or they over blow them with AI what they're called their AI modes and they over saturate them and Google
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.680]  You can art like I think if you look at them you can subjectively choose which one you prefer because at this point
[32:41.680 --> 32:45.480]  They're both so good. It's the artistic choices like Google's tend to look cooler
[32:46.160 --> 32:49.120]  Apples tend to look a little bit warmer. They do different stuff with the details
[32:49.120 --> 32:54.240]  Their semantic rendering is slightly different, but that that is just personal preference at this point. It's amazing
[32:54.240 --> 32:56.240]  We've gotten to the point where it comes down to that
[32:57.080 --> 32:59.880]  Yeah, there's definitely you can definitely see the different internal
[33:01.480 --> 33:03.480]  Aesthetic choices in there. Yeah
[33:06.560 --> 33:11.960]  So what else with the pixel I had another thought oh, I guess we could talk about the
[33:13.240 --> 33:17.360]  the lens decisions, why don't we hold on to that though, and I'll do the first sponsor break and
[33:17.360 --> 33:20.360]  Tell you about our good friends at
[33:21.760 --> 33:29.000]  Away away makes excellent carry-on and larger suitcases
[33:31.080 --> 33:38.080]  They've considered all sorts of travelers and with their carry-on now offering two sizes with an optional ejectable battery
[33:38.480 --> 33:43.360]  You can find a carry-on suitcase that will suit your needs and your lifestyle perfectly
[33:43.360 --> 33:49.140]  They've got two two body types their signature polycarbonate and the fancier
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.080]  Anodized aluminum and both are guaranteed for life. Their suitcases are lightweight
[33:55.080 --> 34:01.900]  The polycarbonate is very very durable. The aluminum of course is durable. Everybody knows that the qualities of aluminum
[34:02.960 --> 34:10.260]  the removable battery is just a game-changer for me because it is it just turns out that the top of your carry-on suitcase is like
[34:10.260 --> 34:13.460]  Just the best place to keep a big
[34:14.880 --> 34:16.880]  TSA compliant
[34:17.240 --> 34:21.540]  Battery right there whoever thought we'd be charging our suitcases, but there you are
[34:21.540 --> 34:24.880]  But anyway, that's the battery that they include is so so capable
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.000]  I think it has five times of a rate and I find iPhone charge
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.480]  You don't really it's not you have to charge your suitcase every time you leave I charge it like once or twice a year
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.600]  That's it. And then every time I'm waiting in an airport
[34:34.600 --> 34:41.360]  I've got two USB ports right there on top of my suitcase to charge me and one of my traveling companions
[34:41.640 --> 34:48.000]  Devices right there while we wait no more hunting in the airport for one of like three seats that happen to be next to a
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.840]  Power outlet no more being the dirty bum and the sitting on the floor of the airport
[34:52.840 --> 34:55.920]  Just because it's right there next to an outlet charge it from anywhere
[34:57.080 --> 35:00.640]  Inside the suitcases. They have an internal compression system lets you pack more
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.680]  Sounds like BS, but it's actually true. It's it's really a great way
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.720]  They've got a little section there where you can put folded up shirts cinch them down with like a hard panel
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.760]  Very easy and then you get to where you're going and your shirts aren't all wrinkled up
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.320]  The wheels on the suitcases are fantastic
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.640]  Really durable. I've had one as long as you can remember a way sponsoring this show. They sent me a suitcase way back when
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.840]  Mine still feels and looks like brand-new. It is a mate. It truly their durability is not to be underestimated
[35:31.080 --> 35:35.960]  So we've got a couple of them now in the house. They all look great. I've got my original still looks brand-new
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.960]  No interest in upgrading or changing. I don't need to what why would I do that? It still looks brand-new
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.400]  I take it everywhere I go. I really love it. Here's the deal. They have for talk show listeners 20 bucks
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.800]  Save 20 bucks by going to away travel comm slash talk show 20
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.880]  And just use that same promo code talk show 20 ta lks a joe w2 zero and
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.800]  Use it during checkout. You'll save 20 bucks. That's a way travel comm slash talk show 20
[36:07.040 --> 36:09.040]  Really great product love it
[36:11.280 --> 36:13.840]  So there was a story another story at the verge
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.720]  I think it was like right after the iPhone 11 events by Sam Byford
[36:18.720 --> 36:25.760]  it was like I think literally said that that Apple needs to needed to catch up to Android this year
[36:26.520 --> 36:28.520]  on the camera and
[36:28.960 --> 36:36.240]  it's taken as a point it had been taken as a point of just fact for like the last year that the pixel 3 was a
[36:36.240 --> 36:41.360]  Better camera than the iPhone 10s. I was writing that a lot as well
[36:42.160 --> 36:43.600]  and I
[36:43.600 --> 36:50.080]  Disagree, I really do and you know, I might say, you know, neil
[36:50.080 --> 36:55.440]  I talked about this a few weeks ago on the verge crash like I feel like the differences
[36:55.760 --> 37:03.120]  were they were real and I could see why subjectively somebody would prefer the pixel 3 for still photography, but
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.560]  objectively, I think that there were plus and minuses on both sides and
[37:07.560 --> 37:15.120]  You know night sight was the one feature the pixel 3 had for a year that the iPhone 10s couldn't do but it wasn't
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.160]  You know, how often do you need it and and you know, I I don't know
[37:21.160 --> 37:26.580]  I mean it was on had portrait mode before Google did it but right didn't seem to have such big a reaction, right?
[37:27.220 --> 37:33.440]  You know, there's there's things that the iPhone still camera could do that the pixel couldn't and it for just regular photography
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.280]  I think it was debatable, but I thought this thing for me is that we went to CES and I was shooting with an iPhone
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.840]  And everyone from our Android team started off shooting with a pixel, but the camera just wouldn't launch
[37:43.840 --> 37:49.840]  they would miss the shot and the video would drop frames and by a day in they'd all switch to Samsung and Huawei phones because
[37:49.840 --> 37:53.000]  It didn't matter how good the camera was if it couldn't get the shot for them
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.080]  And I think that's one of the most underappreciated aspects of a camera
[37:56.480 --> 38:01.480]  Yeah, and that was a knock against the pixel 3 to with startup time and that you and you know
[38:01.480 --> 38:07.520]  I've we've all been in that situation and and we've all at times even I've I've even wondered whether Apple should make you know
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.520]  Should they add a dedicated phone button and I can see why they don't
[38:11.760 --> 38:18.000]  The Nokia phones back in the day had a dedicated shutter button just for the camera and launching it
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.520]  But we've all been in that situation where there's oh my god
[38:21.520 --> 38:24.040]  There's something cute or amazing or whatever going on
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.380]  I don't need to get my camera fired up as fast as possible and you really don't want that to be delayed
[38:28.380 --> 38:31.340]  But I thought that the other thing it was sort of a
[38:33.580 --> 38:35.020]  It's a
[38:35.020 --> 38:36.180]  well-known
[38:36.180 --> 38:42.820]  trope that the Macalope observes very keenly it was that the the gist of Byford's explanation of how the or
[38:43.620 --> 38:47.580]  Assertion that the iPhone needed to catch up on the phone
[38:48.300 --> 38:53.460]  Or on the camera. Well was by citing at least three different Android phones
[38:53.460 --> 38:58.500]  You know, like yeah, it didn't have night sight which the pixel did it didn't have an ultra wide lens
[38:58.500 --> 39:05.180]  Which the these Huawei and and other brand phones did and it didn't have something else that some other phone did
[39:05.380 --> 39:08.300]  But none of those three phones have the three features, you know what I mean?
[39:08.300 --> 39:13.460]  Like you could say quote-unquote Android had these three features, but you had to have three different phones to have all three features
[39:14.180 --> 39:18.740]  It's just a sort of a classic gotcha of comparing the Apple ecosystem
[39:18.740 --> 39:23.140]  to Windows back in the day to to Android in recent years I
[39:25.140 --> 39:29.740]  Thought that the extra lens thing was particularly rich if you're gonna because usually
[39:30.540 --> 39:36.940]  People held up the pixel is the best Android camera phone, you know, and I think with good reason
[39:38.340 --> 39:44.500]  But if you know on those grounds clearly it was it was the pixel that needed to catch up and now still needs to catch
[39:44.500 --> 39:49.540]  Up, it's still only has two lenses even at the highest lens at the highest at the highest version
[39:50.740 --> 39:53.460]  And again, I don't say that that proves that the iPhone is ahead
[39:53.460 --> 39:57.300]  I'm just saying I think it requires a much more nuanced nuanced discussion
[39:58.660 --> 40:06.100]  And I think that the the certainty that some pixel aficionados feel that they have the best still camera phone is
[40:06.660 --> 40:10.340]  Maybe not warranted. Yeah, it's very subjective
[40:10.340 --> 40:12.340]  Yeah, it's very subjective
[40:14.300 --> 40:17.500]  Which brings me to this discussion of okay if you're going to add
[40:18.380 --> 40:23.980]  Like the standard lens on a modern cell phone camera. It's pretty consistently
[40:25.060 --> 40:31.900]  In field of view at what in 35 millimeter terms would be around a 26 to 28
[40:31.900 --> 40:39.420]  To millimeter lens and there's a good good argument to be made
[40:40.420 --> 40:44.140]  That we should kind of get away from those terms anymore
[40:44.540 --> 40:51.060]  Yeah, and Apple certainly has Apple doesn't really describe them Apple just calls them 1x 2x and now 0.5x
[40:51.060 --> 40:57.780]  Which is a better way of thinking about it and field of view which is measured in an angle in other words. What what?
[40:57.780 --> 40:59.780]  What
[41:01.060 --> 41:02.740]  Angle
[41:02.740 --> 41:06.700]  from the from the lens pointing forward is captured in the sensor is
[41:07.700 --> 41:12.220]  Makes more sense than just using 35 millimeter sensor film terms
[41:12.500 --> 41:18.180]  Especially as we as 35 millimeter sensors become a smaller and smaller part of the camera landscape
[41:20.540 --> 41:26.340]  So what we call a 1x lens on most of these cameras is very very similar in field of view
[41:26.340 --> 41:31.620]  Just just a tiny fraction, you know, the iPhone is a little bit wider than the pixel was last year
[41:31.620 --> 41:32.820]  I don't know how they compare this year
[41:32.820 --> 41:37.860]  But like if you set a pixel 3 and an iPhone 10s up last year
[41:38.260 --> 41:42.900]  You could if you knew what to look for if they were set up at the exact same location
[41:42.900 --> 41:46.940]  You could tell instantly which one was which because the iPhones would be a little bit wider
[41:46.940 --> 41:51.420]  so you'd capture a little bit more information along this the sides of the
[41:51.420 --> 41:57.740]  The image so depending on the subject you were photographing you could just see it if there's a little bit more
[41:57.980 --> 42:01.300]  Like I think if you really wanted to do a side-by-side
[42:03.060 --> 42:10.460]  Like double-blind which one do you like part of it would have been you'd have to crop the iPhone pictures like
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.620]  One or two percent and do like a center crop just to get the same field of view
[42:15.620 --> 42:21.460]  if you're going to add a second lens, and now everybody's adding second lenses because
[42:22.340 --> 42:27.620]  It's just the physics of these devices and that you know how thin they need to be mean you
[42:28.260 --> 42:30.140]  at least
[42:30.140 --> 42:37.500]  In the near future. There's no way to make a zoom lens meaning a lens that adjusts from these different fields of view
[42:37.860 --> 42:45.180]  So if you want to get the effects of a zoom lens the advantages meaning to be able to go even wider or to zoom in
[42:45.180 --> 42:47.180]  more without
[42:47.700 --> 42:52.960]  Without resorting to digital zoom you need second and third camera lenses
[42:53.820 --> 42:55.820]  I
[42:55.860 --> 43:01.220]  Kind of feel and and did you watch the the pixel for event? Yes. I forget the guy's name
[43:01.220 --> 43:03.620]  Do you know the guy's name who's like their camera guy? Oh
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.180]  It's mark
[43:06.180 --> 43:13.100]  Blanking on his name, too. He's a guy who made all those computations with that original computational photography app. Yeah, it's a very smart guy. I
[43:13.100 --> 43:16.420]  Think he was a little salty about the ultra-wide lens
[43:17.220 --> 43:18.880]  Yeah
[43:18.880 --> 43:22.900]  Like I kind of feel like Google got caught with their
[43:24.540 --> 43:32.140]  Just caught maybe making the wrong decision on that front and that mark Lavoie mark Lavoie and I have to write this down
[43:32.140 --> 43:42.180]  And I really think that Apple made the right decision now that the non-pro
[43:44.660 --> 43:47.220]  $799 new iPhone has two lenses
[43:47.780 --> 43:53.420]  Instead of following in the footsteps of the iPhone 10 and 10s and going telephoto as the second lens
[43:53.420 --> 43:58.020]  They it only goes ultra wide. I think that's the right move for most people
[43:58.020 --> 44:03.580]  I think it's also the right move for the non-pro phone and I you know
[44:03.580 --> 44:06.840]  And I'm on the record is saying we don't have to worry so much about
[44:07.620 --> 44:12.860]  What pro means in the parlance of an iPhone Pro it really can just mean?
[44:13.580 --> 44:15.020]  iPhone premium
[44:15.020 --> 44:21.380]  Yes, whether it's professional or not, but the truth is as just a basic rule of thumb
[44:21.380 --> 44:28.020]  The wider the lens the more fun it is right and you can get you know
[44:28.640 --> 44:30.640]  some actual comical
[44:31.380 --> 44:36.140]  Effects with the ultra wide by having a subject really close and it exaggerates it
[44:36.940 --> 44:42.200]  And then the longer the lens the more serious it is. It just gives you a more serious feel
[44:42.200 --> 44:48.020]  That's why the portrait lens, you know defaults to the 2x perspective. It just is a more staid
[44:48.020 --> 44:50.020]  A
[44:51.100 --> 44:53.900]  Perspective I remember reading an interview once with
[44:55.660 --> 44:59.540]  Billy Crystal and he was talking I forget who directed the movies
[44:59.860 --> 45:05.540]  but I think it was about city slickers to remember city slickers and then I was city slickers was a smash hit and
[45:06.020 --> 45:09.500]  And was a big big hit and made Jack Parlance
[45:09.500 --> 45:12.620]  It was the crufty old cowboy became a you know
[45:12.620 --> 45:16.620]  It had been like a big star in the 50s and 60s all of a sudden he became big star again
[45:16.620 --> 45:18.740]  and then they made a sequel and
[45:20.500 --> 45:22.180]  Sequel wasn't so good
[45:22.180 --> 45:26.220]  And the story I heard was a Billy Crystal was talking to had a new director for it
[45:26.220 --> 45:27.300]  He was talking to somebody else
[45:27.300 --> 45:29.380]  I think like Rob Reiner who wasn't involved with it
[45:29.380 --> 45:34.300]  And he was just like from the set and he was just like so I could be butchering this anecdote
[45:34.300 --> 45:39.500]  But I know it was Billy Crystal. I know it was I know city slickers to may or may not have been Rob Reiner
[45:39.500 --> 45:43.620]  But anyway, he was talking to somebody who he trusted as a director of comedy and he said hey
[45:43.620 --> 45:48.220]  He always told me that wide-angle lenses are funny. And he's like, yeah. Yeah, that's real fast
[45:48.220 --> 45:49.100]  You want something to be funny?
[45:49.100 --> 45:51.260]  You got to put a wide-angle lens on the camera and he goes with it
[45:51.260 --> 45:52.540]  This guy's not putting nope
[45:52.540 --> 45:58.400]  this guy's shooting everything with a long lens and it was just like crickets on the other end phone and then Billy was like
[45:58.620 --> 46:00.620]  Yeah, I thought so
[46:02.540 --> 46:10.100]  It really is fun and I think just reading it I think I've read more people on Twitter who seem less
[46:10.100 --> 46:12.100]  If
[46:12.340 --> 46:18.420]  You know prosumery photo enthusiasts types and just more casual I just shoot photos
[46:18.860 --> 46:23.020]  They seem to be using the wide-angle lens more than then
[46:23.020 --> 46:27.220]  I saw people using the telephoto lens in the whole two years when
[46:27.620 --> 46:31.280]  When the iPhone if you had two lenses or I guess three years maybe
[46:31.580 --> 46:36.120]  Where if the iPhone had dual lenses the second lens was telephoto
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  I
[46:38.560 --> 46:43.440]  Think that's really true and it's it's interesting to me because I would shoot a lot with the telephoto lens
[46:43.440 --> 46:50.040]  But mostly because I wanted the bokeh and it gets a much nicer natural bokeh than the other lens than the the ultra wide-angle lens
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.700]  But you can computationally deliver telephoto. Google did it last year with the pixel 3 and super zoom
[46:55.700 --> 46:58.920]  That's essentially what they were doing was making a computational telephoto lens
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.600]  But you can't do that with ultra wide-angle because you don't have the extra data. It just is it doesn't exist
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.880]  So putting even on an iPhone 11 not the pro you have the wide-angle and the ultra wide-angle
[47:10.760 --> 47:12.160]  You can still do a zoom
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.960]  I wish Apple would put the button on there because I think it's a better user experience to just do the the 2x button
[47:16.960 --> 47:19.200]  But you can zoom in and it's still a usable shot
[47:19.200 --> 47:24.600]  You cannot zoom out on a pixel and I think that's a loss and when I look at a lot of the Android reviewers
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.520]  Because like you mentioned not a lot of the phones used to have every option
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.520]  But now a Huawei phone a Samsung phone
[47:30.520 --> 47:36.120]  All of them have ultra wide all of them have night mode and it's pixel that stands out for not having everything. Yeah
[47:38.360 --> 47:43.560]  Ben Rubenstein, who's the developer behind the excellent halide app along with his yes
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.520]  Colleague Sebastian Dewit, who's the designer of the app?
[47:49.680 --> 47:52.360]  Did some interesting work last year on?
[47:54.520 --> 47:57.840]  Just comparing the 1x camera
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.700]  Doing a 2x digital zoom versus. Yep, Ben
[48:02.700 --> 48:05.580]  Sandovski this and what I forget how I mispronounced it. Sorry Ben
[48:07.220 --> 48:12.860]  But Ben Sandovski really smart developer really knows this stuff really found that in a lot a surprisingly well-lit
[48:14.100 --> 48:19.700]  Well lit but indoor lighting conditions a 1x camera with two with the 2x digital zoom
[48:19.700 --> 48:27.220]  Using a smart zoom algorithm. We get you a better image than using a 2x camera with a slower lens meaning slower
[48:27.220 --> 48:29.220]  Meaning works worse with less light
[48:31.500 --> 48:38.140]  You know digital the gist of it being digital zoom has gotten better than you think and in the old days when digital photography was
[48:38.140 --> 48:44.540]  New it was like don't ever resort to digital zoom, you know, unless you really really have to because it just looks like
[48:45.380 --> 48:46.580]  muddy
[48:46.580 --> 48:53.140]  Blurry pixels at every level. Whereas it's gotten better and like you said you can do it
[48:53.140 --> 49:00.220]  However, whatever the trade-offs are of doing a digital zoom it. It's still certainly getting you that frame of view
[49:00.460 --> 49:06.100]  Whereas there's absolutely no way to fake of the 0.5 X lens field of view
[49:06.100 --> 49:09.620]  I don't think most people notice because on the iPhone it will switch between
[49:09.820 --> 49:15.460]  The real telephoto and sort of a fake telephoto if it gets into lower light and I don't know if it's going to be a
[49:15.460 --> 49:20.660]  Lower light and I don't know how many people actually notice when it's doing that because when I pointed out they're super surprised
[49:20.660 --> 49:25.220]  No, and nobody nobody noticed. I mean all of us we wrote I'm not maybe somebody noticed
[49:25.220 --> 49:29.460]  I don't know but I even wrote a piece a couple weeks ago about how when you're in night
[49:29.740 --> 49:34.940]  Night mode on the iPhone 11 Pro. It always uses the 1x camera lens
[49:34.940 --> 49:39.940]  So if you're doing 2x in in night mode on a 11 Pro
[49:39.940 --> 49:43.020]  It's using the 1x sensor and doing a digital zoom
[49:43.020 --> 49:47.100]  Along with the interpolation of multiple exposures, you know
[49:48.180 --> 49:49.540]  and
[49:49.540 --> 49:55.500]  Nobody, you know, nobody really caught on to that and there was a bit of Apple not wanting to talk about how it worked
[49:55.500 --> 49:59.820]  Which was weird and should have raised a flag people because if you did get the telephoto lens
[49:59.820 --> 50:01.100]  It looked like night mode didn't work
[50:01.100 --> 50:04.580]  And then when you didn't get it, it looked like night mode worked and you couldn't figure out why sometimes
[50:04.780 --> 50:07.260]  It would work at 2x and not others and it was just confusing
[50:07.260 --> 50:08.020]  Yeah
[50:08.020 --> 50:12.700]  And you can do you can always prove this and it's just the simplest most obvious thing in the world if you're ever
[50:12.700 --> 50:17.300]  Confused as to which camera lens your iPhone is using for a quote 2x shot
[50:17.500 --> 50:22.540]  Just cover one of the lenses with your finger and you can actually see it, you know happen
[50:26.020 --> 50:33.820]  Basically I think that the confusion is that Apple in some ways presents the new the new camera zoom interface with these
[50:34.260 --> 50:37.980]  Separate buttons on the iPhone 11 you get a 0.5 and 1x
[50:37.980 --> 50:44.020]  Buttons, but no 2x button and then on the iPhone 11 Pro you get three buttons
[50:44.620 --> 50:46.620]  0.5 1 and 2x and
[50:47.100 --> 50:51.900]  At some level they want you and I think overall they've really achieved
[50:51.900 --> 50:55.860]  I think that the camera team at Apple is doing some of the best
[50:56.220 --> 51:03.260]  user experience work in the industry it is in terms of what they're doing with the user interface and
[51:04.180 --> 51:06.180]  exposing a little bit more
[51:06.180 --> 51:07.860]  complexity
[51:07.860 --> 51:09.860]  but in ways
[51:10.260 --> 51:15.300]  That don't get in the way of using the camera in the most simplistic way possible
[51:15.300 --> 51:18.540]  Which they know is what most people do is open the camera
[51:18.540 --> 51:23.540]  Make sure you're either in camera or video mode and then hit the button, right?
[51:23.700 --> 51:27.220]  That's what people do and they've really not gotten in the way of that
[51:27.220 --> 51:31.340]  But they've really exposed what you can do in a very, you know, very useful ways
[51:31.340 --> 51:38.140]  There's a little bit of conflation there though it where they really want you to treat it as one camera
[51:38.140 --> 51:44.220]  Yeah, you can zoom in and out of and you don't have to worry about the fact that there are three physical cameras on the back
[51:45.260 --> 51:52.060]  It's just one camera app and it just zooms in and out like the way a point-and-shoot camera can zoom in and out
[51:52.060 --> 51:58.380]  You know and you don't have to worry about it that it's technically three different cameras and three different sensors and three different
[51:58.380 --> 52:00.940]  maximum, you know
[52:00.940 --> 52:03.660]  Exposure speeds and stuff like that. You don't have to worry about it
[52:03.660 --> 52:08.700]  It'll just do what you needs to do to to get the best image at the perspective you're looking for
[52:09.900 --> 52:17.740]  But at the other hand they still there is some aspect of it whereby only having the 2x button on the one that has the 2x
[52:17.740 --> 52:25.580]  Lens physical lens it kind of makes you feel that hitting that button is giving you that camera that physical can't agree
[52:25.580 --> 52:33.100]  Yeah, it where's that's not the case. It's really just about the field of view and it just means
[52:33.580 --> 52:37.900]  0.5 is always going to give you the 0.5 camera because there's no other way to fake it
[52:38.540 --> 52:42.700]  1x is always going to give you the 1x camera because if it's the best camera
[52:43.660 --> 52:47.580]  Period so if you want the 1x field of view, it's never going to be better by cropping
[52:48.940 --> 52:51.660]  The other the other images
[52:51.660 --> 52:56.540]  The 2x though is the mystery where sometimes it if you're outdoors and there's lots of light
[52:56.540 --> 53:02.940]  It's going to give you the 2x camera physically, but indoors it may not and if night sight it never will
[53:03.660 --> 53:04.540]  Yeah
[53:04.540 --> 53:09.740]  But that's okay interesting thing for me is that there's there's almost like this battle inside apple because on one hand
[53:10.060 --> 53:13.660]  They exactly what you said. They just want it to be a camera you pick it up you shoot
[53:13.660 --> 53:14.780]  You don't worry about it
[53:14.780 --> 53:18.700]  But on the other hand some of the technology is so cool that it's going to give you the 2x camera
[53:18.700 --> 53:23.180]  But on the other hand some the technology is so cool. They can't resist talking about it
[53:23.340 --> 53:27.260]  So I think like in a perfect world, they wouldn't really talk about deep fusion
[53:27.340 --> 53:33.340]  It would just be the camera shoots and it gives you the best possible image based on when you're shooting and over time
[53:33.580 --> 53:39.420]  Right now we have smart hdr and we have deep fusion and we have night mode and they're distinct and it switches between them
[53:39.420 --> 53:45.360]  But over time it's probably going to do some amount of each of them depending exactly on where you are in the continuum
[53:45.360 --> 53:50.080]  Of lighting and they will be less distinct. But for right now people keep asking
[53:50.080 --> 53:54.880]  Well, when when do I see deep fusion and apple clearly doesn't want you to care because there's no deep fusion button
[53:54.880 --> 53:56.160]  There's no night
[53:56.160 --> 53:59.520]  Mode button, but at the same time they love the technology so much they talk about it
[53:59.520 --> 54:02.320]  So people think that they're these distinct modes. Yeah. Yeah
[54:03.280 --> 54:04.480]  um
[54:04.480 --> 54:09.460]  I still haven't done i'm kind of waiting, you know, I have I I went ahead and put ios 13.2
[54:09.460 --> 54:16.260]  13.2 developer betas on my my daily carry iphone just because because I thought what do I have to lose?
[54:16.980 --> 54:19.960]  I'm based on and I would I would say the 13.1.2
[54:22.260 --> 54:24.260]  Is okay, it's not
[54:24.580 --> 54:31.700]  A horror show of bugs point three is slightly better. Yeah, I think I'd already switched to the developer base before that. So
[54:31.700 --> 54:38.980]  So, but I just figured why not? I might as well just use this and get deep fusion as quickly as as possible. Um,
[54:39.700 --> 54:43.220]  But people are sweating almost like they're just showing these sweater pictures and saying can you see the difference?
[54:43.460 --> 54:47.540]  And I don't think you're meant to I don't think it's supposed to work that way. Yeah, I don't think so either. Um,
[54:49.460 --> 54:51.460]  Um
[54:52.660 --> 54:54.660]  Uh, I forget where I was going with that but
[54:55.620 --> 55:00.340]  Basically, I feel like apple did the right thing by going ultra wide on the 11. I think it's more fun
[55:00.340 --> 55:02.340]  I think it's more
[55:02.340 --> 55:04.340]  It's impossible to duplicate
[55:05.540 --> 55:06.820]  In software
[55:06.820 --> 55:13.620]  And I do I agree with you. I still kind of feel though that the regular iphone 11 non-pro should have a 2x button
[55:14.100 --> 55:15.140]  Yeah
[55:15.140 --> 55:18.020]  And and they could even style it differently like make it like
[55:18.820 --> 55:21.780]  A lighter color or light slightly less vibrant. I don't know
[55:21.780 --> 55:26.900]  There's some kind of some kind of indication to show that it would that it would be software only maybe I don't know
[55:26.900 --> 55:31.780]  But or maybe not maybe just software only portrait mode and they didn't really think they didn't know it any different way
[55:31.780 --> 55:32.900]  It was just portrait mode
[55:32.900 --> 55:38.900]  But just just as a convenient way to jump to an exact 2x digital zoom
[55:39.060 --> 55:42.980]  Which is an interesting perspective and you know it to me
[55:43.540 --> 55:48.500]  Yes, you can you can get there through the dial and the dial clicks a little bit at the 2x marker
[55:48.580 --> 55:54.180]  But it just as a nice way to jump there and to get the exact if that's what you want for a couple of shots
[55:54.180 --> 56:01.860]  To know that you're exactly at two point zero x and not two point one or one point nine that would satisfy me
[56:02.420 --> 56:08.660]  The the vaguely ocd parts of my brain that if i'm going to take a series of shots from this field of view
[56:09.140 --> 56:11.140]  I want it to be exactly 2.0
[56:11.540 --> 56:15.860]  I don't want it's faster than dialing it dialing. It is a little bit fidgety pressing that button is just immediate
[56:16.260 --> 56:19.060]  Yeah, it's very immediate very exact very satisfying
[56:19.060 --> 56:23.460]  uh, so I but I so it's sort of hard to defend not including it other than as
[56:24.500 --> 56:27.940]  What I call marketing spite that they just wanted to reserve that
[56:28.740 --> 56:33.620]  As a way to emphasize that the iphone 11 pro has a 2x
[56:34.260 --> 56:38.340]  An entire 2x camera system. Yeah, it's three modes instead of two. Yeah
[56:40.500 --> 56:45.060]  Here before we take another break i've got follow-up I need to mention from my last episode
[56:45.060 --> 56:48.660]  I was talking about ben ben thompson and I were talking about our
[56:49.620 --> 56:57.540]  Sort of conservative upgrade cycle to new versions of mac os and that neither of us were upgrading primary machines to catalina yet
[56:58.260 --> 57:00.180]  Uh, ben's ben waits like a year
[57:00.660 --> 57:06.980]  He's very he's very pessimistic on new mac os software quality. I'm going to upgrade sooner rather than later
[57:07.860 --> 57:10.260]  I usually wait a year but I did it this year just because I
[57:10.580 --> 57:13.220]  I could not finish the review without using it on my primary machine
[57:13.220 --> 57:16.820]  There was just too much new stuff. I mentioned looking forward to sidecar
[57:16.820 --> 57:24.420]  But I also mentioned looking forward to sidecar after extolling my my deep and abiding love for the 2014
[57:24.660 --> 57:27.060]  MacBook pro that is my daily driver
[57:28.100 --> 57:30.340]  Completely forgetting the fact that sidecar
[57:30.980 --> 57:36.180]  Requires like a 2016 macbook or later. Yeah, because it needs like the t2 chip and I knew that
[57:36.820 --> 57:42.020]  But I completely forgot it while I was talking about it and it doesn't really reduce my interest in
[57:42.020 --> 57:45.700]  My interest in upgrading this machine to catalina but a little bit it does
[57:45.860 --> 57:48.340]  Because i'm gonna have to use a different machine just to try
[57:49.460 --> 57:50.740]  sidecar
[57:50.740 --> 57:54.340]  but i'm curious what you think of sidecar sidecar of course is the feature that allows you to
[57:55.380 --> 57:57.860]  Use your ipad as an external display
[57:58.420 --> 58:02.020]  Including using the pencil for as input to a mac app
[58:03.140 --> 58:06.100]  That that can take a stylus type input
[58:06.100 --> 58:12.820]  And you as as somebody who illustrates and is a big pencil user. I'm curious, you know, have you given sidecar a good ride yet?
[58:13.540 --> 58:18.100]  Yeah, I mean I used it a lot through the beta but it was kind of hard to use because none of the apps
[58:18.100 --> 58:21.220]  None of the third-party apps could be updated to support it yet
[58:21.940 --> 58:26.260]  I like some of the features some of the stuff they say like, you know, you can just use it to sign documents
[58:26.260 --> 58:30.420]  I do that stuff directly on the ipad or just sketch in notes. I just do that directly on the ipad
[58:30.420 --> 58:34.100]  I don't need it. Maybe if i'm using the mac already, it's slightly more convenient, but
[58:34.100 --> 58:38.260]  I would just pick up the ipad and use those directly. I love it as a second screen though
[58:38.260 --> 58:43.780]  especially if i'm editing in final cut and I have like a meeting on google meet or I just wanted to have slack or
[58:44.260 --> 58:46.180]  I message up I have that all the time now
[58:46.180 --> 58:51.460]  I just put the ipad up and it's great because I can leave the full screen on final cut and I can do everything else
[58:51.860 --> 58:54.100]  On the ipad and slowly but surely
[58:54.820 --> 59:00.180]  photoshop was was tough but slowly but surely apps are updating now and I love that I can just pick it up
[59:00.180 --> 59:04.020]  Draw with the pencil put it back down go back to editing with the mouse
[59:04.020 --> 59:08.900]  I think over the next month or two as the more and more apps update. I'm just going to do that all the time
[59:10.340 --> 59:12.660]  And there's a happy little story here where
[59:13.940 --> 59:19.140]  Luna display which is a great little company that came out with these dongles
[59:21.620 --> 59:23.620]  That that go into
[59:23.620 --> 59:30.180]  The usb-c port of your newer mac or the thunderbolt port on a slightly older mac
[59:31.060 --> 59:38.100]  And trick the mac into thinking it's an entire display that's been plugged in where what it really does is just transmit the image
[59:38.340 --> 59:42.580]  To the luna display app on your ipad so that you can use your ipad as a second display
[59:44.500 --> 59:46.500]  And yeah sidecar
[59:47.060 --> 59:51.620]  To use our our our little rackets term for it sherlock to that feature pretty hard
[59:51.620 --> 59:53.620]  Because it's built into the system
[59:54.100 --> 59:59.220]  It's going to do things that an app using an app and a dongle just aren't as convenient for
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.260]  But the good news is the luna display team rather than just
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:11.620]  go and drink and be sad about getting sherlock to put their heads down and did a lot of work and
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.660]  Already have announced that they've got a mac to mac mode
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:24.740]  For luna display, which will let you use like for example a 5k imac as an external display
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.500]  wirelessly
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500]  Which is really really cool
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.180]  A really interesting use case
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.380]  For like especially to me the one the device that really stands out as yeah
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.060]  that's this is a great way to keep that machine and your active use is the
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:48.740]  Like the five six-year-old iMac 5ks which still have by today's standards outstanding displays
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:55.220]  It's still hard. It is really hard to find a a 5k external display and with
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.220]  Like the price of like the selling price of like a 5k
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:04.900]  Imac even a new one is actually in the ballpark of what you might expect for, you know, you think like well
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.900]  What a waste of time
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.780]  Is actually in the ballpark of what you might expect for, you know, you think like well what a waste to have an entire
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.220]  uh
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:18.660]  Imac computer go to waste and just use it as a display. But when you look at the prices, it's actually not bad
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.740]  No, it's great and apples doesn't sell a standalone, right?
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.780]  and it gets like that as we head towards the the
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.620]  on the launch of the mac pro and you know
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:35.380]  it's like are we really going to have a scenario where the only the only first party apple display is
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:39.620]  A six thousand dollar x, you know pro display xdr for 6k
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.380]  What the hell am I going to do I don't you know people who don't really want to buy the lg
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.180]  Displays, you know
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.060]  it seems ridiculous to buy this expensive mac pro and then use a
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.140]  iMac as your
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:59.540]  Display, but it might be a good secondary display. I don't know it's I just see this as being very useful to a lot of people
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.820]  I'm glad
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.220]  Glad to see lunax still doing awesome work
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.660]  Yeah, absolutely probably get sherlocked in 1016 next year
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:14.660]  Then they'll just mariadum right back again. Yeah exactly just but I mean, it's just the perfect attitude with your hardware software developer
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.420]  It's like you kind of have to
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.860]  You ought to be thinking with whether it's an app or a product might apple steal this idea
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.660]  I mean, I don't know maybe that's a hard word steal, but you know what I mean
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.460]  At least if you're on the team, it's can feel like they stole your idea if the answer is yes
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.900]  Then you should have a plan b for when that'll happen. Like if it seems like it would be a good idea built into the system
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.620]  It there's a very high chance. It will be built into the system and it's probably you know
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.460]  the truth is it's probably a higher chance than if you didn't build your product because
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:49.700]  The existence proof of hey, here's a cool product that does this thing makes it a very compelling argument, you know
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:56.500]  Inside apple to yeah, we should do this right like that sounds like a good idea is one thing here
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.620]  Look at this. Look at what these guys did
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.300]  Is a way more compelling way to say yeah, we should build that into the system
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.940]  Yeah, but they're also almost always only going to do the baseline feature and leave a lot of gaps
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:14.660]  So you can you can really thrive in in making the better version right if there's room in whatever your idea is to go deeper
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:21.220]  And and and stuff like that. Usually there's there's room to do that, you know, for example the my favorite example
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.220]  This year is the beefed up reminders app
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:29.960]  Which is it? I think I don't see how you could argue that. It's not an improvement over the almost rudimentary
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.620]  Reminders app we've had until now
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:40.740]  But is it I don't think is going to put any kind of dent in the sales of apps like things and omni focus
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.620]  You know, whatever your favorite to-do list app is because there's just
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.340]  People have so many diverse needs for the way they want to do it a to-do system
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.620]  That nothing that apple builds into the system that's meant for
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.980]  90 percent of people to use is ever going to touch most of those things
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:03.060]  The same thing with you know calendar and fantastical and mail and spark and some people just always use the google version
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.620]  Right the app regardless of whether they're using apple hardware
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:11.940]  Right or the fantastical group has the card hop which is a context. Yeah way better
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.380]  Yeah way better, but also I wouldn't suggest it as something that's not a good idea
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.020]  but also I wouldn't suggest it as something apple should adopt as the the
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.900]  System app, you know fantastical is probably a little closer. Uh
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.660]  To being you know, it's so you know
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:36.420]  But I can see why apple doesn't didn't go that route on some of the ui decisions
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.740]  But it definitely has has some power user type features that really make it worthwhile
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.140]  Yeah, I guess I could take a break talk about another sponsor. How about this?
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.220]  Here's another one of my favorite sponsors if you're hearing me right now. It's because i'm using their product
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.140]  ero
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.160]  ee
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.020]  ro
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.300]  Uh ero is a way to set up wi-fi in your home and have multiple
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:05.860]  Base stations spread around your house. Maybe you need two. Maybe you need three. Maybe you have a big house. You need four. I don't know
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:14.580]  Uh, but if you're trying to saturate your whole home with one signal from one device plugged into your cable modem or your files box
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.460]  And go from your basement
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.500]  To your garage to your bedroom on the top floor of your house
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.260]  There's a good chance you can't do it if you've got spots in your house that have bad wi-fi
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:30.580]  You should get a system like ero ero makes it so easy to set up
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.220]  You just start with
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.060]  a starter package
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:40.260]  You go to their website. They have all sorts of tools where you can describe your home your apartment your house
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.340]  Whatever you're trying to set up
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.900]  And they'll help you get just the right amount of hardware to do it
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:52.340]  And you set it up in just minutes. It plugs right into your modem your cable your router
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.940]  And you manage it all from a dead simple app. It's a native app right there on your iphone
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:03.300]  And it lets you pause the wi-fi for dinner stuff like that. It lets you see all the devices on your network
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:09.620]  It is the easiest easiest way i've ever seen to set up a secondary guest network so that you can have
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:14.100]  Uh people come over and you they say hey, can I get on your wi-fi?
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.540]  You don't want them on your wi-fi
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.340]  At least if you're like me
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:21.540]  You don't want them on your real wi-fi where they could like see all your devices and stuff. Just give them the guest network password
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:22.900]  uh
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.780]  and
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:30.020]  They get all the same speed and performance and you're not putting putting their devices on your network. Love it super easy
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.500]  Uh, it just I just can't emphasize how easy it is to set this up and
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.860]  And it just you just stop worrying about wi-fi signal throughout your house
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:46.660]  So they have an all-new one an all-new ero that's new hardware starts at just 99 bucks

[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:31.460]  I guess we got to talk. I can't just ignore it. I got to talk about the apple hong kong china stuff
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:36.500]  But I feel like i've written so much about it that I don't need to spend a whole segment of the show on it
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.380]  um
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.540]  And it seems to have calmed down a little bit
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:48.980]  Um, basically apple got caught in sort of a perfect storm of
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.020]  of china related stuff like
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.020]  It really is unrelated and just purely coincidental that the nba
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.860]  Situation where the gm of the houston rockets just tweeted us retweeted a simple pro hong kong
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.180]  tweet and
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.100]  really set off a
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.860]  A firestorm of controversy that made even the apple one seemed small and how often do you hear that?
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:18.020]  Like where apple gets caught up in a controversy and somebody else is in the same controversy and it's getting way more attention. Yeah
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.660]  um
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.860]  But the apple related aspects
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.300]  There's the hk map live app
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.400]  And then there's this this sub-secondary
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.300]  Story of
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.300]  apple
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.300]  Requesting slash demanding that the people creating the shows for apple tv plus keep them china friendly
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.700]  Meaning don't don't don't put stuff in your shows that would anger the chinese or create a controversy. Um
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.420]  With the hk map live i've written enough a lot about it
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.700]  the one thing I can say and i'm not quite sure I made clear my writing is that i've
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:05.220]  I've from multiple people inside apple including a couple of people who are really really
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:12.340]  Interested at a personal level that they they you know, whether it's their family or or significant others
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.860]  But they have a personal investment in the whole situation in hong kong
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.740]  in particular
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.380]  Uh and asked around within the company like i've verified this from a couple people that that
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:29.300]  The initial rejection of that app was not a strat strategic
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:35.300]  dictum from the top of the company that was just a single app reviewer who looked at the app and
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.660]  Thought well this hong kong stuff is controversial. This seems like it's meant to
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.700]  Circumvent the law i'm going to deny it
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.100]  And I think everything that happened after that came from that one
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:55.700]  Ultimately erroneous decision so that the three steps of the controversy is the developer submits this app to apple
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.620]  And it's a map app that shows user submitted
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.340]  Information about police activity and protest activity around hong kong
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.700]  And
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.140]  You the user can use it however you see fit whether it's because you want to join in a protest or whether because you want
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:21.220]  to avoid the protests um, and it has information about like where tear gas is being used which
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.180]  For obvious reasons is something that if you're you know
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.940]  You might want to avoid if the if the app had just been accepted which
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:36.100]  Internally apple determined it should have been that this is not something it's not illegal the app itself
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.100]  The app is not illegal in hong kong
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.660]  It's just information
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.420]  Should have been accepted. I don't think it would have been that big of a deal
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.940]  Big of a news. I I don't think any kind of controversy would have come of it. Nobody would have noticed. No
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.180]  It's you know
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.100]  I think word, you know
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.700]  I think the app is somewhat popular in hong kong for obvious reasons
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.340]  I think there's you know, it's it's small densely populated populated city
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:07.060]  It's not like anybody in hong kong is unaware of the months-long protests
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:12.900]  It's also a wrapper around the web page, which is accessible still to everybody right which you know, we can mention
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.900]  I I just don't think it would have been news
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.980]  I think apple accepts this app that
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.060]  Also is on the web and also is on android is not a news story
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:27.540]  The news story was the and again it people aren't wrong for assuming it right that that this was
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.180]  This was a corporate
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  executive level decision
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.460]  to
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.500]  placate
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500]  the mainland chinese government
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:44.500]  By disallowing this app, which is seemingly an app meant for people protesting for the democratic rights in hong kong
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.100]  so
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.100]  Then when the news came out that the app was
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.740]  Rejected more people than not or at least the sort of people who were tweeting about it or writing about it
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:58.820]  Were operating under the assumption that that was policy from apple
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.820]  Which I didn't think it was but I didn't know
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.820]  No
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:10.500]  Two days later apple apple agreed, you know changed its mind the appeal process and the developer of the app
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.140]  Themselves, I don't want to say himself or herself
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:17.300]  I don't it's not even clear whether it's one person or multiple people but for obvious reasons of
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.220]  Wanting to keep their identity hidden from the chinese government. They're they're
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.420]  Anonymous so the developer i'll just say plural developers of the app
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.740]  Uh even tweeted when they said hey this, you know, we've submitted an appeal
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.780]  We think this might just be a bureaucratic mistake, you know
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:38.340]  They weren't jumping to the conclusion that apple was trying to suppress the app two days later. Apple said okay
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.540]  The app is fine. Just no problem with it doesn't break the law now
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540]  It's in the app store and then it was in the app store
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.100]  And then another two days later
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.340]  They pulled it from the app store and in the in the int in the interim
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.620]  There was a lot of publicity about it including
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.900]  uh multiple op-eds in state-run newspapers in mainland china, which
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:04.740]  The assumption is always have the backing of the government, you know
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.260]  The the state-run newspapers don't just run random op-eds
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:16.580]  Absolutely dragging apple over the coals for this, you know saying that they're helping, you know rioters, you know
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:22.580]  They're in the mainland china. These people aren't protesters for democracy. They're rioters who are making trouble
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.220]  um
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.460]  very very strongly worded, uh, the
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:37.140]  Denouncements of apple's decision to to publish this which wouldn't have happened in the first place if they had simply accepted the app on first pass
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.940]  Yeah
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.940]  Boy this put apple in a bad position and I really I
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:49.860]  Wish they had just weathered the storm and left the app in the store and just had nothing to say about it
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.860]  um
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.420]  But instead they pulled it again two days later
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.740]  And that's where it really gets interesting. I don't know what you think about it
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:07.060]  The assumption on the outside is clearly that apple's simply placating the mainland chinese government and that's again I say that's perfectly reasonable
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.140]  There's no reason to think otherwise
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.980]  but from what i've heard internally from multiple people is that
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.380]  um higher level and lower level, uh
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.900]  Is basically that
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.500]  What what tim cook's company-wide memo said
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:31.060]  Which I I even said really just didn't stand up to scrutiny. I mean, I think you kind of agreed with that, too
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.060]  absolutely, it stands up a little better if you
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:41.780]  Assume and this is what I believe to be the case that apple sort of got thrown under the bus by the hong kong government
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:46.660]  Not the mainland china. It wasn't you know, the mainland china communicates very
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.780]  I don't think apple heard from them. I really don't i've and i've heard from no one who said they did. I don't think
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.580]  mainland china sends messages like that they communicate, uh
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:04.180]  Indirectly disappointed editorials is usually anonymous in state newspapers. Exactly
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.200]  Whereas so apple's internal apparatus
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.380]  Isn't really hooked up
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.420]  They're they're hooked up
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:19.460]  On the hong kong in particular to protect hong kong from mainland china
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.660]  And their assumption is that if there's pressure overt or otherwise
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:35.480]  With tensions between mainland china's laws and rules and desires and and hyper-sensitivity
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:41.460]  To perceptive issues, you know, like there's there's this whole thing in recent years where where
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:47.620]  China effectively demanded that a bunch of airlines around the world that if you fly into like taiwan and hong kong
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.700]  That that these places be labeled as part of china and not as independent
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.800]  locations
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.020]  Very very sensitive to stuff like this. Um, yeah
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:06.900]  Apple set up internally to protect hong kong from china and so they they're
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.660]  their
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.660]  their internal
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:18.100]  Systems were set up to hey if hong kong tells us blank. We should take their word for it and do it and
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:24.260]  hong kong authorities not mainland chinese authorities hong kong authorities told apple
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:29.540]  Hey, this app is no good. This this isn't helping, you know, the right people this is causing
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.700]  You know looters and rioters are using it to circumvent police, you know
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:39.860]  The stuff that tim cook says they were told I actually think they were told by the hong kong authorities. That's part of the
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.480]  conflict in this whole
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.020]  You know, we could obviously do a whole podcast about it and
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.500]  We're not experts. I'm certainly not an expert on the politics of the hong kong thing
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.420]  But part of it is that what people are protesting for is they'd like to elect their own leaders
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.980]  whereas the wade stuff is set up with the
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.940]  Two systems one country promise ever since
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.940]  The united kingdom handed over
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:12.180]  Control of hong kong to china in 1997, you know that the the hong kong authorities
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.540]  Aren't representatives of mainland china
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:21.460]  But they're appointed by mainland china and part of this whole thing with these protests is that the protesters are arguing, you know that
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:26.980]  That you know, they'd like they'd like to replace them with people of their own choosing, you know
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:33.860]  and I I think like the the the current leader of hong kong is something like 15 or 19 percent approval rating or something like that something
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.760]  Totally untenable if if if the position were duly elected in a real democracy
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.140]  Apple just isn't set up to deal with that or wasn't set up to deal with that that they you know
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:50.180]  Hong kong said x y and z and apple said okay x y and z we should you know, pull this app from the store
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.900]  Knowing I mean i'm not saying that the people at apple who made that decision
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.900]  who made that decision of
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:04.020]  Weren't fully aware that hey this looks terrible for us because it looks like we're flip-flopping all over the place reject accept
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:11.380]  Reject all within five days and they knew that that looks bad and they knew that that there were all these op-eds in china
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.580]  Decrying them for this and so they knew how weak it makes them look but they thought it was the right thing to do
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.660]  Because hong kong was asking for it
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:24.760]  Yeah, I I I think they were it was a like to your original point the minute that app was first projected
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.940]  By putting it back on the store that there was no
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.820]  Easy out for them on this whole thing
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.940]  It was either they have to keep it in the store and risk what is happening in hong kong and china
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.100]  Or take it down and risk being seen as an instrument of mainland china
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:45.860]  The whole the whole issue with apple and china is so fascinating because they are so deeply intertwined with china
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.060]  You know, one of my favorite things about reviews is when people say oh a phone shouldn't cost this much is if they have any
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.380]  Idea what a phone what goes into making a phone?
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:59.380]  and the reason the phones don't cost way more in part is the way that they're manufactured and
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:05.220]  Apple has been leveraging that in china for years. There's no easy exit for them there
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.980]  and at the same time tim cook has this consistent policy and you can see this everywhere from how he deals with
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:17.800]  Situations with the mining of materials to civil liberties in the us to engaging the trump administration
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:23.620]  To engaging china is that he believes if he's not part of the conversation. He has no ability to affect change
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:29.960]  but that's always dangerous because one you're going to get those editorials that say that you're appeasing people because engagement
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:36.740]  And appeasement is a very very small buffer between them and one can quickly be perceived as if not become the other
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.620]  But at the same time you give them a conduit back into you and it's often easier
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.760]  I think you said this really well in one of your posts a while ago. The only thing you can't tolerate is intolerance
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.700]  but by reaching out and making those engagements you give them a bridge back to you and they start to
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.900]  Whether they actually influence your policy or not. It's perceived again that they're influencing your policy
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.820]  So apple has all of these things happening in china the removal of the courts app
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:04.980]  Tim cook being elected chairman of the china is a very important part of the policy
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:10.420]  App tim cook being elected chairman of the business school, which you know could have been anybody it used to be
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:15.620]  There's a whole bunch of us ceos on that board and they all take turns and but right now at the same time
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:20.340]  It just happens to be his turn and could he have gone? No, no, give it to zuckerberg this time
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:25.940]  I'll take it next time but all these things happen at once and it creates really bad optics for them
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.900]  And the concern is always that china for example wants iCloud storage
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:36.580]  Um in china and people will find that dangerous but by the same token there are a lot of people outside the u.s
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.380]  Who want nothing to do with having data stored in the us right now?
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.580]  And france wants their you know, their citizens their data and that's going to be an increasing movement around the world
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.900]  But the fear is that china will ask for encryption keys one day the same way
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:53.380]  the fbi were asked for a back door the same way the us government did and
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.480]  The us government you can see it. It's apparent. There's a legal battle. There's litigation
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.800]  Uh, all this stuff happens in the open where with china it's not that form of government
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.160]  and I think that's sort of the fear that underlies all this is that
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.960]  When it happens in china, it's going to be much harder for apple to affect to to sort of stand their ground especially given
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.000]  All the small negotiations that are happening now
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.960]  Uh, I forget what the context was
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.920]  This week, but I thought I had a good observation on um
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.320]  Something with apple in china where
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.360]  Apple didn't fully. Oh, I know what it was. It's the safe browsing story. Yeah
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:37.320]  So one of the other little stories this week was that uh safari as long had this safe browsing feature
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.940]  Where I didn't even notice when it expanded to include tencent which is the state-owned japanese conglomerate
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.200]  You know, but google famously is shut out of china at the moment
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.280]  So, you know if you're in china and you're on behind the china the great firewall
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.400]  You you can't use google search. You can't use google anything for the most part
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.960]  And so the safe browsing feature that safari has had for a while which uses a blacklist of either known or
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.820]  Pre for all effects and purposes known malware
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.280]  Or otherwise, you know stuff that you would want blocked
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.920]  Uh, safari uses google's server for this can't use it in china. So they use tencent
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.760]  but the way google or the way apple wrote the
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:31.560]  Description like if you're like, hmm, let me find out about this feature. Uh, yeah
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:38.440]  You it just said like apple. It just said like safari may send your ip address. Uh,
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.720]  Is like the privacy policy for the features like safari may send your ip address
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.040]  To uh, google or tencent. Yeah, it was completely tone-deaf. Uh, and people
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.080]  rightly, uh
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.320]  Jump to the the plain reading of it
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.960]  Which is that you don't know if when they're using one or the other and so they might be you know
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.320]  You might be in the united states
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.880]  You might be in the middle of tennessee or texas and they're sending your ip address to its server in china
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.920]  And a state-owned media conglomerate which is a very good example of that
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.360]  And they're sending your ip address to its server in china and a state-owned media conglomerate with all your eyes
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.680]  The the feature is as you would expect from apple
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:23.880]  It is designed with privacy in mind and it uses hashed URLs and prefixes of the URLs instead of the whole thing to keep
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.560]  You know google
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.880]  Or tencent from seeing the specific URLs you're visiting. There's no way to avoid
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:35.000]  Well, I guess I shouldn't say there's no way I guess they could proxy the calls through an apple server
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.240]  Which is an interesting question as to why they're not
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:44.840]  why you know the ip address is getting sent to these providers because safari is calling them directly and you know, you can
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:49.320]  I I guess there's a performance argument there that proxying is
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.000]  By necessity going to have an extra hop where your device is talking to apple and apple's talking
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.880]  To google and then google talks back to apple and then apple potential source of failure
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.080]  Which is what happens with syria when it's like wait a second. Hold on
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:09.080]  Uh, so, you know, there's obviously reasons for performance and simplicity to let your device talk directly to google
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.800]  Uh, and then there's reasons of privacy where you'd want it proxied. Um, anyway, that's a separate
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.080]  Thing to me. The problem was was the the way this uh,
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.800]  Feature was described by apple. Absolutely and what I wrote is
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:30.600]  Trust us is not good enough like effectively these things are sort of written with a trust us attitude that look you can trust us
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.200]  Look, you can trust us. We're apple and so my assumption when this story broke last weekend was well
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:42.600]  I would guess that they're only using tencent for users in mainland china and they're using google everywhere else in the world
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.320]  And in fact that is how the feature works
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.720]  But they didn't say that and so the people who jump to the wrong conclusion
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:57.240]  I don't think they're crazy and I happen to know it ties into hong kong specifically because this story went nuts in the hong kong
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.240]  Um
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.560]  The the multi-user chat groups that they use what do they use, uh, what's the app, uh,
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.560]  I forget
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.800]  I'm, not sure it's weibo in china. I'm not sure what it is. It's not signal. It's the other one
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960]  No, the one that starts with the t
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.440]  Telegram telegram. Yeah, so telegram
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:22.760]  Uh supports big multi-user chats. And so there's a whole bunch of groups in in in hong kong who are using telegram
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.400]  And and it went rampant when it's old, you know, super, you know, uh,
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.960]  You know like kindling going up in a in a fire
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:38.200]  viral of hey turn off safe browsing because they're going to send your ip address to tencent and
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.560]  You know protesters in hong kong obviously don't want anything sent. I mean your ip address isn't that
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.040]  You know, it doesn't reveal that much about you
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.360]  But you know if I were a protester in hong kong
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:53.480]  I'd want to be sure that my even my ip address wasn't being sent to china. I don't want it sent to google
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.880]  So I totally get that and so the downside to this is that anybody who got caught up in this?
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.680]  You know, it could really it wasn't getting sent to tencent. It was getting sent to google
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:09.400]  Uh, but you could wind up disabling a useful feature, you know that and now all of a sudden you're browsing
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.840]  You think you've made your browsing safer because you've protected yourself from having your ip address sent to tencent
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.520]  but it wasn't being sent there in the first place and now you're
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:24.360]  liable, you know, you're susceptible to all the sites that safe browsing would have blocked you from which might be sites that the
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:30.520]  That the yes, the chinese government is using to try to hack hong kong protesters. Yeah
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.000]  uh
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.680]  and so anyway trust this isn't good enough and and my take my my quip was
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.880]  If apple is too embarrassed to explain in detail exactly what they're doing to comply with chinese law
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:47.240]  Then they shouldn't be doing it and I really feel like they I wish that they had a white paper describing in more detail
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.520]  How the setup is that icloud users?
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.960]  Server data is stored in mainland. China
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:00.440]  On third-party company hardware. I wish that they would describe that in as much detail as they as they could
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.160]  Instead my understanding is that it's there but apple retains the encryption keys
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.680]  But I it shouldn't be our understanding. There should be a white paper that explains it in my opinion
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:18.680]  Uh, you know and so that you can make your own informed decision about how likely it is that the chinese police could
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.360]  store them in and demand stuff how what what
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:31.000]  What what the dangers are just that the chinese government might have moles working for the company that hosts these servers, etc
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.800]  Etc, but we don't know anything. It's it's way more of a black box than it should be in my opinion
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.800]  And I don't mean to be flippant about it at all. But you know that that line from
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.460]  Um equilibrium where he said the easiest way to get a weapon from a grammaton cleric is to ask him for it
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.300]  They just made tik toks. We just all give them our ip address and everything anyway
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:53.900]  It's not like they need to trick us into it anymore. They just made a catchy social media company
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.940]  Yeah, yeah, ben and ben thompson has some good takes on this where you know
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.100]  And his observation which is to me was very keen and i'm like, yeah
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.900]  Why isn't everybody saying this is that with the nba thing?
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:11.420]  So the this nba executive dan mori, I think his name is who tweeted this one pro hong kong
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.020]  Tweet which was really just like stand up for hong kong. It wasn't like
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.540]  You know hong kong should set the city on fire. It was you know
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:21.180]  We support hong kong. Yeah
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:29.900]  It was tweeted it's on it which is a social network that is completely blocked within china and yet somehow the chinese state media
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:36.220]  Would have us believe that millions of chinese nba fans saw this tweet and were deeply offended by it
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:42.140]  like, you know, I thought it was a pretty keen observation of uh, this is manufactured because
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:44.780]  How could us how could one?
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:50.620]  Message on a social network bandwidth in china have caused millions of people to be angry in china. They can't read it
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:55.420]  But meanwhile thing meanwhile we on the west with our open values
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:03.020]  Uh, totally allowed. So we allow them to block our social networks. Yeah, I mean here I am standing up for facebook, you know, uh,
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:08.700]  But I mean on principle it doesn't seem right that that we allow them to say yeah
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:15.020]  No instagram in china, but we'll take tik tok and let everybody install it on their phones and if it's fun enough people will have it
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.020]  Yeah, no, absolutely it's uh
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.780]  It it well the thing that scares me is that this is like there's that old saying from the west wing where
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:29.340]  There's no amount of there's no amount of manpower or money that equals a criminal being stupid
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:33.260]  And a lot of the stuff that we see all the time is buffoonery. It's just so dumb
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.660]  It's easy to catch and especially with this stuff
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:40.940]  It creates such a streisand effect that it ends up shining a huge light on on things that are happening
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.420]  But it's the stuff that we don't hear about that worries me
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.300]  It's the requests that get made that aren't, you know, oh as we saw twitter for an nba that's ludicrous
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:54.140]  It's just absolutely ludicrous, but it's the stuff that's not uh, so above board or or so public that's
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.100]  So public that I worry more about. Yeah, totally
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:29:59.740]  uh
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:04.540]  so anyway apple they're in a tough spot in china, I think that it could get I think that
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:09.420]  My takeaway from this this whole saga though, is that it's not that apple
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.580]  Just got through a terrible
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.700]  Exposure
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:24.060]  To to their foothold in china. It's that it just sort of hinted at how bad it could be
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.780]  Yes, right. Like what happens?
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:33.900]  I mean if there is a tiananmen square like crackdown on the hong kong protesters, you know
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:36.700]  What happens if if if the chinese government?
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:43.420]  Sends, you know the their military into hong kong to put it put an end to this, you know, it's yeah
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:51.500]  Yeah, they you know, they're it's it's in my opinion right up there with natural disasters, you know as
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.020]  Which would affect every company though, right?
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:01.100]  like apple is sort of uniquely exposed in china as as a western company because no other
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.260]  western company is so reliant on them for manufacturing and
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:10.700]  You know the this the second factor of apple's sales within china
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:15.100]  It's like this more or less tied, you know, it goes back and forth it ebbs and flows more
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:20.940]  But you know us is the is the biggest market us, you know, or call it north america if you want to include
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:23.260]  You know our canadian friends like you
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.620]  You know the north america is the biggest market
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:32.380]  China and europe greater western europe are more or less tied as their second biggest markets
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:36.300]  It's a big market for apple. It's certainly one of growth
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:41.420]  It's certainly part of their growth story and everybody knows growth is important for the message of apple to wall street
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:47.420]  It would obviously be a shit show if apple had to pull out or if their sales within mainland
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:53.500]  China were decimated through bad publicity or tariffs or any of their various things that could go bad, but apple
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.140]  Could exist as we know it
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.380]  with their sales in
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.940]  Two consumers in mainland china being cut off. It would be a significant hit
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.380]  It would be reflected in the stock price. But apple as we know it would would still be there, you know, it would be like
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:13.500]  I don't know. I think ball parking it. I don't know like 20 percent 25 percent something like that
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.140]  Yeah, and it's hard too because even if it's not a disaster
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.700]  Sorry, keep going. No keep going
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.580]  No, I was gonna say even if it's not something like an incident in hong kong even if it's something like tariffs
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:30.700]  And people will say well apple represents way too much of the gross domestic product of southern china for
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:37.020]  Any of that to like the chinese government to want to affect that in any way, but they have a remarkable ability for absorbing pain
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:42.140]  I I think we don't understand the extent at which they would allow something to happen. That was
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:48.460]  Moderately that was even severely painful for them if it was worse for whomever they were contending with
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:54.540]  Yeah, and just the if the tariffs got too bad and it destroyed apple's ability to compete manufacturing in china
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.100]  Even if it cost every job in shengzhen province
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:00.780]  I don't think they would have it. I don't think at the end of the day they would have that big a problem with it
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.940]  yeah, uh
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:07.740]  You know the manufacturing thing is just the angle that cannot be it just cannot be understated, you know
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.780]  And there was a story that you know, the wall street journal just had a story over the weekend
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:15.580]  Do you see this about how you know, there's iphone 10r's I think being made in india now
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:20.860]  Which is a weird thing to see it's you know, just a weird thing to see that small print that says
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:24.140]  You know designed by apple in california assembled in india
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.580]  But india the indian national government is making a huge press
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:35.420]  To appeal to smartphone manufacturers in particular to to build up india as a major production center
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.460]  for smartphone hardware
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.780]  and you know apple's part of it, but it's
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.960]  Even if they put the pedal to the metal and and accelerated
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:47.340]  their
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.700]  trying to
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.060]  to become
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:54.300]  independent of china if they wanted to for manufacturing and assembly
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:00.140]  Even the fastest they could do it the most efficient way if they didn't make any mistakes
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:04.380]  Made all the right moves spent as much money as they needed to it's still a years-long process
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.300]  possibly
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:12.620]  Many years long fascinating made a deliberate choice not to own the core technologies when it comes to manufacturing and that gives them exposure
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.300]  Right, there's absolutely exposed and it in particular the iphone, you know, it's everybody knows it's a technology
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.980]  You know, it's the most important best-selling biggest revenue and profit maker
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.860]  Will be for years to come
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.300]  It's utterly dependent on china at the moment
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.940]  All right, let me take one final break here and thank our third and final sponsor
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:38.380]  Of this episode of the talk show

[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.500]  10
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.700]  Off my thanks to squarespace for their continuing support
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.660]  of this podcast
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:33.980]  All right, how about this let's go forward thinking do we do it are you done I think we're done on china
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:40.620]  What do you think? Yes, I agreed. Uh apple event as we record this could this is the sort of segment of a podcast
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:46.620]  That could be could be blown apart by between recording and publishing but as we speak on monday
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.620]  October 21st
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:53.260]  There are no signs no invitations. No rumors that i've seen that there's going to be an apple event
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.900]  This fall another no
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.540]  No event this month at least
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:01.820]  Uh, it's possible. I look back at the last few years
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:07.420]  So last year they sent out invitations on the 18th of october for the october 30 event. That was in brooklyn
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:13.920]  Two years before that in 2016. They sent out invitations on october 19th
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.480]  For I think it was the last ever event at town hall in cupertino
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:22.780]  But that was only eight days ahead. It was actually on the 27th and it was weird
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.260]  it was a thursday, which is I don't remember that but
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:29.580]  Uh, it was right. So i'm going to use the dreaded my understanding language again
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:35.180]  But my understanding is they're way too busy learning launching launching tv plus to have the resources to do an event in october
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:41.180]  That that sounds right to me, uh october because they're all over the place that the premiere is right, right?
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.620]  Uh, the pr is spread thin. Um, yeah
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.540]  And that's launching november 1st, right? Yeah, uh
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:54.780]  That makes sense to my knowledge apple has never held a fall event in november
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:58.380]  And the closer you get to thanksgiving the more impossible it would be
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.460]  uh, also the further along you get
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.540]  the
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:09.020]  Less anything that you want to announce would have time to factor into holiday gift purchases
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:17.580]  What do we think is coming the three products my guess is like my guess is that it won't be consumer
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:22.140]  Products, it'll be professional products and it'll be similar
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.540]  Like I know they didn't show anything off at wwc the way they did with the imac pro
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:30.880]  But my my guess is still that it'll be something like that, you know where they have a very specific
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:37.420]  Not a giant media event, but they have a bunch of stuff put together to show us how the products are used in context
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:43.900]  Yeah, well the big we get our introduction that way the one product we've already been told by apple is to expect this calendar year
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:50.480]  Is the mac pro right when they and to me what's instructive is to go back to 2017
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:54.860]  When they were on a similar schedule with the imac pro where they showed it at
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:59.840]  They showed it at wwdc in june said you can expect it later this year
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.400]  And then they didn't have an event for the the
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.000]  Launch of the imac pro what they did was hold small private media briefings
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.320]  In new york, and I believe in cupertino as well so that west coast
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.000]  Media didn't have to travel to new york and vice versa from from the east coast
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.880]  and there was no keynote there was nothing that was live broadcast it was just
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.000]  Small briefings of groups. I think I was in like a group of like six or something like that
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.520]  And they had multiple demos set up in in their little townhouse and well little
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.240]  their big townhouse in new york
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:44.160]  Where we would just move from station to station and they'd show us, you know, here's here's what the imac pro means for developers
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:50.960]  Here's what it means for 3d people who do 3d modeling and rendering and here's what it means in, you know, these other demos
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.640]  There you go, I could see them doing that exact sort of thing again with the mac pro
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.040]  I could even see them doing it again if there is as rumored a 16-inch macbook pro coming before the end of the year
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:10.240]  Because what do you got what would you even if it wasn't a time compression like oh we're so busy with
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.480]  The tv plus that we don't even have time to do this event. What are you going to do with a 16-inch macbook pro?
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.120]  You've already shown catalina. What's the demo? You know, what is the story to be held on stage?
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:25.680]  You know, they don't hold stage events just because there's a new product. They have to have something to talk about
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.960]  And they're not going to talk about how bad the keyboard was for right
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.160]  Right. They're totally not going to do it
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.160]  um
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.120]  Yeah, they're you know, they might talk about how great the new keyboard is
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.320]  But they're not going to talk about how bad the old keyboard was. Uh, yeah
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.280]  so the only other product that's rumored that might
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:49.280]  You know come out before the end of the year at least that i'm aware of is the air pods with noise cancellation
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.680]  Yeah, and again that's pro because everything's pro
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.920]  They could just hold a briefing for that and tell the press how great they sound I don't see them holding an event for that
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.000]  Yeah, no likewise. So I guess the one last thing I wanted to talk about this week
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  is
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:11.060]  A little bit on catalina, which i've been playing with a little and uh catalyst in particular, which you sort of need catalina
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.600]  To do and I just know I just know for the whole next year
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.520]  I'm going to say catalyst when I mean catalina and catalina i've been doing that too
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.800]  Because it's just I I make errors like that it's
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.940]  You know talking about like hashing algorithms. It's just I I file stuff in my head alphabetic
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:35.640]  alphabetically and c-a-t-a-l just doesn't have many items in it and to have two of them
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  Be related to the same
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.280]  version of mac os
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.800]  Is is really going to screw me up. So I apologize to everybody out there listening for all of the
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.960]  Catalyst catalina conflations i'm about to make the draft for my review. I called it mac os catalyst
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  I had to fix it before it went live
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.440]  In the headline
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.520]  Yeah, I could totally i'm glad you caught it. I I
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:07.320]  Would you know they had press briefings for catalina for the whole os?
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.000]  The week before it it shipped
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.040]  And
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.320]  You know apple pr reached out to me to see if i'd be interested in going up to new york to to
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.120]  To have the briefing and I was and I thought boy that's weird though
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.000]  Like I was kind of more intrigued than I would have been because in my head I thought that they said it was a briefing
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.240]  Entirely about catalyst and I thought whoa, this might be this might be really interesting
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:39.480]  Are they they're preemptively having an entire briefing just about this catalyst thing and then I realized it wasn't it was catalina
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.160]  It was the whole
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.720]  Just a you know, just a recap of the whole song and dance of all that. It wasn't it was i'm glad I went
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.720]  It was useful. It was interesting
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.680]  um
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.000]  But it wasn't anywhere near as juicy as I thought it would have been if it would have been catalyst specific
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.360]  um
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.520]  So anyway, are you using catalyst or not catalyst catalina on your primary machine?
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.240]  I did I I don't usually do it because I have to edit video on it and I have to edit podcasts on it
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.520]  And i'm very nervous about it
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.320]  But again, I just I was using an alternate machine and it just wasn't enough to actually review it
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:13.480]  I felt like I had to use it. So I put it on my main machine and it had some ups and downs
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560]  But it's pretty solid now
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.840]  So one of the big changes is that 32-bit apps are now gone and you know apple
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:28.520]  Managed this transition about as well as they could they gave plenty of heads up years ago at starting at wwdc is that you know?
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.240]  soon enough
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.520]  You know that at that whatever point they made the announcement 32-bit
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.200]  Frameworks no leopard. It was up on remember bertram put up the huge 32-bit banner at snow leopard
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.360]  Was that really when they first started I think they mentioned it a little bit with leopard
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.320]  But it was like a it was a headline feature in snow leopard. Was that just though going to 64-bit?
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.320]  That's yeah. Yeah
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:55.320]  As soon as they went to 64-bit apps
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.680]  Everybody should have known that eventually they're going to do away with 32-bit apps and it took a long time and that's the way it
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.120]  should be
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.000]  You know, I think it took longer on the mac than then
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.200]  Then it did on ios ios made the transition
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:14.360]  Quicker and that's the way it should be because the mac is you know, it's just the nature of a desktop computing platform
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.560]  So I don't think apple made a wrong decision at all
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.320]  Um, it might have been too long
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.920]  It's like you know how sometimes you forget to plug in your ipad because the battery lasts so long
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:27.960]  You have to plug this was like it was like 10 years and I think some companies like oh, they're never gonna do it
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.360]  We're safe, you know, that's that's funny you say that, you know, I didn't really think about that
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.960]  But I think you're right that there might have been it might have been too long. I don't know
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.400]  But every time one of these transitions gets made or when something goes away
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:46.760]  You know, it's a little sad, you know that there's you know, uh, dry. It's that sad the drag thing doesn't run anymore. Um,
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:52.840]  You know, there's some 32-bit stuff that isn't going to make the 64-bit transition and it's a bit sad
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.440]  But it was sad when classic went away. I hadn't you know, nobody who really
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:03.880]  Whatever your however fond your memories of classic mac os were and minor is super fond and there there are you know entire essays
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.960]  I could write about things of the user interface of the classic mac os that I still think were vastly superior to anything
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:12.440]  That's come since including mac os and ios
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:19.720]  But running classic apps in mac os 10 was never a great experience never looked right never felt right
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  But once the the classic layer was removed from mac os 10 it still was you know a poor one out moment
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.280]  You know that you can't even launch these things anymore without an emulation layer
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:36.920]  Emulation layer, uh for me personally. I I I don't think there's anything that I use. That's 32-bit. I went through
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.480]  There's a way to check in
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.360]  I think the best way because it's not just checking what's running like in in
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.440]  The activity monitor you can you can add the in activity monitor. You can go up to the view menu. I think in
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:57.320]  In the columns that are displayed you can display type and it'll it'll say whether it's a 64 32-bit app
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.920]  And if you sort by that column, you can see if you have any 32-bit stuff
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.520]  running
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.520]  If you go to about this mac
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:10.520]  And then go to the system report when you go to applications, it'll show all the applications that are installed on your system
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.320]  in your applications folder
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.920]  Uh, which is a better way of seeing if you have anything laying around that that won't run if you upgrade
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.760]  And I think that even when you run the upgrader the updater from 10 14 to 10 15
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:30.600]  It'll it'll even then point out. Hey, you've got this x y and z apps installed that won't run
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:35.400]  You know, they're doing as much as you can. I don't I think it's a non-issue for the most part
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.720]  Because a lot of plugins seem to get bit especially audio plugins. Yeah, that's yeah
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.640]  That seems like a huge thing and I know a couple people who work on audio apps
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:51.080]  Uh, it seems like that's a really big deal and on sort of unfortunate, I guess
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.320]  Yeah, I don't know why they haven't made the transition. You would think they'd be actively maintained, but
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.400]  They're not
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:03.320]  Oh, yeah, I was I was wondering if adobe was going to make it on time because adobe they did. Yeah
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.200]  uh
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.760]  So, you know and I I have upgraded a machine
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.800]  it's not my primary machine and I know that one of the other things about
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:15.320]  Catalina that people are complaining about is that they've tightened up some of the
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.280]  um
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.680]  You know, it's it's that fine line between is it a security feature or a privacy feature?
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.120]  It's a little bit of column a a little bit of column b, but you you know
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:34.120]  They've they've made the desktop a magic location that apps have to have special permission, you know, like such and such app is trying to read
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  Read files from your desktop
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:43.240]  the first time you launch an app that was already open when you upgraded and then and and had
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:47.880]  Documents from the desktop the downloads file and the documents folder open at the time
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.240]  Yeah, and it tries to reload them
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.760]  God help you because it starts asking permission for every directory for every every file that you had open at the time
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.960]  So there's you know
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.680]  It takes some getting used to I I really I have a rant in me about it
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.840]  Like I kind of see why apple's doing this
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.800]  But it really doesn't play well in the context of that classic get a mac
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.320]  ad yeah, where where the john hodgman pc got upgraded to vista and was
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.880]  How do you do you authorize this? Yes or no? Do you authorize that? Yes or no, you know?
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.160]  Every it'll only ask you once but for every app that'll only ask you if you want to download once but for every website
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.360]  Yeah
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.520]  It's it's a lot. Uh
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.760]  And it brings in it
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:41.320]  I get it. I get why they're doing this. I think some of these things are in response to actual malware attack vectors
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.960]  That apple is aware of
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.920]  My son ran into one I I think I talked about this on the show a year or two ago
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.200]  But my son ran into one about two years ago, maybe 18 months ago, but it was really interesting
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:00.680]  Where he somehow stumbled on a site or he clicked on something. It wasn't like super dubious
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.680]  Wasn't like he was trying to download, you know crack games or something like that
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:11.480]  You know crack games or something like that. Yeah, I forget, you know, he could reproduce it and and there was a url where he
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.580]  It was like a fake amazon result and he I guess he kind of clicked on it accidentally
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.280]  but what it did is it went to
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.640]  It went to one of these sites claiming that your
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.280]  Uh
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.800]  mac had
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.280]  That the site had detected that your mac had malware and that's why it was running slow
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:35.960]  And that you needed to call this number and i'm sure if you did call it
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.280]  You know that they would do talk you into it
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:38.520]  You know
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:44.760]  there's everybody knows people who've had family members fall victim to this or you call them up and they talk you into installing like a
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.800]  Backdoor on your mac. Yeah
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:50.520]  Just terrible stuff terribly shifty stuff
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:56.360]  But the the do the the devious part of this website my son stumbled upon was what they were doing
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.600]  was
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.600]  sending your browser
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600]  downloads of
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:10.700]  They were like empty text files or maybe they were like text files that contained four characters like just just literally just like
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.580]  Two or three characters and and but they were sending them as fast as as they could
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:22.860]  And safari even just a year or two ago was willing to say, okay, you're going to send me all these downloads
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:25.020]  I'll download them as fast as as fast as I can
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:30.060]  And and just by downloading as many of these files as it could as fast as it could
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:37.340]  It made safari really slow. It really was it slowed down it exactly as the website promised it didn't
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:42.140]  Install anything it wasn't a your you know, there was no malware running on your machine
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:48.320]  But it slowed your browser down so fast that if you couldn't if you didn't know like the trick to force quit safari
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:55.040]  To force quit safari, um, it was tough to get out of like it was so slow
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:58.640]  It slowed safari down so far so fast that you couldn't really close the window
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.680]  So you could you know, totally see how people would fall for it
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:07.840]  And i'm sure that there's a hundred other tricks that are similarly a bunch of google ad hijacks that would just send you to
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  A fake website. Yeah
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:14.720]  So there's all sorts of stuff i'm sure you know that are out there and but I
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.680]  I some of this stuff though. It's like tightening up safari I get because I really do feel like you know, you're out
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.160]  You don't know what you're getting there
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.780]  I feel like having apps that beg for permission to to read files off your desktop
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:36.720]  I feel like that's over the line. I feel like i'm not quite sure what and again, maybe i'm wrong and there there's apps that are
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.800]  taking advantage of this and just guessing that you have juicy personal stuff on your desktop and
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.880]  you know slurping all the data from it, but
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.880]  It just seems contrary to the way that the mac is they try to mitigate it
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.720]  Like if you double click or if you drag it's an explicit user action
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:58.240]  So that overrides the check but it's just like when you do that reinstall and you already have stuff open
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.000]  You don't have the opportunity to drag anything. So it's like the worst case scenario
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.920]  And it's just it it's just so telling
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:13.440]  You know, it's so much cleaner on even though ios and ipad os are more still more limiting overall in terms of being able to
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:17.200]  use an app that can just see the real file system and I know that you know, there's
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:23.600]  The files app has beefed this up and there's integration with with dropbox. But if you're treating data as files
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:29.440]  As opposed to just being a a library app, right?
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.400]  Like when you use photos and you use the apple notes app you don't treat the individual
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:40.640]  Photos as files. You don't treat notes as files. They're just items in a in a library
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:42.640]  Which is the sort of modern way to have
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:49.280]  Multiple bits of data in an app and and in a lot of cases it's it's great. It's just conceptually simpler. It's neater. You're
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.200]  You're
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.480]  Successfully encapsulating the file system from the user
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:02.080]  It you're not missing anything by not having these in you know, your individual hundreds of notes as individual files in a file system
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:07.600]  But if you really do want to deal with documents in the traditional document mindset
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:13.280]  Ios's way is still limiting right and the mac is just natural
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.920]  It's just the way you know that when you boot up into a mac
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.200]  It still is the case where the default application that's running is the finder which is the file system app
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:29.840]  I feel like nannying all these decisions with are you sure you want to let this app read from the desktop is
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.840]  Just it's just a pain in the ass
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400]  And I really kind of wish
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.320]  there were if it's even if there is a good idea for this I really wish that there was a
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.000]  Developer mode for lack of a better word and I feel like the calling it developer mode
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:51.840]  Would would properly scare scare the people off who shouldn't be turning it on
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:55.440]  You know as opposed to calling it advanced user mode or something
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:02.960]  Just call it developer mode and it would turn off almost all of that stuff and just say I trust that i'm not
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.480]  Getting tricked into installing malware on my on my mac
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:12.080]  Let me run the mac the way I was running it five six years ago where I can write scripts and
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.400]  Not have to have not have to tell the system that terminal app has full disk
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:24.080]  Access and stuff like that. Just call it a little bit of that like they call it advanced user mode
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:27.040]  A little bit of that like they got rid of the option to run any app now
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:30.480]  There's only app store and certified apps. That's right and uh
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.400]  But you can go into terminal and type in a command then it restores the button for
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:41.360]  Running the app, but that's just one at a time. There's no like konami code to unlock all of it, right? I I just feel like
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.240]  The way that this has been added
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.080]  over time
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  to a design
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.040]  That is you know
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:56.080]  That is the way mac os 10 was originally conceived from the next era through the the you know, the transition period in 2000
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:57.760]  uh
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.760]  circa 2000 let's say
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.320]  It's resulted in this system where you have to do these things 100 times, you know
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:09.840]  Maybe that's an exaggeration, but you have to drag each app and drag, you know into full disk access
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.040]  And you have to authorize this and authorize that whereas I really feel like
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:18.480]  There should be a way to and you have to jump all over the system to get these different things, right?
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.480]  And god bless them like apple gets no exemption
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.520]  I launched quicktime for the first time and drew to a screen record. I had to launch settings go in check a box
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.760]  And then quick time and then reload and then it says like if you want it to apply
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.120]  You've got to quit and restart the app, which is like very skype or something
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.480]  I really feel like there should be a they should take into account
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.200]  A way that if you really want to turn that stuff off
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:45.200]  It's it's either all one check box like an idea I had is you know how like right now you can
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.840]  in users and groups you can have
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.780]  Administrator accounts and then you can have standard users and a standard user
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.260]  Is limited in all sorts of ways where they can't delete apps. They have to have an admin password
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:02.340]  Well, why not make in addition to an administrator account? Why not make a developer account and you can just have an entire account?
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:04.820]  That's you know has all all the
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:11.860]  All the powers of an administrator plus the powers of a developer, which is mostly I trust the software on my mac. Yes
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.140]  Yeah, i'm a grown-ass adult and I want to make these decisions
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.900]  I mean, well i'm an or you know, i'm an expert, you know, like, you know
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:23.700]  I'm an expert and I I trust myself to control the software that's running on my mac
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.940]  And it's a lot of little things too
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.540]  Like I didn't notice this when I wrote my review
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:32.020]  But I was using music and I right clicked and I said show me and find it it worked fine
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:35.480]  And then I went to podcasts and I wanted to get the actual file for the podcast
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:38.900]  And I right clicked and that option doesn't exist because it's a catalyst app
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:43.060]  It doesn't it's not aware of i'm sure they could put it in but they didn't and so it's one less
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:46.340]  It's one less feature that I use occasionally that's available to me
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.800]  Well, that brings me to my next section, which is the catalyst griping
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:59.140]  Which could be an entire episode of the show and maybe will be in the coming weeks, but at the moment, you know
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:05.060]  Let's keep it short. Uh, well shortish short by the standards of a segment on this podcast
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.780]  um
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.780]  the catalyst apps
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:11.780]  I mean there's
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:13.780]  Two groups of them. I mean there's apple's own
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:16.340]  and then there's uh
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.340]  Third-party ones that are now in the app store
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:23.220]  The
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:24.660]  apple ones
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.620]  are
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.820]  Home, well, there's the the ones that we had from last year home
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:33.460]  News and stocks which I consider one app because they're really sort of the same
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.940]  stocks is just a
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:39.780]  Version of news that has business related news. Yeah
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.520]  but voice memos and podcasts
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:49.300]  Or I guess podcast was was is new this year. So the four from last year home news stocks voice memos
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.340]  Uh, all of these are weird and unmack like in their own ways
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:55.860]  uh
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:00.820]  and people including some people from apple last year said well that's early give them time and then
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:06.040]  This year they didn't really look much improved at all and craig fedorigi
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.440]  I forget who he was. Was it who talking to vitici? I mean, but
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:17.560]  After wwdc said well, you know, these are design decisions. They're not I asked him about it on stage at my live podcast
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:24.200]  Talk show too. Yeah, and he said, you know, they're not technical limitations. They're design limitations, which is sort of a euphemistic way of there's
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:27.800]  There's untalented people designing these apps
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:34.440]  Honestly, or they were experimenting but then later on he said, you know, but you know, it's early in the beta
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:39.560]  They'll improve by the end. Well, they didn't improve at all. I don't if they changed anything other than to fix bugs
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:43.880]  I didn't I can't notice it. I mean the home app still looks like an ios app
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:49.400]  A lot. I mean it even has the weird ios like controls for the date picker
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.080]  There were no design changes
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.040]  They optimized a few things in terms of the mechanics of the apps
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.600]  But the designs didn't change and and that using ios controls in a mac app
[01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:02.280]  Especially one from apple. It's it's mind-blowing to me
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:05.320]  I mean part of what made the iphone so
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:07.640]  great
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:13.560]  Right from the get-go was that they said at like a technical level, you know, they're we're building this, you know
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:16.840]  It's like a stripped down version of os 10 and and we've you know
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.120]  Taken our cocoa frameworks and made a new version for ios
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.920]  There was no leakage
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:29.000]  At all of anything that would that would look like a mac control
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.520]  On io iphone every single control that they had
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:38.600]  Was I mean like push buttons are the one example of a thing that works pretty much the same on a touch screen as on
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:40.040]  a mouse
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:41.000]  screen
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.960]  But things like date pickers or pop-up menus all had
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:51.960]  Very very ios style controls and even on the web even in mobile safari. They went out of their way
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:56.440]  To create every take every single standard html user interface control
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:59.320]  Like pop-up menus and do them in an ios way
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.980]  And even today in 2019
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:08.760]  Where one of the flagship features if not the flagship featured in my opinion of ipad os 13
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:18.360]  Is desktop desktop class browsing right where it reliably asserts itself as safari for mac as opposed to safari for iphone
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:24.680]  So that you get the mac what you'd see on a mac or any other desktop class browser in the ipad
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:31.660]  Even though that's true, and I think it they've it's just absolutely my very favorite thing about ipad
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:38.920]  Os 13 the hardest thing that that would that would drive me crazy if I had to go back to ios 12 on an ipad
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:46.200]  Even so they're not desktop style controls, right? It renders the page that way but you still get
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:53.480]  Touch optimized versions of these controls. They're not little tiny things that you need a pencil to touch
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.840]  A pencil to pick they have big fat finger size things that you can tap on
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:06.840]  Everything is touch optimized so to take something that's not mouse optimized at all and just stick it on the mac
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.160]  Almost literally unchanged. It's mind-boggling. It's just as offensive to me
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:17.960]  As as a ui connoisseur as it would have been if you had every once in a while had a tiny little
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.080]  menu bar show up in an iphone app
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.960]  The original windows on tablets, right? Yeah, it just it's mind-boggling to me
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.120]  Yeah
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:34.760]  So the two new apps this year for catalina are find my and podcasts. Those are both catalina apps as well
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:43.480]  Podcasts is the is that standout. It looks the most like it's non-catalyst siblings tv and
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.120]  music
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:54.360]  Um, there's obviously a lot of confusion out there between what's catalyst and what's not catalyst. I mean, I know a lot of people think
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  That the app store app
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:01.080]  Is catalyst because it is very ios e yeah
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.480]  There's an awful lot of things in the app store app that to me are ui mistakes
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:12.200]  But that they come across as ios isms. I mean the one that I I just think it's I just think it's a bad decision
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:18.280]  Is when you look at an app and you click like in your updates and and you can click more to read the release notes
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.760]  It opens up in a very ios style panel
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:27.400]  That has no close button or done button. It just it just is like a rectangle on your screen
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:31.160]  And the only way to close it is to click away which yeah, it's it's baffling
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:37.080]  It's a very that's just bizarre from a mac user's experience perspective of how
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.480]  A window or a sheet or anything like that would would be dismissed
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:46.280]  Like it's just strange. But anyway, it's not a catalyst app app store app. However, you know
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.120]  Ultimately the user shouldn't have to know that's a key point, right?
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:58.600]  And so like 32-bit versus 64-bit typical user never had any idea never should have had any idea
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.240]  Swift when swift became a way to make real mac apps
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:10.280]  There was no way to like double click an app and tell oh this app was written in swift and this one was written in objective c
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.960]  Like the programming language is not something that a user should ever have to worry about
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:20.520]  There were some tiny some things that you know you as an even as a non-developer
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.880]  You could kind of get a hint like you can always in the mac poke around
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.720]  In the you know, click on the control click or right click whatever you want to call it on the dot app bundle
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.960]  Show the package contests and poke around in there and look at the frameworks and until recently
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:42.440]  An app that used swift whether it was written entirely in swift or partially in swift had to include the swift frameworks within the app bundle
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  Because they weren't part of the system
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  for technical reasons
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:54.200]  That would that are irrelevant so you could poke around as a user and just poking around the app bundles tell if it used swift or not
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.120]  But as a typical user there was no sign of it
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:04.120]  Yeah, and that's how catalyst should be catalyst should not be something that users have to think like hey
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.960]  I know that this app is on the ipad and it's on my mac. Is this catalyst or is it just
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.200]  Appkit app and a ui kit app for the ipad you shouldn't have to know only developers should have to know
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:22.280]  But the truth is you look at these catalyst apps and they they do stick out there's telltale signs that these are catalyst apps
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.040]  Yeah
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:28.280]  And it's also it's hilarious that if an app kit app does something bad people assume was catalyst
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:34.600]  Yeah, that's very true. It's very telling so the podcast app so people are confused people think of music
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.560]  Tv and podcasts are all catalyst apps. They're not
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:41.660]  the music and tv apps are effectively
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:49.160]  Two forks of the old itunes app and you know, I love I just love I almost feel like it's a troll from apple
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:52.680]  That the preferences window is still a modal dialogue box
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.160]  They rewrote so much of those apps to make them look new and to separate stuff
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.800]  And yet they still have a modal dialogue box, which is just wonderful amazing to me
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:08.440]  It's all of these apps even like podcasts and music and tv is if you if you open up any list view or grid view
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:13.080]  And you click into anything you get this whole row that all it has is a back button in it a little yeah
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.120]  circle and that back that you go back and it just
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:19.640]  Blanks you back into the grid like an iPhone or a tablet or whatever
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:23.000]  You go back and it just blanks you back into the grid like on iOS
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:28.360]  The title becomes the title of the master view becomes the title of the detail view and it slides you back and forth
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:32.520]  So you're spatially aware here is just oh we're gonna throw an entire row up there stick a little button in
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:37.160]  And then cross fade you in and out. Yeah, and it's across all the apps and it's baffling to me, too
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:40.840]  And it's yeah, it just doesn't read well as immacula
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.160]  but then there's other things in the podcast app that are just telltale signs that just
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:48.520]  It just would never imagine a mac app let alone a mac app from
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:51.720]  Apple that doesn't support this so like you go into
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:59.080]  The episodes of a show and it lists them and you click on one you can use shift and an arrow key to extend the selection
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:01.160]  And select multiple episodes
[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:04.200]  Right now there's a thing you think oh that's cool because you know
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:09.080]  That's the thing you expect to be able to do in a mac app with a list view is select multiple items by shift
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:16.680]  Arrowing or command clicking on just continuous ones so you can select numbers one and three but not two
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:22.120]  But guess what if you hit command a which you would expect to select all the episodes nothing happens like
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.080]  Yeah, command a just isn't hooked up
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:27.000]  which
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  is like
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.680]  It I guess it's an oversight
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.240]  You know
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:37.160]  I bet they fix it because the podcast app really really goes out of its way to be as mac like as it possibly can
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.280]  but you the reason it sticks out is that
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:46.280]  Support for command a as select all in a list view isn't something that's part of the beauty of cocoa
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:49.320]  And the app kit frameworks. Is that the reason that
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:56.920]  Brand new apps never had oh we forgot about hooking up command a is that they didn't have to remember it because it just came for
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:04.200]  Free with appkit right like that's why you can't remember even a brand new app that didn't have support for select all
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:07.320]  Because it came for free and you didn't have to do that
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:15.320]  Because it came for free and you didn't have to keep this checklist of 50 60 100 standard little things that we have to hook up
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:22.040]  Manually because they don't come across for free because command a for select all isn't a thing on ui kit on ios
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.280]  I also mentioned that you can't right click and go to see the file in finder because there's no there's no directory all my
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:34.840]  Directories that had podcasts in are empty now and they're all some slash library slash podcast slash cache file, right?
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:37.800]  it's and that's just I
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:46.280]  Realize, you know, maybe that's the future we're heading towards but it to me. It's a future that would be best provided by a
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.240]  either an iPad
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:55.000]  OS device or another iOS device that is iOS on a laptop form factor not
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.080]  Mac OS like
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:00.320]  What Mac OS is to me is inextricably tied to being?
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:05.920]  If if you want like I think it's great that it has evolved in a way for casual users
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:08.980]  They don't really have to interact with files in the file system often
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:14.600]  but if you want to you should be able to and in an app like that where you know, the back end is a
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:19.000]  file like an image in photos or
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.680]  at a
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:28.420]  podcast episode and a podcast player you expect to be able to get to it in the finder somehow by and and the way that
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:33.080]  I you know, the most obvious thing to try that I would try is what you just tried is right-clicking on it
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:38.800]  and then you expect a reveal and finder menu item and you expect it to open a finder window and there it is and
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:45.100]  It doesn't work. Not so much. All right, and I get it like, you know when they move to Swift, you know
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:49.200]  Swift is gonna be a multi-year transition APFS is gonna be a multi-year transition
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.360]  Catalyst is gonna be a multi-year transition and next year's will be better than this year's
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.300]  It's just these feels so much more palpable because they're the apps that you're dealing with now
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.880]  I think most casual users never see APFS
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.640]  They never see Swift but boy do they see like home home dot app in front of them?
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:08.280]  So it you you were watching the sausage getting made and I don't think we're used to that
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:14.100]  Yeah, and you know, I don't know I played with the Twitter app a little bit and it's not horrible
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:18.580]  And I guess I'm I guess I would have to agree that it is better to have
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:26.440]  This Twitter app with a bunch of deficiencies that I would consider just standard in a Mac app then no Twitter app at all
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  but
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:32.040]  It is particularly galling to me with Twitter
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.520]  because
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:37.080]  I'm I'm opened and and
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:43.420]  Sensitive to the idea that like for a one or two person developer shop
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:46.160]  Yes that
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:51.840]  Maintaining fewer apps and less small a smaller code base is a huge advantage and that maybe it is
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:58.640]  The difference between being able to offer a Mac app and not and only having an iOS and iPad app
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:05.480]  Twitter doesn't have that excuse Twitter is a billion-dollar company with like 3,000 employees. Like what the hell are they doing?
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:12.440]  And in in addition to the fact that they can't beg poor, right?
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.900]  They can't say we can't afford to have a Mac development team. They're there
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:23.820]  They've when they acquired Tweedy and Lauren bricker back in the day. They acquired a one
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:32.220]  Person now again, Lauren bricker is a friend and a fine fellow and an ingenious UI designer and an incredibly
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:40.340]  Talented developer and is exceptional in all those regards including just being a good person. It really is an exceptional person. I
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:45.420]  Realize that that's you can't expect everybody to be a Lauren bricker
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:48.500]  but it was a one-person company that had a
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:50.880]  great I
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:54.260]  iPhone app a great real Mac app and
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:59.340]  Not just a great iPad app, but still to this date arguably the most innovative
[02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:07.560]  user interface in an iPad app that anybody's ever created that was pushing the boundaries that even Apple had defined for the experience of a
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:12.340]  Multi-level app and how you would navigate
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:18.140]  The depth of the hierarchy you were at and how you would indicate the depth of the hierarchy
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.940]  You're at all from one person and now yeah
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:24.280]  We're told that Twitter can't couldn't afford to keep up a Mac app
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.660]  And so this is great now
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:31.180]  They'll have a Mac app because they can use their iOS app and you we get this garbage
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:37.820]  And it's funny because you mentioned Ben said out Sandusky before how it his old job was doing the entire Twitter for Mac app
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:39.820]  It sounds like
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:44.500]  They've never invested in it it's perplexing yeah, it's it
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:47.580]  and I remember when they had
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.500]  It was you knew I knew the writing was on the wall
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:56.200]  And I'm a I'm a tweet bot user myself both Mac and iOS so part of it
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.700]  I'm not too concerned. You know because my use of Twitter isn't that affected
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:06.100]  But I would like to see that the native Twitter app be as good as possible
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:08.100]  Just
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:12.460]  On general principle and you realize that that's what most people are going to use
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:15.820]  but I knew the writing was on the wall when they added the
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:20.320]  The notification support for Twitter stuff in the system
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:26.520]  Multiple versions ago yeah, and when you'd click on it even if you had the Twitter Mac app installed
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:33.300]  It would open in the twitter.com website. Yeah, I remember asking about Apple about that, and they were like well
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:38.380]  That's off the record. That's what Twitter wanted yeah, like it wasn't Apple's decision
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.620]  It was Twitter's so even if you had the Mac app, and you opened like a DM notification
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.420]  It would open the DM in in the website even though you have their app installed
[02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.740]  Yeah, and even I used to keep out all the time, too
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:55.420]  But they keep changing Twitter just in ways that degrade the experience like they can no longer just pull up a thread anymore
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:59.780]  You have to do all these complex moves try to reassemble the thread and sometimes it doesn't work
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:02.460]  So you can't even see replies to your own message sometimes
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:08.980]  It's just and it's so frustrating yeah, it's like I don't know I'd still use it
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:15.260]  But yeah for like reading a thread especially a thread with that's even just a day or two old like so like that the
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:20.420]  Because they can't just pull up the thread they only can show the messages in the thread that they already have cached
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:27.580]  Yeah, and so if you're somebody is showing you a tweet from somebody you don't even follow you have to go to the website or
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:32.100]  Twitter dot app yeah, you know anyway. I just don't think it's a great app
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.740]  I don't think it's a great selling point of catalyst
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:38.940]  But it's you know maybe overall. It's better than I feared
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:43.620]  I guess that's my take so far on catalysts is that it seems like it's better than I feared
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.860]  I think the potentials there. I think apples
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:54.860]  I think the biggest question I have isn't whether catalyst is is a good or bad idea in principle it is
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:00.940]  Why did they decide it was worth shipping when they did because I don't think it's even this year
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:02.780]  I feel like it's a little iffy and
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:08.860]  An awful lot of the apps that are the best examples of it seem to have to jump out of UI kit into app kit
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:12.740]  Which seemingly defeats the whole purpose of doing it in the first place?
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:15.780]  Yeah, well this year in general
[02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:22.560]  I feel like last year was such a good balance of new features and going back and just maintaining on like you know paying down
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.460]  Foundational debt yeah, and this year it feels like they tried to catch up
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:33.060]  And it was just too much, and we've seen that just splatter all over the releases recently, and I you know and they
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:36.140]  Probably thought you know they would get all of this stuff done
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:37.340]  I don't know how they thought that
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:40.020]  But I hope we can just I think last year was a much better pace
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:41.660]  And if we could just stick to that pace
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.580]  We won't get as many new features every year
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:46.780]  But the ones that we do get will be better and the older ones will be maintained better
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:49.620]  And I think that's just a much better plan going forward
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:55.100]  Uh yeah, I hope so it's it is an interesting year-over-year
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:59.060]  Difference where it really was did seem like last year's hey
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:05.620]  We're focused on performance you know and bug fixing and making stuff smaller and just more reliable and working you know
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:09.020]  Getting this older you know if we support five years back
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:14.980]  We want this a version of iOS on a five-year-old phone to still run great and they did it and it was like wow
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:16.980]  This is unbelievable and then the next year
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:24.260]  Probably the I don't know inarguably inarguably is too strong a word, but by consensus the buggiest year in recent memory
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:29.540]  And a lot of thought again. I was I also have this thinking that instead of announcing
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:35.060]  This is what we're shipping for iOS 13. This is what we're shipping for Catalina. This is the next year of iOS
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:40.340]  This is the next year of Catalina and take the pressure off having to ship everything in September and if some stuff comes off in
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:44.900]  October if some stuff comes up in September in December if some stuff ships in March
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:50.660]  That's fine. Yeah, this is what you're gonna get. It's a roadmap for the next year. Yeah, and I would like to see it
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:52.660]  I I would really like to see
[02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:55.140]  Mac OS in particular
[02:15:55.140 --> 02:15:57.860]  I really don't feel like needs an annual update
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:15:58.500]  Yeah
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:02.820]  And I don't know how that now that they've gotten into that pattern and it seems it seems like
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:07.300]  Somebody at Apple is gonna listen to me say this and they're gonna say well we there's no way we could make you happy
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:11.860]  Because you know maybe a few years ago when they weren't on an annual update people
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:16.500]  Maybe even me in particular. We're complaining that the Mac wasn't getting updated frequently enough. I I
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:22.900]  I'm less audacious updates like make sure the whatever features you need to be parallel with iOS do that
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:25.780]  But don't you don't have to do I'll be happy with five amazing things
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:30.500]  I don't need ten things that are struggling to ship right to me the stuff that I only thing
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:36.020]  I get it that iOS is on an annual update because the hardware is on an annual update right and and that's
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:39.780]  Important to Apple financially right now and it's important in the competitive landscape
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.820]  It's just cell phones are you know, they're just so
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:45.860]  They're just so big so much bigger than everything else
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:49.540]  and so if there's a new iPhone every September and are really
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:56.020]  You know, of course technically if they didn't have an iPhone next year in September
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.420]  It wouldn't be the end of the world for the company
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:03.060]  But it would certainly be bizarre and a sign that something had gone terribly wrong
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:09.540]  so there you know for some definition of has to there has to be a new iPhone every September and if you have a new iPhone
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:12.920]  And if there has to be a new iPhone every September there has to be a new version of iOS
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:21.700]  And it would be really really hard to separate just the hardware specific stuff that requires a new version from the feature related stuff
[02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:28.180]  But it just bleeds over to now if we're going to do a Mac OS version 2
[02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:31.300]  All of the new features that are Mac specific
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:35.640]  We have to do at the same time that we do the features like sidecar
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:40.200]  Which yeah, obviously by definition needs the Mac to go
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:47.240]  To get new stuff in in addition to the iOS stuff at the same time the new reminders has to sync between iOS and Mac OS
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:50.040]  I would like to see them just
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:57.560]  Put the Mac on the annual update cycle just for those features that have to be updated to keep pace with iOS
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:17:59.720]  And let the other stuff on the Mac
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:05.080]  Take as much time as it takes to get right and just let the Mac as the more mature
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.720]  You know by however, you want to define it. It's decades old platform, you know
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.240]  Let it be the mature platform that it is that doesn't need to change radically or
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:21.600]  Radically is the wrong word, but doesn't need to change it as fast at paces as a mobile operating system does
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.680]  Yeah, no totally agreed and even with iOS
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:32.560]  I mean we get already some features don't come until the point one release like the new emoji and things like portrait mode and
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:39.680]  and deep fusion just make that the norm know exactly what you can ship in September and then have other features because they're gonna do
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:46.640]  An update in March anyway, so just stage out those features and we'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree and
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:53.280]  Hopefully I you know, I can't imagine that internal to Apple. There's not going to be some sort of you know
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:56.880]  Hey, let's let's do a post op on you know
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:02.160]  Yeah, but let's make sure a post modem on this and figure out where did we go wrong? How early?
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.160]  How do we detect it next year? How do we better?
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:09.200]  Better estimate what will be done at at a certain time and how do we better?
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:11.960]  Separate stuff that needs to be done
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:18.680]  For 14.0 in September and stuff that can wait and how do we sort of stage them out?
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:24.680]  Totally someone's gonna go you jackass has said there's nothing wrong or unlucky about 13 now. Look what happened. I
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:30.800]  You know, I've had people send me that like how come you're not talking about that and it's like you do you read my stuff?
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:32.800]  at all do you realize how
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:37.600]  Like I'm the opposite. I get annoyed every time I look at an elevator and don't see a 13. I'm so mad
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.680]  I'm so mad. I'm like it is a mark, you know
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:47.080]  This this giant skyscraper is a marvel of engineering and yet we're going to cater to the nitwits who think that
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.480]  Yes, the 13th floor would be unlucky
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:56.160]  Anyway, I'm gonna wrap it up that's a good show Renee. It's always good to talk to you people can
