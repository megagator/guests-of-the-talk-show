[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  Well, Craig, how's your weekend?
[00:03.280 --> 00:06.240]  Oh, pretty uneventful.
[00:08.560 --> 00:11.240]  Hey, how about if I start it up, Elon Musk?
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.080]  There you go.
[00:13.360 --> 00:15.400]  I know a lot of people,
[00:15.400 --> 00:17.960]  to me, a surprising number of people on Mastodon
[00:17.960 --> 00:20.200]  do not want to use the word Twitter even,
[00:20.200 --> 00:23.560]  and they call it the bird site, the similar.
[00:23.560 --> 00:24.380]  I don't get-
[00:24.380 --> 00:25.720]  I'm a little looser on that.
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.200]  Yeah, I don't get that.
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.880]  But again, one of the weird things, not weird,
[00:29.880 --> 00:32.640]  I think good things about me growing older
[00:32.640 --> 00:35.800]  is I have way more,
[00:35.800 --> 00:38.160]  I think I've always sort of been a,
[00:38.160 --> 00:40.760]  I've tried to be, from my youth onward,
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.840]  a live and let live type person,
[00:42.840 --> 00:46.480]  and I've hopefully only grown more open-minded.
[00:46.480 --> 00:49.120]  And so something like that, I think 15, 20 years ago,
[00:49.120 --> 00:52.400]  I'd have really rolled my eyes at calling it the bird site.
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.280]  And now I just, I don't pass judgment on it.
[00:54.280 --> 00:55.760]  You don't want to use the word Twitter.
[00:55.760 --> 00:57.000]  You don't have to use the word Twitter.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.840]  I'm not going to avoid it, but-
[00:58.840 --> 01:01.080]  Right, it's everybody's personal call, right?
[01:01.080 --> 01:04.000]  It's like pronouns or whatever.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.060]  Do what you feel is right.
[01:06.060 --> 01:06.900]  I'm okay with it.
[01:06.900 --> 01:08.400]  Stephen Colbert, who showed,
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.100]  my wife and I watch pretty frequently,
[01:10.100 --> 01:11.840]  or at least we watch the first half
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.280]  of the monologue and everything.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.720]  I don't know exactly when he stopped.
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.280]  I don't know if it was upon Biden's inauguration
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.880]  or if he even, it might've even been like with January 6th
[01:23.880 --> 01:25.520]  when he was still president,
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.200]  but he hasn't said Trump's name in two years.
[01:29.200 --> 01:32.760]  And it doesn't, they won't print his name either.
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.920]  You know, like a modern TV monologue has like a,
[01:36.920 --> 01:40.060]  sort of like a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation
[01:40.060 --> 01:42.120]  next to the, you know what I mean?
[01:42.120 --> 01:42.960]  Right, right, right.
[01:42.960 --> 01:43.800]  The scrolling thing.
[01:43.800 --> 01:47.800]  Or just a, you know, like slides really next to them.
[01:47.800 --> 01:48.720]  Oh, right, right, right.
[01:48.720 --> 01:49.560]  Okay, I see what you're saying.
[01:49.560 --> 01:50.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:50.380 --> 01:52.960]  Where instead of putting the host right in the center,
[01:52.960 --> 01:54.280]  the host is off to the right
[01:54.280 --> 01:55.960]  and there's sort of a straight corner.
[01:55.960 --> 01:59.000]  It's actually, I think, a very nice subtle innovation
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.760]  to the late night comedy thing.
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.760]  I would give credit to the Daily Show with Jon Stewart
[02:05.760 --> 02:08.880]  for popularizing it.
[02:08.880 --> 02:10.800]  But I'm sure there are others who've done it before.
[02:10.800 --> 02:13.640]  But anyway, he doesn't print his name either.
[02:13.640 --> 02:15.740]  I forget, you know, and they have like a thing.
[02:15.740 --> 02:18.520]  It's actually, going back to Twitter,
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.240]  it is late, late night with Stephen Colbert listeners
[02:22.240 --> 02:25.660]  that suggest nicknames for him, you know,
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.360]  to be used.
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.720]  And it is interesting, but he doesn't call out.
[02:30.720 --> 02:32.400]  He doesn't emphasize over and over,
[02:32.400 --> 02:33.800]  I'm not saying this guy's name.
[02:33.800 --> 02:36.120]  You just have to pick up that he doesn't say his name
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.400]  even though he's still frequently the butt of his jokes.
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.560]  So anyway, we can do something like that.
[02:41.560 --> 02:44.280]  What's your name for Elon?
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.200]  I think that the person who came up with the Space Karen
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.480]  was kind of that it's, you know, it's not really offensive.
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.320]  And, you know, I guess unless your name is Karen,
[02:55.320 --> 02:57.320]  but, and it kind of evokes, you know,
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.920]  it's deprecating, but not offensive.
[03:02.920 --> 03:07.080]  And, you know, my view there is that, you know,
[03:07.080 --> 03:10.360]  guys like Elon and Trump,
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.360]  they thrive on the attention, right?
[03:15.360 --> 03:18.720]  At heart, I think they're both narcissists.
[03:18.720 --> 03:21.440]  So, you know, the best thing you can do
[03:21.440 --> 03:23.620]  is just kind of ignore them.
[03:23.620 --> 03:26.000]  And I'm fully on with Colbert.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.040]  I mean, I don't mention his name either, right?
[03:30.040 --> 03:31.280]  I said, there's no reason to.
[03:31.280 --> 03:35.400]  In fact, you notice that he looks like a wreck these days
[03:35.400 --> 03:37.720]  because he's getting starved of attention, right?
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.400]  The media doesn't follow him as much.
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.480]  His, what he says is not as important anymore, right?
[03:42.480 --> 03:44.880]  He's not leading the United States of America.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.920]  So-
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.120]  Well, and you mentioned it and you were, you know,
[03:48.120 --> 03:51.000]  one of the, I think you published last night,
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.020]  a blog post on your personal blog,
[03:53.020 --> 03:55.600]  not on the iconometry site.
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.440]  But, you know, you don't have to get your license
[03:57.440 --> 04:00.800]  for armchair psychology to figure out
[04:00.800 --> 04:03.720]  that there are similarities between the two
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.040]  in terms of their insatiable desire for attention
[04:07.040 --> 04:07.880]  at any cost.
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.880]  Yeah, so I therefore think if you are genuinely,
[04:14.920 --> 04:16.680]  and as a lot of us are,
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.320]  certainly with the former president
[04:18.320 --> 04:20.900]  and I think a lot now and ever more so,
[04:20.900 --> 04:22.720]  those of us who care about Twitter.
[04:22.720 --> 04:26.640]  And it's not just Twitter itself, of course,
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.640]  it is the veering into right wing nut job promotion.
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.280]  You know, there's some, you can make,
[04:37.280 --> 04:39.440]  I don't want to go too far off on the politics,
[04:39.440 --> 04:41.440]  but you can, lots of people are doing it
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.520]  and can do it better than me.
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.280]  But you can also make the argument
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.320]  that this is not just an argument about the service
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.680]  and is he making bad product decisions with the service.
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.680]  In general, there's also a greater political argument
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.460]  to be had about the direction he,
[04:59.460 --> 05:01.160]  some of the changes that he's making.
[05:01.160 --> 05:04.580]  Well, and it leads into a broader discussion
[05:04.580 --> 05:07.500]  of how social networks affects that political system.
[05:07.500 --> 05:09.060]  Hey, let me, yeah.
[05:09.060 --> 05:12.840]  Yeah, talk about another four hour podcast
[05:12.840 --> 05:14.120]  if we get into that.
[05:14.120 --> 05:17.120]  All right, let me take a break here
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.120]  and thank our first sponsor
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.280]  and it is our good friends at Trade Coffee.
[05:21.280 --> 05:23.320]  I can literally say that this podcast
[05:23.320 --> 05:25.240]  is partially presented by Trade Coffee,
[05:25.240 --> 05:28.320]  not just because they are sponsoring the show
[05:28.320 --> 05:30.700]  in this episode, but because my blood right now
[05:30.700 --> 05:35.500]  is filled with caffeine delivered by Trade Coffee on a mug.
[05:35.500 --> 05:38.280]  Here, listen, here, I'm gonna tap my pen on it right now.
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.120]  Can you hear it?
[05:39.120 --> 05:41.600]  That's my coffee mug with Trade Coffee in there,
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.760]  well, the remnants of it.
[05:42.760 --> 05:45.520]  It's an easy way to jumpstart your New Year's resolutions
[05:45.520 --> 05:47.960]  by starting your mornings with better coffee.
[05:47.960 --> 05:50.560]  By upgrading your coffee with a trade subscription,
[05:50.560 --> 05:52.000]  you can boost your morning energy,
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.520]  save money by brewing at home,
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.240]  and even support small local businesses.
[05:56.240 --> 05:59.000]  Trade Coffee is a coffee subscription service
[05:59.000 --> 06:02.320]  that makes it so simple to discover new coffees
[06:02.320 --> 06:05.700]  and make your best cup of coffee at home every day.
[06:05.700 --> 06:08.900]  Trade partners with the nation's top rated
[06:08.900 --> 06:12.720]  independent roasters to send you the best quality coffee
[06:12.720 --> 06:15.200]  you can get, all handpicked by their coffee experts.
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.080]  I've been having it delivered for months
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.240]  and months and months, better part of the year, I think,
[06:20.240 --> 06:21.720]  and I don't know that I've gotten coffee
[06:21.720 --> 06:22.960]  from the same roaster twice.
[06:22.960 --> 06:26.200]  It is an unbelievable variety of roasters
[06:26.200 --> 06:28.480]  and it just keeps coming from different places.
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.240]  It just makes it so easy and convenient
[06:31.240 --> 06:32.640]  to discover new coffee
[06:32.640 --> 06:35.760]  and to keep the coffee in your house fresh.
[06:35.760 --> 06:38.440]  You just start out with the subscription,
[06:38.440 --> 06:40.600]  you know, maybe one bag every two weeks,
[06:40.600 --> 06:43.480]  and if that's not enough, you can change it to once a week
[06:43.480 --> 06:45.920]  or you could change it to like once every 10 days
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.760]  or something like that or three times a month.
[06:47.760 --> 06:50.320]  Have you ever been to an Airbnb and pulled out the coffee
[06:50.320 --> 06:53.000]  that's been sitting in there for like, you know?
[06:53.000 --> 06:53.840]  Forever.
[06:53.840 --> 06:56.400]  That's not a, that's bad.
[06:56.400 --> 07:00.000]  Yeah, and it's, it's a good thing.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.320]  Yeah, so you look at the date
[07:01.320 --> 07:03.960]  and it's like Barack Obama was the president.
[07:03.960 --> 07:06.480]  It's like, oh, that's a long time ago, oh my God.
[07:06.480 --> 07:08.480]  Look, they'd send it to you at your house
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.920]  on your preferred schedule.
[07:09.920 --> 07:12.160]  You can adjust that schedule at every time.
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.320]  Pause it if you're going away on vacation
[07:14.320 --> 07:15.960]  or something like that, it is so easy.
[07:15.960 --> 07:17.120]  They have a terrific website.
[07:17.120 --> 07:19.360]  Have a better year by upgrading your morning routine
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.200]  with Better Coffee.
[07:20.200 --> 07:22.880]  Right now, Trade is offering listeners of the talk show
[07:22.880 --> 07:26.520]  a free bag of coffee with any subscription at
[07:26.520 --> 07:30.480]  www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show.

[07:35.760 --> 07:38.720]  for a free bag of coffee with any subscription purchase.
[07:38.720 --> 07:43.640]  My thanks to www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[07:43.640 --> 07:45.240]  Just in case there are listeners
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.720]  who are not familiar with the saga
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.720]  and it's possible because there might be some
[07:48.720 --> 07:51.160]  who either went into Twitter in the first place
[07:51.160 --> 07:54.640]  or tuned wisely, I think in hindsight, tuned out,
[07:55.640 --> 07:59.160]  closed the doors, locked the shutters.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.080]  Got out early.
[08:00.080 --> 08:03.080]  I sort of feel in some ways,
[08:03.080 --> 08:06.520]  I'm trying to think, I love my analogies,
[08:06.520 --> 08:08.680]  but I sort of feel like the person
[08:08.680 --> 08:11.400]  who blew off the hurricane warning.
[08:13.160 --> 08:16.360]  Imagine if a hurricane, instead of being a one-day event
[08:16.360 --> 08:20.560]  that you get 48 hours notice, a slow-moving hurricane,
[08:20.560 --> 08:24.280]  and I was like, ah, this is going to be fine.
[08:24.280 --> 08:25.800]  It'll blow over.
[08:25.800 --> 08:27.280]  It's just a little rain.
[08:27.280 --> 08:31.200]  Anyway, what happened was, I believe it was Friday,
[08:31.200 --> 08:32.160]  the 13th.
[08:32.160 --> 08:36.720]  Yeah, at about 4.20 Central European Time.
[08:36.720 --> 08:38.600]  I don't know about that.
[08:38.600 --> 08:39.800]  I don't know either.
[08:39.800 --> 08:43.200]  But it's just like, eh, I would not put it past it.
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.200]  He loves his 4.20s for stock prices and stuff like that.
[08:48.880 --> 08:50.480]  I mean, he's made two of those jokes.
[08:50.480 --> 08:53.120]  He once, well, a joke.
[08:53.120 --> 08:54.960]  The Twitter one turned out not to be a joke,
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.800]  but his acquisition price for Twitter was 54.20 a share.
[08:59.800 --> 09:04.800]  And years ago, he made an idle threat to take Tesla,
[09:04.960 --> 09:08.360]  which had at that point long been a publicly held company,
[09:08.360 --> 09:12.600]  to take it private at $420, ha ha ha.
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.520]  Well, I don't know.
[09:13.520 --> 09:16.800]  Friday evening, it was late here on the East Coast,
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.240]  I think around seven or something out there in California.
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.040]  All of a sudden, third-party clients stopped working
[09:25.040 --> 09:27.160]  with an authentication there.
[09:27.160 --> 09:29.360]  Yeah, I got a text from Sean.
[09:29.360 --> 09:32.320]  It's Sean Heber, who's, he's the one that actually does
[09:32.320 --> 09:34.400]  the most of the development on Twitterific
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.000]  in the past few years.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.240]  And he texted me.
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.920]  It's like, what does our app look like in the dashboard?
[09:40.920 --> 09:42.160]  Are we suspended?
[09:42.160 --> 09:43.720]  I was like, what?
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.240]  I logged in and immediately saw the little red banner.
[09:48.240 --> 09:50.880]  And it's like, oh, we sent you an email with details.
[09:50.880 --> 09:52.920]  Of course, there's no email with details.
[09:54.760 --> 09:56.800]  From the outside, it was a real mystery.
[09:56.800 --> 09:59.880]  I had a friend, the first I heard about it was a friend
[09:59.880 --> 10:03.720]  who purely, I think just genuine coincidence,
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.120]  like me, a fellow nerd,
[10:05.120 --> 10:08.360]  there's a friend who's ex-Apple now working somewhere else,
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.600]  but like me, manages iOS app updates manually.
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.800]  Like what I like to do, I don't have it automatic.
[10:14.800 --> 10:17.320]  I just, you know, whenever I, you know, once a day,
[10:17.320 --> 10:18.680]  at this point, I have so many apps
[10:18.680 --> 10:20.000]  and updates are so common.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.480]  You know, it's sort of like a daily tour,
[10:21.480 --> 10:23.760]  but I just go in and I want to see what's new.
[10:23.760 --> 10:24.600]  And-
[10:24.600 --> 10:25.440]  That's the thing.
[10:25.440 --> 10:26.720]  You get to get your chance to read the release notes
[10:26.720 --> 10:28.360]  if there are any and that kind of thing.
[10:28.360 --> 10:29.200]  Yeah.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.240]  And it's, you know, and often,
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.240]  sometimes it's a good reason to think, ah,
[10:32.240 --> 10:33.320]  there's an update for this app.
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.320]  I don't use that one anymore.
[10:34.320 --> 10:35.160]  I'll just delete it.
[10:35.160 --> 10:37.240]  You know, sometimes I just, anyway,
[10:37.240 --> 10:40.160]  he manually applied a tweet bot update
[10:40.160 --> 10:43.360]  and then couldn't log in and thought that the,
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.600]  you know, the update was-
[10:44.600 --> 10:47.120]  Yeah, made the correlation.
[10:47.120 --> 10:49.720]  And I said, oh, I haven't installed any updates.
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.840]  And ooh, I can't get in either, authentication error.
[10:52.840 --> 10:53.680]  And then we were-
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.520]  Right.
[10:54.520 --> 10:55.360]  The wheels started turning.
[10:55.360 --> 10:57.680]  So yeah, background.
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.400]  So what we now seem to know as we record here on Monday
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.600]  is that it's exactly what we feared,
[11:03.600 --> 11:06.080]  that Twitter made the decision
[11:06.080 --> 11:09.280]  to kill popular third-party clients
[11:09.280 --> 11:11.920]  like tweet bot and Twitterrific and-
[11:11.920 --> 11:12.760]  Pretty, yeah.
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.160]  It's pretty clear that they had some sort
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.200]  of internal threshold of usage
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.160]  that if an app was over a certain number,
[11:20.160 --> 11:22.520]  they got the ax that they were under.
[11:22.520 --> 11:25.680]  Because for example, our iOS client got the ax,
[11:25.680 --> 11:29.520]  but our macOS app, which is the same code,
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.440]  except for, you know, the UI bit, it's fine still.
[11:33.440 --> 11:35.080]  And you know, for the moment,
[11:35.080 --> 11:36.720]  they'll probably hear this podcast and go,
[11:36.720 --> 11:37.920]  oh shit, we missed one.
[11:39.600 --> 11:40.440]  Yes.
[11:40.440 --> 11:41.280]  But-
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.440]  So it is, yeah, let's,
[11:42.440 --> 11:44.680]  I would love to hear an explanation for this to make,
[11:44.680 --> 11:46.360]  because I don't know the exact details,
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.000]  but the gist of it is they didn't shut down the API servers.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.880]  And I think they can't- No, no.
[11:52.880 --> 11:55.200]  Because I think your apps like Twitterrific
[11:55.200 --> 11:57.960]  are using APIs that are used by posts.
[11:57.960 --> 12:00.360]  They use them on their own apps for some of this stuff.
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.920]  Yeah, there are some of the,
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.040]  in fact, they have their own private OAuth keys
[12:06.040 --> 12:11.040]  that let's let them access the normal API plus extra stuff.
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.160]  So it's, you know, it's, there's,
[12:15.160 --> 12:16.000]  and because, you know,
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.720]  Twitter has evolved over so many years, right?
[12:18.720 --> 12:20.960]  I'm sure that the mixture of, you know,
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.640]  the private and the public in their code base is pretty,
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.880]  it's probably pretty well entangled.
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.880]  So if, you know, I don't think they will ever
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.440]  be able to completely pull the public API,
[12:37.440 --> 12:40.440]  but they certainly can kneecap it.
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.600]  But, you know, with rate limits.
[12:42.600 --> 12:45.080]  Yeah, so, yeah.
[12:45.080 --> 12:47.160]  So basically what they did is just,
[12:47.160 --> 12:49.200]  instead of shutting down API servers,
[12:49.200 --> 12:50.400]  which they effectively can't do
[12:50.400 --> 12:52.800]  and probably wouldn't want to do, but they don't have to,
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.800]  what they did was revoke the OAuth credentials.
[12:58.080 --> 12:58.920]  Right.
[12:58.920 --> 13:02.080]  Each app has effectively an ID within Twitter.
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.640]  Yeah, we have, every app has a,
[13:05.640 --> 13:08.360]  basically a public key and a private key, you know,
[13:08.360 --> 13:10.920]  and each one of those tokens has a secret.
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.000]  So, you know, there's a handshake that happens there
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.200]  and if any point during the handshake, you know,
[13:17.200 --> 13:19.400]  somebody says, no, this is no good,
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.320]  then you're not going to be able to connect.
[13:21.320 --> 13:22.840]  And I mean, we could have,
[13:22.840 --> 13:25.240]  we could have blocked off access to Twitter if, you know,
[13:25.240 --> 13:28.280]  we'd done a similar thing on our end, but there's, you know,
[13:28.280 --> 13:29.800]  there's no reason for us to do that.
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.720]  But yeah, they, that was the point of OAuth, you know,
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.920]  it gives power to the individual who has, you know,
[13:37.920 --> 13:41.320]  you can go on Twitter and look in your apps section
[13:41.320 --> 13:44.680]  of settings and see the apps that have requested tokens.
[13:44.680 --> 13:47.000]  And if you see one or there's an app that you think
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.240]  is misbehaving, you can go remove it.
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.840]  That's another one of the ways to cut off access to the API.
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.320]  And essentially what Twitter did is they did that
[13:57.320 --> 13:58.440]  across the board.
[13:58.440 --> 13:59.880]  They basically, in fact,
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.800]  if you go look in your app section of, you know,
[14:02.800 --> 14:04.720]  twitter.com and then the settings,
[14:04.720 --> 14:07.120]  you won't see Twitterific, you won't see Tweetbot,
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.480]  you won't see any of the apps that were previously
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.320]  granted access.
[14:11.320 --> 14:13.320]  Ah, as a user, you're saying?
[14:13.320 --> 14:14.160]  Yes. Gotcha.
[14:14.160 --> 14:15.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.960]  If you opened up, you know,
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.800]  the Twitter website right now and navigated to settings,
[14:19.800 --> 14:21.800]  you will not see Tweetbot.
[14:21.800 --> 14:24.440]  You will not see Twitterific because it just removed.
[14:24.440 --> 14:27.600]  And Twitterific for Mac, like you just said,
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.200]  somehow escaped the Reaper almost certainly because they
[14:31.200 --> 14:35.520]  set some sort of threshold and Twitterific for Mac must be
[14:35.520 --> 14:36.840]  under the threshold.
[14:36.840 --> 14:39.960]  But the other key difference is that you guys use a different
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.880]  ID for Twitterific for iOS than Twitterific for Mac.
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.680]  Whereas Tweetbot, I think uses the same ID.
[14:47.680 --> 14:50.040]  Yes, that they have, they use the same,
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.040]  the same key pair for their Mac and their iOS apps,
[14:55.840 --> 14:59.360]  which I don't remember honestly why we did that,
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.120]  but there was probably a reason where we needed a separate
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.480]  one just maybe, but it probably went back to the Kickstarter
[15:06.480 --> 15:08.880]  because it was kind of a separate thing.
[15:08.880 --> 15:10.800]  And I remember that, right?
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.600]  Yeah, it's, but you know, it's and honestly,
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.000]  I do not see long-term.
[15:18.000 --> 15:18.840]  I don't, you know,
[15:18.840 --> 15:22.520]  but a lot of people been noticing that Twitter for Mac
[15:22.520 --> 15:25.920]  still works and are downloading it and buying it.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.360]  And you know,
[15:27.360 --> 15:29.760]  we're going to eventually hit our heads on that,
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.680]  whatever that limit is and have to shut it down there too.
[15:34.680 --> 15:36.880]  So, which.
[15:36.880 --> 15:39.720]  So part of the frustration here, I mean, number one,
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.600]  those of us who use these clients or like in your case,
[15:43.600 --> 15:45.440]  make them, love them.
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.120]  I mean, truly, truly do love them.
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.080]  And to me, it's not just like a minor convenience
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.080]  or nicety versus the official Twitter app.
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.160]  It's almost an altogether different experience.
[16:00.160 --> 16:02.760]  And to me, and I've written about this,
[16:02.760 --> 16:05.200]  and maybe not recently, although I guess now is the time
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.440]  to revisit the theme of Twitter clients
[16:09.440 --> 16:12.480]  as a UI playground is, you know,
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.280]  and I've used that too with weather apps
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.000]  where I think because the,
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.720]  and I'm not, I think you understand
[16:22.720 --> 16:27.720]  that I'm not underplaying how significant Twitterrific is
[16:27.960 --> 16:30.960]  and how complicated and big and how many features it is
[16:30.960 --> 16:33.080]  and how difficult, you know, a lot of it is.
[16:33.080 --> 16:36.520]  I'm not trying to say, ah, just a Twitter client, it's easy.
[16:36.520 --> 16:41.360]  But the scope of Twitter is so minimal, you know.
[16:41.360 --> 16:42.720]  Right, right, right.
[16:42.720 --> 16:45.400]  It's a small API footprint, really, when you look at it.
[16:45.400 --> 16:48.040]  It's not, there's not a lot there.
[16:48.040 --> 16:49.360]  But there is a lot.
[16:49.360 --> 16:52.280]  Well, and in part, it's part of what makes,
[16:52.280 --> 16:56.000]  to me, Twitter a brilliant idea.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.760]  The original concept is so brilliant
[16:57.760 --> 17:00.680]  because it is conceptually so simple.
[17:00.680 --> 17:03.640]  And even with such a simple concept,
[17:03.640 --> 17:08.640]  it eventually evolved to be truly complex and wide-ranging.
[17:10.680 --> 17:15.680]  And it just shows you how, you know, compared to,
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.360]  well, at this point, even Instagram, right?
[17:19.360 --> 17:22.320]  Instagram is so wildly, you know,
[17:22.320 --> 17:24.840]  it's effectively three or four social networks
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.840]  crammed into one app in one service and one namespace, right?
[17:28.840 --> 17:31.600]  There's the traditional Instagram
[17:31.600 --> 17:35.360]  that is sort of like Twitter, but for images and video.
[17:35.360 --> 17:37.480]  And now there's the whole thing
[17:37.480 --> 17:41.240]  with the fleeting stories at the top
[17:41.240 --> 17:44.560]  and the vertical videos in the middle.
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.640]  And it's also an instant messaging client and blah, blah, blah
[17:48.640 --> 17:52.680]  and, you know, go even more complex to Facebook's blue app.
[17:52.680 --> 17:55.320]  And they've never had third-party clients,
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.720]  but if they did, to encompass all of Facebook,
[17:59.720 --> 18:01.240]  it's almost impossible.
[18:01.240 --> 18:04.120]  And that's one reason the Facebook,
[18:04.120 --> 18:09.120]  even before all of the reasons people, including me,
[18:09.240 --> 18:12.280]  don't like Facebook today existed,
[18:12.280 --> 18:14.920]  I never got onto it because I never understood it.
[18:14.920 --> 18:17.480]  Whereas Twitter, it was so easy to understand,
[18:17.480 --> 18:21.720]  and that's what made it so rich as a playground
[18:21.720 --> 18:26.320]  for tinkering with the presentation.
[18:26.320 --> 18:29.320]  The key word there was a playground, right?
[18:29.320 --> 18:30.880]  Especially in the early days,
[18:30.880 --> 18:34.000]  we had no idea what we were doing, right?
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.520]  In fact, all there was on the Twitter website was,
[18:36.520 --> 18:38.520]  you know, what are you doing?
[18:38.520 --> 18:42.760]  You know, and a lot of those early tweets are just like,
[18:42.760 --> 18:45.600]  one of my early ones is experimenting.
[18:45.600 --> 18:48.520]  Because it's like, and it was presented on the website
[18:48.520 --> 18:52.160]  is Craig Hockenberry is experimenting, right?
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.920]  Or is having lunch, or it was just kind of a,
[18:55.920 --> 18:59.800]  wow, this is an interesting way to let people know
[18:59.800 --> 19:02.560]  kind of what I'm thinking right now.
[19:02.560 --> 19:05.800]  And, you know, then it involves, you know,
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.800]  with, you know, you needed a way to identify people.
[19:11.080 --> 19:13.880]  That's where the whole at screen name thing started.
[19:13.880 --> 19:15.520]  That wasn't even a part of it, right?
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.240]  It's like, you know, one of my early tweets was at Dan,
[19:19.240 --> 19:20.080]  right?
[19:20.080 --> 19:20.920]  Well, which Dan?
[19:21.800 --> 19:23.200]  It turns out it was Dan Benjamin,
[19:23.200 --> 19:25.600]  because, you know, he was the only Dan I knew on Twitter.
[19:25.600 --> 19:26.440]  He might have been the only Dan.
[19:26.440 --> 19:29.200]  Yeah, it was like two Dans on Twitter.
[19:29.200 --> 19:32.240]  Right, yeah, and then Dan Morin joined up,
[19:32.240 --> 19:35.000]  and it was like, ugh, there's two Dans now.
[19:35.000 --> 19:35.840]  Yeah.
[19:39.320 --> 19:41.160]  So, but, and you know, the hashtags,
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.000]  that was another thing,
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.920]  I think it was Christmas scene that came up with that.
[19:43.920 --> 19:47.480]  And the, you know, then it came up with the,
[19:47.480 --> 19:51.280]  Robert Anderson came up with the at reply thing,
[19:51.280 --> 19:52.800]  you know, reply change report.
[19:52.800 --> 19:57.800]  And it was just like, the thing that was so important
[19:58.440 --> 20:03.120]  and exciting at that time is how it was evolving, right?
[20:03.120 --> 20:06.920]  And that's kind of one of the frustrations over the,
[20:06.920 --> 20:11.760]  you know, the last maybe 10 years or so,
[20:11.760 --> 20:15.040]  is there hasn't really been a lot of evolution on Twitter.
[20:15.040 --> 20:18.920]  Yeah, well, it is wild, you know,
[20:18.920 --> 20:20.680]  and now is the time to look back
[20:20.680 --> 20:22.240]  and pour one out for Twitter.
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.800]  But it is wild how many of the,
[20:23.800 --> 20:25.680]  I'm sure there are others, but you know,
[20:25.680 --> 20:28.840]  hashtags and mentions are certainly two of the ones
[20:28.840 --> 20:31.040]  that it's hard to conceive that the product
[20:31.040 --> 20:33.600]  didn't have those as first-class citizens.
[20:33.600 --> 20:36.680]  They were just user conventions.
[20:36.680 --> 20:40.640]  And nothing, they weren't treated specially.
[20:40.640 --> 20:45.000]  So like, if you made a joke and I replied at Chalkenberry,
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.240]  you know, and here's my witty comeback,
[20:47.240 --> 20:50.120]  that was just a tweet that happened to start
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.440]  with the characters at sign Chalkenberry.
[20:54.440 --> 20:55.280]  Right.
[20:55.280 --> 20:57.160]  And it would just show, you know,
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.440]  it would go to anybody who followed me
[20:59.440 --> 21:02.160]  just got that tweet as a regular tweet.
[21:02.160 --> 21:06.400]  And there was no, there were no APIs to tie stuff together.
[21:06.400 --> 21:09.420]  So you couldn't, if you tapped on your original tweet,
[21:09.420 --> 21:11.360]  I mean, there was no concept really
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.640]  of replying to a specific tweet.
[21:13.640 --> 21:15.760]  You were just entering the.
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.360]  You're just throwing it out there.
[21:17.360 --> 21:18.680]  Everybody could see it.
[21:18.680 --> 21:21.600]  But you know, and fairly, in fairly short order
[21:21.600 --> 21:23.420]  that really took off.
[21:23.420 --> 21:25.340]  And you know, and then I guess,
[21:25.340 --> 21:27.160]  I think before Twitter adopted it,
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.320]  clients like Twitter, if it could do things
[21:29.320 --> 21:32.400]  like filter those, you know, you could do it on your own
[21:32.400 --> 21:35.820]  once you had those tweets sucked in through the API.
[21:35.820 --> 21:38.000]  But then Twitter, you know, embraced it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.400]  And it's obviously, you know, famously with hashtags, right?
[21:41.400 --> 21:43.120]  I mean, it's, you know.
[21:43.120 --> 21:45.180]  Yeah, well, the hashtags and they, you know,
[21:45.180 --> 21:47.400]  the in reply to, that was actually a field
[21:47.400 --> 21:50.640]  that they added to the API response
[21:50.640 --> 21:53.640]  that allowed us to do interesting things, right?
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.740]  And it was, that was something that,
[21:56.740 --> 21:59.440]  where we had to work with Twitter engineering
[21:59.440 --> 22:01.220]  to make that happen, right?
[22:01.220 --> 22:03.000]  That was not something that we could do on our own.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.880]  That's not something that Twitter could do on their own
[22:04.880 --> 22:07.480]  because it needed kind of both the front end
[22:07.480 --> 22:10.600]  and the back end to work simultaneously on this thing.
[22:10.600 --> 22:13.280]  And that was, that was great.
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.320]  I mean, but that hasn't happened for years, right?
[22:16.320 --> 22:19.260]  It's just not been a collaborative thing between,
[22:19.260 --> 22:23.620]  and the thing that kills me is that in,
[22:25.280 --> 22:29.380]  prior to the purchase by Elon Musk,
[22:29.380 --> 22:34.380]  the Twitter API people were starting to open things up.
[22:35.080 --> 22:35.920]  Yeah.
[22:35.920 --> 22:37.140]  Right, they, you know, we, in fact,
[22:37.140 --> 22:40.560]  after the purchase was announced,
[22:40.560 --> 22:43.000]  or, you know, he put his bid in,
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.880]  and we got, I got an email from one of the people
[22:47.880 --> 22:50.180]  working on the Twitter API stuff,
[22:50.180 --> 22:52.980]  and they were opening up group DMs.
[22:52.980 --> 22:55.720]  They wanted to, you know, provide third parties
[22:55.720 --> 22:57.480]  with the ability to do group DMs,
[22:57.480 --> 22:59.840]  which is something that people have been asking us for
[22:59.840 --> 23:00.680]  for years, right?
[23:00.680 --> 23:03.280]  It's like the official client can do it, why can't we?
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.680]  Well, we don't have API.
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.320]  Well, so they started to open things up,
[23:06.320 --> 23:08.200]  and that was like, and when there's,
[23:08.200 --> 23:10.160]  and I couldn't, I couldn't say to him,
[23:10.160 --> 23:12.860]  it was like, we're gonna wait and see on this,
[23:12.860 --> 23:15.280]  because there's this guy named Elon Musk,
[23:15.280 --> 23:18.080]  and I don't trust him.
[23:18.080 --> 23:20.680]  We, and that, you know, he,
[23:20.680 --> 23:23.520]  the guy who was working on that was one of the,
[23:23.520 --> 23:26.760]  I think he got, he was a part of the first round of layoffs.
[23:26.760 --> 23:31.760]  So, you know, they were so close.
[23:32.340 --> 23:35.640]  They were really close to getting it again.
[23:35.640 --> 23:39.200]  It cracked me up from your blog post about the,
[23:39.200 --> 23:40.720]  as you called it, the shit show.
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.680]  Yeah.
[23:41.680 --> 23:46.680]  You mentioned the, and put a link to the first tweet
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.800]  you posted through their APIs back in December 2006.
[23:52.140 --> 23:54.200]  And again, it made me laugh twice,
[23:54.200 --> 23:57.640]  because first it just says, the whole tweet is,
[23:58.520 --> 24:01.680]  thinks he's finally gotten the posting code right,
[24:01.680 --> 24:02.520]  shot, dot, done.
[24:03.440 --> 24:05.400]  But that made me laugh, because like you said,
[24:05.400 --> 24:08.160]  in those, or in that, at least for that first year,
[24:08.160 --> 24:13.160]  that was the convention, to tweet in the sense of,
[24:13.960 --> 24:15.640]  that you-
[24:15.640 --> 24:16.640]  It was personal, right?
[24:16.640 --> 24:18.520]  It was usually, it was your personal status.
[24:18.520 --> 24:20.220]  Well, and it was, I think,
[24:20.220 --> 24:23.040]  largely inspired by like AIM statuses, right?
[24:23.040 --> 24:23.880]  And all-
[24:23.880 --> 24:24.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.240]  iChat was, or what was it, what did they call it?
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.520]  Was iChat messages or something?
[24:29.520 --> 24:32.540]  No, iChat was the original client that Apple made
[24:32.540 --> 24:37.540]  to talk to AIM, and the other, Yahoo had one,
[24:37.760 --> 24:40.280]  and there were a couple of others that were,
[24:40.280 --> 24:45.280]  they were all effectively, had the same features.
[24:45.320 --> 24:48.500]  But one of the things that they had,
[24:48.500 --> 24:52.200]  that modern messaging, like iMessage and WhatsApp,
[24:52.200 --> 24:57.040]  and all the other modern ones don't have, is a status, right?
[24:57.040 --> 24:58.480]  And you could set your status,
[24:58.480 --> 25:01.760]  the defaults were like, available was green,
[25:01.760 --> 25:03.120]  away was red.
[25:03.120 --> 25:03.960]  Right, right.
[25:03.960 --> 25:07.940]  It meant like, hey, I'm here and my client is running,
[25:07.940 --> 25:11.640]  but I'm busy, so don't bother me.
[25:11.640 --> 25:12.480]  And then you could-
[25:12.480 --> 25:14.320]  Yeah, I probably had one at one point,
[25:14.320 --> 25:16.520]  because it was a point of creativity, too.
[25:16.520 --> 25:17.920]  I probably had one at one point,
[25:17.920 --> 25:19.520]  was like, he's locking the chalk,
[25:19.520 --> 25:21.040]  or something like that, right?
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.840]  Right, so you could make a custom one
[25:22.840 --> 25:24.920]  and set whether that was green or red.
[25:24.920 --> 25:27.080]  And Jack Dorsey's idea was,
[25:27.080 --> 25:29.040]  well, what if there was a universal service
[25:29.040 --> 25:31.320]  for those sort of things, and you could just say
[25:31.320 --> 25:34.160]  that you're, you know, you could just post an update
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.000]  that you're eating lunch at such and such cafe,
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.040]  and your friends who were nearby could maybe see that
[25:41.040 --> 25:43.120]  and say, oh, I'll go stop by and see Craig.
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.080]  It was like a live, what are you doing?
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.080]  And that convention of posting with like an active verb,
[25:50.880 --> 25:55.880]  with your name implicitly filled in as the beginning,
[25:56.280 --> 25:59.280]  was part of the presentation of tweets, like you said.
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.640]  It would look like that as you looked at Twitter's interface.
[26:02.640 --> 26:05.360]  And it's just, to me, it's a sign,
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.200]  the fact that that's not how Twitter turned out to be
[26:08.200 --> 26:13.200]  isn't a failure, it's the, usually the sign of a great idea
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.440]  is when it expands into something
[26:15.440 --> 26:17.720]  that the creator didn't originally envision,
[26:17.720 --> 26:18.560]  but it works well.
[26:18.560 --> 26:21.280]  Right, the evolution, and in fact,
[26:21.280 --> 26:23.880]  it was interesting to me that it was things
[26:23.880 --> 26:27.360]  like South by Southwest, where Twitter really
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.800]  kind of got its foothold, because it's a group,
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.320]  it's a place where a lot of people group together, right?
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.480]  And you need that ability to know where people are,
[26:38.480 --> 26:39.480]  what they're doing.
[26:39.480 --> 26:42.760]  Same, you know, the early WWDCs, I mean, we were fighting,
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.760]  you know, getting a connection on the wifi, number one.
[26:45.760 --> 26:47.160]  Number two, we all had new iPhones
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.400]  and the batteries were running low,
[26:49.400 --> 26:51.920]  and we needed to know where everybody was.
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.240]  Yeah, I don't remember exactly how we used it.
[26:55.240 --> 26:57.720]  So I used- Yeah, I don't either.
[26:57.720 --> 26:58.560]  But I know we did.
[26:58.560 --> 27:01.800]  Yeah, I remember, I was very, you know,
[27:01.800 --> 27:04.120]  I forget which years I was at South by Southwest,
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.760]  but it encompassed at least March, 2006,
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.040]  maybe 2005 too, but before Twitter,
[27:12.040 --> 27:14.320]  then there was March, 2007,
[27:14.320 --> 27:16.400]  and that was the South by Southwest
[27:16.400 --> 27:17.680]  where Twitter exploded,
[27:17.680 --> 27:20.080]  and the fail whale came up multiple times
[27:20.080 --> 27:21.600]  during the conference,
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.600]  and the Twitter crew was at South by Southwest,
[27:26.600 --> 27:28.160]  so God only knows-
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.000]  Probably all of them.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.200]  Yeah, God only knows how they were fixing it,
[27:32.200 --> 27:35.960]  but they did a good job, but we didn't have iPhones yet.
[27:35.960 --> 27:38.440]  The iPhone had been announced in January,
[27:38.440 --> 27:41.360]  but wasn't coming out until June,
[27:41.360 --> 27:44.080]  and South by Southwest took part in the middle,
[27:44.080 --> 27:46.840]  but somehow, even without iPhones yet,
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.280]  we broke Twitter during, I think, honestly,
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.840]  if my best guess is, because I remember doing it a lot,
[27:52.840 --> 27:55.880]  is when you would go to a conference back then,
[27:55.880 --> 27:57.800]  you'd have your laptop in a backpack,
[27:57.800 --> 27:59.960]  and every, you know, in between sessions,
[27:59.960 --> 28:01.440]  you'd just sit down in the hallway
[28:01.440 --> 28:04.120]  with your laptop on your lap, literally,
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.480]  and check your email, or, you know, and check Twitter,
[28:07.480 --> 28:08.600]  and you could, you know,
[28:08.600 --> 28:11.920]  so we were effectively using our Power Books,
[28:11.920 --> 28:13.320]  I think they were Power Books at the time,
[28:13.320 --> 28:14.760]  maybe the MacBook had come out,
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.680]  but, you know, we were using our laptops as cell phones.
[28:18.680 --> 28:22.280]  Yeah, no. But it was mind-blowing, though,
[28:22.280 --> 28:24.920]  what it enabled in terms of, like you're saying,
[28:24.920 --> 28:25.920]  like, where we could say,
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.560]  hey, we're gonna have beers at Paradise at five,
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.680]  and the people who followed me on Twitter and were there
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.480]  would say, oh, Gruber and Krager, Gruber and Kudol,
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.120]  and whoever else, are gonna be at Paradise at five,
[28:41.120 --> 28:43.240]  and then, you know, they could meet in there.
[28:43.240 --> 28:44.800]  Yeah, it was connections, right?
[28:44.800 --> 28:47.920]  It was just, it was a way to connect with people.
[28:47.920 --> 28:52.920]  I remember that between the release of the Mac client,
[28:54.040 --> 28:58.560]  then it was just like, oh, less than a month later,
[28:58.560 --> 29:00.240]  the iPhone was announced, and it was, again,
[29:00.240 --> 29:01.760]  that, you know, it was announced,
[29:01.760 --> 29:03.640]  and then we had to wait until, you know,
[29:03.640 --> 29:05.800]  till June in order to get the devices,
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.800]  and I, by the time that WWDC rolled around,
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.360]  I had had jailbroken, I had that first version
[29:15.360 --> 29:17.560]  of Twitter effect running on the phone,
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.920]  and my battery was dead before I got to San Francisco.
[29:21.920 --> 29:24.320]  It's just like, because it's like,
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.840]  I had no idea that the radio used so much power,
[29:28.840 --> 29:30.720]  and, you know, I'm just like,
[29:30.720 --> 29:32.920]  I'm leaving the radio on all the time, you know,
[29:32.920 --> 29:35.360]  even like, you know, if it was shut down in my pocket,
[29:35.360 --> 29:36.640]  radio was on.
[29:36.640 --> 29:39.360]  So which, and you know, it was,
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.840]  that that was part of the evolution,
[29:40.840 --> 29:43.520]  part of the learning process, part of, you know,
[29:43.520 --> 29:47.760]  making a product that would work in extreme environments.
[29:47.760 --> 29:50.360]  So while we're going down nostalgia lane,
[29:50.360 --> 29:53.880]  I'm trying to think of the timing of when,
[29:53.880 --> 29:58.880]  so the iPhone came out in June, end of June, 2007.
[29:59.040 --> 30:03.560]  Jailbreaking started very soon thereafter.
[30:03.560 --> 30:04.400]  Right.
[30:04.400 --> 30:08.120]  And it's shocking, really, to me, it still is,
[30:08.120 --> 30:13.120]  how without any help from Apple
[30:13.120 --> 30:15.560]  that developers, you know,
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.560]  a small crew of very, very clever developers
[30:18.560 --> 30:21.520]  were able to sort of backwards engineer
[30:21.520 --> 30:25.040]  how to get Xcode to generate binaries
[30:25.040 --> 30:27.960]  that you, if you had a jailbroken phone
[30:27.960 --> 30:29.280]  that you could install,
[30:29.280 --> 30:33.120]  and then all of a sudden we had native third-party apps
[30:33.120 --> 30:38.080]  without any native third-party app support from Apple.
[30:38.080 --> 30:39.880]  And they were good.
[30:39.880 --> 30:41.000]  I mean, yeah.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.520]  So I, again, back to, you know,
[30:43.520 --> 30:45.400]  conferences and people getting together,
[30:45.400 --> 30:49.840]  and it was at C4 in Chicago where I met Lucas Newman
[30:49.840 --> 30:52.800]  and saw his lights off, or lights out,
[30:52.800 --> 30:54.280]  I can never remember what it is,
[30:54.280 --> 30:58.640]  but that was like, okay, this is,
[30:58.640 --> 31:02.720]  this takes an iPhone, it's very Apple-like.
[31:02.720 --> 31:07.720]  Oh, by the way, he used the Apple APIs that we all knew,
[31:07.760 --> 31:09.600]  right, you know, it was, you know,
[31:09.600 --> 31:13.040]  they had a UI table instead of an NS table, right?
[31:13.040 --> 31:16.240]  You know, it's like that, it was pretty clear to me
[31:16.240 --> 31:18.720]  that the Apple had done a smart thing, right?
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.720]  They had basically taken APIs and ways of programming
[31:23.880 --> 31:26.120]  that they knew worked really well
[31:26.120 --> 31:29.520]  because they'd been using them on the Mac since, you know,
[31:29.520 --> 31:32.240]  or they'd been using them actually since Next,
[31:32.240 --> 31:36.200]  and got those running on a mobile device.
[31:36.200 --> 31:40.760]  And that was one of the reasons why things took off, right?
[31:40.760 --> 31:43.120]  Because it was something familiar, right?
[31:43.120 --> 31:45.560]  It was just something that the people latched onto.
[31:45.560 --> 31:47.560]  And then that's, you know,
[31:47.560 --> 31:50.400]  I basically came home from Chicago from that conference
[31:50.400 --> 31:52.440]  and started working on a Twitter client.
[31:52.440 --> 31:56.680]  I was that, you know, that enthused by it.
[31:56.680 --> 31:58.440]  And got a bit of a headstart, you know,
[31:58.440 --> 32:00.760]  and at that point there was no SDK either, right?
[32:00.760 --> 32:01.960]  You know, as you were saying,
[32:01.960 --> 32:03.660]  there was, Apple had said nothing
[32:03.660 --> 32:04.800]  about how you build these things.
[32:04.800 --> 32:06.800]  We kind of figured it out.
[32:06.800 --> 32:09.700]  You know, basically there's this thing called Class Dump
[32:09.700 --> 32:14.080]  that lets you take any Objective-C binary
[32:14.080 --> 32:17.380]  and suck all the strings out of it,
[32:17.380 --> 32:21.720]  and put those strings in a format that is familiar
[32:21.720 --> 32:24.840]  for people who code against those APIs.
[32:24.840 --> 32:28.040]  So, you know, it was, I mean-
[32:28.040 --> 32:30.120]  And basically- Twitter at that point,
[32:30.120 --> 32:33.080]  Twitter at that point only supported an XML API.
[32:33.080 --> 32:34.800]  There was no JSON.
[32:34.800 --> 32:36.600]  That was like, you know,
[32:36.600 --> 32:40.520]  that shows you how old the API was, right?
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.560]  And the only way I could get on the jailbreak,
[32:44.560 --> 32:46.800]  the only way I could decode the XML
[32:46.800 --> 32:50.480]  was to call something in the framework
[32:50.480 --> 32:55.360]  that was used by the Microsoft Office file viewers, right?
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.660]  Because, you know, at that point,
[32:57.660 --> 33:00.800]  Office was using XML-based files and, you know,
[33:00.800 --> 33:02.320]  they needed them, you know, if you wanted to,
[33:02.320 --> 33:05.120]  on your iPhone, you wanted to preview a Word document,
[33:05.120 --> 33:06.880]  you needed to decode that XML.
[33:06.880 --> 33:10.000]  So I was, I'd found that, and I was like,
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.920]  okay, now I can do it.
[33:11.920 --> 33:14.960]  So I'm, you know, I'm using the Microsoft Word code
[33:14.960 --> 33:17.040]  to, you know, display tweets.
[33:17.040 --> 33:21.760]  It was kind of, but that was,
[33:21.760 --> 33:25.120]  it was fun and exciting because you could put that
[33:25.120 --> 33:28.400]  in your hand and take it with you, right?
[33:28.400 --> 33:30.040]  I'm probably the first person in the world
[33:30.040 --> 33:33.440]  who knew how great it was to be standing in line,
[33:33.440 --> 33:36.200]  you know, to check out on groceries and look at Twitter.
[33:37.640 --> 33:40.520]  Right, you know, or just, you know, those moments
[33:40.520 --> 33:42.720]  where, you know, you've got nothing else to do,
[33:42.720 --> 33:44.480]  you're just kind of waiting for something, you know,
[33:44.480 --> 33:46.380]  you're, you know, getting your car repaired
[33:46.380 --> 33:49.240]  or something like that, and you're just sitting there,
[33:49.240 --> 33:51.400]  you know, whereas you said, we're saying, you know,
[33:51.400 --> 33:53.200]  we used to break open the laptops,
[33:53.200 --> 33:56.200]  now you can just pull out the phone and, you know,
[33:56.200 --> 33:57.020]  do some stuff.
[33:57.020 --> 34:02.020]  And I think that affected the evolution of the service
[34:02.360 --> 34:04.600]  and the product a lot.
[34:04.600 --> 34:08.280]  It was originally conceived as being usable from phones,
[34:08.280 --> 34:09.940]  and I've talked about this on the show before,
[34:09.940 --> 34:13.240]  it's actually why there was a pretty stringent
[34:13.240 --> 34:18.240]  character limit of 180, because SMS was limited to 160,
[34:18.560 --> 34:21.040]  I think, I always get this wrong a little bit.
[34:21.040 --> 34:23.400]  It's 160 or 180, something like that, yeah.
[34:23.400 --> 34:27.120]  They needed some space for screen name and stuff like that.
[34:27.120 --> 34:30.440]  Or metadata, they were like, so if we're maxed out
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.420]  by SMS's limit of 160, let's say that we'll claim
[34:34.420 --> 34:37.760]  20 characters for ourselves if we ever need them,
[34:37.760 --> 34:40.800]  and tweets will be limited to 140 characters.
[34:40.800 --> 34:45.800]  And of course, it being 2006, there were issues then
[34:46.200 --> 34:49.280]  about, well, what's a character, right?
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.600]  Right, because-
[34:50.600 --> 34:52.640]  Yeah, ask somebody in China what a character is.
[34:52.640 --> 34:55.280]  Or, and I don't, emoji hadn't really,
[34:55.280 --> 34:56.880]  I know that they existed in Japan,
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.520]  but the explosion of emoji and the modern emoji
[35:01.520 --> 35:04.560]  of thousands of emoji that are available,
[35:04.560 --> 35:07.240]  which are actually, I think you can have up to eight bytes
[35:07.240 --> 35:10.700]  for a single emoji, or maybe more, probably more,
[35:10.700 --> 35:12.660]  with the combining characters.
[35:12.660 --> 35:17.180]  So if you tweet a Santa Claus emoji,
[35:17.180 --> 35:21.480]  but set the skin tone to one of the darker skin tones,
[35:21.480 --> 35:24.520]  there might be like eight bytes, which is eight-
[35:24.520 --> 35:26.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's the original character,
[35:26.640 --> 35:27.920]  they're variation selector, right?
[35:27.920 --> 35:29.280]  All sorts of fun.
[35:29.280 --> 35:31.460]  Anyway, all sorts of fun with that back then.
[35:31.460 --> 35:34.560]  But the other thing, though, was that the idea,
[35:34.560 --> 35:35.720]  but this is how-
[35:35.720 --> 35:38.240]  And people were using that weird input mechanism
[35:38.240 --> 35:39.120]  to do this, right?
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.040]  You know, that you're gonna go one, one, one, two, two,
[35:42.040 --> 35:43.880]  three, three, three, four, four, four, four, five.
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.280]  I could never do that.
[35:45.280 --> 35:47.120]  And that was, again, when the iPhone came along,
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.080]  it's like, oh, wow, keyboard now.
[35:49.080 --> 35:51.680]  I jumped on Twitter very early,
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.860]  but only as a web interface.
[35:53.860 --> 35:55.440]  And I don't know that Jack Dorsey,
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.960]  I mean, of course you'd make a website,
[35:56.960 --> 35:58.940]  2006 was late enough in the web era
[35:58.940 --> 36:01.100]  that of course there was a website.
[36:01.100 --> 36:04.280]  But when you were on a phone, before the iPhone,
[36:04.280 --> 36:07.440]  and before Twitterific, and before the modern concept
[36:07.440 --> 36:09.020]  of how you would tweet from a phone,
[36:09.020 --> 36:12.840]  the idea was you would just have an old-fashioned
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.040]  keypad phone, not even a smartphone type thing,
[36:18.040 --> 36:22.680]  and you could get text messages from the people you follow.
[36:22.680 --> 36:25.140]  And so instead of a, there was no timeline,
[36:25.140 --> 36:29.920]  it would just be a text message from 011738,
[36:29.920 --> 36:31.440]  which was like Twitter, I don't know what,
[36:31.440 --> 36:32.360]  I'm making the number up,
[36:32.360 --> 36:34.360]  but they had like a five-digit number.
[36:34.360 --> 36:36.840]  You'd get it, and it would just say,
[36:36.840 --> 36:39.560]  at Chalk & Berry, eating a sandwich,
[36:39.560 --> 36:41.840]  and that would be it.
[36:41.840 --> 36:44.680]  The idea that you would do a timeline,
[36:44.680 --> 36:46.480]  and obviously their website had
[36:46.480 --> 36:48.840]  what we would consider a timeline from the beginning,
[36:48.840 --> 36:50.720]  but the idea that you might,
[36:50.720 --> 36:54.360]  that one might have a timeline like that on their phone
[36:54.360 --> 36:57.440]  was, it took Twitter to the next level.
[36:57.440 --> 37:00.760]  And because, for obvious reasons,
[37:00.760 --> 37:05.760]  it's these little snack-sized nuggets of text,
[37:06.200 --> 37:09.720]  tweet length, were the perfect size
[37:09.720 --> 37:12.160]  for consumption on a phone.
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.320]  And you could put many of,
[37:14.320 --> 37:17.640]  even on the old, original 3.5-inch iPhones,
[37:17.640 --> 37:20.500]  you could put quite a few of them on screen.
[37:20.500 --> 37:24.440]  The iPhone scrolled so well and so smoothly
[37:24.440 --> 37:27.600]  that, for things other than tweets, too,
[37:27.600 --> 37:31.920]  but you can just, you could consume Twitter,
[37:31.920 --> 37:34.360]  and it was one of the few things
[37:34.360 --> 37:36.360]  where it felt like it was just as good
[37:36.360 --> 37:40.480]  to use Twitter on an early iPhone as it was on a desktop.
[37:40.480 --> 37:41.320]  Whereas I-
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.480]  Yeah, it actually was actually probably better, I would say.
[37:44.480 --> 37:46.480]  The whole scrolling thing was very visceral, right?
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.480]  It just kinda, the physicality of it,
[37:51.760 --> 37:53.240]  that's what excited me, right?
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.760]  It's like, oh, this thing is physical,
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.760]  and this thing that I work on
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.300]  works great with that physical input.
[38:00.300 --> 38:04.620]  I remember there was, Twitter itself, by 2008,
[38:05.780 --> 38:09.480]  that was another groundbreaking,
[38:09.480 --> 38:12.000]  very memorable, specific South by Southwest.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.800]  It broke Twitter again, Twitter was already huge.
[38:14.800 --> 38:17.480]  But everybody at South by Southwest had iPhones.
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.480]  And it was m.twitter.com, not mobile, just the letter M.
[38:23.440 --> 38:28.320]  But what it gave you was a web-based interface to Twitter
[38:28.320 --> 38:31.700]  through them that was optimized,
[38:31.700 --> 38:34.080]  effectively optimized for the iPhone, let's face it.
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.160]  But what that meant in 2008,
[38:37.160 --> 38:40.320]  when our iPhones were on the Edge network,
[38:41.560 --> 38:43.520]  which if you're not, you might think,
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.200]  oh yeah, I'm sure Edge was slower than-
[38:46.200 --> 38:47.760]  Yeah, you got no idea.
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.840]  Edge was slower than 3G, I'm sure, but it was so slow.
[38:51.840 --> 38:53.760]  I mean, you can look at this up,
[38:53.760 --> 38:55.640]  I guess I'll put a link in the show notes
[38:55.640 --> 38:57.040]  to Wikipedia's entry.
[38:57.040 --> 38:58.320]  And everybody was using it.
[38:58.320 --> 38:59.280]  Everybody was on-
[38:59.280 --> 39:00.680]  Everybody had it.
[39:00.680 --> 39:03.320]  Everybody was thirsty for it.
[39:03.320 --> 39:06.160]  And it's like, there's one cup of water
[39:06.160 --> 39:07.800]  for a thousand people.
[39:07.800 --> 39:08.640]  Right, so in-
[39:08.640 --> 39:11.920]  And they're all, everyone has a little straw, they're like-
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.000]  So in addition to Twitter breaking
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.160]  during South by Southwest because of that,
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.500]  AT&T's coverage in the convention center area in Austin
[39:21.500 --> 39:24.920]  was flaky as hell. Wiped out, yeah, yeah.
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.240]  And the best possible Edge connection you could get
[39:28.240 --> 39:29.520]  was really slow.
[39:29.520 --> 39:32.960]  But so m.twitter.com did not show avatars
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.440]  because even if they compressed the hell out of them,
[39:36.440 --> 39:39.600]  it would be all sorts of extra data.
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.240]  It was just the text, but it's all you needed, right?
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.160]  And in some ways, your distinctive username, you know-
[39:48.160 --> 39:49.000]  It worked for you.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.480]  Well, and that carries back
[39:51.480 --> 39:54.000]  to the text-based era of the internet, right?
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.240]  When we were doing everything through Telnet
[39:57.240 --> 39:59.960]  and everything was in a terminal window,
[39:59.960 --> 40:02.380]  you'd just recognize people's email addresses,
[40:02.380 --> 40:05.000]  or like on a BBS, everybody just had a nickname.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.180]  Or IRC, still to this day, right?
[40:07.180 --> 40:11.560]  IRC is a handle-based, you know,
[40:11.560 --> 40:13.640]  that's how you identify people, by their handle.
[40:13.640 --> 40:16.100]  And Twitter worked great for that, it really did.
[40:16.100 --> 40:21.000]  And again, it's super primitive by what we expect today
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  with LTE and 5G and the ability for those things to stay up,
[40:26.260 --> 40:28.240]  even when you're at like a football game
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.280]  with 70,000 fans, you know?
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.440]  We expect our phones to continue working, and they do.
[40:35.440 --> 40:36.280]  But by-
[40:36.280 --> 40:40.160]  Yeah, no, there's been a lot of technological change
[40:40.160 --> 40:41.920]  in the last 16 years
[40:41.920 --> 40:43.400]  that we've been working on Twitter, I think.
[40:43.400 --> 40:44.240]  Yeah.
[40:44.240 --> 40:47.400]  There are immense amount, you know, phones,
[40:47.400 --> 40:50.160]  network speeds, CPUs, you know,
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.560]  that, you know, you'd think about the first CPU
[40:53.560 --> 40:54.880]  that was in the first iPhone,
[40:54.880 --> 40:57.680]  versus, you know, what we've got now with the A,
[40:57.680 --> 41:00.360]  I even forget what the number is, 16, 18, something,
[41:00.360 --> 41:03.160]  you know, it's just like so fast.
[41:03.160 --> 41:06.560]  What hasn't changed, though, is people, right?
[41:06.560 --> 41:07.860]  The humanity behind it,
[41:07.860 --> 41:09.840]  the need to connect with other people,
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.240]  the need to kind of know what your friends are doing.
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.600]  That's important to a lot of people.
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.560]  And that hasn't changed in that period of time.
[41:18.560 --> 41:20.920]  So you had, while we're on memory lane,
[41:20.920 --> 41:23.200]  you had Twitterrific running, I mean,
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.080]  and it was good before the SDK was out.
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.840]  And it was like on Cydia or someplace, too.
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.840]  And it was very much a niche kind of thing, but then-
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.640]  It wasn't just my favorite third-party app.
[41:38.640 --> 41:39.880]  It was probably, you know,
[41:39.880 --> 41:42.540]  it instantly became my favorite iPhone,
[41:42.540 --> 41:44.480]  more favorite than all of Apple's own,
[41:44.480 --> 41:46.380]  maybe other than Safari, of course,
[41:46.380 --> 41:47.840]  because having the web on-
[41:47.840 --> 41:49.040]  Yeah, that was killer.
[41:49.040 --> 41:50.280]  On the phone was killer.
[41:50.280 --> 41:54.400]  But like, it was nice to have mail,
[41:54.400 --> 41:57.560]  but email is so verbiage.
[41:57.560 --> 41:59.760]  You know, most emails I write are longer.
[41:59.760 --> 42:01.520]  You don't want to peck them out with your thoughts.
[42:01.520 --> 42:03.680]  It still is great to have email on the phone,
[42:03.680 --> 42:06.260]  but it's not better on the phone
[42:06.260 --> 42:08.460]  than on a desktop with a real keyboard.
[42:08.460 --> 42:11.820]  And, you know, messages was obviously, you know,
[42:11.820 --> 42:13.800]  people forget how the presentation,
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.720]  the modern presentation of a messaging app
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.680]  was pioneered by messages on the iPhone.
[42:20.680 --> 42:22.400]  Where- Yeah, green bubbles, right?
[42:22.400 --> 42:24.400]  Everybody complains about green bubbles for a while.
[42:24.400 --> 42:25.240]  That's all you have.
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.520]  Well, and that they're conceptually sorted
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.600]  by who the chat is with, right?
[42:30.600 --> 42:33.400]  Like on those old Nokia T9 phones,
[42:33.400 --> 42:35.880]  you just had a list of the messages.
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.480]  And so like, if I got a message from you,
[42:39.480 --> 42:41.400]  then a message from my wife,
[42:41.400 --> 42:44.140]  and then a message from my wife,
[42:44.140 --> 42:46.460]  and then a message from you,
[42:46.460 --> 42:49.640]  your messages would be like numbers one and four
[42:49.640 --> 42:52.280]  in a single list with two from my wife in between.
[42:52.280 --> 42:54.240]  And it was just, you know, just showed as-
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.400]  It was hard to read, right?
[42:55.400 --> 42:56.880]  Yeah, it was not good.
[42:56.880 --> 42:58.520]  There was no- No threading.
[42:58.520 --> 42:59.360]  There were no threading.
[42:59.360 --> 43:01.280]  Yeah, well, there was nobody thinking
[43:01.280 --> 43:02.680]  about user interaction, right?
[43:02.680 --> 43:05.480]  That the phone companies were never good
[43:05.480 --> 43:07.200]  at making usable software.
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.680]  They still kind of aren't, but you know.
[43:09.680 --> 43:12.380]  The concept was effectively like,
[43:12.380 --> 43:14.560]  like remember those pink pieces of paper
[43:14.560 --> 43:16.560]  that we used to use for phone calls
[43:16.560 --> 43:17.960]  when you were out at work?
[43:17.960 --> 43:19.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:19.040 --> 43:20.880]  So- You had a stack of those.
[43:20.880 --> 43:23.040]  A stack of these, and if the phone rang
[43:23.040 --> 43:25.200]  and somebody wasn't there, then somebody,
[43:25.200 --> 43:26.640]  you know, it was like phone call,
[43:26.640 --> 43:28.120]  and then you'd write who it was,
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.040]  what time, what date, and what they said to tell you.
[43:32.040 --> 43:33.880]  And then like, you'd get back to your desk
[43:33.880 --> 43:36.400]  and there'd just be a stack of these pink papers
[43:36.400 --> 43:39.400]  from, you know, maybe two of them are from the same person.
[43:39.400 --> 43:41.160]  Maybe they're from seven different people.
[43:41.160 --> 43:45.760]  But that was the concept of SMS on phones before iMessage.
[43:45.760 --> 43:46.960]  I mean, I know that Apple didn't,
[43:46.960 --> 43:49.120]  Apple actually just called it SMS originally,
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.400]  but I'll call it messages.
[43:50.400 --> 43:52.760]  Because it's, you know, obviously the same app.
[43:52.760 --> 43:53.600]  It was the messaging app, yeah.
[43:53.600 --> 43:54.760]  So that was a big one.
[43:54.760 --> 43:56.280]  But Twitter was just mind-blowing,
[43:56.280 --> 43:58.960]  because like you said, I honestly think Twitter
[43:58.960 --> 44:01.440]  on the phone was better than Twitter on a desktop.
[44:01.440 --> 44:04.000]  It was the one thing that was better on the desktop,
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.440]  because, and-
[44:05.440 --> 44:08.640]  Well, the thing too is because it was better,
[44:08.640 --> 44:11.120]  I totally agree that it was better on the phone
[44:11.120 --> 44:12.200]  than on the desktop.
[44:12.200 --> 44:14.800]  But even in those very early days, right,
[44:14.800 --> 44:16.000]  in the jailbreak days,
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.240]  there were actually a couple of different apps.
[44:19.240 --> 44:21.160]  There was another one called Twinkle,
[44:21.160 --> 44:23.720]  which was, they took a totally different approach.
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.240]  So that whole UI playground idea started really early.
[44:32.920 --> 44:36.520]  In fact, back then there were also websites
[44:36.520 --> 44:39.920]  that, you know, people were using the quote unquote
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.120]  sweet solution to get Twitter,
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.960]  and they were making their own,
[44:45.960 --> 44:48.320]  they were hitting the API, doing their own thing,
[44:48.320 --> 44:51.640]  you know, XML HTTP requests, you know,
[44:51.640 --> 44:52.920]  filling it in a timeline,
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.920]  and we were kind of all seeing what this new thing could do.
[44:58.680 --> 45:00.480]  And yeah, it was-
[45:00.480 --> 45:01.840]  Well, so what happened,
[45:01.840 --> 45:04.400]  and then once they announced the SDK,
[45:04.400 --> 45:06.120]  you were already working on jailbreaking,
[45:06.120 --> 45:09.680]  and Steve Jobs said, okay, okay, we hear you,
[45:09.680 --> 45:11.760]  we're gonna do an SDK in a couple of months,
[45:11.760 --> 45:13.600]  give us some time to get it right.
[45:13.600 --> 45:15.520]  And then they announced it in March.
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.120]  I believe that was the first event JAWS ever hosted.
[45:19.120 --> 45:21.600]  JAWS, I remember, hosted the,
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.040]  here's our keynote introducing the developer SDK.
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.600]  And then, you know, you did the smart thing
[45:29.600 --> 45:31.880]  and adopted the official SDK
[45:31.880 --> 45:33.760]  as opposed to staying jailbroken,
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.240]  even though in some ways it was more limited,
[45:37.240 --> 45:38.600]  because instead of having access
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.800]  to all of the private APIs that you had figured out,
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.000]  it was like the first public APIs
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.680]  were the, here's the subset of them.
[45:47.680 --> 45:50.880]  Yeah, I was pretty happy to stop digging around
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.840]  in the Microsoft XML parser.
[45:54.840 --> 45:57.240]  It was obviously a better way to go.
[45:57.240 --> 45:59.640]  It was, yeah, it was worth the wait.
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.640]  And it also gave us some time to sort of step back.
[46:06.520 --> 46:10.160]  And I view that the original jailbreak one
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.040]  is just the experimental phase, right?
[46:13.040 --> 46:16.640]  All of our products kind of have a experimental phrase.
[46:16.640 --> 46:19.760]  We typically don't do those in public.
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.680]  With the jailbreak, we were kind of,
[46:21.680 --> 46:24.480]  that was the only option to do it in public.
[46:24.480 --> 46:28.080]  So yeah, we kind of stepped back and thought about,
[46:28.080 --> 46:30.080]  okay, what do we want to do
[46:30.080 --> 46:32.000]  given the constraint to the phone?
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.760]  You know, like my experience of, you know,
[46:33.760 --> 46:36.160]  killing the battery by keeping the radio on,
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.560]  that was like, okay, how are we going to deal with that?
[46:39.560 --> 46:44.560]  Right, when you experiment with something new,
[46:44.680 --> 46:47.640]  you quickly learn what its constraints are.
[46:47.640 --> 46:50.440]  And that, for software development, is hugely important.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.960]  Yeah, yeah, you gotta play test to figure it out.
[46:52.960 --> 46:56.080]  You had to make it, you know, start with an idea,
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.240]  but then don't be, you know, strong ideas loosely held,
[46:59.240 --> 47:00.920]  right, oh, here's how I think it'll work,
[47:00.920 --> 47:02.960]  let me get it working, and then you start using it,
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.000]  and you're like, oh, this would be better.
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.360]  Well, remember that early version
[47:07.360 --> 47:09.200]  also had a transparent background
[47:09.200 --> 47:11.560]  because we thought it'd be nice to see your,
[47:11.560 --> 47:13.360]  and then it's like you take it out in bright sunlight
[47:13.360 --> 47:15.200]  and go, oh, okay, that's a bad idea.
[47:15.200 --> 47:20.200]  Then by 2008, June, you know, one year into the iPhone,
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.520]  there was already an Apple Design Awards
[47:24.520 --> 47:26.040]  for the iPhone, right?
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.880]  It was the very first year, the SDK was literally
[47:30.880 --> 47:33.560]  only four months old, April, May, June,
[47:33.560 --> 47:35.520]  maybe three months old. Something like that, yeah.
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.600]  I seem to remember we had very little time
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.120]  from the SDK drop to the point of, you know,
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.680]  submitting the stuff for the App Store.
[47:44.680 --> 47:46.840]  It was just like, how are we gonna do this in three months?
[47:46.840 --> 47:48.360]  Well, we did it.
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.520]  Here's where my memory is, you know,
[47:52.360 --> 47:55.040]  well, it's halfway like Swiss cheese at this point,
[47:55.040 --> 48:00.040]  and it's funny because as my memory gets fuzzier,
[48:00.840 --> 48:03.480]  it's not just that I don't remember certain things,
[48:03.480 --> 48:06.960]  it's that I'm not 100% sure if what I remember
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.960]  actually happened or not, or if my mind sort of turned
[48:12.440 --> 48:14.280]  the way you wanted it to be.
[48:14.280 --> 48:16.120]  It's sort of like what you're, well, yeah,
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.600]  it's like an adaptation, right?
[48:17.600 --> 48:21.480]  So like if you take a 500-page novel
[48:21.480 --> 48:23.600]  and you wanna make a two-hour movie out of it,
[48:23.600 --> 48:26.080]  you've gotta consolidate some characters, right?
[48:26.080 --> 48:28.720]  So instead of having three police detectives,
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.000]  you just make one and that character has all three
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.800]  of the roles from the novel.
[48:36.800 --> 48:38.480]  But here's a memory I have.
[48:38.480 --> 48:43.320]  I remember that when you won, when Icon Factory won
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.200]  that Apple Design Award in 2008 for the Twitterrific
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.120]  three months into the App Store, it was so joyous.
[48:51.120 --> 48:54.840]  I can't remember if you were my first friend
[48:54.840 --> 48:56.240]  to win an ADA or not.
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.920]  Probably not because, you know.
[48:57.920 --> 49:01.680]  No, I think Cable, Steven probably.
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.000]  Yeah, the panic guys.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.960]  Yeah, they were the pros at that point.
[49:04.960 --> 49:09.960]  But it was always, the ADAs are still prestigious,
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.040]  but man, in that 2010, 2000s decade
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.440]  for our indie pals, the ADAs, it was just so joyous
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.720]  whenever somebody we knew won and it was so,
[49:24.720 --> 49:26.880]  again, it was just, oh my God, this is awesome.
[49:26.880 --> 49:28.960]  And it should be no surprise
[49:28.960 --> 49:31.200]  because the Twitterrific was just so amazing,
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.680]  but you never know, Apple's taste.
[49:34.680 --> 49:35.560]  What are they gonna love?
[49:35.560 --> 49:37.560]  Apple's taste in the ADAs,
[49:37.560 --> 49:40.120]  like everything else about Apple, can be inscrutable.
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.160]  But you won, and what I remember was,
[49:43.160 --> 49:45.480]  that was the night where me and you
[49:45.480 --> 49:48.920]  and the panic gang went to-
[49:48.920 --> 49:50.280]  And Corey, yeah.
[49:50.280 --> 49:52.000]  Chevy's.
[49:52.000 --> 49:52.840]  Oh God, yeah.
[49:52.840 --> 49:53.680]  Chevy.
[49:53.680 --> 49:54.520]  And had those giant margaritas.
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.440]  Chevy's was a Mexican, big, big Mexican restaurant.
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.440]  The type of big Mexican restaurant
[50:01.440 --> 50:04.160]  that was exactly at the right location.
[50:04.160 --> 50:06.960]  Cat-A-Corner from a convention center.
[50:06.960 --> 50:07.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:07.800 --> 50:11.360]  And they serve margaritas the size of Craig's hands.
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.040]  Margaritas that looked big, even in your hands.
[50:18.040 --> 50:20.640]  And we were all on Cloud 9,
[50:20.640 --> 50:23.360]  and of course you, especially, you had-
[50:23.360 --> 50:27.920]  I remember getting off the stage and I just,
[50:27.920 --> 50:30.200]  I tweeted just, holy shit.
[50:30.200 --> 50:31.280]  And that was it.
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.160]  And everybody who followed me knew what that meant, right?
[50:35.160 --> 50:36.560]  It was like, I didn't have to say,
[50:36.560 --> 50:39.000]  oh, I just won an ADA award, here's me.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.840]  It was just like, it was very raw at that point.
[50:41.840 --> 50:43.360]  Here's the other thing that I remember.
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.080]  I think it was when we were coordinating,
[50:45.080 --> 50:45.960]  where should we go?
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.680]  And before we just said, hey, you know,
[50:47.680 --> 50:49.800]  the panic guys are going over to Chevy's, let's meet them.
[50:49.800 --> 50:50.640]  I forget, you know, it was about,
[50:50.640 --> 50:52.560]  I don't know, about 10 of us there.
[50:52.560 --> 50:55.120]  But I remember, and this could be a false memory,
[50:55.120 --> 50:58.760]  but I seem to recall that you and I were in the,
[50:58.760 --> 51:01.800]  at the bottom level of, street level of Moscone West,
[51:01.800 --> 51:05.800]  like in the lobby, waiting to figure out what should we do?
[51:05.800 --> 51:06.640]  Where should we go?
[51:06.640 --> 51:08.640]  And people were coming up and congratulating you.
[51:08.640 --> 51:10.440]  People easily recognize you.
[51:10.440 --> 51:12.380]  And even people who maybe didn't know
[51:12.380 --> 51:15.920]  that what you look like, or that you're rather tall.
[51:15.920 --> 51:19.560]  They knew you after they had just seen you go on stage
[51:19.560 --> 51:20.640]  to take the award, right?
[51:20.640 --> 51:21.480]  You had just been on stage.
[51:21.480 --> 51:22.960]  They go, holy shit, that guy's tall.
[51:22.960 --> 51:27.800]  And a mutual friend of ours who was at Apple
[51:27.800 --> 51:32.000]  on this secret iPhone team on their performance team,
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.440]  and I believe is still there
[51:33.440 --> 51:34.920]  and might still be on the same team,
[51:34.920 --> 51:36.280]  so I'm not going to say his name,
[51:36.280 --> 51:39.000]  but I think you know who I'm talking about,
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.520]  came up to you to congratulate you
[51:41.520 --> 51:44.740]  and then dropped like a bomb on you.
[51:44.740 --> 51:47.480]  Like, hey, and by the way, for scrolling,
[51:47.480 --> 51:50.100]  if you, what you really probably want to do
[51:50.100 --> 51:54.360]  is embed like a UI view in a UI view
[51:54.360 --> 51:57.320]  instead of using a table, something like that, right?
[51:57.320 --> 52:00.680]  Like, you had been doing a certain thing.
[52:00.680 --> 52:03.160]  He knew exactly what you were doing, and he's-
[52:03.160 --> 52:04.160]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.920]  Well, they had like a two or three year head start
[52:06.920 --> 52:08.040]  on the scrolling.
[52:08.040 --> 52:11.440]  Right, and he knew exactly what you were doing
[52:11.440 --> 52:14.280]  and said, yeah, you know, we ran into that
[52:14.280 --> 52:16.480]  with this two or three of them,
[52:16.480 --> 52:18.200]  named some of their first party apps.
[52:18.200 --> 52:21.280]  And what we figured out is if you embed sub views
[52:21.280 --> 52:25.880]  and do this, and it was gibberish to me, you know?
[52:25.880 --> 52:29.080]  It was all, yeah, for the technical listeners,
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.480]  it's all about flattening the view hierarchy, right?
[52:31.480 --> 52:33.800]  It's like, there was actually, as you're scrolling,
[52:33.800 --> 52:34.980]  those views had to be created,
[52:34.980 --> 52:38.960]  and views that contained views were less performance,
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.840]  less performant than if you just created a snapshot,
[52:42.840 --> 52:44.880]  basically created a snapshot of the view, right?
[52:44.880 --> 52:46.680]  Let the GPU do all the work.
[52:46.680 --> 52:51.400]  And I was like, oh, yeah, of course.
[52:51.400 --> 52:55.640]  And a while later, met up with Lauren Briktor,
[52:55.640 --> 52:58.040]  and he kind of relayed the same thing.
[52:58.040 --> 53:00.080]  It's like, that's one of the reasons
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.360]  why Tweedy was so awesome, because, I mean,
[53:03.360 --> 53:05.600]  Lauren actually did the cover flow
[53:05.600 --> 53:07.840]  on the original iPod app.
[53:07.840 --> 53:08.720]  Was it the iPod app?
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.880]  I think it was called the iPod app, or iTunes.
[53:10.880 --> 53:13.760]  It was way back, whatever it was called.
[53:13.760 --> 53:15.840]  It was the thing that had the cover flow.
[53:15.840 --> 53:19.040]  And you know, the guy who makes cover flow
[53:19.040 --> 53:21.880]  is probably gonna make a pretty good Twitter client,
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.240]  you know, scrolling, so.
[53:23.240 --> 53:26.560]  But I just remember, yeah, and I understood the,
[53:26.560 --> 53:28.180]  you know, I know enough about programming,
[53:28.180 --> 53:30.740]  and I understood the idea of flattening the view,
[53:30.740 --> 53:33.200]  and then therefore having way fewer
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.140]  of these object instantiations for each one.
[53:36.140 --> 53:38.120]  And while you're scrolling fast,
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.940]  and one of the things that's still fun to do on an iPhone
[53:40.940 --> 53:44.280]  is just scroll fast as like a fiddle toy.
[53:44.280 --> 53:47.800]  I just remember, though, when he dropped that on you,
[53:47.800 --> 53:52.080]  it like, you instantly went from the euphoria
[53:52.080 --> 53:54.160]  of holy shit, we just won an ADA,
[53:54.160 --> 53:58.080]  to oh my God, I know exactly what he's talking about.
[53:58.080 --> 54:03.080]  And it's really bugged you all along
[54:04.020 --> 54:06.160]  that Twitterrific wasn't scrolling as smoothly
[54:06.160 --> 54:08.600]  as like, say, Messages was, right?
[54:08.600 --> 54:12.800]  Yeah, that's true, and then you weren't there.
[54:12.800 --> 54:15.320]  The next day, I met a guy named Rizwan Satar,
[54:15.320 --> 54:19.400]  who was at that point working on the AOL app,
[54:19.400 --> 54:20.480]  I believe it was.
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.120]  And he's like, I was asking all these questions
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.200]  about the scroll view,
[54:25.200 --> 54:28.920]  because I was having trouble making things snap
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.160]  like the Photos app did, you know?
[54:31.160 --> 54:33.240]  When you scroll a photo, it kind of snaps into place.
[54:33.240 --> 54:37.400]  And I had written a bunch of code to try to emulate that,
[54:37.400 --> 54:40.080]  and I was like, this is really hard.
[54:40.080 --> 54:42.880]  He came up to me after one of the presentations
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.200]  and said, you know, there's just this flag you can set.
[54:46.200 --> 54:49.640]  I was like, I literally spent like, you know,
[54:49.640 --> 54:53.400]  probably three or four weeks on doing my own implementation.
[54:53.400 --> 54:57.720]  And again, it was because I missed the documentation, right?
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.460]  It's like the, you know, I was doing a lot of this stuff
[55:01.460 --> 55:04.520]  before even the, you know, Apple was publishing the SDK,
[55:04.520 --> 55:06.940]  but it wasn't, you know, it's like, you know,
[55:06.940 --> 55:08.920]  description forthcoming kind of thing, right?
[55:08.920 --> 55:11.200]  It's like, they had a lot of work
[55:11.200 --> 55:13.960]  to do for the documentation, so yeah.
[55:13.960 --> 55:16.240]  So in addition to missing documentation period,
[55:16.240 --> 55:18.840]  there was also the fact that a big part of it
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.120]  was the best practices for how to use them.
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.280]  So you could read, let's just say
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.280]  if you're a superhuman developer
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.580]  and you could read the API documentation
[55:31.580 --> 55:34.560]  from start to finish and memorize it all,
[55:34.560 --> 55:37.260]  that still didn't tell you how best to do something
[55:37.260 --> 55:38.740]  to get like performance scrolling.
[55:38.740 --> 55:41.360]  But it was so good as it was
[55:41.360 --> 55:44.160]  that you won the Apple Design Award
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.400]  and revolutionized the way people think of Twitter.
[55:48.400 --> 55:50.600]  Other things, and I know we've covered them before,
[55:50.600 --> 55:52.280]  but why not cover them now?
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.280]  Twitterrific's use of Ollie the bird as the icon
[55:58.440 --> 56:02.040]  predates Twitter having a bird as its logo.
[56:02.040 --> 56:04.440]  Like, and you guys have mentioned it,
[56:04.440 --> 56:06.320]  and rightly so, you know, that the-
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.960]  It, the story behind that is the Mac app,
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.960]  which we started working on late 2006, released early 2007.
[56:15.960 --> 56:18.440]  Now I'm a developer, right, and I just put
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.500]  this crappy little icon in the app that, you know,
[56:22.500 --> 56:26.520]  I knew it was a placeholder and we were all using the app.
[56:26.520 --> 56:30.280]  And David Lanham just one day
[56:30.280 --> 56:33.160]  sent me this little blue bird.
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.760]  Dave, now David is one of your colleagues at iConfact.
[56:36.760 --> 56:40.720]  He was a colleague. He's now out on his own,
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.960]  but yeah, he's super talented artist, great guy.
[56:44.960 --> 56:47.440]  And he sent me this icon, and I could not get that
[56:47.440 --> 56:49.340]  into our software repository fast enough.
[56:49.340 --> 56:52.820]  I mean, it's just obviously this, this just works.
[56:52.820 --> 56:57.820]  And yeah, that predates Twitter's icon for,
[56:58.280 --> 57:00.960]  I mean, at the time, all they had was the word mark.
[57:00.960 --> 57:03.640]  You know, the big fat round Twitter letters.
[57:03.640 --> 57:04.480]  Yeah, and-
[57:04.480 --> 57:05.560]  And that was it.
[57:05.560 --> 57:10.020]  And then as a, if they needed something smaller and square,
[57:10.020 --> 57:14.100]  they just used the T from the Twitter wordmark.
[57:14.100 --> 57:17.560]  And that whole, you know,
[57:17.560 --> 57:19.920]  David coming up with the blue bird,
[57:19.920 --> 57:22.220]  that was the first step.
[57:22.220 --> 57:26.360]  And one of the challenges I had in that early app
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.640]  was coming up with verbs and nouns,
[57:29.640 --> 57:33.000]  because we had no name for these things, right?
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.520]  It's like, you know, they were, you know, SMS posts,
[57:37.520 --> 57:41.300]  they were posts of some other kind.
[57:41.300 --> 57:45.500]  And in developing the UI, it's like, I needed to say,
[57:45.500 --> 57:48.700]  you know, something that, you know, refresh,
[57:48.700 --> 57:52.020]  what are we gonna, well, okay, let's call it a timeline.
[57:52.020 --> 57:54.380]  You know, post, what am I gonna,
[57:54.380 --> 57:55.860]  I'm not gonna say post a post.
[57:55.860 --> 57:57.900]  I'm not gonna, you know,
[57:57.900 --> 58:00.100]  I'm not gonna say send a post.
[58:00.100 --> 58:01.620]  It's just, it was really kind of,
[58:01.620 --> 58:02.580]  I was just like, okay,
[58:02.580 --> 58:03.900]  I'm gonna put a placeholder in here.
[58:03.900 --> 58:06.660]  I'm gonna call them Twits, right?
[58:06.660 --> 58:11.340]  So the first version of Twitter, if you use Twits,
[58:11.340 --> 58:16.340]  and it had the blue bird icon,
[58:16.860 --> 58:19.300]  and folks at Twitter were actually using this app.
[58:19.300 --> 58:20.620]  They loved it, right?
[58:20.620 --> 58:22.620]  That they were like, oh, wow,
[58:22.620 --> 58:25.420]  somebody is making something awesome with our API.
[58:25.420 --> 58:27.100]  They were all into it.
[58:27.100 --> 58:29.260]  And Blaine Cook, one of their,
[58:29.260 --> 58:33.220]  he was actually the guy that was helping scale the app,
[58:33.220 --> 58:34.260]  getting it, you know,
[58:34.260 --> 58:36.380]  so it wouldn't fail well and all that,
[58:36.380 --> 58:37.700]  just sent me an email one time.
[58:37.700 --> 58:41.140]  He says, you know, Twits is not a very good name, you know.
[58:41.140 --> 58:43.020]  If you thought about maybe calling them like Tweet,
[58:43.020 --> 58:46.540]  and I was like, that was fucking awesome.
[58:46.540 --> 58:49.340]  The bird tweeting, yeah, okay, great.
[58:49.340 --> 58:51.460]  And that was the first, you know,
[58:51.460 --> 58:53.060]  first time anybody called them a Tweet.
[58:53.060 --> 58:55.560]  So the bird came first,
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.420]  and then from the bird as the icon came the verb,
[58:59.420 --> 59:01.220]  and noun, Tweet.
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.340]  Yeah. That's amazing.
[59:02.340 --> 59:04.060]  It's unbelievable.
[59:04.060 --> 59:04.900]  Yeah. All right.
[59:04.900 --> 59:08.700]  No, and see, it was very experimental at that point.
[59:08.700 --> 59:10.300]  It was just everybody,
[59:10.300 --> 59:12.020]  nobody knew what they were doing, right?
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.860]  It was just, we were just kind of all like,
[59:14.860 --> 59:16.920]  and, but you knew when it was right.
[59:16.920 --> 59:21.100]  Like, I knew when that blue bird came along, that was it.
[59:21.100 --> 59:23.820]  Well, that was what we were missing.
[59:23.820 --> 59:25.100]  And then Tweet came along,
[59:25.100 --> 59:27.220]  and it's like, that's another thing we were missing.
[59:27.220 --> 59:29.100]  And among other things,
[59:29.100 --> 59:31.940]  in terms of innovations that were driven by third party,
[59:31.940 --> 59:35.460]  and it speaks both to the role of third party developers
[59:35.460 --> 59:39.220]  on iOS, moving iOS forward in the idioms,
[59:39.220 --> 59:42.580]  and also Twitter itself, right at the intersection of it,
[59:42.580 --> 59:47.580]  was that in his, after Loren Brikter left Apple
[59:47.700 --> 59:48.840]  and struck out on his own,
[59:48.840 --> 59:53.800]  he made Tweety and invented pool to refresh.
[59:53.800 --> 59:55.100]  Yeah, that was another thing.
[59:55.100 --> 59:57.900]  I was like, oh, I wish I thought of that.
[59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.340]  So we, one of the things-
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.460]  That was a really good thing.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:06.740]  And then it sort of goes back to these innovations
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.820]  in Twitter, we're far reaching, right?
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.420]  There are screen names at GitHub,
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.540]  there are hashtags, anywhere you look, there's a hashtag.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:19.820]  You know, the notion of replying to somebody's thing, right?
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.180]  There's these linkages between thought.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.420]  This stuff is spreading, right?
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.140]  You know, it's like they're, you know, pool to refresh.
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.220]  If you don't have to, doesn't have pool to refresh,
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.820]  and I was like, what the hell are you thinking?
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.300]  It reminds me of like back in the classic Mac OS era
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.480]  when Mac TCP was like shareware, right?
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.480]  And so the extension that you installed on your Mac
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.500]  to do TCP IP networking didn't come from Apple.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.780]  It was like a community project.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.660]  And you know, the idea that pool to refresh
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.380]  in a list on these touchscreen devices
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.940]  didn't come from Apple.
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.540]  But you know, I think easily, it was so obvious
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.580]  that even within a year, Apple adopted it
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.920]  and had APIs and figured out,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.180]  here's how this can be part of it.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.020]  It did not take long.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.060]  Yeah, that little segment, they even came up
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.580]  with the little segmented control
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.840]  that kind of spins as you pull down,
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.180]  and that was all they, it was clearly,
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.580]  they had the same reaction that I did.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.620]  It's like, ah, geez, I wish I thought like that.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.500]  It was just such an exciting time
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.120]  and innovations were coming left and right.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.340]  All right, let me take another break here
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.740]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.020]  It is our good friends at Nebula.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.180]  Nebula is a streaming service created and owned
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.380]  by some of the internet's most thoughtful creators.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.880]  And that's, it really is true.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.400]  It's important that they are, in fact, owners.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.380]  They have equity in the service.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:46.120]  And they offer full-length and ad-free videos
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.720]  earlier than anywhere else,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.340]  as well as Nebula-exclusive content.
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.940]  Fully-produced Nebula originals,
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:57.180]  like Anita Sarkeesian's That Time When, or Impact.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.700]  Rene Ritchie, friend of the show,
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.140]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.300]  Rene Ritchie has a channel on Nebula.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.900]  For example, he's got like a feature-length retrospective
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.420]  on the launch of the iPhone.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.340]  He also posts a lot of his stuff,
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.760]  and a lot of the creators on Nebula do the same thing,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.200]  where they'll post the same stuff that they post to YouTube,
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.580]  but put an extended version on Nebula.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.820]  And if you've ever been listening
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.880]  to a lot of YouTube channels,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.320]  you might hear them say at the end of their YouTube videos
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.040]  that you could check them out on Nebula.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.200]  You don't just get them ad-free,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.580]  as opposed to YouTube on Nebula,
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.080]  but you get extended versions.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.820]  And it is to YouTube what HBO was
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.240]  to regular commercial TV back in the day.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.760]  It's the best of the best.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.460]  And it is, you know, you get what you pay for.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.580]  They've also got Nebula classes,
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.880]  so like this whole online, learn-at-your-own pace
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.220]  through video expertise in small nuggets,
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.040]  and have them be professionally produced and edited,
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.880]  and so that it doesn't feel like doing homework.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.740]  It actually, you know, while you're learning,
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.660]  it actually feels more like entertainment.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.320]  So they've got Nebula classes for all kinds of stuff,
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.640]  including an introduction to programming
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.840]  called What Is Code? from creator
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.700]  and NYU professor Daniel Shiffman.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.000]  So that might be of interest to people
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.400]  who listen to this show, bonus and exclusive content,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.800]  all sorts of other stuff.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.080]  I really love it.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.920]  It is so great, and you might think,
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.400]  ah, you know, YouTube's good enough.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.120]  I'm telling you, try it out.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.240]  They've got so much good stuff there.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.320]  It is normally just five bucks a month or 50 bucks a year,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.640]  but listeners of the talk show,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.380]  you can get a whole year of Nebula for just 40 bucks.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.000]  That's cheap for a whole year of this
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.220]  by going to nebula.tv slash the talk show.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.300]  That's nebula.tv slash the talk show.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.860]  Go check it out, watch a couple of the videos,
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.020]  and you'll see how good they are,
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.740]  and you'll see what a bargain it is at 40 bucks a year.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.380]  My thanks to Nebula.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.420]  I can't imagine how great it must be
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.140]  to be able to watch somebody code
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:07.140]  and watch along with somebody who knows what they're doing.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.900]  I mean, I'm old enough to...
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.420]  When I first started coding, right,
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.300]  it's like we had magazines.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.820]  I know, I remember.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.260]  We had no bulletin boards.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.660]  It was just like you copied and pasted code
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.100]  out of Byte Magazine or whatever.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.220]  Remember when they started?
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.140]  I don't know.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.660]  Floppy disks were always so expensive,
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.320]  or at least they were back then,
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.760]  that in the early days,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.980]  you would literally have to retype the program.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.220]  The only thing they'd give you is the print out.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.700]  They'd say, here's a sample program.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.100]  And there was no OCR or anything.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.560]  No, no OCR, definitely not.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.340]  And you'd get an O for zero or something,
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.420]  and it's like that one character was screwing you up
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.620]  and it'd take you hours to find it.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.580]  It was a breakthrough when those programming magazines
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.260]  could start shipping CDs,
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.020]  or maybe they did have floppies at some point
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.060]  and they just charged,
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.020]  it was like a $15 magazine or something,
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.420]  but you'd get a floppy disk,
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.360]  and then you could actually have the sample programs
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.420]  without retyping them.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.300]  It was groundbreaking.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.460]  And then you could download them from the internet.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.340]  Yeah, I'll just say this about Nebula.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.620]  The sponsor reads over,
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.900]  but I'll just point this out too,
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.020]  that it does fit with the theme of the show,
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.020]  which is that this idea or situation of indie developers,
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.500]  the wide open world of creativity
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.020]  that the internet enables,
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.580]  being dependent on one choke point corporate overload.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.140]  And people are certainly a lot happier with YouTube
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.840]  than they are with Twitter,
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.620]  but still YouTube is YouTube and if they pull your ads
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.180]  or something for some reason,
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.540]  or they pull the whole video because somebody said
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.980]  that some algorithm detected
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.160]  that there was a copyright violation of some music
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.940]  or something like that,
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.900]  YouTube's in charge there.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.100]  On Nebula, the creators are in charge.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.100]  And if everybody is sort of having a reckoning,
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.680]  I certainly am,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.680]  and sort of looking at certain dependencies we've had
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.380]  on things like Twitter,
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.440]  as opposed to the openness of Mastodon
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.560]  and rethinking my priorities and not being lazy.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.860]  Nebula is to YouTube what something more federated
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.100]  or more in control of the creators than a service
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.940]  is for truly professional video.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.340]  So anyway.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.660]  Yeah, there's a silver lining in all this for me.
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.900]  It's the outpouring of support,
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.060]  people saying how much they've appreciated our work.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.900]  People saying, I got into design
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.680]  because that first version of Twitter kind of inspired me.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.340]  I've had people tell me,
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.340]  it's like they got into iOS programming
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.700]  because they saw what I was doing.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.780]  I mean, that to me is so rewarding.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.420]  And that's kind of the dream of indie development.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.620]  You're doing something for somebody else.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.460]  It was-
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.860]  Right, not for an advertiser, a corporate client,
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.420]  or business to business bullshit.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.260]  Well then, and that exactly though is what,
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.060]  like in that era, the indie developers I knew
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.580]  were only working on two platforms.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.580]  I mean, and I didn't know, there were Windows,
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.420]  of course, Windows indie developers.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.220]  I'm sure more of them because Windows
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.520]  was and remained so much bigger.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.740]  And of course there was the indie games market,
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.780]  which was already, has been a thing
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.500]  as long as you've been able to-
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.380]  Games are a separate thing.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.260]  But in people I knew, I knew web developers
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.620]  and I knew Mac developers.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:49.220]  And I didn't know anybody who wrote phones, phone software.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.700]  I don't even know anybody who thought,
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.100]  hey, should we write something for a phone?
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.100]  Because there was no way to write, even if you-
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.060]  Well, there was some Java stuff that you know,
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.740]  it was just like, it was clunky.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.460]  I mean, it's just like, oh, I'm not doing this.
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.700]  A, right, A, even if you did it,
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.620]  you weren't gonna make something that was actually
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.740]  joyful or joyous or well-designed.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.700]  B, you couldn't distribute it to anybody
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.540]  because everything, you had to go-
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.300]  It had to go through the phone company.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.980]  As Steve Jobs famous called them the orifices,
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.380]  but it was this bureaucratic,
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:27.020]  like Terry Gilliam's Brazil nightmare of the,
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.140]  and they just, they didn't see a problem with it
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.140]  because I don't think that the carriers ever envisioned
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.100]  anybody else would just,
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.900]  the only other major corporations, you know, like-
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.300]  Apple deserves a lot of credit for cracking that.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.140]  Right.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.980]  So it wasn't-
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.620]  It was a deal with Singular.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.260]  It wasn't just writing touchscreen software,
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:52.260]  which was new or having a bright, colorful 3.5 inch screen,
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.340]  which seemed huge compared to the phones
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:59.460]  that only had a little tiny, you know, postage stamp screen
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.980]  above a keyboard.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.500]  It was the idea of writing for phones at all.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.460]  And we just started with these devices
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.980]  that were so much more amazing
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.740]  and could enable incredibly beautiful software.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.860]  Software that wasn't like,
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.260]  hey, that looks pretty good for a phone.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.420]  It was actually, hey, that looks better than Mac apps,
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.260]  you know, like the-
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.100]  Right.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.740]  Because the iPhone had smaller pixels
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.860]  and it was, you could make an iPhone app
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.100]  that looked better than Mac apps even looked.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.140]  Let, you know, whereas-
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.460]  Especially at a distance, right?
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.940]  You know, that was, you know, everybody, you know,
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.580]  it's like the retinal display is awesome.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.420]  Right.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.260]  But at the distance,
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.980]  you were typically holding the screen
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.060]  of the original iPhone.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.500]  The pickles kind of disappeared
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.820]  and that's how they got away with all those rich textures.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.380]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.220]  Question for you.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:53.220]  Do you think Apple knew that the App Store
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:58.700]  was gonna be a thing at the time that the iPhone came out?
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.540]  Do you think that they-
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.380]  Yeah, I do.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.940]  Were happy with just having that one screen
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.620]  of their own apps and that was it?
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.460]  I think that, you know,
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.260]  having read enough of this Jobs biographies,
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.380]  I think, you know, like,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:15.140]  I think it's what most people would guess was the truth,
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:18.220]  which is that there were some people in Apple
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.860]  who felt like it's, you know,
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.140]  before the iPhone was even announced,
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.860]  that, oh, it's inevitable that we're,
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:29.060]  this is gonna be a thing sort of at some way like the Mac
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:33.700]  where these apps that we're making with the UI kit
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.900]  will be made by third-party developers,
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.660]  just like third-party developers can do things for the Mac.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.020]  And then, you know, I think Steve Jobs himself was,
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:48.020]  I think sort of had a we'll-see attitude towards it.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.940]  Yeah, that's my guess too.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.820]  It was like, you know, this is a possibility.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.460]  Let's not discard it.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.740]  Let's see how it plays out.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.700]  I mean, launching a product of that scope, you know,
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.820]  you know you're gonna be busy with it for a year.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:03.660]  Right.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.500]  At least.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.580]  Right, and you know, the thing about Jobs was that he was,
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.220]  one of his very, very best abilities
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.900]  was his unbelievable ability to change his mind.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.900]  And famously what he would often do,
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.300]  I mean, so many people have the exact same story.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.140]  And Andy Hertzfeld, I think,
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.700]  probably told the earliest versions of it
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.220]  in his wonderful, wonderful Revolution in the Valley book,
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.780]  which is also at the website folklore.org.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.580]  It's kind of weird that the book is Revolution in the Valley
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.500]  and the website is folklore.org, but it's the same content.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.780]  But the story that would happen over and over again
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.940]  is someone would come up to Steve and say,
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.740]  here's my idea, I wanna do X.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.180]  And he'd think about it and say,
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.540]  that's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.500]  No, we're not doing that.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.180]  And then the next day Jobs would come in
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.640]  and go to the same guy and say,
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.820]  hey, I had a good idea yesterday.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.580]  I think we should do.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.360]  What if we do X?
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.340]  And it's the exact same thing.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.780]  But he would say it like that, you know,
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.460]  it's like he slept on it, his brain absorbed the idea,
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.180]  and then he thought it was his idea.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.420]  And then, you know, the engineer,
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.980]  you'd just learn to go with it.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.940]  That's how you got your ideas approved.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.340]  And I think it could be like that,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.760]  where he was thinking, you know,
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.380]  because the other weird thing about being Steve Jobs
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.520]  is he could get every single app he wanted onto the phone
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.060]  because he was Steve Jobs, you know?
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.940]  And, you know, if it was him who said,
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.740]  oh, I definitely want a YouTube app
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.700]  built into the original iPhone,
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:29.660]  he could make that happen.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.820]  He could call Eric Schmidt and they could, you know,
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.220]  work out a deal and they'll give, you know,
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.600]  that YouTube app was written by Apple,
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:41.600]  but obviously with APIs and permission from Google.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.460]  Yeah, thank God he didn't want a Twitter app.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.300]  I know, right?
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.140]  Exactly.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.700]  But it would have been totally different.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.780]  My whole career trajectory
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.700]  would have been totally different.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.500]  Right, if he did, he would have had it.
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.980]  So that is the one thing where everybody else
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.460]  is looking at the original iPhone
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.820]  and people like me and you and, you know,
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.660]  are looking and thinking,
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.300]  oh, I would like to put blank on the iPhone.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.740]  Whereas Steve Jobs already had everything in mind.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.980]  Yeah, he had that ability.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.620]  No, I think that they knew that.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.100]  And the fact that he made that announcement
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.100]  that, okay, we're gonna do an SDK by September.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.240]  I mean, the phone was only three or four months out.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.220]  I mean, and it was, you know, it's clear from,
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.700]  I remember you guys saying it.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.700]  Of course, Apple wanted their own,
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:24.300]  even if it had remained first party
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.460]  only for a year or two longer, you know,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.900]  which I think is the most it could have possibly lasted
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.980]  before they opened the gates.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.300]  Of course, Apple wanted for their own apps
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.220]  the best APIs possible, right?
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.980]  That was, you know, the best, some of the best.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.740]  That, yeah, and it was pretty obvious
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.420]  from working with the jailbreak APIs
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.980]  that, you know, if they, all engineers do it, right?
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.620]  You cut corners on that first version.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.460]  Right.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.280]  Because they had to ship.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.120]  It's just a natural thing to do.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.960]  Right.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.340]  Yeah, you're more interested in the ship date
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.580]  than the code being 100% beautiful and perfect.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.900]  Right, we could do this in a way
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.780]  where it might blow up if you do it wrong,
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:04.780]  but we'll just know not to do it wrong.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.420]  My, yeah, my favorite was that you could feed
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.860]  a little snippet of HTML to any label view
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:15.660]  on the first SDK that, you know, the jailbreak SDK.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.280]  And, you know, they obviously knew
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.980]  that they had to limit themselves, you know,
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.540]  to bold or italic or, you know, color changes, you know,
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.460]  but, you know, you could put a table view in that label.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.540]  All hell would break loose.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.180]  You know, you could do an iframe
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.460]  because it was just WebKit sitting by.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.140]  And it was like, yeah, we're not gonna release that.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.860]  All right, enough of sunshine
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.460]  and happiness and fond memories.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.420]  Let's recap where we are.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.660]  So, with this shutdown last week.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.620]  So, things that I want to mention.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.140]  This is not, it was not a surprise, right?
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:00.140]  And even predating SpaceKaren taking, how do you like that?
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.500]  I'll go with it.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.340]  Oh, there you go.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.820]  You meant to say Elon Musk, right?
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:08.380]  Even predating SpaceKaren, this entire SpaceKaren saga.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.540]  We've had, it has been, I guess,
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.020]  for a longer period of time
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.460]  than when it seemed like whatever period of time
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:21.380]  when Twitter as a company fully embraced third-party clients
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:24.620]  and, like you said, celebrated them and loved Twitterific
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.860]  and, you know, and you could, you had access to Blaine Cook
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.420]  and could, you know, talk to the people at Twitter
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.520]  and they loved it.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.580]  It's been a longer period of time where they,
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.220]  we've all, those of us who love these third-party clients
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.700]  have been worried that they were going to just go away
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.500]  because they started limiting them, you know,
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.780]  famously at some point, I don't know what year it was
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.260]  when they said, and it was sort of Apple-like,
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.100]  where they didn't say,
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.200]  we're gonna stop accepting new Twitter clients,
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.500]  but they more or less said,
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.040]  these APIs shouldn't be used
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.980]  to replicate the Twitter experience.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.380]  Something like that, right?
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.500]  So, if you want to use them just to write a bot
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.020]  that auto-posts your headlines,
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.140]  like I have a script bot that does that
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.100]  for Daring Fireball, that's fine,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.160]  because that's not a client,
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.080]  but in terms of how should users be viewing Twitter,
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.820]  they shifted to, we want people to use the twitter.app,
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.360]  and the twitter.app and the Twitter website
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.980]  started gaining a lot of features that never made it
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.100]  to the third-party APIs.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.780]  They started, I guess, sort of, I mean.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.580]  Yeah, for me, I started worrying when Twitter bought Tweety.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.420]  Yeah.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.580]  That was like the first change that was like,
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.420]  okay, this is not going our way.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.260]  Yeah.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.080]  This is their companies,
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.260]  and you know, Ben Thompson's Stratechery this morning
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.500]  talked about that, and you know, he's right.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.700]  They should have just shit-canned us all at that point.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.220]  That would have been, you know, rip the Band-Aid off early.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.680]  I would have been okay with that, right?
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.220]  It's just like, okay, it's their company.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.420]  They can do what they want.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.220]  I think what, it depends what their goal was,
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.140]  and I think Jack Dorsey, he can be inscrutable.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.380]  He sort of communicates like a, almost like a guru, right?
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.860]  Like via zen clients.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.860]  Read between the lines, yeah.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:19.860]  Right, but if the idea was that Twitter should be,
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.060]  aspires to be as a company,
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.500]  a multiple tens of billions of dollar
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.980]  publicly held company, which they are, you know,
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.120]  Space Caron bought them for $44 billion.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.360]  Their aggregate, you know, what do you call it?
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.780]  The market cap, I don't know where they peaked.
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.100]  You know, I don't know how close
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.540]  to 100 billion they ever got.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.240]  They might have been over 100 billion at some point.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.260]  If that's the idea, then having third-party clients
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.620]  probably wasn't ever a good idea.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.180]  I still think, though, that if the idea was that,
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.920]  they never tried putting ads in the timelines
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.380]  that the third-party clients deliver,
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.700]  and I get it that I guess it's all about tracking
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.060]  that if they were delivered to you.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.620]  Yeah, that's, I think that's the bottom line, right,
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.640]  is that they had no, a couple of things, right?
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.180]  You know, if they're, they want to control
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.220]  the presentation of the ads, right,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.660]  that they wanna tell the advertisers,
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.900]  this is what your ad is gonna look like,
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.900]  and they also wanna be able to tell the advertisers,
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.460]  oh, this is the metrics we can get from that ad.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:31.460]  And I'm, first off, it would've been hard for them
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:35.460]  to get that tracking information from third parties,
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:39.540]  and secondly, I'm not sure I would've gone for that.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.500]  I'm very much anti-tracking, you know,
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.220]  people have the right to privacy, that kind of thing.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.300]  The thing that, to me, gets lost in tech
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.740]  has really gotten lost, and in that,
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.460]  and Twitter, to me, epitomizes it,
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:59.200]  is the idea that certain ideas can be very good ideas,
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.600]  excellent, I mean, like Hall of Fame ideas,
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.640]  but may not be, you know, the overall full path
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.640]  and execution may not be $100 billion business, right?
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.000]  So, daring Fireball, I'm very proud of it,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.200]  I think it's a good thing, but there's no way
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.200]  that Daring Fireball could be a $20 million a year enterprise.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.060]  I mean, I could've tried this.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.180]  And you wouldn't want it to be.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.120]  Right, I could've made decisions,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.660]  hired more people to work with me,
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.900]  had multiple bylines on the site,
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.240]  and have a small staff, not even huge,
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.140]  but, you know, I could've hired five people
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.440]  and had multiple, done something more
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.740]  like the Ringer Network and have multiple podcasts
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.020]  under the talk show brand or the Daring Fireball brand,
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.620]  and have multiple people there,
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:54.980]  and that might've been good,
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.460]  and it might've been 20 million or more,
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.620]  you know, 20 times the size that it is now
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.780]  in terms of revenue, but it wouldn't be what it is,
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:05.860]  it would be something different,
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.900]  and I think what it is is worth doing even if it's small.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.220]  Think about, like, restaurants, it's a perfect example.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.940]  There are many of, I'll bet, everybody listening,
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.940]  some of your favorite restaurants are one-off institutions,
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.940]  you know, where the owners of the restaurant are,
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.540]  there's no two locations, it's just one location,
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:30.040]  the owners are there, and they run the place,
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.580]  and that's what it is, and there is no way
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.200]  to turn it into a chain without ruining what it is.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.220]  There's a sushi restaurant here in town
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.940]  who the head chef owner passed away last year,
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.380]  and everybody in town was like,
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.820]  oh my God, Mickey's gone.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.000]  That was the first thing,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.700]  and the second thing is, are they gonna reopen?
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.780]  And thankfully, Mickey was one of those people
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:03.180]  who taught her crew how to make the awesome sushi,
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.580]  they all, and they're carrying on, right?
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.360]  Because it's beloved by them,
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.860]  and it's beloved by the community.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.260]  But it's never gonna be a chain, right?
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.860]  It's a minor miracle, and it's a minor miracle
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.660]  and a fortune of planning and staff loyalty
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:24.500]  that the one place could outlive the owner,
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.580]  but it just is what it is, and I think-
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.580]  Being small, being small is a gift, right?
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.820]  You being small is a gift to you,
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.060]  it lets you do things that you can't,
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.020]  wouldn't normally be able to do.
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.420]  If you were working for the New York Times,
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.180]  there's things you could not do.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.740]  It's the icon factory, right?
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.260]  There are just a handful of us.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.700]  We're doing things like Wallaroo that,
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.780]  it makes no sense for us to make a wallpaper app.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:50.160]  There's a shitload of wallpaper apps out on the store,
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.980]  but we love making wallpapers, right?
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.060]  And you want people to get them
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.340]  in the best possible way. We're doing it as much for us
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.940]  as we're doing it for the community.
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.520]  Well, it turns out there are other people out there
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.100]  who like cool wallpapers too, so hey, it works out.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.620]  But I think if you read between the lines
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.660]  of what Jack Dorsey has said in the last year
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.260]  during this whole Space Caron takeover saga,
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.860]  that he thinks, in hindsight,
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.940]  that Twitter should have been a public service type thing.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.080]  And I think what he's saying is,
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.120]  instead of trying to build something
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.460]  that would justify a $100 billion value,
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.500]  they could have done something altogether different
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.980]  and made it more like an API and a plumbing
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.940]  for this type of messaging
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.580]  and to run the namespace of usernames
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:39.580]  and to run the content moderation
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.900]  and make some money, or like Wikipedia,
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.040]  like a foundation, right?
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.260]  Wikipedia, obviously, is probably
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.020]  the single triumph of the web.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.260]  It is, in some ways, it's a total tangent here.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.820]  I was thinking over the weekend
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:56.700]  that in some ways, Wikipedia, all by itself,
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.820]  is what the Tim Berners-Lee concept
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.860]  of the World Wide Web would be,
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.180]  where there's these pages.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.860]  There's a page for everything
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.980]  that you think there should be a page for,
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.420]  and they link to each other, and-
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.360]  And it's essential.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.200]  And-
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.700]  It's a totally-
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.540]  There's no pay-
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.780]  Every time those things come up,
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.140]  it's like, oh yeah, I'm gonna donate.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:17.980]  There's no paywall.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:19.120]  My wife, it's the same thing.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.220]  We probably donate twice,
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.140]  because it's like, we need that thing.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.180]  And even when they do ask you for money,
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.740]  they just put a banner at the top
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.260]  and push everything down.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:29.700]  They don't cover their goddamn content
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.580]  with a banner telling you to do it.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.220]  So if Twitter had gone, been something like that,
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.460]  and again, Wikipedia raises money,
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.540]  they pay a staff, they obviously have
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.940]  huge server cost needs,
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.940]  but they're not making $100 billion a year,
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.260]  or they're not justifying $100 billion value,
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.540]  because that's not their goal.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.460]  Their goal is to be a thing.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.500]  If Twitter had been set up like something like that,
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.620]  then I think the third-party clients
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.440]  were obviously the way to go.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.660]  So, and I'm sure Ben is talking about
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:58.780]  Twitter as a company,
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.540]  the company that is what the goal is.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.700]  Yeah, exactly, he's looking at it
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:03.980]  from the business point of view,
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:08.700]  which, yeah, I would love to have a,
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.620]  like a DNS for usernames.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.300]  You always want at Gruber.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.020]  I always want at Chalkenberry.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.700]  Why do I have to go sign up for all these fringe services
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.700]  just to kind of plant my flag?
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.580]  Because it might be useful.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.980]  I bet you don't have as much trouble
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:25.900]  getting Chalkenberry as I do Gruber,
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.940]  because Gruber is shockingly,
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.340]  it's the most popular surname in Austria.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.220]  Hello to all of our Austrian Grubers out there.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.420]  I have a different problem with Chalkenberry.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.860]  It's called auto-correct.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:38.560]  It always comes out Chickenberry.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.320]  Chickenberry, ah, I like that.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.780]  But anyway, it has been many years
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.500]  that we've all been dreading that,
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.220]  hey, they might just pull the plug, right?
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.800]  And the third-party clients for the last,
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.300]  I don't know, five, six years,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.780]  sort of were in a...
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.980]  Living on borrowed time.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:58.280]  What's the, Limbo, right?
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.380]  Limbo was the religious-
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.940]  That's what I mentioned earlier, right?
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:04.660]  It was like, we were kind of coming out of Limbo.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.500]  Right.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.340]  Kind of, you know,
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.140]  that you could see a glimpse of a bright future.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:10.960]  Yeah, can you?
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.980]  And I think that they were kind of thinking
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:16.220]  along the lines that Jack had set out there, right?
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.300]  Like, okay, how do we become something
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:23.300]  that is a resource that businesses need,
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.520]  consumers need, developers need, you know,
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.600]  all of these, how can we satisfy all these people?
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.680]  And they were thinking hard about it.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.880]  I know for a fact they were thinking hard about it.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.020]  As much of a loudmouth as that Musk is,
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.640]  one thing we don't know,
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.800]  and, you know, he supposedly, you know,
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.140]  at this point, I can't take him at his word on anything,
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.380]  but, you know, some of the things he said he wanted-
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.600]  He's, the thing that's interesting, right,
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.260]  is that that blog post I wrote,
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.220]  I didn't mention his name at once,
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.700]  but everybody knew who I was talking about
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:25:59.700]  when I was talking about, you know,
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.660]  shitheads and, you know, bozos and all that.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.380]  Yeah, he's ruining his reputation right now.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.940]  He might be noticing it, I don't know,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.700]  but I'm certainly noticing.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.980]  We don't know, we never, for all the things we do know,
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.220]  we know he wanted to reinstate
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:20.180]  a bunch of previously banned accounts,
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.540]  and his, you know, and again, I knew that,
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.080]  and when I was optimistic about his ownership of Twitter,
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.320]  I was on the impression that it's possibly,
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.080]  even though a lot of those banned accounts
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.260]  are people who I literally despise,
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.820]  and, you know, and I think some of them should not-
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.020]  Yeah, they don't affect you, though.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.180]  You don't come in contact with them.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:43.180]  You know, yes, they're spreading filth and lies,
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.020]  and, you know, but there's a lot of ways
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.580]  for people to spread filth and lies, not just Twitter.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.260]  But it is sort of, it's sort of like, you know,
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.420]  in some ways, what I thought Musk was talking about
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.660]  was aligned with Dorsey's idea of Twitter
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.260]  as more of a public service,
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:05.260]  and in a way that any dirt bag hate speech type thing,
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.220]  person, can go and register a domain name,
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:14.260]  and if they can find a web host who will host their stuff,
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.540]  have a domain name, I don't, you know,
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.700]  and it just, you know, I wish those people
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.780]  weren't out there, but the fact that they can have
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:27.580]  a website and it's on the same web as my website is,
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.040]  you know, that is, in some sense, not in a legal sense,
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.500]  but just in a theoretical sense, free speech.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.340]  And I could see, I still can see,
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:41.620]  how Twitter having a more light-handed approach
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:45.580]  to banning people for that type of speech,
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.900]  so long as they provide everybody with tools
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.540]  so you don't have to see it if you don't want to, right?
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.220]  That's the thing, I have the right to ignore it.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.140]  You have the right to say it,
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:57.380]  I have the right to just say, fuck you,
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.500]  I'm not listening to this.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.580]  You know, in the same way that I just,
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:04.660]  I literally never just stumble upon Nazi websites,
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.980]  I should never stumble upon Nazi tweets in my,
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.180]  you know, in my timeline.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.000]  Yeah, exactly, it should not be boosted
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.820]  or retweeted or whatever.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.800]  But we didn't, so he, you know,
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.140]  he said he was gonna do that,
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.720]  he said he was gonna do some other things,
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.140]  he said he was gonna take out, you know, this was-
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.900]  This is a lot of things.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.460]  But he never really talked, as far as I know,
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.260]  never said anything about third-party clients.
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:31.580]  So what does Elon Musk think about the third-party clients?
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.100]  Was he against them, was he, you know,
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.020]  and a lot of us were like,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.780]  maybe he doesn't really think about,
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:40.780]  he surely knows they exist, but does he care?
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.100]  Or are they so small that he, you know, fine,
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.240]  this can be a thing that even though he's not into it
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.220]  and it's not one of his priorities,
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:55.220]  keeping them running wasn't going to draw his attention.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:00.700]  The one red flag all along that had me worried
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.440]  was the fact that he has long been opposed,
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.060]  even before he owned the place,
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.900]  opposed to the attribution on tweets that would say,
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.780]  you know, like in small gray text
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.900]  posted from Twitterrific on iOS.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.500]  It would, you know, and some clients showed them,
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.660]  I think Twitter's own first-party client
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:23.240]  hasn't been showing them for a long time,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.200]  but most third-party clients do.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.040]  And of course the one thing-
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.540]  Yeah, we show them if you tap on the date, right,
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.780]  it just toggled it and, you know, it showed it.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.700]  But it's not a mainline piece of information,
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.380]  but it's still kind of important.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.900]  But for some reason he'd been opposed to that
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:40.220]  and said, we're going to get rid of it.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.940]  And lo and behold, they did get rid of it.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.300]  The API stopped delivering that info.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.700]  You know, like I forget what Twitterrific showed,
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.020]  but like when they changed the API data
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:55.020]  so that that info was no longer in each tweet's JSON,
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.820]  some of the clients I saw just had like null,
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.300]  you know, like where it used to say
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.500]  posted from Tweetbot on Mac OS,
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.020]  it now just said null or something like that.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.220]  And then, you know, all the third-party apps
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.960]  that are actively developed just stopped trying to show it.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.460]  But that was the red flag to me that said
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.860]  he's not into third-party.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.500]  He's not just ambivalent, but against third-party clients.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.140]  The one thing that was famous,
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.480]  those strings were famous for,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.120]  and Marques Brownlee I think was the best at spotting it,
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.380]  was be like when Samsung would be promoting
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:33.380]  the new Galaxy phone and the tweet, you know, like never.
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.940]  Obviously coming from a PR person with an iPhone.
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.980]  Right, like when the iPhone X came out
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.220]  and they had a whole bunch of,
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:42.120]  and whole ad campaign about how stupid the notch was
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.660]  because they didn't have notch.
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.780]  And then a year later came out.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.240]  But in the meantime, they'd have tweets dunking on notches.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:53.240]  And then the tweet would say posted from Twitter on iOS.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:54.740]  And then, you know, and then all of a sudden
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.660]  there's 5,000 retweets and everybody's dunking on them.
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.060]  So you can't do that anymore.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.020]  But so I-
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.780]  He didn't have to worry about advertisers anymore, right?
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.700]  He's giving them away.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:08.820]  So I think we fans of the clients were worried in two ways.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:12.460]  We were worried A, that he would do what he in fact did do,
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.800]  which is say, pull the plug on these apps,
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.220]  that's just kill them.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:21.000]  And then B would be if the API servers fell apart
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.660]  and nobody was there who knew how to kick them
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:27.740]  to turn them back on and it would just fall apart.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.860]  And even though they-
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.740]  That lack of resources, of people resources
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:36.380]  was really my first thought, right?
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.820]  So, you know, in my first round of layoffs,
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:42.100]  it's like all the Twitter API developer relations people,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:46.020]  the people working on it, they got shit, right?
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.180]  And that was like, okay,
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:51.080]  how well is this API gonna work in, you know, a month?
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.880]  And so we spent Friday night when this first happened
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.340]  and you of course, as, you know,
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.380]  and like our friends, Paul and Mark over at Tapbots.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.900]  Paul and I have been texting each other quite a bit
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.180]  in the last few days.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.880]  Well, and that's, but isn't that great though?
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.220]  It's like part of the great part about our community is-
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.220]  I respect his work, he respects mine.
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:13.900]  Like, you know, I told him about the blog post,
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.980]  he goes, holy shit, 16 years, right?
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.300]  There's respect there, right?
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.260]  Because it's like, he knows what it's like
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.940]  to keep a product going that long.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.900]  Right, it's, you know, it's like Larry Bird
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.180]  and Magic Johnson, you know, going arm in arm
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.700]  into the hall of fame together, you know,
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:31.380]  and, you know, having Michael Jordan there to toast them
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:33.420]  and say how great it was to play again, you know,
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.660]  rivals who love each other.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.660]  So Friday night though, it really was up in the air,
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.880]  whether is this an accident and the API fell apart
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.260]  and because it's a Friday night and they're-
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.100]  Exactly.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.460]  And they're on a skeleton crew.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:48.460]  And on Friday night, I was leaning towards,
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:51.560]  I think this is an accident because there's no messaging
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.740]  about it at all.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.020]  And then by Saturday morning,
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.140]  you had shared on a Slack that we're in, a group Slack,
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.420]  that that screenshot that showed that red banner
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.220]  on Twitterrific's developer credentials from Twitter
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.980]  saying you don't have that many, you're suspended.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.140]  Which that to me was the, oh, this is-
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.220]  Yeah, that was, in fact, we were all holding out hope
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:21.740]  that it's like, okay, you know, is this, okay, yes,
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.860]  it says we're suspended, but you know, is this intentional?
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.140]  Is this like, you know, somebody who doesn't necessarily
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.820]  know what they're doing with the API
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.880]  if it's a switch on something and-
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.020]  As we record right now, have they still,
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.500]  they've still said nothing?
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.660]  Is that true? They said nothing.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:41.940]  They said that it's totally chicken shit, you know?
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.980]  I'm sorry, it's like, if you're gonna do something,
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:46.420]  come out and say you're doing it.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.260]  Right.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.500]  It's really that simple.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.200]  Right, and it's like I wrote on Daring Fireball
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.040]  over the weekend.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.980]  It is their call to make.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.540]  We've all been dreading this for years
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.500]  that they would say, hey, we're going to, you know,
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.620]  end of life for third-party clients.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.740]  Everybody should move to the first-party client.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.220]  This is what we, and here, you know,
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.840]  and if they would like to explain why they could,
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.240]  that would be appreciated.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.660]  They don't have to, but, you know, say something,
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.580]  post something, give some sort of notice, right?
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.580]  And, you know, how, you know, the more notice-
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.580]  It's totally disrespectful, right?
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.620]  You know, we've got, we've got customers
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.860]  that we need to let know what's happening.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.320]  I mean, we need to let Apple know what's happening.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.020]  Right, and there's people-
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.700]  Hey, how many, you know, award-winning,
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:40.620]  you know, high-grossing apps with, you know,
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:43.260]  thousands or tens of thousands of subscriptions
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.060]  have been removed from the App Store.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.860]  We have no idea what the fuck's going to happen.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.700]  I don't know, I just-
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.900]  How did we pull this product?
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.320]  I'm looking-
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.160]  Oh.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.020]  I'm looking at the official Twitter account right now,
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.320]  twitter.com slash twitter,
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.480]  and they haven't posted anything since December 10th.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.320]  Yeah, great.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.860]  So talk about, you know, and Elon must-
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.700]  Well, they have no comm steam, right?
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.900]  He's famous for, you know, oh, we don't need comms.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:11.740]  Right.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.580]  So even-
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.780]  You're a consumer product now,
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.660]  you're not selling rockets, you're not selling cars, right?
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.100]  I guess cars are a consumer product.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.140]  No, but it's crazy, and I was somebody,
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:22.380]  I mentioned it, and a couple of people who write,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:24.380]  you know, some of the people in the tech sphere
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.760]  are more like, some people have one foot
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.700]  in the car world, too.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.780]  You know, MKBHD, again, a prime example, right,
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.740]  where he's, in addition to being, in my opinion,
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:37.420]  the world's best tech YouTuber,
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.280]  is also a great car YouTuber.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.340]  But the lack of an actual comms team at Tesla,
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.480]  it drives the people who cover Tesla crazy.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.420]  I can't imagine.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.840]  I think Apple actually has fantastic PR.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.680]  I really do.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.580]  I've said this over the years.
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.140]  One thing about Apple PR,
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:56.220]  and it's true for the company in public, too,
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.120]  is they won't always answer your questions,
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.320]  of course, famously.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.040]  I mean, anybody can think of dozens
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.500]  of interesting questions you'd like to ask Apple PR
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.660]  that they're not going to answer,
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.060]  but they'll just say, no comment.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:09.900]  You know, they will.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.720]  They can't answer that.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.140]  They will answer your question.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.580]  If I could ask them anything,
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:16.580]  and I will get an email back or a phone call back,
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.080]  they may not answer my question,
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.260]  but they will, you know,
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.300]  pay me with respect to do it. They'll respond.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:22.420]  Right, they give you feedback.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.740]  Right, that's all you need.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.840]  Right, they might commit, at times,
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.100]  what we would call lies of omission,
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.840]  where they won't talk about something
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.020]  that you wish they would.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.380]  I wouldn't, I think lie is probably a strong word,
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:36.380]  but if they tell me something, it is true.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:40.380]  I've never been told anything by Apple PR that is not true.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.460]  The one time, the exception proves the rule,
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.560]  and I wasn't involved in it, personally, as a reporter,
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.940]  but during Steve Jobs' health saga,
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.580]  when he first, when it really took a turn for the worse,
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.380]  and he had to have the liver transplant,
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:59.300]  and took the second leave of absence from the company,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.700]  and their messaging on that was, you know,
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.800]  all, you know, it was inaccurate,
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.540]  and it was because he didn't want to tell people
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:08.900]  because he thought it was private,
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.900]  and, you know, what's the obligation
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.000]  of a publicly held company when the CEO,
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.740]  any CEO, you know, their health status
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.140]  is of interest to shareholders,
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:24.860]  but obviously, Steve Jobs was not just any CEO to Apple.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.660]  That's a mess, and that's a side story,
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:28.360]  but that is not about Apple.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.640]  That was about Steve Jobs, personally, you know,
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.820]  and Katie Cotton, who was more or less
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.860]  his personal PR spokesperson,
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.900]  and what they, you know, the way they handled that.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.500]  That was very much about them, not Apple.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.760]  So Apple is very, very, you know,
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.080]  but even if Apple had a bad comms team,
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.120]  and I, you know, I deal with other companies, too,
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.320]  who have lesser comms teams.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.060]  I don't know, it's insane that you can't write to Tesla
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.760]  and get an official response.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.180]  It really is.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:57.460]  I mean, it's, I guess he is proving
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:59.540]  that you can not have it,
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:04.900]  but it's never not going to be missed.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.700]  I would say that it's eventually gonna bite you in the ass.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.500]  Yeah, well, is it gonna be the doom of the company?
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.020]  Maybe, but the other thing, too,
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.100]  I think the lack of a comms team at Tesla
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.540]  is why Tesla is getting hit so hard.
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.760]  Their stock is way down compared to the...
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.460]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:23.460]  That's what I mean, it's gonna hit you in the ass.
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:26.180]  It's way down compared to the market.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.260]  It's way down compared to their competitors in the car space.
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.520]  It's way down compared to their competitors
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:36.020]  just in the electric vehicle space.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:36.860]  And there's no...
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.180]  I have a lot of...
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:40.020]  There's no...
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:43.140]  I know a lot of people who have Teslas that are like,
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.460]  I don't want this car anymore because of Elon Musk.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:47.980]  We have mutual friends.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.740]  We know, I know people who've canceled orders for Teslas
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.060]  in the last three months.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.780]  There's no, I generally don't give stock advice
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:58.420]  or analysis, this isn't really advice,
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:02.620]  but I also, but I really do think that the market,
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.020]  quote unquote, is largely inscrutable
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.140]  and things move up and down for reasons
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:10.340]  that you're never gonna really know why exactly,
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.920]  except sometimes it's pretty obvious.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.180]  I think it is extremely obvious that Tesla's stock
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:18.100]  over the last three months during the Twitter,
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:20.980]  as owned by SpaceKaren era,
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.900]  is way down because he's revealed himself
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.060]  to be a jackass in a way that I...
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.500]  This is, you know, I really just had no idea
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.460]  and the signs were all there.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:33.760]  I should have known.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.220]  So the people, you know, my famous optimist-
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.060]  It didn't affect you though.
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.260]  It didn't really affect you.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.340]  Yeah, and I didn't-
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.400]  For me, it was like, yeah, this guy is...
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.780]  I don't really get him.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.100]  What's his deal?
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.140]  But you know, it's like, I don't own a Tesla.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.900]  I'm not gonna be launching a rocket anytime soon.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:53.060]  I'm just gonna kind of let it fall by the wayside
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:54.780]  and well, guess what?
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.500]  Now it affects me.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.180]  It's obvious that a significant amount
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:02.620]  of Tesla's market value was faith in Elon Musk personally.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:03.940]  That, you know, that he, you know,
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.700]  and I think there is something to that,
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.260]  that the, I know we didn't technically found Tesla,
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.460]  but the, you know, he's been there a long time,
[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:15.140]  that that type of visionary, charismatic CEO,
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.380]  the Henry Ford type, the Walt Disney type,
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.820]  the Steve Jobs- The Steve Jobs, you know,
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.220]  when Steve Jobs came back, that gave us all hope.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.860]  The Bill Gates, the, you know, Zuckerberg,
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:30.900]  that these, that a certain type of CEO
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.260]  is so visionary and effective
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.380]  that they're worth betting on, right?
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.380]  That you don't need, you know,
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:38.120]  I'm just gonna place a bet on this company
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.420]  because I believe this person,
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:43.220]  and I think that, you know, it's like if, you know,
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.540]  you don't know anything about basketball,
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:45.700]  but you know Michael Jordan,
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.940]  so you're gonna bet on the team that has Michael Jordan,
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:48.980]  or LeBron, right?
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:51.380]  Like all of a sudden, LeBron goes to the Lakers
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.660]  and you're like, ah, that's enough for me.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:56.020]  I'm gonna place a bet on the Lakers to win.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.120]  I bought some stock after Apple released the iPhone
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.300]  because it was like, I believe in this.
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.140]  And that's turned out to be a pretty good thing.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.980]  I think that he's revealed himself to be so independently
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:13.620]  and flaky and making such terrible decisions
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.060]  that people who had faith and had no interest,
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.180]  don't really care, you know,
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:19.120]  they can't, you can't invest in Twitter right now
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.980]  because it's no longer publicly held, it's privately held.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.040]  That's the whole thing that he did.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.560]  But like for Tesla, people whose money was in Tesla
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.540]  because they had faith in Elon Musk
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:32.260]  are looking at what he's revealed himself to be
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:35.640]  and how, what his leadership style is like.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.140]  And they're like, oh, I guess maybe he is just making up
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:43.020]  the, you know, how far advanced their full self-driving is
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.500]  and how far, you know, what type of a moat
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:46.900]  they have around their business.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.180]  And- And you're absolutely right when you say
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:52.740]  that they have to be better than the humans.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:53.700]  Oh, that's a side.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.380]  You can't just equal, yeah, that's a separate thing,
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.180]  but I totally agree there, right?
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.740]  It's like, you know, if you're gonna claim
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:02.580]  that something works, it's gotta work really well.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:05.460]  But if they had a professional comms team,
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.060]  they could be managing that and getting word out
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.580]  and trying to separate,
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:14.860]  try to get the press to buy, whether it's true or not,
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:17.820]  but to put the spin on it that the Musk who runs Twitter
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.980]  is not, that's not how he runs Tesla, you know?
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:22.220]  Tesla's different. Right, there's really
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.140]  somebody else that's pulling the strings.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:28.840]  Without a comms team and with his own singular genius
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.140]  being the comms for Tesla, well, guess what?
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:34.980]  He is a jackass and so he's bungling that too.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.800]  It's just infuriating that this is how they've done it,
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.740]  that here we are three days later
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.640]  and they've literally just ghosted us.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.820]  It's like somebody breaking up with a significant other
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:46.820]  not by saying, I break up with you,
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:49.300]  but just by never returning their calls, right?
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.140]  And it's like, all of a sudden your text just, you know,
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.500]  and you're not getting read receipts anymore.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.380]  They're just like, are they seeing my texts?
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.220]  What's going on?
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.220]  And it's like, it's just so profoundly disrespectful.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.140]  It really is the disrespect.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.020]  We all know what's happening and the fact that, you know,
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:12.020]  that Tapbot's turned on some other API keys yesterday
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:15.260]  and people were kind of able to use Tweetbot
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:18.240]  for a little bit and then, you know, it was broken posting
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.500]  and, you know, you couldn't see old tweets
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:23.460]  and stuff like that and it was just kind of limping along
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.180]  and then, you know, they killed that.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.000]  Did they kill that?
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:27.840]  I didn't notice that.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.860]  Yeah, they killed it a couple hours later.
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:32.260]  And, you know, Paul did that just, you know,
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:35.580]  it's like that's the only way we can prove
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:37.420]  that they're really shutting us down
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.940]  is to actively, you know, shut us down.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.980]  And again, it comes back to we've got other stuff
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.060]  we need to deal with as a result of it.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.540]  It's not just them that has, you know,
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:50.500]  that shuts the API off.
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.420]  It's we've got to shut off products.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:55.820]  We've got to let customers know, you know,
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.460]  Tapbot has got, it's got subscription renewals coming up.
[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:00.300]  It's the-
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.340]  They don't want to deal with, you know,
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.780]  thousands and thousands of refunds.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:04.620]  The fact-
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.500]  It's going to cost them money.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.200]  The fact that Paul had built into Tweetbot
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.820]  the ability for them to remote change
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.620]  their OAuth credentials with Twitter
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:19.460]  without submitting an app update just shows,
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.300]  that shows you how worried developers
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.700]  like you guys have been.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:26.860]  Our app has a little built-in web view
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:30.220]  that looks at a file on our server
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:33.740]  that, you know, popped up a little web view that says,
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.200]  you know, something bad has happened to Twitter.
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.940]  And it explains the state of things.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.860]  And we did that release.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.100]  So a couple of months ago, I'd say,
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.500]  I don't remember exactly, but that was really,
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.340]  that and, what was in it?
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:49.580]  It was like that and a copyright date.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.540]  That was it.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.300]  And we knew, because, you know,
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:00.860]  after dealing with this unstable API situation
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:06.700]  for, you know, years and years, you're a little gun shy.
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.640]  And it's like, okay, this may not happen.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.960]  We may never need to use this, but if it does,
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.160]  we want to be prepared.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.440]  And, you know, the Tapbots, you know,
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.920]  that switching the API keys may have been
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.960]  a test thing for them, maybe not.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.920]  I don't, you know, we never talk about that,
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:27.920]  but yeah, we're all gun shy about the Twitter
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.640]  after Elon took over.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.960]  So what are you going to do?
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:36.360]  So Tapbots famously, I mean, everybody I'm sure
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.560]  who cares about it knows that they've been hard at work
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.140]  on a Mastodon client called Ivory,
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.800]  which is in test flight beta right now.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.040]  Super, super, you know, they keep opening.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.600]  It's super quality app too.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.440]  Yeah.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.880]  It's what you would expect from them, right?
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.720]  Right.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.520]  You know, if they have, they did something really smart,
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.720]  I think probably because of back in the days of app.net.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:02.560]  Yeah, that's what I-
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:04.560]  Probably because they kind of,
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.040]  I think what they did is they kind of abstracted
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.700]  their back end, you know, fetching the data from the UI,
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:13.120]  presenting it kind of situation.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.200]  I think probably version two of the Twitter API
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.600]  helped bring that along.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.000]  And, you know, they're building from, you know,
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.640]  I haven't talked to Paul about this,
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.960]  but just looking at it from somebody who knows
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.180]  how apps are built and how social media apps work.
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:33.400]  It feels very much like me that they're taking Tweetbot
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.280]  and massaging the bits that need massaging
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.660]  to work with that new Mastodon API,
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.660]  which is great because it gives people a UI
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.560]  and an environment that they're used to.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.480]  Really, you know, that's it.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.620]  So let me put on my journalist hat here
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:54.720]  and ask the hard question.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.040]  Is there going to be a Mastodon-rific?
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:59.360]  Mastodon-rific.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.000]  Mastodon-rific, I don't know, that doesn't sound good.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  Uh, well, we looked at it back in 2018
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.920]  and we actually called it Fantasodon.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.640]  And I've put you on the spot here.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.540]  Well, no, it's something that we're interested in for sure.
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:22.480]  And we have some prior commitments now
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.440]  that we're working on that kind of prevents our small team
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.000]  from looking at it full time.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.680]  Right, Icon Factory is a small team.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.760]  How many developers are there?
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.640]  There's me, Sean, and Shannon Hughes, who works on Linea.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.240]  Right, so it's, and that's, you know,
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.080]  Tapbots is two people, Mark Jardine and Paul Haddad.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.680]  And I think Todd Thomas is-
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:45.280]  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.120]  And a little bit on the Mac side.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.580]  Yeah, he's doing the Mac version, right?
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.420]  That's right.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:51.580]  Again, we don't talk about teams, you know?
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:55.000]  It's just, we're both small, we both know it.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.320]  Right, right, right, but like small, small,
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.720]  not just, you know, like small,
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.720]  you could put the company into a van, you know?
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.560]  Small.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.380]  The one difference is that the Icon Factory
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:08.760]  is more diversified than-
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.920]  I was just gonna say, right?
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:10.760]  Tapbots.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.160]  So Tapbots has a few other apps.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.480]  They've got the Calcbot, which is a fine calculator,
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.040]  and I actually use it.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.120]  They did, Waitbot, what did Craig Federighi say
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:26.560]  that the Mac Mini is a product in our lineup or whatever?
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.800]  Waitbot is an app that they had.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.960]  It was like a weight tracking app,
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:32.080]  but I don't think it's an active development anymore.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.940]  No, the other one is that's active,
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.720]  and I personally use it and love it as Pastebot,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.560]  which is-
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.400]  Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.240]  And I know that there's-
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.500]  Right, Todd had some problems with Pastebot for a while.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.040]  I've had some stuff, and I talked to Paul about that, yeah.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:49.000]  Yeah, it's funny because it's like
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.400]  there's dozens of good, seriously,
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.480]  there's like over a dozen good Twitter clients for iOS,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.480]  so it is a crowded space,
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.240]  and there's probably even more clipboard managers
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:02.440]  for the Mac.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.320]  Because there's also a bunch of apps
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.520]  that primarily do other things
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.160]  that have clipboard managers.
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.400]  Keyboard Maestro is mostly a macro utility
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:13.560]  for automating your Mac in ways,
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.640]  but it also has a very good clipboard manager,
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.140]  and LaunchBar and Alfred,
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:22.680]  which are really command space launchers primarily,
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.680]  also have clipboard managers, but I like Pastebot.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.680]  But I know nothing about their internal revenue pie chart,
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.080]  but you don't have to be a genius
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.000]  to think that Tweetbot for iOS
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.440]  is the Pac-Man of their pie chart
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.120]  in a way that Twitterific, I guess,
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.680]  I don't think is for icon factory.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.100]  No, no, again, when we saw what was happening,
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:53.120]  it's like, okay, we need to come up with other products.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.480]  We have Linea for drawing on your iPad,
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:00.480]  which is, people love it, is another one that people love.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.940]  It's just a really simple way to keep notes
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.080]  on your iPhone, your iPad, and watch.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:09.000]  Right, tot is for sale, right?
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.120]  I know, I know.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.580]  Yeah, it's free on the Mac,
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:17.580]  and it's paid on the iOS, and paid on the watch too.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.480]  But yeah, and we've got Wallaroo now.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.000]  It's just a new product that does the wallpapers,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.080]  and we've been actively trying to diversify.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.600]  But I'm not gonna lie,
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.160]  it's gonna hurt to lose some Twitterific revenue.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.800]  I mean, we had our own ad server.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.960]  You did not mention Frenzyk.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.680]  Oh yeah, yeah, Frenzyk's on the Apple Arcade.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.320]  Right, so Frenzyk, and again,
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.480]  to just go down memory lane, was a-
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.040]  One of the first games on the iPhone.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.860]  One of the first games on the iPhone,
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:53.840]  and was super, one of the things that was so super key,
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:54.880]  again, I don't wanna,
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.360]  this could be a whole show about Frenzyk,
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.120]  but it was so super,
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.880]  one of the things that was so cool about Frenzyk
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.880]  was that unlike so many of the other first round of games,
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.680]  it was, it only makes sense
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.520]  on a touchscreen device on your hand.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.200]  It was like, Frenzyk and Trism were like,
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.400]  they were meant for this device.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.800]  And they're very tactile, right?
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.360]  And it's a very fun story
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.200]  that one of these original iPhone games
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:23.280]  that had a nice run and was a big hit at the time,
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.520]  but then fell by the wayside,
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.660]  it came back and now it's on Apple Arcade.
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:30.820]  So anybody out there who's got an Apple One subscription
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.240]  or just an Arcade subscription,
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.240]  you go check out Frenzyk on your phone.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:37.440]  It's back, it's better than ever without question.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.760]  We love working on that product.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.600]  And the thing is we love everything we do, right?
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.600]  And that's kind of, that's the problem.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.280]  The problem with Twitter right now
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.260]  is that we're losing something we love.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:54.800]  Right, so what I'm hearing in so many words
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.600]  is that the fantastadon idea,
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.480]  don't never say never, maybe,
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:02.080]  but not at the moment that you guys have,
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.000]  your plates are full.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.880]  The thing that right now is that I'm,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.240]  I think it's a time to kind of take a step back, right?
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:14.440]  I think having these clients on Mastodon is a good thing.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:19.440]  Right, I'm not against Mastodon client, but it's the,
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:26.080]  how can this new web standard called ActivityPub,
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:29.680]  which is basically the underlying infrastructure
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:34.260]  for the Fediverse, Mastodon instances talking to each other,
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:38.480]  Tumblr's talking about adding it, Microblog does it.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.880]  You know, there's a place for photos
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.880]  called PixelFed that uses it.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.560]  I'm kind of thinking that, you know,
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.120]  maybe the direction that we need to head
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.960]  is how do you pull all these different various sources
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:59.960]  of information together and kind of make them work together
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.720]  as a whole and be interactive?
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.040]  And basically, you know, it's like,
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.040]  imagine your RSS reader being interactive, right?
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.340]  You know, you read something in, you know, NetNews wire,
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.080]  and, you know, you can post immediately
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.580]  and you start a conversation.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:21.800]  And this is, I mean, I hate talking about this actually,
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.440]  because it's kind of not well-formed in my mind yet.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.120]  You know, it's not even at that point
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.520]  where I start to experiment.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.240]  You've got a delicate little idea in your head.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.920]  And you don't want to, if you expose it-
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.960]  You don't want to fuck it up.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.320]  By letting people know.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.880]  I hear you, I hear you.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.880]  But that to me is, it's exciting.
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:52.200]  Like Twitter was, you know, the first time I posted,
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:55.120]  you know, that little XML snippet to their API
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.560]  and saw something show up in my web browser,
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.160]  it was like, oh, this is cool, right?
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.840]  And, you know, I think I'm going to start poking around
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.200]  at this stuff and get it to the point
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.820]  where I can have an intelligent conversation
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.320]  with the designer.
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.200]  That's also a really important part of what we do,
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:20.160]  is we prototype to the point where
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.520]  you can start to understand it as a normal person, right?
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.640]  You know, if I start talking about activity pub
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:28.840]  and, you know, having these, you know,
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.400]  these sources and publishers and consumers and, you know,
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.800]  the designer, rightfully so,
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:36.800]  their eyes are just going to glaze over and go,
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.760]  what are you talking about?
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.400]  Right, it's like if you're just talking about
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.200]  an R or a feed reader,
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.080]  trying to talk about the XML differences between RSS
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.240]  and the Atom feed format and start-
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.020]  Right, or how does that differ from, you know,
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:54.240]  the JSON feed that the man worked on?
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.400]  It's like, ah!
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:57.440]  Right, and then all of a sudden the designer is just like,
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.260]  what are you talking about?
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.200]  You're like, oh, it's going to be a list of articles.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.640]  Oh, okay, I know how to style that.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.400]  It's going to look like a news reader.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:04.240]  Right.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.440]  What are you going to, what happened?
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.940]  I don't think this is going to happen.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:09.080]  I think the best, honestly, I think at this point,
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  the best we're going to get is at least some sort of,
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.780]  you know, yes, we killed the third party clients.
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:16.240]  Everybody should use the first party.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.720]  Just give us a goddamn statement.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.680]  And maybe by the time this episode airs,
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:23.340]  that will have happened in between this moment
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:24.180]  when you and I are talking-
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:27.600]  I'm guessing that's actually pretty likely, but you know,
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.600]  you hear rumors and, you know-
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.440]  What are you going to do though if,
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  what if they just completely changed their mind
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.880]  and say, nevermind, and all of a sudden,
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:40.280]  oh, that's a long discussion, long internal discussion.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.360]  It's like, you know,
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.960]  what happens if Twitter is shy, you know?
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:50.880]  Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.520]  You know, again, it's, we're,
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:54.580]  we're going to miss the source of revenue, but you know,
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:58.380]  is it really worth the grief and the, you know,
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:01.280]  it's an abusive relationship at this point, right?
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:02.120]  Yep.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.840]  Do I go back with the girlfriend, you know,
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.080]  who beat me every night?
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:06.920]  Yep.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.920]  I'm in a group discussion, not even a group chat.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.240]  These aren't necessarily friends,
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.080]  but it's a small private thing.
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:18.640]  And one of the topics was about is, you know,
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.400]  like a recurring thread is Twitter and Musk
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.040]  and what's going on.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.160]  And somebody posted last week, it was before this,
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:29.760]  so it was in the context of something else, about this.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.940]  You know, one of the stories is that, widely reported,
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.180]  this isn't like a rumor,
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.280]  but that Twitter has stopped paying their rent
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.400]  in all over the world, like San Francisco
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.400]  and other places.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.720]  And somebody posted, somebody,
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:47.080]  not somebody who's like an Elon Musk fan,
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.880]  but just was like, ah, that's just good negotiating.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.620]  That's, you know, negotiating with landlords
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.160]  is just good business and it's, you know,
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.520]  real estate's a tough business.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:56.920]  And I wrote back and I was like, yeah, it is.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.640]  But when you negotiate with your landlord
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.760]  before you sign a lease, that's what the lease is.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:04.960]  The lease is the agreement you come to.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.480]  And so, you know, whether you're renting a home
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.560]  or an apartment or a 12-story office building,
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:14.880]  you, you, you know, you negotiate the lease.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.160]  A lease is a legal document.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.080]  Right. You break that lease,
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:19.000]  you're breaking a legal document
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.120]  and you're gonna have contract problems.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.240]  Right, so yeah, and yes, a good business person
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.640]  does negotiate hard on stuff like that
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.160]  and does get good terms.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.040]  There's a story out this week that Goldman Sachs
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.680]  lost $1.2 billion last year on their credit card business
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.920]  and their credit card business is effectively Apple Card.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.240]  So somehow, I mean, now, whether that's a long-term,
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.160]  they're never gonna make money, well, then Apple's,
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.900]  you know, Goldman is not gonna stay in the business if,
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:48.000]  but maybe, maybe that was the plan all along.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.880]  No one seems to know whether they expected
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.360]  to lose money last year.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.600]  But it just shows how well Apple, you know,
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:56.960]  Apple's not the one taking the $1.2 billion loss.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.100]  It's Goldman. Right.
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.000]  That is, that, you know, and Apple is full of-
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.680]  Apple is a tough negotiator.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.560]  They are very good at it.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.240]  Tim Cook is a famously good negotiator.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:10.460]  Eddy Cue is the, what I've heard the story multiple times
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:13.080]  is that it was like Eddy Cue's the one person at Apple
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.320]  that Steve Jobs thought was a better negotiator
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:18.520]  than himself, or at least always took,
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.720]  Eddy Cue was the guy who Jobs always took with him.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:24.360]  His side man, yeah, this is his backup.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.920]  But you know what they are?
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.080]  They're honest negotiators, you know?
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.080]  They say, we're going to pay 30% and we'll pay 70%,
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.080]  we'll pay, give you 70% and we'll keep 30%.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:36.900]  And you know-
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:39.080]  Well, they had that NFL deal that they backed out of.
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:39.920]  Right, right.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.280]  You know, it's just like, it doesn't make sense for us.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.120]  Right.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.440]  It's been nice chatting.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.880]  Right, but they're not going to make an agreement
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:48.540]  on terms X, Y, and Z.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.680]  And then once the agreement is made, say,
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.900]  oh, remember A, B, and C that you said we couldn't do,
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.740]  or we're gonna do them anyway.
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:54.560]  Just kidding.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:55.400]  Right.
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.720]  And to me, this rent thing,
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:00.800]  it's exactly the same mindset with this developer thing,
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.680]  where yes, they had the right to pull the APIs.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:05.320]  They, you know, that's their company.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.480]  But- Yep.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.120]  But this is not the way to do it.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.240]  This breaks trust.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:11.560]  There's, you know, so if they did turn those
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.120]  search back on, I don't see any,
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:17.280]  I mean, I would guess you would allow Twitterrific
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:19.760]  to keep going, but would you keep investing
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.600]  development resources in Twitterrific
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.720]  knowing that they might just do it again at any time?
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:25.560]  Right? Yeah.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:31.280]  Trust and respect are like the easiest,
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.440]  or the hardest things to earn
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:34.800]  and the easiest things to lose.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:37.560]  Why would you, let's say you and I co-owned
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.000]  an office building in San Francisco.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.720]  And now that, you know, I think it's,
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.000]  I think as we all know,
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.760]  Twitter needs less space than they did before.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.080]  Yeah, they're gonna convert it into a hotel.
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:51.200]  If Twitter came to us in our building and said,
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.300]  we would like to lease your smaller building
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.800]  for the next five years,
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.560]  I would tell them to go pound sand.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:59.040]  I don't care, you know, and if we had a price on it,
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.400]  I would turn them down even if they were willing
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.800]  to just pay the asking price per square foot,
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.240]  because they've proven themselves to be a company
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.400]  that if they want to, will stop paying the rent.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.240]  You know what I mean?
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:11.880]  Like when you're, you know, you're a person-
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:14.560]  What does the stock market work on?
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.520]  There's a lot of trust in that whole market.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.240]  You know, you trust the company's, you know,
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:23.680]  gonna do right by you as a shareholder.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.520]  Unless I, unless I-
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.600]  And all of a sudden they don't?
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.560]  Unless I literally thought I can't find anybody else
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:30.820]  to take this space,
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:34.000]  I would never lease the space to Twitter.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:34.840]  So I, you know-
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:36.680]  Well, and it's that way around the world too.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.000]  Why would anybody,
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.440]  why would anybody trust Twitter as a platform vendor again?
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.720]  And again, we all have these frustrations with Apple
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.040]  and their position over the app store.
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:48.880]  And-
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.240]  But they're consistent about it, right?
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:55.240]  Apple set some rules long ago that they're-
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.920]  And they, just from those internal emails,
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.400]  they struggled with what those rules were.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.240]  Right.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:03.960]  But they set the rules and they, exactly.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.040]  They do what they say.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:08.840]  We may not like a lot of the stuff they say, but they-
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.440]  I think it's absolutely wrong
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.920]  that you can't mention your website in an app.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:16.760]  That's just, that's just, I don't, I don't get it.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.960]  Or that you can't, and my pet bugaboo
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.740]  that you're not even allowed to explain the rules
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.720]  at the app store, which is nuts.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.720]  All right, let me take a break here
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.680]  and thank our third and final sponsor of the show.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.200]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.480]  You guys know Squarespace.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.480]  It is the all-in-one platform for building your brand
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:34.520]  and growing your business online.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.200]  You can stand out with your own beautiful website,
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.100]  engage with your audience, and sell anything.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.760]  You can sell products, you can sell your content,
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.120]  and even your time booked through a Squarespace website.
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.460]  They make it easy for creators to monetize their content
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.180]  and expertise in a way that fits their brand.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:55.660]  They have member areas where you can unlock
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.100]  a new revenue stream for your business
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.880]  and free up your time in your schedule
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.240]  by selling access to gated content to your audience,
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.960]  like videos, online courses, newsletters,
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.460]  email newsletters, that sort of thing.
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:09.800]  Everything you want, domain name registration,
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.440]  templates to choose from, design tools
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.600]  to tweak those templates to look just the way you want
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.560]  to fit your brand with no HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.920]  technical expertise involved at all, WYSIWYG.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.240]  But if you want to get in there at the code level,
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.420]  you can do that too.
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:28.940]  You can go from the nerdy end,
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.000]  you can go from the visual design end.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.160]  It's all there built into Squarespace.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:37.880]  And even if it's not you, the listener of the talk show,
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:42.720]  who needs a new website, you as the family nerd
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.480]  or nerd in the group, when people come to you like,
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:47.320]  hey, I need a new website, what should I do?
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.080]  Send them to Squarespace, give them the code,
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:51.960]  even if they don't listen to the talk show.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.520]  Let them think they came from here.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:57.280]  That URL, squarespace.com slash talk show,
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.760]  squarespace.com slash talk show.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.840]  Go there, send people there,
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.200]  send your friends and family there.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.120]  They get a free trial, 30 days, no limits,
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:07.920]  no watermarks on the website.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.040]  And when they're ready to launch,
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.960]  just remember that code, talk show.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.640]  No the, just talk show.
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:15.120]  You save 10% off your first purchase,
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.480]  which can be for up to a year.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.800]  Pay for a year at once, save 10%.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.640]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.520]  And an underlying theme of this show is nostalgia.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:29.240]  And, oh my God, that getting started on the web these days
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.400]  is so much easier, you know, collecting money.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.560]  I mean, the early days, I mean, we were, you know,
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:38.760]  FTPing files, you know, hooking up payment gateways
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.000]  with CGI, it was a total.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.120]  Well, I- It was a mess.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.400]  It was a hard thing to do when it was a mess.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:50.800]  I remember I bought my first copy of BB Edit.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.840]  I think I called and gave my credit card
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:53.960]  over the phone.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.460]  I know, I have the receipt.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:58.720]  I have my BB Edit 2.5 user manual on my shelf.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:01.020]  Did you download it off of Usenet?
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:02.120]  Almost certainly.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:02.960]  Yeah.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.680]  Or from the InfoMac archive, right?
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:05.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.500]  Which I sometimes peruse by email
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:10.280]  and sometimes peruse by, InfoMac was a,
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:13.160]  it was both an email newsletter and a posting
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.880]  to CompSys Mac, right?
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:18.720]  A CompSys Mac something on Usenet.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.640]  And it would just be like a daily list
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:25.360]  of what new apps were out and updates, you know, in our-
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.120]  That was one of my first release.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:31.400]  It was sort of like a blog before blogs
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:32.760]  because it would just be like, you know,
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.720]  like here's 10 utilities that have a new version today.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.360]  But I remember also sending checks to people, you know,
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:40.960]  for shareware, because I liked paying for it.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.960]  I even, you know, on the low budget of a college student
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.840]  or a recent college grad,
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.420]  I wanted independent developers to thrive.
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:52.560]  I remember mailing checks to people, but-
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.240]  Yeah, well, I used to have a stack of postcards
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:57.800]  that I would mail, you know, the Laguna Beach postcards
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.080]  that I would mail back to people
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.800]  with their serial number on it.
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:03.360]  And it was kind of a nice thing, right?
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.200]  It's like, you know, I was like,
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.200]  I was sharing a little bit of, you know, where I live
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.640]  and, you know, my home to your home.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.840]  You have been very kind with your time today,
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:15.520]  but I have one more topic I wanna talk to
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:17.880]  and I know you care about it and I know you're busy,
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.000]  but we'll try to keep it brief.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.600]  But there was a story last week
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.840]  from our Scoopster extraordinaire, Mark Gurman,
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:27.160]  that Apple is working, has engineers working
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.000]  on touchscreen MacBooks.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.360]  Now, he did not say Apple is coming out
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.600]  with touchscreen MacBooks.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:36.560]  He said Apple has engineers working on touchscreen MacBooks.
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:38.600]  It's a real project.
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.960]  And if it comes to fruition,
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:45.280]  they wouldn't arrive until 2025, which is, you know,
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.000]  and I famously love to remind people
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.520]  that Apple's hardware pipelines, even for Macs,
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.640]  which aren't quite as rigid as iPhone
[02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:55.880]  because of the insane numbers of iPhones they make,
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:57.640]  but they are set in advance.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.460]  And so-
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.440]  Oh, way in advance, yeah.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:03.880]  You know, it's not, it is not outlandish, you know,
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.320]  that the earliest we might see,
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.040]  if everything Gurman says
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.240]  about these touchscreen MacBooks comes true,
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:12.880]  that we won't see them for another two years,
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.620]  probably more than two years,
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.880]  because what are the odds that if it does happen in 2025,
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:20.080]  it's going to happen in the first two weeks of January,
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.480]  slim to none. Right, no.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:25.240]  And it's probably going to affect
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.560]  a manufacturing line a lot, right?
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:32.080]  You know, the way that LCD screens have been produced
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:35.240]  for the last, say, 15 years,
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.280]  it's going to fundamentally change, right?
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:40.240]  It's like, it's going to have some new sensor in it,
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.400]  new bezel, new, new, new.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.720]  Right, so he says 2025 at the earliest,
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:48.080]  and the other practical concern, which says to me,
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:52.240]  second half of 2025 at the earliest
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:54.280]  would be that there's got to be
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:57.000]  some sort of WWDC message about it,
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.380]  you know, for developers to have some kind of APIs
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.880]  to access the touch in a Mac app
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.400]  where there obviously is none.
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:07.840]  Yeah, and probably some sort of a simulator
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.760]  that runs on the Mac,
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.720]  and maybe that simulator uses
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:15.200]  the new virtualization framework.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.240]  Yeah, there would be a lot of pieces
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:20.640]  that had to fall into place for this to be.
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:24.480]  Yeah, actually, I guess maybe what you would do is,
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:26.480]  instead of a simulator, is use the,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.560]  what's that sidecar with your iPad and move?
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.800]  Yeah, yeah, that would be another approach to it
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:32.620]  to actually get physical,
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:35.560]  but, you know, everybody's using an iOS simulator,
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.280]  which, you know, simulates touch.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.120]  To do something.
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:40.020]  To do something similar to that.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.300]  The only thing to take away from that
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.560]  is that there would be a lot of work
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:48.800]  from both Apple's developers' tools team
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.800]  and developers themselves, third-party developers.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:53.340]  There's...
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.180]  It's not just like,
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:55.900]  oh, well, let's just put this thing on the Mac,
[02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:57.520]  and away we go.
[02:07:58.440 --> 02:07:59.280]  You know this.
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:01.560]  Anybody, do you use screens at all,
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:02.960]  the VPN app for iOS?
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.600]  Yes, yeah, from Evovia.
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:10.080]  Yeah, yeah, Luke Vandell is making this product forever,
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:14.520]  and I've got a little Mac mini server that I run
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.600]  that does our backups from the web server
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.200]  and all sorts of stuff.
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.960]  And yeah, I need to control that from my iPad
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.320]  every once in a while, right?
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.840]  E-dovia, I'm sorry.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.320]  E-dovia, yeah, edovia.com.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:28.960]  And fantastic little tool,
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.920]  and it shows you within a couple of minutes
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:36.920]  the problems with a touch UI on the Mac.
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:37.760]  Yeah.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.200]  I'm not gonna enumerate them all,
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:44.480]  but it's pretty obvious once you actually start doing it.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:47.720]  Right, but basically anybody who's out there listening,
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:49.760]  and you're super enthusiastic about this,
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.160]  and every time I start complaining
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:53.960]  about the things I'm dreading about it
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:55.460]  if it ever comes to fruition,
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:56.460]  and you roll your eyes and say,
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:58.800]  no, no, no, you just touch, it's not that big a deal,
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.880]  you don't have to resize and space everything.
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.060]  Just keep the Mac interface the same
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:07.620]  and just let me touch the things to scroll them.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:12.620]  Go fire up screens and log into your Mac on an iPad
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:16.600]  and start poking around with your finger
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.520]  at a Mac on an iPad, and you'll see,
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.160]  oh yeah, those red, yellow, green buttons
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:23.260]  in the top left of the window,
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:26.480]  they really are very small and very close to each other.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.000]  Navigating menus is kind of a pain in the ass.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.280]  Right, and I know that people,
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.960]  when is Apple finally gonna put touch screens
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.400]  on a MacBook has been, it's over 10 years, right?
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.640]  Ever since touch blew into the world.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.680]  It was around before the iPad, right?
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.360]  We had the iPhone, oh, great touch screen.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.560]  Oh, we should put this on our Macs.
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.020]  Nobody was thinking of the iPad,
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:53.440]  they were thinking about, put touch on a Mac, no problem.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.520]  Ever since the iPhone shipped, there's never been a day
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.720]  where people aren't hunting for signs
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:01.900]  that maybe Apple is going to add
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:03.960]  touch screen support to the Mac.
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:08.840]  And so with last year's update to Mac OS,
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:10.360]  or maybe it was the year before,
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.360]  but when they sort of made it look even more like iOS,
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:20.320]  the iOS visual UI style, and things like the WiFi menu
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.520]  now had like a touch style toggle,
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:27.360]  you know, a little blue white switch
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.160]  for turning WiFi on and off.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.040]  Very famously and controversially this year
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.980]  with Mac OS 13 Ventura with the complete redesign
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:38.320]  going from the old system preferences
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.860]  to the new settings app,
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:43.480]  this visual style of the settings app
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.260]  is obviously iOS inspired.
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.400]  And so lots and lots of people looked at that and said,
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.080]  see, they are definitely going to move to touch.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:52.900]  But the settings app is actually
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:55.520]  a really interesting example.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.480]  I've been, as we record, I am as yet unpublished.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.560]  I have a big long, well, not too long,
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.000]  but a daring fireball piece about this,
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.680]  what I'm talking about, why this just adding touch
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.900]  is not that easier said than done to the Mac.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:13.200]  And the settings app is a perfect example
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.600]  because it just look at the sidebar, just the list,
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.720]  and again, not complaining about the settings app,
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.780]  just take it for what it is,
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:22.760]  but compare it side by side with an iPad, right?
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.940]  A Mac and an iPad right next to each other,
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:30.200]  open settings and look at the list of panels on the left.
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.800]  On the iPad, they're way further apart.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.200]  The row height is higher.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.120]  They're significantly there
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:38.380]  because they're optimized for touch.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:39.660]  And on the Mac, they're not
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:41.400]  because they're optimized for a pointing device.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:46.280]  And it's a more information dense interface.
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:47.600]  It always has been.
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.640]  And they could lower that density
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.660]  and do something like they've done on the iPad OS
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:57.720]  with the touch pad, the focus kind of driven UI
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.480]  where you move the little dot around on the screen
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:02.680]  and it does different things
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:04.620]  depending on what it's hovering on.
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:05.920]  They could do something like that,
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:09.840]  but then think, okay, that's gonna make Mac OS
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.720]  kind of modal at a system level.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.280]  It's like, oh, am I using touch mode
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.760]  or am I using mouse mode?
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.280]  Yeah, I can't see the main thing.
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.880]  That's a weird thing, right?
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:22.120]  Well, and when you're on a MacBook,
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.400]  you're always in both modes, right?
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.080]  Because a MacBook, unlike an iPad,
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.240]  an iPad at least does have the two states
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.760]  of being connected to the magic keyboard
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.840]  or you pull it apart from the Mac.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.360]  Yeah, it knows, it knows, yeah.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.300]  Gurman's report,
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:37.960]  and I think this makes all the sense in the world,
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:40.920]  is that Apple, they're just talking about laptops
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:43.640]  with a permanent hinge, not a detachable
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:47.000]  where you can snap it apart from the keyboard.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.360]  And I, you know, that would be, I just don't,
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:50.200]  that's a whole-
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.020]  Well, it would, yeah.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.320]  And then you think, okay, well,
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  they've got these new beautiful studio displays.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.760]  What's gonna happen there?
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:58.600]  Yeah, it's-
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.120]  And among the classic thing is I tell people who say,
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.320]  oh, you know, touch on my Mac display
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:09.200]  or my studio display will be awesome.
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:13.380]  I say, hold your finger out in front of you, you know,
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:16.720]  at a 90 degree angle to your body
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:19.260]  and hold it there for five minutes.
[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:22.760]  And you'll know within a couple of minutes
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:23.680]  why that's a bad idea.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:25.840]  Your arm starts to hurt.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:27.720]  So if you're doing that all day long,
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:29.600]  you're poking at the screen all day long,
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:32.280]  and it's not very ergonomic.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.140]  Right, but the devil's advocate argument,
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:35.160]  and I'm amenable to it,
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:38.080]  and I don't think Gurman's news,
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:39.720]  let's just say it's true and they are,
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:41.980]  I mean, I'm not surprised, A, that they're working on it
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.980]  just as an idea, and let's just say they do ship it.
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.240]  I think it may not be disastrous
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:51.560]  and maybe won't actually require
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:54.600]  a significant rethinking of the Mac UI.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:59.100]  If the intention is we don't expect anybody to do more
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:02.080]  than just poke an okay button once in a while
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.940]  or if you just scroll, I mean, this all makes me sick
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:09.080]  because, you know me, I don't want any, you know,
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:11.380]  as far as I know, I have a studio display.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:13.200]  I mean, this is because I don't have little kids anymore.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.360]  Well, actually, my son never touched my screen, so.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.500]  You trained him well.
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:20.960]  But I have a one-year-old 14-inch MacBook Pro
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:25.960]  and a like eight-month-old studio display
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:30.440]  with the nano texture, and as far as I know,
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.760]  neither display has ever been touched by a human finger.
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:34.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:38.340]  So because nobody else, nobody, I don't have,
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:40.360]  I guess colleagues are the big problem
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.040]  coming up to your laptop and just touching the screen
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.840]  to say, here, make this bigger.
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:47.960]  Yeah, I know people who will break your finger
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.280]  if you try that.
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.860]  I'm not, it's not a germ thing.
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:53.640]  It's a, you can't, you know, like.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:56.600]  I get upset when the little oil's on the keyboard
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:58.400]  sometimes, you know, transfer to the screen.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:00.400]  That's like, oh my God, I gotta clean my keyboard,
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.240]  clean my screen.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.680]  Clean my screen, clean my keyboard.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.660]  I'm very, I'm not a very fussy person,
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.440]  but I keep my screens very clean.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.320]  Well, neither one of us has great vision, right?
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.160]  It really, it's, it's.
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:10.680]  I think, though, there's, there's,
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.080]  there's an advantage to having a clean screen, right?
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:14.740]  It's like a figure to see.
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:15.580]  Right.
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:16.800]  The devil's argument take, though,
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.560]  about that gorilla arm argument,
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:19.860]  and that is what Apple,
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.060]  I think it goes all the way back to Steve Jobs,
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:23.840]  because people, like I said, people have been,
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:26.680]  as soon as they got to know and love the iPhone,
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.920]  they're like, when is this gonna come to the Mac?
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.840]  And the Steve Jobs argument,
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:33.080]  which is more or less Apple's line,
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.380]  like, you know, they obviously don't talk about things
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:37.240]  they aren't doing often, but like,
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:40.160]  on stage with me at the talk show or anywhere else
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.620]  in public where they might get asked,
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:45.440]  is this is ergonomically not great.
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:47.860]  And, you know, and John Ternus,
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:50.760]  I think during a keynote or somewhere in some interview,
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.560]  has talked about the information density of the Mac,
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:57.160]  and that they're very happy with the, you know,
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.480]  and they keep reiterating it,
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:00.080]  because the other thing people say is, you know,
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:02.440]  what about just, you know, this is the other,
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:04.560]  it goes hand in hand with the idea of touchscreen Macs,
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.040]  is quote unquote merging the iPad and Mac OSs,
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.520]  why have two operating systems for these same size devices,
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:13.120]  just merge them into one?
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:14.440]  And it's honest, you know,
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:17.240]  as a lay person that sounds like common sense,
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.540]  it's like, why have, why did GM have both the Buick
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:22.020]  and Oldsmobile brands, right?
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.860]  That makes no sense.
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:25.760]  They should just get rid of one and just have one.
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.460]  Why, you know, but when you get to the nitty gritty details,
[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:29.960]  it makes no sense whatsoever,
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:32.960]  because if you got rid of iPad OS
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.840]  and just ran Mac OS on the iPads,
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:37.320]  everybody who loves the simplicity of iPad OS
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.640]  is gonna be disappointed.
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.560]  And if you did it the other way and got rid of Mac OS
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.720]  and made all these machines run iPad OS,
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.200]  iPad OS is lacking so much complexity
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:50.880]  that the Mac has to be able to do,
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.240]  that they would just have to re-implement
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.700]  the Mac and iPad OS anyway,
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:55.240]  and it would clearly be more work
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:56.980]  than just keeping them both separate, right?
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:58.640]  So that's not gonna happen.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:00.480]  But I do think that there's an argument to be made
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:01.880]  that the real world evidence,
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.760]  because the PC world has had touchscreen laptops
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.460]  for over 10 years, is that it's just nice to have.
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:09.800]  This is the Ben Thompson take.
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:12.180]  Ben Thompson is like, yeah, I wish you could just have it.
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:14.640]  Yeah, he's the one that I always hear from
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:16.960]  when I say, no, no, no, no.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.800]  It's kind of nice.
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.160]  And I think in certain scenarios,
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.180]  like scrolling a webpage, sure.
[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:25.480]  I can see Touch working with that, you know,
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:28.720]  pinching on a photo in Photos, the Photos app on the Mac.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.600]  Sure, I could see that.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:33.800]  Can I see using BB Edit with my finger?
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:35.280]  Or Xcode, right?
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.120]  Like, look at Xcode.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:37.600]  Oh, God, Xcode, no.
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:38.440]  So just go-
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:42.520]  Oh, man, instead of stepping over, I stopped the debugger.
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.500]  So three things I can think of off the top of my head.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.640]  Look, or four, BB Edit would be one,
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.080]  Xcode would be another, Final Cut,
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.200]  just take a look at a screenshot of Final Cut or Logic
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.400]  or anything like that in a pro media tool sense,
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.400]  and think about touching those things.
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:04.040]  Or in Safari, open up the developer panel.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:04.880]  You know, what do you-
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:05.720]  The web inspector.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:06.960]  Yeah, the web inspector.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.080]  And start thinking,
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.320]  just pretend like you could try to touch those things.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.880]  Or perhaps my canonical example,
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:15.600]  look at those red, yellow, green buttons
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:17.660]  up in the top corner and think about it.
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.600]  Think about trying to hit that yellow one
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.600]  to minimize a window without hitting the red one,
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:25.520]  which does something very different.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:30.520]  Well, there was a reason why the touch points
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:36.220]  on the original iPhone were 44 pixels tall, right?
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:39.440]  And that was one of the things.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:41.600]  You know, it was a very inventive time, you know,
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:44.240]  you kind of exploring what touch meant.
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.560]  One of the first things I did was I put my finger,
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.320]  which I have a fairly large hand, as you know,
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.200]  and I held it up against the ruler.
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:53.480]  And guess what?
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.880]  That 44 pixels was just about the, you know,
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:01.400]  a medium pressure of my finger against the ruler.
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:02.740]  And it was like, okay,
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:05.120]  but somebody had thought about this.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:09.280]  I know the people that worked on that original iPhone.
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.820]  And, you know, they were a smart group of people
[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:15.660]  and they obviously made it 44, you know,
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:16.840]  cause it's a weird number, right?
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.160]  Why 44?
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.000]  Right.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.620]  And nothing on the Mac is 44.
[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:22.620]  No.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:27.040]  The controls, they're like 20 or 22
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:27.880]  or something like that.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.260]  So they're like half the size.
[02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:30.100]  Right.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:31.320]  And the other interesting thing is, you know,
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.720]  and one of the things people took,
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:36.200]  I think mistakenly is a sign that touchscreen support
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:37.920]  was coming to the Macs is Catalyst
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:41.520]  and that you can run iPad apps on Mac OS now.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.880]  And obviously look like they're more meant for touch
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.640]  because on the iPad they are.
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:49.380]  But one of the things about Catalyst is that by default,
[02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:50.320]  everything has shrunk.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:54.480]  I think the scale is 77%, which is a very strange number,
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.720]  but just call it 75%.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.880]  And if you've never noticed it,
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:01.280]  just take an app like a third party app,
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:04.580]  like Overcast is one that I know runs on the Mac.
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:07.000]  Just open it on your Mac, open it on your iPad
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.800]  and look, not screenshots in comparing,
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:12.580]  but just look at the physical devices.
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:15.680]  You'll see that it is much smaller on the Mac
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.280]  cause the Mac is an information dense interface.
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.920]  So I can see at a very high level,
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.320]  two ways that Apple could go about this.
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.460]  And the first way would be,
[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:28.080]  I will call it the Ben Thompson route,
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.040]  which is just add touchscreens to the Mac.
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.000]  Don't really rejigger anything.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.400]  And if a whole bunch of the interface
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:37.240]  is not really touch friendly,
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:39.600]  then just use the mouse pointer for all that stuff.
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:41.440]  Like if you want to hit that yellow button,
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:42.840]  you'll know to use the track pad.
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.640]  But if there's a big okay button
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:46.440]  and you just want to tap it with your finger
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:49.200]  and you just want to flick to scroll safari
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:50.560]  with your finger and you don't care
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:52.360]  about the smudges on your screen,
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.520]  go ahead and touch, you know, you can, you know, so what?
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:58.540]  And you'll just learn what's good and what's bad.
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:02.320]  But I, and I think the argument for this is, is not,
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:05.360]  it's clearly, Gurman's going, always wants to,
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.940]  like part of the thing's not frustrating,
[02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:10.920]  but it's like, I can't read his stuff
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.300]  without being mildly annoyed by it,
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:15.820]  is that there's always a narrative attached.
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:19.760]  But is, the narrative is always built around the facts
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:21.840]  as opposed, you know, like, so if the fact is
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.000]  he heard they're working on a touchscreen,
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.920]  then he builds a narrative that is,
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.760]  this could help Apple because its competitors
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:30.480]  all sell touchscreen laptops.
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:34.640]  But the truth is, Apple clearly won that argument, right?
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.320]  10, 11 years ago, Samsung had an enormous,
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:40.480]  years-long marketing campaign.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:43.480]  Microsoft, who has a very, very well-regarded
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:45.780]  hardware business now with the Surface line,
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:49.920]  spent years where the primary ads I saw
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:53.240]  for Surface laptops were all targeting the MacBook Air,
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:55.960]  either by name or obviously implicitly,
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.320]  and the message was, ours look the same, you know,
[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:02.000]  they look like the same sort of aluminum little thing,
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.600]  and they're svelte and small and lightweight,
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:07.220]  and ours have touch and theirs don't.
[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:10.640]  And, you know, that's worth trying as a marketing campaign.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:14.260]  But the Mac is more popular now than it ever has been.
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:17.320]  It is, they're record-breaking quarters,
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.940]  and the Macs that most people buy are MacBooks by far,
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:23.480]  and the fact, so, you know, you can make the argument
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:25.740]  that if they had touchscreens, they'd sell even more.
[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:29.600]  Maybe that's true, but it's obviously not hurt them at all
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:31.000]  that they don't have them.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.920]  I think, though, there is an argument that the world
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:37.960]  in the last 10 years has grown and changed,
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:41.320]  and that fundamentally, people, especially younger people,
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.600]  I hear this from people with young kids all the time now,
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.640]  kids can't get it through their heads
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.220]  that Macs don't have touchscreens.
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:49.760]  They just touch them, and it feels broken.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:51.320]  They've grown up with it, yeah.
[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:53.600]  It's like that's their first.
[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:56.320]  That was the problem with Apple TV, too, right?
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:59.280]  Kids were walking up to the Apple TV, and it's like,
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.060]  whoa, why isn't this working?
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:03.440]  So, you know, so that's the Ben Thompson rule.
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.120]  Just add touch, and if some of the things are too small,
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:08.400]  then just learn not to use touch for those things,
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:13.400]  and it's a totally secondary, just nice to have thing.
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:16.880]  The other route that they could go would be to rejigger
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:21.880]  the Mac interface to really iPod size it, everything,
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:25.940]  and all of Apple's own first-party apps,
[02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:27.360]  and just think about this.
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.240]  Here's another example, Safari.
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.720]  I'm a diehard Safari user.
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:31.660]  It's my favorite browser.
[02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:33.580]  I've been a Safari user for years.
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.200]  How do you close a tab on Safari?
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:40.160]  You move the mouse over the tab to the right or left side,
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.740]  of course, left side for the close button on Mac.
[02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:46.880]  The right side that Chrome uses is idiomatically wrong,
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:49.500]  in my opinion, even though I know lots of people use Chrome,
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:53.140]  but you hover over that thing, and then the X appears,
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:55.240]  and you tap the X button to close the tab.
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:56.880]  Well, how do you do that with touch, right?
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:59.080]  If you look at the iPad, it's very different.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:02.660]  They have to keep the X button visible at all times,
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:07.660]  because, again, it goes back to that information.
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:11.580]  And they only let you, on iPad,
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.720]  they only let you close the front-most tab,
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:15.480]  because that's the only one that changes
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:19.080]  the favicon to an X, so you can't close a background tab,
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:21.200]  because of this problem.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.680]  So if Apple did that, I would be heartbroken
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.840]  if they changed the entire Mac interface
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:29.800]  to be iPod or touch-sized and touch-friendly,
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:30.760]  and I think this is-
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:33.520]  Well, the problem is both approaches don't seem
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.000]  like something that Apple would do, right?
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.180]  That first approach, it's like,
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:40.100]  this is coming from the company that spent all that time
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:43.360]  and engineering resources to come up with that awesome,
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.320]  you know, touch pointer on the iPad OS, right?
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:49.920]  They could have just put an arrow there,
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.280]  and people would have gone, oh, cool,
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:54.920]  I can now point at stuff with my arrow on my iPad.
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:59.040]  But they made it, they made it Apple-esque, right?
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.760]  I don't see an Apple-esque solution
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:02.480]  for either one of those scenarios.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:04.640]  Right, and I know there are exceptions,
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:07.700]  because no company's perfect, including Apple, certainly,
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:12.700]  but the Apple ethos is that everything should be nice.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:13.920]  Everything. Yes.
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:17.640]  The packaging, the tape, the little green pull tab
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.000]  that you put in part- No rough edges, no rough edges.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.040]  No rough edges, the packaging should be nice,
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:25.280]  the plastic that's wrapped around the device
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.240]  inside the packaging should be nice,
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:28.920]  everything in the interface should be nice,
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.400]  and so if you have touch,
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.260]  everything should be touch-friendly.
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:36.740]  And when they added mouse pointer support to iPad OS,
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:40.440]  they didn't just put a Mac-style arrow cursor on screen
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:42.440]  that moves around, they made it nice,
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.920]  and they made it very iPad, it's incredibly inventive
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.680]  and so natural, and I like,
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.120]  I seamlessly move back and forth between an iPad and a Mac,
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:53.780]  and I just know where it is, but with that,
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:55.840]  what do you call it, focus, you know?
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.040]  Yeah, the focus interaction is-
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.240]  Focus interaction, and that you have this round
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.600]  eraser-sized thing instead of an arrow cursor,
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.120]  and it's kind of, instead of being precise with a point,
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.800]  it is kind of sloppy, like a small fingertip.
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.580]  You know, look at Stage Manager, right?
[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:17.400]  That's Apple's current attempt to kind of span the-
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.240]  Mac, iPad- The window management
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.780]  on a Mac with window management on the iPad,
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:27.380]  and it's got a ton of rough edges, right?
[02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:32.380]  I don't think the people who want it are happy with it,
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:35.500]  the people who are making it probably aren't happy with it.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.660]  It's a hard problem, right?
[02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:41.420]  It's not something you can just wave the magic wand and go,
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:43.020]  oh, here you go, right?
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:44.140]  You've got Stage Manager,
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:46.140]  and it works awesome across all platforms,
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:49.580]  and Stage Manager doesn't work awesome
[02:26:49.580 --> 02:26:51.180]  across all platforms.
[02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:55.980]  I think back to the even probably a longer argument
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:58.780]  than the should Macs have touchscreens argument
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:02.620]  is the how many buttons should be on a mouse argument, right?
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.860]  Apple stuck with a one-button mouse well past the point
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:07.980]  where everybody was like,
[02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:10.940]  they obviously should have a two-button mouse,
[02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:14.140]  and even today, really shipped with one button,
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:17.180]  but found a clever solution where they can enable
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:21.740]  the things that you used secondary buttons for
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:25.180]  in a way without adding the complexity of another button,
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:28.380]  and the argument against the two-button mouse,
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:31.420]  the argument on the one side is always,
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:35.340]  it's sort of the Microsoft mindset, in my opinion,
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:39.100]  and it's more the typical nerd mindset
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:41.020]  as opposed to a designer's mindset,
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:43.100]  which is that more is always better.
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:47.260]  More features, more features.
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:49.100]  An app with more features is better.
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:49.740]  More settings.
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:50.940]  Need more settings.
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:52.700]  More settings, more features.
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:55.900]  Famous is the way most software was advertised
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:57.740]  in the early decades of the PC industry
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:01.260]  with full-page ads with here's our app,
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:02.700]  and here's a list of features,
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:04.700]  and there's a pretty green checkbox,
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:06.460]  and oh, wouldn't you believe it?
[02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:09.740]  Every single thing has a green checkbox for our app,
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:11.500]  and our competitor's app has,
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:16.380]  oh, the first two, sure, red X, red X, red X.
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:17.980]  Only one button on this Mac.
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:20.380]  You better buy a Windows 95.
[02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:23.500]  Right, and it is, and that does appeal to people.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:25.100]  I'm not saying that that's wrong.
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:28.380]  Obviously, there are some people who truly believe that,
[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:29.340]  that more is better,
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:32.380]  and so having more buttons on a mouse is better
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:32.780]  than having fewer.
[02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:34.620]  Having more options on a screen is better.
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:36.220]  I mean, that's Ben's thing, right?
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:37.420]  He wants more options.
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:41.020]  And if you only want to use the left-most main button,
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:43.900]  then just click that one button on your mouse all the time
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:45.740]  and ignore these other buttons.
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:48.380]  You can do that, and it is, that is true.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:51.100]  I just retired a mouse, and I looked at it
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.020]  as I was putting it in the trash,
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:55.820]  and it's like that left button was just like,
[02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:57.660]  it was just shiny, you know?
[02:28:57.660 --> 02:28:58.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.380]  Covered in, it covered in finger grease
[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:02.780]  and the right one, a little bit,
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:04.540]  but it was kind of as new.
[02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:08.220]  Right, it's like when you have an old keyboard like I do,
[02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:10.940]  you can look, you know, you can definitely see.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.380]  Where do you hit the space bar?
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:13.740]  Right, where do you hit the space bar?
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:15.260]  Erosion, it's a real thing.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:16.540]  So, you know, I don't know.
[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:19.420]  I think it's, but I do think that there's-
[02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:20.780]  I absolutely agree that there's a,
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:24.700]  there's, it's a, we're going to hear about it at WWDC.
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:28.140]  There's probably going to be a lot of tooling involved.
[02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:31.020]  There's probably a lot, unless it's like Ben's just,
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:33.100]  you know, hey, let it roll, you know?
[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:35.420]  There's some rough edges, but you know,
[02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:36.460]  you can deal with it.
[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:39.100]  In the way that I had a bad feeling about Twitter
[02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:43.260]  and third-party clients, just for weeks at this point,
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:45.340]  and that it was a growing sense of dread
[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:47.260]  and it was not surprised on Friday,
[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:49.980]  on the opposite side, I have a good feeling about
[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:53.500]  if it comes true that touch screens come to MacBooks
[02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:55.580]  two or three years from now.
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:58.460]  I have a good feeling that it'll be done in a way
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:00.380]  where at every step of the way,
[02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:04.220]  it's done by people at Apple who feel just like we do
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:07.420]  about the information density of macOS
[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:11.020]  being a strong point that cannot be sacrificed.
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:13.740]  And that they'll, you know, and maybe that's also
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:15.900]  one of the reasons this is years ahead,
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:18.380]  is that there's work to be done to do it the way they want.
[02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:20.700]  And I'm, you know, I'm not thinking-
[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:26.700]  Yeah, and it's going to respect me as a user of that platform, right?
[02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:28.620]  It's like, I don't have to use Stage Manager.
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:32.300]  I don't, I have nothing to do with it, you know?
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:36.700]  But some people may want it and more power to them.
[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:41.820]  I certainly never would have anticipated 15 years ago
[02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:47.820]  the way that Apple has magic trackpads and magic mice now
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:49.980]  that have one button or, you know,
[02:30:49.980 --> 02:30:52.380]  literally with the trackpads, no buttons, right?
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:53.980]  No actual buttons.
[02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:56.940]  But that enables not just right-clicking,
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:58.300]  which was the whole argument, right?
[02:30:58.300 --> 02:30:59.580]  The whole argument with two-button mice
[02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:02.780]  is regular click versus a right-click for a contextual menu
[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:04.300]  and you want two buttons for that.
[02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:07.900]  The magic trackpad does dozens of things, right?
[02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:10.620]  You can zoom and, of course, scroll, right?
[02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:11.660]  The two things.
[02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:15.740]  I would have never, I don't have, you know,
[02:31:15.740 --> 02:31:17.420]  this is why I write about stuff that,
[02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.660]  my job is writing and blabbing on this podcast
[02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:24.220]  about stuff, creative, inventive stuff
[02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:26.860]  that people make, not thinking of it.
[02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:28.140]  Like, I never would have thought of it.
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:30.460]  And there might be something like that, you know,
[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:32.140]  or multiple solutions like that.
[02:31:32.140 --> 02:31:34.620]  And, you know, to tie it back into Twitter, right?
[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:36.460]  It's all kind of, you know,
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:39.180]  you have that initial innovation called a trackpad
[02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:41.980]  and then you start adding things like, you know,
[02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:45.580]  the haptic feedback, you add the different gestures,
[02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:47.420]  you add all of this stuff
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:49.740]  and a keyword there is additive, right?
[02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:50.300]  Right.
[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:54.140]  You make that initial thing better and better and better.
[02:31:54.140 --> 02:31:56.460]  And Apple is so good at that.
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:57.740]  Right.
[02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:00.860]  That article you wrote long ago, you know,
[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:04.220]  how Apple rolls, it's just, you know,
[02:32:04.220 --> 02:32:08.620]  take that nut of the idea and increment and increment
[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:10.300]  and increment and, you know,
[02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:12.380]  just make it better year over year.
[02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:12.620]  Yeah.
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:15.900]  I'm glad Apple doesn't spend much time explaining
[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.380]  over and over again, officially, you know,
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:21.500]  why iPadOS and macOS are not merging
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:23.820]  and why they are separate platforms.
[02:32:23.820 --> 02:32:27.340]  I'm glad because it gives me all the time in the world
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:29.740]  to write about it at great length on my website
[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.580]  and talk about it on the show.
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:34.060]  But I really do believe from everybody I know
[02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:36.860]  they're behind the scenes and, you know,
[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:37.980]  and what they have said,
[02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:41.180]  what John Ternus and Jaws have said about it,
[02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:43.260]  that they get, and Federighi.
[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:46.060]  Federighi has spoken eloquently about it.
[02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:46.540]  They're very open about it.
[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.620]  And the people like that, they don't want to hear it.
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:51.900]  But Federighi of all people is the one
[02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:53.980]  whose life would be tremendously simpler.
[02:32:53.980 --> 02:32:58.860]  If he had one less OS team to manage.
[02:32:58.860 --> 02:32:59.340]  Yeah.
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:02.140]  And he's the, you know, merge teams and do all sorts.
[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:02.300]  Yeah.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:03.500]  You could do that.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:06.780]  That would be awesome for him.
[02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:08.300]  Right.
[02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:10.460]  In terms of decreasing the amount of work
[02:33:10.460 --> 02:33:11.580]  he has to deal with,
[02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:14.540]  it would be, he'd be the number one beneficiary in the world.
[02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:16.540]  And yet he's one of the most eloquent
[02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:21.260]  and ardent supporters of the separation of macOS and iPadOS.
[02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.620]  And he's one of us.
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:23.260]  He's one of us.
[02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:27.420]  He's been using NextStep since it wasn't even NextStep, right?
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:27.740]  Right.
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:28.700]  Well, you know.
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:32.620]  So anyway, I'm optimistic that even if it comes true,
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:33.260]  it'll be fine.
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:35.340]  And that people like me and you can just ignore it
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:38.540]  and never touch my screen still.
[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:38.940]  Yeah.
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:40.620]  And it's not going to fundamentally change
[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:41.500]  the macOS interface.
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:44.460]  But, you know, it's going to be something
[02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:48.460]  that Apple can leverage, you know, at a point of sale, right?
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:50.380]  You know that you're going to be able to walk
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:52.940]  into an Apple store and it's going to have some demo
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:55.020]  that says, you know, hey, touch me here.
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:56.940]  And it's going to do all sorts of cool things.
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:58.700]  And you're going to be like, oh, this is great.
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.420]  This is better than my iPad or whatever.
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:01.900]  Right.
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:04.700]  You know, it's just, you know, that's going to happen.
[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:05.980]  It's going to, it's just going to have a,
[02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:07.580]  it's going to have a cool name.
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:09.980]  It's not, I don't know what that name is going to be,
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:14.380]  but it's going to, you know, it's going to be the marketing people
[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:16.620]  and the manufacturing people probably start thinking
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:18.700]  about this new thing at the same time.
[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.500]  And yep.
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:21.900]  And they're going to act as though they've invented it.
[02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:25.900]  And it's all the, all the people who've been thinking
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:27.900]  it's insane that they haven't had it for 10 years
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:30.780]  and that they should have just, just make it a touch screen
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:33.100]  when they come up with their name for it and act as though
[02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.420]  they've invented it, which, you know, I'm sure there will be
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:37.660]  aspects that they didn't vent, but yeah.
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:42.380]  And then Samsung six months later is going to have their copy of it.
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:43.420]  Craig, thank you so much.
[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.740]  I know, obviously it's been a rough week.
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:48.700]  You have my sympathies, but also you have my profound thanks.
[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:51.580]  And you know that I love Twitter Effect and you know
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:52.300]  that I love.
[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:52.460]  Yeah.
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:53.500]  You were an early supporter.
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:57.980]  I mean, I mentioned you that there was a reason for that.
[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:00.700]  Well, you kind of gave me the idea, right?
[02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:03.740]  You said, oh, I want it.
[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:05.580]  I want this thing to be a dashboard widget.
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:10.860]  I was like, oh, and then I was like, yes, that's literally the,
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:12.540]  I, it's so long ago.
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:15.180]  This again, maybe one of those I'm constructing the memories
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:16.460]  for what I want them to be.
[02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:19.660]  But I'm going to say, I read that tweet, got in the shower
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:22.860]  and then had the idea for Twitter Effect, let's say.
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:24.060]  And where did you write about this?
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.820]  Is this an old Furbo post?
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:26.540]  Yeah.
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:26.860]  Yeah.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:29.420]  Well, when you, was it when you announced Twitter Effect?
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:30.540]  Yeah.
[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:30.860]  Yeah.
[02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:32.540]  It's in, it was January.
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:35.580]  In fact, it was yesterday, 16 years ago.
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:40.380]  So yeah, we, it's, you know, we, at the end of the thing,
[02:35:40.380 --> 02:35:42.780]  he's like, oh, hey, you know, this is a new thing, you know,
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:43.500]  go follow us.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:47.100]  It's, you know, Chalkinberry, you know, Getty and him,
[02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:50.300]  Talos, you know, all of us in it, and you can even follow
[02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:51.340]  some famous people.
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:56.140]  And the link for famous was to you and somebody else who
[02:35:56.140 --> 02:36:00.540]  I've forgotten, but you know, the Indigerati.
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:00.780]  Yeah.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.820]  Well, that's, that speaks to how small Twitter, that's really
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:06.140]  speaks to how small Twitter was back then.
[02:36:06.140 --> 02:36:08.060]  We did that on our internal Slack the other day.
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:10.540]  It's like, oh, that's been back when Groover was famous.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:16.860]  There was a time when my follower count was, I was never
[02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:20.060]  a top of the list, but I was, you know, maybe it was some,
[02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:22.380]  maybe at one point I was in the top 100 or something.
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:22.620]  Yeah.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:22.940]  I don't know.
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:27.100]  But now, you know, follower count doesn't matter.
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:28.860]  You know, it's quality versus quantity.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.380]  Oh, it's always, I wish, honestly, I wish I had a lot fewer
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.020]  followers.
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.020]  It's one of the reasons I'm enjoying Mastodon.
[02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:35.900]  That is very true.
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:36.220]  Yeah.
[02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:39.420]  And one of the things I will say about Mastodon is that the
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:43.660]  level of discourse is a lot, you know, I can't reply to
[02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:46.780]  everything, but there are things that I want to reply.
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:47.580]  Right.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:51.100]  And that, that wasn't always true on Twitter recently.
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.020]  I've been given a lot of thought that I know, and I've
[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:55.180]  talked about it last word, the last episode of the show with
[02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:56.860]  Glenn Fleishman and we've gone on too long.
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:58.540]  I'm not going to go on too far, but I've been thinking a
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:00.620]  lot about where's Mastodon going.
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:02.220]  It's obviously a good place.
[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:05.100]  It feels very much like early Twitter, but it's also very,
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:09.020]  at least my circle on Mastodon of people I've followed is
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:10.940]  very nerd centric.
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:11.500]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:11.900]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:15.820]  There's not a lot of the political information or people
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.900]  talking about COVID or whatever.
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:21.340]  It is important on Twitter for the last 10 years.
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:25.260]  It is much nicer, but I'm optimistic that Mastodon is going
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:27.740]  to stay that way because I do think Mastodon is what I was
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.540]  saying about with Twitter.
[02:37:28.540 --> 02:37:31.260]  Mastodon isn't run.
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:33.660]  You can run a commercial instance of it if you choose, but
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:34.860]  it's open source project.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:39.340]  It is sort of a foundation or it's just trying to be good,
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:42.300]  but therefore it's not trying to be profitable.
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:46.220]  And so therefore nothing, none of their decisions are geared
[02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:49.740]  towards profit or engagement.
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:50.060]  Right.
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:52.620]  And it's that algorithms.
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:52.860]  Right.
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:55.980]  And so famously, there's this, you know, one of the things
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:58.780]  people that love the third party Twitter clients love about
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:02.460]  them, including me, but is the non algorithmic timeline.
[02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:05.100]  Just show me the tweets from the people I follow in the order
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:05.820]  they were posted.
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:06.860]  And that's all I want.
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:09.980]  And you can kind of get that in Twitter on their following
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.260]  tab in the Twitter app.
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:12.620]  But if you can keep it there.
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:13.900]  Right.
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:17.900]  But the point is, is that Twitter shifted towards the
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:23.340]  algorithmic timeline years and years ago, because when they
[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:26.460]  wanted to grow and it's that whole thing where their idea
[02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:29.980]  was, we want to be a hundred billion dollar company.
[02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:33.180]  We want to be a peer to Facebook.
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:36.700]  And so we need Facebook size appeal.
[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:42.540]  And for the not just slight majority, but overwhelming
[02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:48.620]  majority of regular people out there, the Twitter of old,
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:52.540]  the old original Twitter that was only a non algorithmic
[02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:55.820]  timeline and only the people you chose to follow with no
[02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:59.420]  suggestions at all, other than what you've chosen to follow
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:02.300]  was baffling to most people.
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:05.900]  That was not confusing that they didn't understand it, but
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:07.900]  confusing. Why would I want to use this?
[02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:10.940]  And Twitter had these metrics.
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:13.180]  They were very obvious to see that people would say, all
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:15.260]  right, people keep saying I should get on Twitter.
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:17.020]  Now I'm on Twitter here.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:17.820]  I'll follow.
[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.260]  All right, Barack Obama.
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:21.100]  And here's somebody else.
[02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:24.380]  And one thing they did algorithmically even back then was
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:26.060]  suggest people to follow.
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:26.620]  Right.
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:29.100]  That's how my wife got so many followers, because she made
[02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:29.660]  that list.
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:30.860]  Oh, really?
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:31.660]  I didn't know that.
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:31.900]  Yeah.
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:35.660]  She's got, like, tens of thousands of followers, not because
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:36.460]  she's my wife.
[02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:38.780]  Like, people are like, oh, you're famous, John.
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:39.660]  I know, but no.
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:43.100]  But people followed her because she and Anil Dash and I
[02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:43.900]  forget who else.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:46.940]  But back in those early days, somebody at Twitter liked her
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:50.780]  jokes and put her on that list of, like, 50 people you might
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:51.820]  want to follow.
[02:39:51.820 --> 02:39:53.180]  I don't even know that that was algorithmic.
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:55.980]  I think they just had, like, a list of here's 50 people we
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:59.820]  at Twitter think are good, general, like, you know, friendly,
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:01.580]  funny, interesting, insightful.
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:02.540]  Maybe you like politics.
[02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:03.420]  Maybe you like sports.
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:04.540]  Maybe you like jokes.
[02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:07.020]  Here's some people to follow, but just prime the pump,
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:07.420]  basically.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:07.660]  Right.
[02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:10.860]  But people exposed to that, they'd sign up, they'd follow
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:12.860]  some people, they'd look at their timeline, they'd say, I
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:15.100]  have no idea why I would ever want to come back here.
[02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.420]  And then they wouldn't come back, and they went away.
[02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:21.740]  And then they shifted towards using algorithms to suggest
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:24.700]  content and to promote engagement and test.
[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:28.300]  Oh, this hashtag is getting lots of engagement.
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:29.980]  Let's show it to more people.
[02:40:29.980 --> 02:40:34.860]  And, oh, everybody who has liked tweets from Al Franken seems
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:40.380]  to want to engage with this hashtag about a new political
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:41.100]  issue.
[02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:43.340]  And so let's show it to those people.
[02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:46.940]  And that did increase engagement.
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:53.340]  But to me, the obvious downside to it is it drew people who
[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:55.740]  were looking to fight, or even people who weren't looking
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:59.020]  to fight, the engagement would make them emotional and angry.
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:02.220]  And now they're in a bad mood, and they are snippy and rude
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:04.220]  and curt on Twitter.
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:07.420]  The culture grew, shifted.
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:12.380]  Yeah, at the risk of diving into talking about social
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:17.580]  networks for hours and hours, to me, the thing that's
[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:23.260]  problematic with algorithms is that they show you what you
[02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:24.700]  like, right?
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:29.180]  And the thing is that life is full of things that you don't like,
[02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:30.780]  and you need to be exposed to them.
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:34.620]  One of the beautiful things about Twitter, I've learned
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:38.540]  about for things like the Tulsa massacre on Twitter.
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:44.300]  I had never, I mean, I grew up in a school filled with
[02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:46.540]  other white people, right?
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:48.780]  And I'd never heard of this and never been taught in my
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:49.020]  history.
[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:51.900]  And I was like, I read that, and I was like, holy shit,
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:52.380]  right?
[02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:55.420]  And that's something that an algorithm would not because,
[02:41:55.420 --> 02:41:58.300]  you know, I don't express any like of that.
[02:41:58.300 --> 02:41:58.780]  Right.
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:04.380]  But it's the diversity of things that algorithms don't
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:06.620]  help at all with.
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:07.100]  Right.
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:10.620]  It just shows you what you already know and what you know
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:11.260]  already like.
[02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.660]  And, you know, some people want that.
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:18.460]  So for a lot of Facebook is so wildly popular.
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:21.740]  And all sorts of things that I loved or used to love are
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:22.220]  like that.
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:23.820]  I think RSS feeds are like that.
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:27.420]  I think there's an RSS feeds are having a nice resurgence,
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:30.460]  but they're never going to be as popular as like Facebook,
[02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:30.700]  right?
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:33.340]  They're not because the most people don't want to curate
[02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:33.980]  Usenet.
[02:42:33.980 --> 02:42:35.260]  I loved it back in the day.
[02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:39.500]  It was never something that was going to explode in popularity.
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:41.980]  There's a reason that all these modern social networks
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:44.860]  replaced it because they don't engage people who aren't
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:47.420]  looking to do the curation and hunting themselves.
[02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:49.420]  Mastodon is like that.
[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:50.940]  It has that appeal.
[02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:54.460]  And so for some of us who liked the old Twitter better
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:59.020]  than new Twitter, everybody has the same reaction.
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:00.060]  You go to Mastodon.
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:02.780]  You use one of these tools to find the people you followed
[02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:03.980]  on Twitter on Mastodon.
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:07.580]  And you say this is better than Twitter in most ways,
[02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:11.580]  because I'm seeing better content, having better engagements.
[02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:12.940]  Everybody is friendlier.
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:14.540]  This is just a total win.
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:18.460]  And most people who use Twitter or have ever used Twitter,
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:22.140]  if they tried Mastodon, they would be like, not confused.
[02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:24.940]  I think per se, although some of the Federation in which
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:26.540]  server you're on is confusing.
[02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:28.220]  And that's a barrier to entry to.
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:31.820]  I just think, though, that they could get talked through
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:34.940]  the pick a server, find a name, find people you want to
[02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:38.460]  follow and still look at it and say, this is not engaging.
[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:39.500]  I don't get it.
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:40.380]  And that's fine.
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:41.420]  And that is fine.
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.660]  But I think if I'm right, the good news is I think Mastodon
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:50.140]  can continue to grow and thrive and will stay the place
[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:52.940]  that is making us happy, those of us who are happy on
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:54.940]  Mastodon, in perpetuity.
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:43:58.380]  I am genuinely optimistic about that.
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:02.300]  And so the thing that's going to make me happy is being able
[02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:06.860]  to combine some of those things that make me happy.
[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:07.100]  Right?
[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:09.820]  There's certain things.
[02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:15.100]  I absolutely love Michael Tsai's RSS feed, right?
[02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:18.620]  It just tells me about stuff that's happening in the Mac
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:24.780]  industry and, you know, has good links, has good commentary.
[02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:27.340]  It's just like, it's one of the things I follow.
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:31.260]  But, you know, if I'm looking at Mastodon, I may or may not
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:33.900]  see his toots about these things.
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:37.660]  So, you know, it's like, there's a lot of things that
[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:38.140]  interest me.
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:42.540]  How do I get all of those things that interest me kind of
[02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:43.740]  into one place?
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:43.980]  Right.
[02:44:43.980 --> 02:44:47.020]  And you have the freedom to do that because there's no gatekeeper
[02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:47.500]  rules, right?
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.860]  Like one of the things I think the open web, man, one of the
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:52.780]  things I think people don't learn now, right?
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:56.620]  One of the things I think people don't know is that the
[02:44:56.620 --> 02:45:00.700]  Twitter API rules prevent a Twitter client from federating
[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.420]  information from other services.
[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:07.820]  So, for example, why was Tapbots working on ivory before
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:09.020]  this happened?
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:12.700]  Because they weren't allowed to turn Tweetbot into a, oh,
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:15.900]  you can have Twitter accounts and Mastodon accounts side by
[02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:17.180]  side in the same app.
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:20.460]  The Twitter APIs forbid you from doing that, right?
[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:22.700]  And so there's all and there's, you know, all sorts of other
[02:45:22.700 --> 02:45:24.220]  things that are therefore impossible.
[02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:26.940]  So not just separate accounts with separate timelines, you
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:29.820]  therefore, obviously, therefore can't merge them into one
[02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:31.740]  timeline, which is what you're talking about, right?
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:34.860]  And doing clever, original things with presentation.
[02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:35.740]  Nope, not allowed.
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:39.500]  So anyway, by conclusion on this last digression of this
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:45.020]  digression fold episode, is that perversely, in some ways,
[02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:49.260]  SpaceKaren might have saved Twitter and restored it to former
[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:53.820]  greatness, but not by saving Twitter itself, but by wrecking
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:58.780]  Twitter itself, and by wreck, by wrecking it, creating a
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:03.260]  critical mass of people like me who were sort of skeptical
[02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:07.180]  about Mastodon and were lazy and more willing to stay on
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:11.340]  Twitter than do the right thing and go to the open thing.
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:15.820]  But by pushing so many people away and moving them to Mastodon
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:20.140]  by wrecking Twitter, he's added critical mass to Mastodon
[02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:21.420]  that was lacking, right?
[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:22.460]  Like three months ago.
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:25.740]  I've had a Mastodon account for since 2018 during.
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:26.380]  Yeah, me too.
[02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:26.620]  Right.
[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:28.460]  There was something that that's something that they did.
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.380]  There was like, oh, oh boy.
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:31.340]  We've been asked it on.
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:33.180]  We got to pack up.
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:33.980]  Yeah, let me go.
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:37.180]  Let me go get my Gruber and let you go get chicken berry.
[02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:37.420]  Right.
[02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:38.940]  We all signed up.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:43.420]  Everybody signed up in my crowd at 2018 during some API.
[02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:46.380]  Yeah, I don't even want to go back and think about what that
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:47.820]  was, but it was certainly something.
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:52.300]  And I thank everybody who's been working on Mastodon for
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:52.860]  years.
[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:55.020]  I thank them and open.
[02:46:55.020 --> 02:46:55.660]  What's the thing?
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:58.380]  The activity pub and these API.
[02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:02.860]  I thank all of those people who had the vision to say to know
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:06.780]  five years ago that this Twitter thing was a bad idea and
[02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:08.700]  that we should forge ahead with this.
[02:47:08.700 --> 02:47:11.420]  I thank them profusely and sincerely.
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:15.500]  And it's so wonderful that Mastodon is here thriving,
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:17.900]  working and, you know, obviously there's lots they can add
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:19.580]  and it can be better and faster.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:22.380]  And they've got scaling issues like when we have to fail.
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:22.940]  But we're not.
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:29.500]  But the fact that they had the foresight to say, yeah, okay,
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:31.180]  this is a walled garden.
[02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:31.500]  Right.
[02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:36.620]  But yeah, let's celebrate the fact that here we are toasting
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:39.340]  to the third party Twitter clients that we previously loved
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:40.380]  and are now shut off.
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:42.620]  And Mastodon is already here.
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:45.820]  We're not stuck at the point of, I guess we should make
[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:47.180]  something open.
[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:48.380]  That's like Twitter.
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:50.700]  Let's get started and see what sticks.
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:54.140]  And no, it's already here because these people had the foresight
[02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:54.940]  to do it years ago.
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:47:56.300]  And I thank them profusely.
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:48:00.620]  But the truth is the truth is pre Space Caron acquisition
[02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:03.900]  of Twitter Mastodon was not a ghost town.
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:06.620]  And I know that there are people who've been actively using
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:10.540]  it for years, but for me, it was I would check in every couple
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:12.780]  months or once a year or something.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:16.060]  And it was like, it was like crickets chirping for me.
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:20.380]  It's thanks to Space Caron that Mastodon has this massive
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:23.820]  infusion of critical mass to make it active enough, even
[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:25.580]  though it still is a tiny size of Twitter.
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:30.300]  It went from too small to enough to be interesting.
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:35.100]  And I think is never going to grow too big to be problematic,
[02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:37.100]  which is kind of a neat place to be.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:41.100]  Yeah, people talk about the barrier to entry for Mastodon,
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:42.700]  and that's not necessarily a bad thing, right?
[02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:45.660]  I mean, I don't see many bot accounts.
[02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:47.260]  It has a flip side, right?
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:47.740]  Yeah.
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:54.060]  So you know, of course you want that diversity.
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:57.260]  And that's one of the things that worries me a little bit
[02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:01.500]  now, but I think over time it'll probably work itself out.
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:05.740]  But yeah, it's a lot of tech dudes at this point.
[02:49:05.740 --> 02:49:06.060]  Right.
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:08.380]  Well, but that's also who we follow.
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:11.580]  There are thriving communities and entire instances.
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:14.860]  If you just search Mastodon.art, you know, a couple of
[02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:17.340]  the people at Icon Factory are big over there.
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:20.460]  And you know, it's like it's a bunch of artists hanging out
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:22.220]  and doing their thing.
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:26.220]  Many, many, there's maybe a dozen popular servers that are
[02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:30.300]  focused on the LGBT community.
[02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:32.380]  Yeah, even the URL is, you know.
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:33.900]  Yeah, right in the URL.
[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:34.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:35.340]  Awesome.
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:35.660]  Yeah.
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:36.300]  Yeah.
[02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:37.180]  So there's, you know.
[02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:37.500]  It'll work.
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:41.900]  I have hope that it'll work itself out and that it won't
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:44.700]  become too much of a trash fire like Twitter.
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:46.780]  I am optimistic.
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:48.620]  Let me thank you for your time.
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:49.900]  Yeah, it's been a pleasure.
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:52.220]  I'm going to put links in the show notes to all of those fine
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:56.700]  Icon Factory products that haven't had their OAuth credentials
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:49:58.060]  yet over the weekend.
[02:49:58.060 --> 02:49:59.260]  So there's all sorts of places.
[02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:00.700]  I will put some links into Furbo.
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:01.500]  I thank you, Craig.
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:02.300]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:04.380]  Cheer up and thank you for everything.
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:10.220]  No, this is not the first time we've had a set back and,
[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:13.820]  you know, we'll figure out what we're going to do and start
[02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:17.260]  doing it and let me let me let me thank the sponsors for
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:17.980]  today's episode.

[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:33.900]  Yep.
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:48.380]  Thank you, John.
