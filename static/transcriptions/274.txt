[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  I was so excited I found the best slippers I've ever had okay I'm so
[00:11.680 --> 00:17.000]  excited to tell you about them I'm still are they cozy oh they're so cozy so
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.200]  they're there from they are not a sponsor of the show this week but they
[00:21.200 --> 00:28.920]  formerly sponsored the show Mack Weldon Mack Weldon shirt right now I've got me
[00:28.920 --> 00:33.080]  undies I'm sitting here it rains I had to take off my pants I'm sitting here my
[00:33.080 --> 00:38.800]  me my me undies and my Mack Weldon shirt you know they make good stuff they
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.120]  really do they actually really do at first I thought it seemed too costly but
[00:43.120 --> 00:46.880]  like my gosh their stuff is so good so well made and so comfortable tell me
[00:46.880 --> 00:51.640]  about these slippers man I want to look them up all right all right so I don't
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.800]  know if you remember but from many many years ago I believe and I've you know I
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.680]  also suffer terribly from podcast amnesia but if I recall correctly on
[01:01.680 --> 01:08.520]  the previous incarnation of this show Dan Benjamin and I spoke a lot about
[01:08.520 --> 01:12.240]  slippers now I could be getting this wrong because I have podcast amnesia so
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.560]  my apologies to mr. Benjamin if I'm getting it wrong but my everyday
[01:17.560 --> 01:20.760]  somebody's every day somebody's born he's never seen the Flintstones don't
[01:20.760 --> 01:23.920]  worry there's somebody who has not heard that about the one-mile slipper and I
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.360]  really like slippers in a winner because I just I just Peter about the house you
[01:28.360 --> 01:32.240]  know I don't leave but you need slippers because it's it's cold and the floors
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.720]  you know get get really cold and you can't do good work with cold feet now I
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.460]  have very strong feelings about slippers I want slippers that have a bit of a
[01:43.460 --> 01:48.760]  back I don't like a slipper where you just slip it right in and there's no
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.320]  back no no no no scuffs for just they you you can't walk with slippers like
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.400]  that now if I recall correctly that's that's what Dan like to see like the
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.640]  ones you just stick your foot in and there's no back but to me it means you
[02:01.640 --> 02:05.600]  have to shuffle you have to shuffle your feet and it makes that's not very
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.640]  dignified it's not dignified you're not modeling well for your son it is not
[02:09.640 --> 02:18.160]  dignified it makes a noise that I find to be unattractive but you don't want
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.160]  too much of a of a back because then you might as well just be putting shoes on
[02:24.160 --> 02:27.400]  right you've got to do much too much work they kind of want it so that your
[02:27.400 --> 02:32.040]  foot can still just get in with no help from your hands right I've been looking
[02:32.040 --> 02:35.800]  for a good pair of slippers I believe I had a good pair of slippers years ago
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.600]  and whoever it was they they stopped making them and then I've been hunting
[02:41.600 --> 02:47.100]  for slippers ever since and with absolutely zero satisfaction had a pair
[02:47.100 --> 02:51.560]  of lands ends that I was it's not the worst it's like it's it's it's I feel
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.900]  like it's really symptomatic of our age of Amazon where I get an extraordinary
[02:54.900 --> 02:59.400]  amount of stuff delivered a lot of the time including stuff you would typically
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.280]  get from a store but like it's the one of the worst things is I ran through
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.360]  this with my sonology for example where I tried to cheap out on my first
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.580]  sonology and I really regretted it because I only bought a two bay sonology
[03:11.580 --> 03:15.480]  which sounds like a lot but if you want to use a sonology for what it's really
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.280]  for you got a pop for the one where you can put lots more drives in that's what
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.560]  makes sonology or any NAS good and I feel like one of the worst things you
[03:24.560 --> 03:28.120]  can do for yourself is economize on the wrong thing and then by multiples of
[03:28.120 --> 03:31.760]  them and you feel like such a cock like what am I doing it's so annoying they
[03:31.760 --> 03:34.320]  arrive and you put them on you're like well I hate these I guess I'll donate
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.520]  these like donated slippers hard pass I
[03:37.520 --> 03:47.040]  I excuse me mm-hmm I took a look at these slippers I forget why I was I
[03:47.040 --> 03:51.440]  guess I was just shopping for you know like regular t-shirts and undies and
[03:51.440 --> 03:58.120]  stuff and some socks and and I saw that they had these slippers I wasn't looking
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.040]  for slippers at Mack weldon didn't even know they made them but I took one look
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.420]  at him and I thought these might be these might be it you see the you see
[04:05.420 --> 04:08.200]  the picture there I'll put this in the show notes for sure well I got a lot I
[04:08.200 --> 04:13.460]  got a lot questions all I will be acquiring these they if they they claim
[04:13.460 --> 04:18.140]  to have a memory foam footbed yeah waterproof and slip resistant soul and
[04:18.140 --> 04:23.780]  an anti odor silver xt2 registered trademark interior lining yeah and they
[04:23.780 --> 04:26.780]  look like they look like the right combination of easy to deal with
[04:26.780 --> 04:30.640]  comfortable but also sturdy you're not what you're not well you're not walking
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.320]  around looking like you're on it is a bit of a it's a bit of a shoe bottom you
[04:34.320 --> 04:38.720]  know not you know you can see from the pictures it's not big it's it's not like
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.080]  a pair of sneakers but it's you could be comfortable and dignified with the one
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.160]  mouth slipper let's be honest well let me tell you this too I want before I
[04:45.160 --> 04:49.600]  went with the idea of no backslip er I don't know what the industry term is but
[04:49.600 --> 04:55.040]  the other thing that bothers me about a no backslip er is what if something
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.520]  unforeseen happens and I need to I need to run yeah they're just they they would
[05:00.520 --> 05:04.200]  come flying right off what if there's some kids to get off your
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.520]  lawn right you you you kick in their direction and then they're gonna your
[05:08.520 --> 05:12.760]  slipper your slippers off and all the Philly kids are laughing right fat
[05:12.760 --> 05:16.880]  Albert's out there going look at that man with the slipper those kids those
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.280]  kids will tell that story for weeks you can't have your lucky it can't have it
[05:21.280 --> 05:27.280]  yeah one thing though I don't like I also don't like and I'm not a germaphobe
[05:27.280 --> 05:33.940]  yeah but you know I like to keep things tidy mm-hmm it's like a mental thing so
[05:33.940 --> 05:39.400]  with my slippers I don't like them to take one foot out out the door they're
[05:39.400 --> 05:43.780]  in the house right now is the mat we have mats you know we're civilized
[05:43.780 --> 05:48.220]  people we've got a mat in the front door so you can you know wipe your feet now
[05:48.220 --> 05:54.480]  is that mat that you come in and wipe your feet on is that any cleaner than
[05:54.480 --> 05:58.780]  the outside stoop listen whatever you do in life you're gonna suffer from cross
[05:58.780 --> 06:02.640]  contamination but it's germs all the way down you can't think about that all day
[06:02.640 --> 06:06.280]  long you need to get on with your life just keeps it just keep also if it
[06:06.280 --> 06:09.760]  serves your your your house is we have one of those Philadelphia houses that's
[06:09.760 --> 06:13.120]  narrow and tall like the Dutch yeah so you got it you got it you have to go
[06:13.120 --> 06:17.160]  with steps that you fall down sometimes and say Jiminy yeah and and with a
[06:17.160 --> 06:21.720]  situation like that you're gonna want not only dignity but confidence and
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.320]  that's another reason man who walks up to his private office that's it that's
[06:25.320 --> 06:28.700]  another reason for me to get that hard rubber sole though is for taking the
[06:28.700 --> 06:32.080]  steps you know like these lands and ones that I've been suffering with for years
[06:32.080 --> 06:38.640]  had like a almost like a leather sole mm-hmm not good for not good for the
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.160]  slip slipperiness anyway they attract anyway the thing that got me worried
[06:43.160 --> 06:46.680]  about these though is they don't sell the slippers like shoes you know like
[06:46.680 --> 06:50.880]  size 11 size 11 and a half size 12 they've just got like small medium and
[06:50.880 --> 06:56.200]  large and I think large they're like it's sizes 11 to 13 right here what do
[06:56.200 --> 07:00.960]  they say here large doesn't even know this is my this is my question to you
[07:00.960 --> 07:04.360]  that you can come back to you is all right so it's like given your shoe size
[07:04.360 --> 07:09.920]  small small as small as an eight to nine shoe size medium is a nine to ten and
[07:09.920 --> 07:15.800]  large is ten to thirteen now number one what if you're ten right now you're do
[07:15.800 --> 07:18.760]  you get the medium that's nine to ten or do you get the large problem this is
[07:18.760 --> 07:22.640]  this is our concern I am a I used to be a nine and a half and as I age I'm
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.480]  getting closer to a ten but I don't want it to be too loose but I fo shizzle do
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.160]  not want it to be too tight I had a good chance though because it with a lot of
[07:31.160 --> 07:34.440]  shoes I take a 12 and so I feel like that's square in the middle of that
[07:34.440 --> 07:40.480]  large range mmm but I can be really really picky about shoes like five you
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.040]  you pick you about a product this is why I you know you know I you've known me
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.720]  for years I for years and years and years I've been wearing black adidas
[07:48.720 --> 07:53.080]  samba millennium millennium I don't know what you call it I'm not the regular
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.440]  sound like indoor soccer shoes yeah indoor soccer shoes but not the regular
[07:56.440 --> 08:01.120]  Sambas I like the millennium ones they have oh you went with like a you have
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.600]  money for the enterprise yeah yeah when they have some kind of advanced torsion
[08:04.600 --> 08:09.080]  control in the soul or some bullshit like that so important yeah but one of
[08:09.080 --> 08:12.560]  the number one I feel like they never go out of style number two I know if I get
[08:12.560 --> 08:17.640]  the exact same size it'll fit me the exact right way anyway I'm happy to say
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.560]  these slippers feel as though they were custom made for me like I went to a
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.680]  slipper tailor and I had these custom-made it could not fit my feet
[08:27.680 --> 08:33.760]  better within the sort of diesel sort of you well for many years a mr. group
[08:33.760 --> 08:38.960]  within about a day within about a day it went from sort of needing a little bit
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.160]  of help with my fingers to get it over the lip to to just being able to slip my
[08:44.160 --> 08:48.600]  feet right in oh you broke them in yeah oh let me tell you what else pet peeve
[08:48.600 --> 08:55.400]  uh-huh here's one all right I got it when somebody buys a pair of slippers
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.800]  that has a back and they don't step on them they step on them they treat them
[09:00.800 --> 09:04.240]  like the slippers that don't afford we call those scuffs when you got when you
[09:04.240 --> 09:07.800]  got like us or like a lady might have a kind of she called a mule and that's the
[09:07.800 --> 09:10.640]  kind where your foot just goes into it well you like some kind of monster and
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.800]  if you're stepping on that and now I mean there's again dignity you know you
[09:15.800 --> 09:19.840]  could think these could from from going through the gallery here yeah it looks
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.440]  like you could step on oh yeah yeah it's a soft back so you could all right but
[09:24.440 --> 09:28.280]  hey if that's and I understand that's whole anecdote is about how hard it is
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.560]  to find the right pair of slippers but keep looking if you want if you're the
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.320]  sort of person who don't give up don't give up don't treat don't treat slippers
[09:35.320 --> 09:38.960]  with the back like they don't have a back yeah anyway couldn't be more
[09:38.960 --> 09:43.200]  comfortable I even like the way they look I mean it's a nice you know you
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.680]  could tell which color I got I got the dark gray ones yeah they look great yeah
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.080]  there's a fella here he's enjoying some coffee on what looks like his his deck
[09:51.080 --> 09:57.360]  yeah yeah yeah anyway you'll never gonna believe this I couldn't wait to put
[09:57.360 --> 10:01.080]  these on and talk to you about him while I was wearing them I can't find the
[10:01.080 --> 10:05.480]  sons of bitches I don't know where they are you should get a tile I don't know
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.040]  where they are I don't know where they are you could just tape them tape a tile
[10:10.040 --> 10:14.400]  on to each one of them tell people it's steampunk it makes no sense our house
[10:14.400 --> 10:17.160]  where could they where could they have gone where there's only a limited number
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.560]  of places I bet they're under something I that's that's possibility I wonder I
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.600]  may have to I may have to go under I feel like the only places they could be
[10:27.600 --> 10:33.880]  are my closet in my bedroom or at the front door where I take them off and put
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.800]  shoes on to go out you know out and about and they're they're not at either
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.520]  place and it's part of my pathology is and it made me late to start this
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.080]  podcast with you because I was ready I was ready to go right on time but I
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.920]  wanted this slippers mm-hmm I go up to my room I look in a closet and I podcast
[10:52.920 --> 10:57.040]  here from from a cave in the basement so actually I looked by the front door
[10:57.040 --> 11:00.720]  first which is where I assume they were yeah couldn't find them haven't been
[11:00.720 --> 11:03.640]  wearing them for a couple of days because it's been a little warm it's
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.280]  been been like up and up around 50 degrees didn't really need him could
[11:08.280 --> 11:11.520]  have used him but it's really when he gets cold that out went up to my room
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.240]  looked in the closet went all the way back down to the first floor looked at
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.120]  the front door went all the way back up to my room looked in the same closet
[11:18.120 --> 11:25.320]  again and they still weren't there hmm I might go I might go with underneath the
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.360]  couch I don't know how I don't know I mean okay so here's the kind of thing I
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.400]  should as you know you have you have a young person in your life you can't tell
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.080]  them anything and the thing that that so you know you know how it is where like
[11:38.080 --> 11:41.200]  the kid is so much like the one parent or so much like the other parent or
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.640]  sometimes completely different one way I love my wife so much one way she's a lot
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.000]  like my wife is they don't really understand how to look for things and so
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.360]  and so she's frantic because she can't find a thing and I say well did you look
[11:54.360 --> 11:57.280]  here she said yes I looked there and she just she doesn't want to find it she
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.720]  wants to be right and I say now the thing about finding a thing is you can't
[12:00.720 --> 12:03.600]  just look in the places that you've looked that's not looking you keep
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.960]  looking till you find it and the reason that the less civilized people say it's
[12:07.960 --> 12:10.640]  always the last place you look is because nobody keeps looking for
[12:10.640 --> 12:13.800]  something after they found it that that that's that's the problem is you've
[12:13.800 --> 12:17.440]  bought into that ideology so I'm gonna give you a note and then I'd like to
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.820]  share an anecdote the note I'm gonna give to you John I I assume you're you're
[12:21.820 --> 12:26.320]  doing pretty okay with some of this stuff I you should do what I do which is
[12:26.320 --> 12:33.400]  you stack you need you need two more pairs of these that you put aside in
[12:33.400 --> 12:37.760]  case our friends at Mac weldon thank you so much to Mac weldon for sponsoring
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.200]  this you need to stack these and have a second pair ready for when they don't
[12:44.200 --> 12:48.320]  make these anymore or god forbid something terrible happens to the pair
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.640]  you have or they get lost you you need that so what you could do right now is
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.360]  you go to Mac weldon calm you get the one mile slipper get order two pairs and
[12:57.360 --> 13:01.440]  then put them away or take one of those pairs and until you find your other pair
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.760]  now you got a pair of slippers I know that sounds like a monstrous thing to do
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.000]  but these have made you so happy I've never John I've never I've known you for
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.680]  I was gonna I've never heard you this happy before I was gonna buy two more
[13:11.680 --> 13:15.520]  pairs I was already set to buy two more pairs just do that with so many things
[13:15.520 --> 13:22.040]  like our drip coffee thing we use for like making a one-hitter of coffee it's
[13:22.040 --> 13:25.240]  it's hard to get and sometimes you order from the wrong people on Amazon and it's
[13:25.240 --> 13:28.360]  confusing and it's weird and you get now you get the Chinese one that doesn't
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.680]  really work God love them and so I bought two more there's more I said why
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.600]  we have three of these I said well ask me in two and a half years when the
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.760]  other one gets all janky now you now you can still enjoy your coffee like John's
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.240]  gonna enjoy his slippers here's the problem though the problem is I was I
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.680]  was really looking forward to having them in mint condition and I know
[13:45.680 --> 13:48.920]  exactly where I would put them I would put them in the lower left corner of my
[13:48.920 --> 13:52.880]  back of my closet that's where I would put there's only one place that makes
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.960]  logical sense for me to put spare slippers I would keep them in the box
[13:55.960 --> 14:01.700]  now if I if I go ahead and do this and I don't find the pair that I own which are
[14:01.700 --> 14:06.440]  obviously somewhere in the house they must be in the house there's it's you
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.680]  could like unless you unless someone is gaslighting you your slippers are in the
[14:10.680 --> 14:13.840]  house you don't you've already stipulated you do not go outside and
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.040]  nope and even if I did I'd come home with them right I think I would remember
[14:18.040 --> 14:21.320]  coming home barefoot oh you wouldn't like leave them at a pizza coffee or
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.440]  something no I don't think so you wouldn't take them off you're not the
[14:25.440 --> 14:28.320]  kind of person that takes off your shoes in public right now no I can't remember
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.360]  the last time I took off my shoes public other you know other than I guess to buy
[14:32.360 --> 14:35.760]  shoes that should be in the federal code and don't don't put your feet up on the
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.000]  bulkhead in the plane don't do that nobody wants to see your feet oh man
[14:41.160 --> 14:45.480]  don't do that you know do you follow this guide you ever hear of him Tom
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.400]  Nichols is a sort of in it you probably don't because he's sort of a sports guy
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.760]  no he's a Trump guy politics he's like he's a good follow on Twitter if you do
[14:56.760 --> 15:00.920]  want to follow he's one of these Republicans who's always a radio free
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.680]  Tom yeah and he's always been contrary to Trump you know and very consistent on
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.520]  it he teaches it like the Naval War College he's a Russian foreign policy
[15:09.520 --> 15:15.040]  expert but anyway his pet peeve in life is people who take their shoes off on
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.480]  airports and so people send him pictures people know it bothers them and they you
[15:20.480 --> 15:23.680]  know some you know somebody who follows him gets on a plane and sees it you know
[15:23.680 --> 15:30.480]  they they'll send them a picture I like to be comfortable don't criticize me
[15:30.480 --> 15:33.840]  like you know what I like to not be nauseated for four and a half hours oh
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.000]  the people who do it in that front row but I'm saying they put the old look at
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  me I pop for you know Delta Plus and now I'm gonna I'm gonna put my bare feet on
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.160]  the bulkhead don't do that and it makes you really makes you really wonder about
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.840]  it really turn it turns your tummy a little bit okay here's my here's my
[15:49.840 --> 15:53.000]  confession to you and I'm not proud of this I hope not a lot of people will
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  listen to this but for a long time my secret shame in some ways I don't like
[15:58.000 --> 16:04.400]  talk about it is that um I'll wear Crocs okay look look look I like to be
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.440]  comfortable and and so what I'll do my house shoes in the Japanese style is I
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.280]  walk around in Crocs now let me let me be super clear these are not the kind I
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.080]  think I feel like when I met your son in New Zealand maybe he was wearing Crocs
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.680]  very that's a very that's a very high possibility but here's the thing and
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.120]  that's when you give him in a funny color and they have holes in them and
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.560]  then you put pins on them and stuff like that no I'm a grown man I'm 53 years old
[16:27.560 --> 16:33.000]  and I have what are called professional Crocs I have that's funny how I have the
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.040]  kind of Crocs that a professional would wear like let's say it's somebody who's
[16:36.040 --> 16:41.200]  a medical professional and so they're they're very rugged and they're really
[16:41.200 --> 16:44.920]  quite handsome and if if I were to drop a hypodermic needle I would not be
[16:44.920 --> 16:47.400]  instantly killed because the whole there's a hole in my shoes and in a
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.560]  hospital really no I have professional Crocs now what I want okay so let's get
[16:51.560 --> 16:54.920]  that out of the way now what I want to share with you the minute that you
[16:54.920 --> 17:02.360]  mentioned open back shoes I thought of a fact that I learned in 2019 so Crocs if
[17:02.360 --> 17:05.640]  you've ever seen a pair of Crocs and you probably have you know most people wear
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.840]  them like a like a like a an open back clog and you walk around you may I don't
[17:10.840 --> 17:14.200]  know if you've noticed that there's like a little strap that flips over then goes
[17:14.200 --> 17:16.880]  around the back of your ankle yeah you know what that's called
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.360]  nope sport mode sport mode sport mode is that official that's official Crocs
[17:22.360 --> 17:27.600]  lingo don't follow the trades but I'm pretty sure it's called sport mode and
[17:27.600 --> 17:33.000]  then you really need to start tearing ass and your professional clocks you go
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.160]  into sport mode see that's what it's a good you know I I'm not gonna lie to
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.200]  Marilyn I wouldn't wear Crocs personally but but to each his own I don't pass
[17:42.200 --> 17:44.640]  judgment and their profession that I mentioned that they're professional
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.120]  Crocs yes yeah well I get it but I I do I do appreciate the sport mode I feel
[17:49.120 --> 17:52.840]  like that it solves the same problem that the back of the slipper that I'm
[17:52.840 --> 17:57.040]  hundred percent keeps keeps it on but it doesn't else it's not like putting on a
[17:57.040 --> 18:00.320]  pair of shoes you know that's the thing if you got to bend over they're not
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.920]  right well here's my okay so here's my question I'll make this really fast so
[18:04.920 --> 18:07.720]  the the one-mile slipper I once again I really want to thank everybody at Mac
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.720]  well then um the one-mile slipper when I sponsor them not okay are you sure I'm
[18:13.720 --> 18:16.640]  100% sure that they are not sponsoring this it's just gonna be one of those
[18:16.640 --> 18:19.120]  Teen Vogue things we were eventually gonna have to take it down because it's
[18:19.120 --> 18:26.400]  monster content I was in the CMS we accidentally hit the button sorry my bad
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.800]  so my question to you is given that your knowledge of your shoe shot shoe size
[18:30.800 --> 18:34.560]  and the thing is the size you're working in I'm a small man I'm a little guy I'm
[18:34.560 --> 18:37.880]  like a Dan Benjamin size guy I would say you're right in the middle what you say
[18:37.880 --> 18:41.360]  you take a nine a nine and a half a ten I think just about the average American
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.300]  height which makes me seem short but you know our lifts and my Crocs which are
[18:45.300 --> 18:48.920]  professional so my question to you is given what you know about your shoe size
[18:48.920 --> 18:52.400]  and you'll see this sometimes not like a Zappos or whatever and and when people
[18:52.400 --> 18:56.280]  have the rate is one of the few things where they do a multifaceted approach to
[18:56.280 --> 18:59.700]  reviews if you know me you know how frustrating I find it there's only one
[18:59.700 --> 19:03.880]  facet to reviews which is number of stars yeah so stupid we talk about this
[19:03.880 --> 19:07.440]  on rectus all with us or Q so all the time how frustrating that is people are
[19:07.440 --> 19:11.760]  mad that pet sounds by the Beach Boys got released again and so they leave a
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.040]  bad review because they're mad and it's like wait a minute you just gave a one
[19:15.040 --> 19:20.560]  star pet what so what you'll see is one of the facets where they say true to fit
[19:20.560 --> 19:23.400]  is it true to fit and then you give a number of stars based on whether you
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.480]  think it's true to fit does it feel too big does it feel too little given what
[19:26.480 --> 19:31.360]  you know about your shoe size and you're in a range that's much broader than mine
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.920]  do you feel like these are true to fit should I be what I'm asking you is I
[19:35.920 --> 19:40.440]  don't think I want to go it doesn't make sense to me if I'm on the on the edge of
[19:40.440 --> 19:45.160]  ten like the Stevie Nicks song it doesn't make sense to me to go into the
[19:45.160 --> 19:49.440]  ten to thirteen yeah if I'm Mike could slide by I I think if you were gonna buy
[19:49.440 --> 19:53.140]  a pair of these I would get that medium that's a nine to ten I would because I
[19:53.140 --> 19:57.420]  can't imagine it if you if they fit me as well as they do I feel like you'd be
[19:57.420 --> 20:00.400]  you'd be it would be like you're wearing your dad's slippers you know what I mean
[20:00.400 --> 20:04.600]  little boy with with yeah he passed a long time ago is it true Navy or true
[20:04.600 --> 20:08.880]  black that I'm working with here should I get true Navy's kind of handsome yeah
[20:08.880 --> 20:14.320]  I think you get used you get true black no no I went I went the gray one with a
[20:14.320 --> 20:17.400]  chart like a charcoal yeah sure all I see is true Navy and true black well
[20:17.400 --> 20:20.520]  just just so we don't know maybe I got these other maybe I maybe I did get the
[20:20.520 --> 20:24.580]  black I'm gonna go with my did not really maybe I hate those fake Navy's
[20:24.580 --> 20:28.560]  I'm gonna go a true Navy in medium and I'm adding to cart oh no I guess you're
[20:28.560 --> 20:33.280]  right I guess I did get the black I don't know maybe they did they get rid
[20:33.280 --> 20:36.680]  of the other one will this make me happy in life John it will this finally be the
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.040]  thing where I buy the thing and it makes me happy in life do you like slippers I
[20:41.040 --> 20:48.200]  mean I'm open what kind of work does he do um anyway um thanks one last time

[24:29.480 --> 24:32.440]  sit on it cuz the my concern I have to be honest with you my concern this is
[24:32.440 --> 24:35.840]  your show my concern is that you will find these today if you don't find these
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.360]  today you're being gaslighted by somebody I'm guessing probably your wife
[24:38.360 --> 24:44.040]  but if you do find them I don't want you to sit on this John don't wait this
[24:44.040 --> 24:49.560]  happened to me this happened to me with I want to say the Nike dynasty oh and
[24:49.560 --> 24:52.440]  you know I just suddenly occurred to me what if what if the listeners of the
[24:52.440 --> 24:58.680]  show what if there's a run on them oh geez Louise I got you know I had not
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.600]  even occur oh no this is this is why you always got it by the domain name right
[25:02.600 --> 25:07.080]  off the dome you guys go get it oh man is there okay so if it's not Amy Jane
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.440]  is there a chance the contractor stole your slippers be honest maybe they just
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.640]  took one of them and hid the other one it's you know that's if you has to be a
[25:15.640 --> 25:19.840]  possibility you know I wouldn't rule it out Sherlock I would I would go don't
[25:19.840 --> 25:22.840]  sit on this John get some more and you know what treat yourself you go to you
[25:22.840 --> 25:26.160]  go to Zappos I don't want to thank Zappos you go to Zappos are similar and
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.320]  you pick you up some professional Crocs now here's my tip you'll be able to use
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.080]  this in sports mode the other nice thing about the Croc is you want to get them a
[25:34.080 --> 25:38.400]  little big you don't want them to be too tight but just give them a spin maybe
[25:38.400 --> 25:41.760]  you use them for shower shoes you take off your slippers put on your or if you
[25:41.760 --> 25:45.280]  want to do a shift at the hospital now you have a professional shoe it's a
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.580]  Croc hey you know what I often think about this just slippers have me
[25:50.580 --> 25:55.560]  thinking about it but that the purchases in my life that dollar for dollar I
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.560]  would consider the best purchases I've ever made some of them are big ticket
[26:00.560 --> 26:07.720]  items we bought a we bought an Acura back in 2006 and still as our car we
[26:07.720 --> 26:12.240]  don't really do a lot of driving now we what is 13 years old dollar for dollar
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.640]  one of the best purchases we've ever made just the car just runs it never
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.240]  gives us any trouble couldn't be better also sometimes it'll be something that I
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.960]  spend you know like a buck or two on now look I put this link there in the in the
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.240]  iMessage for you it's a little coffee filter you you were talking about this

[27:32.400 --> 27:35.680]  over the edge you know and then they get in your coffee that's no way to live
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.920]  it's no way to live anyway I bought this thing mine looks exactly like this it is
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.160]  also black it is just a piece of plastic this one on Amazon is $13 which seems
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.440]  ridiculously if you want a number four they make you buy the pot with it yeah
[27:50.440 --> 27:54.560]  this is a number this link is a number two yeah but if you want the number four
[27:54.560 --> 27:58.960]  which is the baller model I think they I think they make you buy a pot with it
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.400]  now you know you got a pot you're not using I like a pot I put it right in the
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.000]  mug I'm gonna drink it now I don't want it later you know and some people it's
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.880]  the same style of making coffee that the the kenex does and you know that's very
[28:10.880 --> 28:13.440]  you know I don't know those things are like 100 bucks or something and they're
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.160]  very nice little cute little cute for me I've I got this at a local coffee shop
[28:18.160 --> 28:24.080]  here in Philadelphia and it was absolutely without question either 1998
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.840]  or 1999 so we're talking I've had this thing for 20 years I have made I was
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.040]  thinking about it and I convinced I only spent about four bucks on it it and it
[28:34.040 --> 28:38.120]  looks like four bucks right it's just a little piece of PVC plastic right yeah
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.560]  I've made I'm trying to think how much coffee I've made for myself with this
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.360]  exact same thing in 20 years that's gonna make you feel old if you think
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.540]  about it too much but these do they last forever they're fantastic I feel like I
[28:49.540 --> 28:54.400]  make coffee at least 300 times a year I mean maybe there's 60 days where I either
[28:54.400 --> 28:57.700]  are you the primary coffee maker in your home oh Amy doesn't really drink coffee
[28:57.700 --> 29:02.000]  she'll show so you you are literally mr. coffee she will drink coffee related
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.600]  beverages you know like you know like get some kind of frappuccino or some
[29:06.600 --> 29:09.760]  kind of thing if she's out and about and in the summertime she often enjoys a
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.600]  cold brew coffee love an iced coffee I love an iced coffee when whoever we're
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.200]  whenever we are in New England where they got donkey donuts you go in and get
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.800]  you you is hot in the summertime you go on the beach you get you one of those
[29:21.800 --> 29:29.080]  large large ass iced coffees Oh brother 20 years figure 300 times a year I make
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.000]  coffee that's 6,000 times I've made coffee with this thing hmm and I think I
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.440]  spent four bucks on it and it still looks Brett looks as good as new there's
[29:38.440 --> 29:41.840]  so many things like that I mean like Syracuse as always because he's how he
[29:41.840 --> 29:45.800]  is is on this ongoing quest to find the spatula that he wants oh I know greater
[29:45.800 --> 29:50.280]  that he wants and and that's the thing though is like we have this one
[29:50.280 --> 29:55.160]  Cuisinart like I say spoon but it's like a serving spoon that we accidentally
[29:55.160 --> 30:00.920]  stole from a potluck at my kids preschool and we I still use it every
[30:00.920 --> 30:05.440]  single day and you gotta try this is what's this it's the slippers all over
[30:05.440 --> 30:09.680]  again you don't want to be without when once you've bonded with your coffee
[30:09.680 --> 30:14.200]  dingus I sent you the clever coffee drip or large 18 ounces and I'll tell you what
[30:14.200 --> 30:17.280]  I love about this it's it's very similar to here now I'm not trying to upgrade
[30:17.280 --> 30:20.400]  you here you're already gonna be blowing a lot of dough on Crocs today so the
[30:20.400 --> 30:23.480]  clever coffee drip or large 18 ounces you put you a number four in there and
[30:23.480 --> 30:27.080]  you know what there's a reason those crimps are on there people use them you
[30:27.080 --> 30:30.480]  fold over the crimp fold the crimp on the bottom fold the crimp on the side I
[30:30.480 --> 30:34.200]  know you don't think you need it that that's privilege you need to fold the
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.720]  crimps you put it into the dingus you put in your coffee okay now it comes
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.320]  with this little coaster that you put it on you don't really need it but it is
[30:43.320 --> 30:47.000]  hygienic right now I mean you put in your coffee and now here's what you're
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.520]  gonna do you're gonna pour you don't have to be a weirdo about this you're
[30:50.520 --> 30:54.040]  gonna pour I do boiling water and from a Cuisinart pot I think you'd a
[30:54.040 --> 30:58.280]  Cuisinart and then you very slowly should take you almost 30 seconds to
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.440]  pour it in and you're stirring stirring stirring if you have good coffee it's
[31:03.440 --> 31:07.320]  gonna get a little foamy and then when it's these that's it for a while you
[31:07.320 --> 31:10.960]  can put the lid on if you're fancy then you know what you do you put that right
[31:10.960 --> 31:15.360]  onto your mug it accommodates most mug sizes and then that little plunger goes
[31:15.360 --> 31:21.440]  boop gets pushed up and now your coffee is is going it's had time to sit there
[31:21.440 --> 31:24.400]  and bloom as they say that's what makes the foam is called blooming that's how
[31:24.400 --> 31:27.960]  you know if it's fresh that goes into your mug and then you rinse it out rinse
[31:27.960 --> 31:31.280]  it out don't wait don't don't sit on that either rinse this get the crocs and
[31:31.280 --> 31:35.720]  rinse this out don't wait it will get filmy and if you try to use a cleaner on
[31:35.720 --> 31:39.360]  it you might strip it yeah that's why I like the black one and then you can't
[31:39.360 --> 31:42.600]  really stain the black one but see this clear one to me looks like something
[31:42.600 --> 31:46.440]  that would get stained it's so there's so many like wonderful small pleasures
[31:46.440 --> 31:49.480]  in life I was trying to think of things like this for me and like apart from the
[31:49.480 --> 31:52.400]  Cuisinart thing we stole again I'm so sorry to my daughter's preschool
[31:52.400 --> 31:56.000]  cooperative preschool that we stole that that was wrong of us not to return I owe
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.960]  you an amends is it stealing if it was an accident I don't think it's stealing
[31:59.960 --> 32:04.200]  unless it's intentional that is that's in the federal kind of what's the
[32:04.200 --> 32:08.520]  obligation to you know there's some that's a that is a fantastic your wife
[32:08.520 --> 32:11.480]  if memory serves your wife as a lawyer you should ask her I think the term they
[32:11.480 --> 32:15.360]  use is malice aforethought did you intend to steal the Cuisinart spoon at
[32:15.360 --> 32:19.080]  the playmates cooperative preschool it is called playmates by the way and and
[32:19.080 --> 32:23.480]  so anyway there are so many joys the first one that copped in my mind of
[32:23.480 --> 32:27.440]  course are the new air pods which are costly they don't fit your model of
[32:27.440 --> 32:32.640]  being you know potentially uncoastly but it's so true there's so much crap that
[32:32.640 --> 32:36.720]  you can blow money on in this life that will not make you happy right and
[32:36.720 --> 32:39.960]  there's so much stuff where like you find yourself clinging to this thing
[32:39.960 --> 32:44.160]  that actually really works it I mean I'll tell you what man invest invest in
[32:44.160 --> 32:50.080]  some good screwdrivers you can get a set of screwdrivers on this I know this
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.960]  sounds random right but if you go I can I'll send you a link you can go and get
[32:53.960 --> 32:58.160]  this set of screwdrivers you can have it delivered in two hours to your house and
[32:58.160 --> 33:04.080]  that those screwdrivers are gonna they're so sharp well made they don't
[33:04.080 --> 33:06.640]  pop like if you're a clown in the basement trying to strangle a guy it's
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.840]  not gonna break on you like these are really nice screwdrivers and then what
[33:09.840 --> 33:15.720]  you do is you get you a magnetizer D magnetizer and that's this thing right
[33:15.720 --> 33:18.440]  here you ever have one of these no I don't think you run your screwdriver
[33:18.440 --> 33:22.040]  almost like you're honing a knife you run the end of your screwdriver through
[33:22.040 --> 33:28.240]  the magnetizer and it magnetizes what kind of black magic is that you could
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.400]  just turn you're turning a non magnetic screwdriver into a temporarily magnetic
[33:32.400 --> 33:35.520]  screwdriver is well you're saying you can hang on to your slippers cuz then
[33:35.520 --> 33:39.800]  over here on the other side is a D magnetizer and you can D mag if you
[33:39.800 --> 33:43.160]  chose to if you decide you don't want to live the magnetic screwdriver lifestyle
[33:43.160 --> 33:48.640]  then you go over here real creepy like and then that takes the magnet off the
[33:48.640 --> 33:51.680]  off the blade called blades on a screwdriver here's what I'm telling you
[33:51.680 --> 33:57.960]  though don't suffer with using a dime on a standard head don't suffer with with
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.920]  using like a leather man that you stole from the preschool you know if you're
[34:02.920 --> 34:05.960]  gonna have a goat roll Phillips head if you're gonna be changed you're gonna be
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.280]  changing the batteries on your ring doorbell you're gonna want a really
[34:09.280 --> 34:13.040]  sharp screwdriver because gravity is working against you John and you want
[34:13.040 --> 34:16.400]  them the magnetic tip obviously I mean I shouldn't have to spell it out but
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.560]  that's that's that's because gravity yeah it keeps the screw you don't you
[34:20.560 --> 34:23.680]  don't lose the screw it'll just stay connected to the tip of the screwdriver
[34:23.680 --> 34:28.320]  latest president I sent to John Sirakusa I hope he doesn't mind me saying I just
[34:28.320 --> 34:31.320]  sent him a headlamp because I think he needed a headlamp he's been you know
[34:31.320 --> 34:33.840]  he's been preparing the way for his computer it spends a lot of his back
[34:33.840 --> 34:38.160]  worrying about his cables I just I'm telling you get a headlamp and and I'll
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.920]  tell you what I told John Sirakusa once it's like having a space pen it's like
[34:42.920 --> 34:47.840]  it's like having a field notes once you have a headlamp you first you go why
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.040]  would I need a head headlamp I'm not I'm not a minor I'm not a minor or like I'm
[34:53.040 --> 34:57.960]  not like like a peeping Tom why would I need this no well guess what once you
[34:57.960 --> 35:01.360]  got it you're gonna find ways to use it take it out the trash of course you're
[35:01.360 --> 35:04.320]  gonna put on your headlamp I take off your slippers and put on something
[35:04.320 --> 35:09.280]  different all right that's let's get uncomfortable here let's do anything
[35:09.280 --> 35:11.760]  else about slippers that I should know about I've known those those will be
[35:11.760 --> 35:15.000]  coming from Nashville any day now no that's it that's it I'm telling them I'm
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.560]  done with slippers close the book 36 minutes yeah I think we got to talk
[35:21.560 --> 35:28.800]  about this DOJ versus Apple iPhone encryption thing mm-hmm which it really
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.080]  really feels like deja vu all over again right it feels like and I like looked it
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.720]  up like to refresh my memory about the San Bernardino which I always spell
[35:38.720 --> 35:43.120]  wrong by the way I always want to spell it San Bernardino there's like a
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.520]  nickname it seems like his name is st. Bernard like Bernardino yeah there's an
[35:47.520 --> 35:51.520]  extra are in there that I that was it wasn't that around Christmas one year yeah
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.040]  I was like a disgruntled government where I mean yeah he came in well yeah
[35:55.040 --> 35:58.840]  he came in and again I don't mean to make light of it but he know that the
[35:58.840 --> 36:02.160]  horrible horrible I think it was a man and a woman they came in and shot up a
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.360]  Christmas party or something like that I do believe it was a holiday party but
[36:06.360 --> 36:10.720]  anyway I do think I if if I may be so bold I would just say for those of you
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.120]  if you are a listener from the San Bernardino area I would I would
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.800]  consider maybe going to a city hall meeting and suggesting that that the
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.520]  city removed that are you know think about it oh okay fool me once you know
[36:24.520 --> 36:31.960]  shame on shame on you yeah but anyway it's so horrible but man what a what a
[36:31.960 --> 36:36.840]  dilly of a pickle this puts Apple in so with the San Bernardino case it was
[36:36.840 --> 36:41.920]  still the Obama administration and and what they wanted and they could the FBI
[36:41.920 --> 36:45.360]  came out of that looking really bad I kind of forgot how it ended but
[36:45.360 --> 36:55.000]  basically with an encrypted iPhone you there's no magic way to decrypt it Apple
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.160]  does you can't just go to the Genius Bar and you know they do something and all
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.600]  of a sudden you're in the phone it used to work that way right in the old days
[37:02.600 --> 37:09.640]  it was just you know you know your your passcode was sort of a suggestion not
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.360]  really but they had a big red button that they could click to override it
[37:13.360 --> 37:16.640]  yeah don't you remember I remember like troubleshooting phones you could do it
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.600]  like with iTunes you could just connect an iPhone to iTunes and like I forget
[37:20.600 --> 37:23.300]  if you could get the access the contents but you could at least put a new
[37:23.300 --> 37:28.920]  operating system on it anyway what the government wanted Apple to do was
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.480]  because the other thing is there's there's the the 10 guests lock and if
[37:34.480 --> 37:40.160]  you can and right after you make five guesses that are wrong it'll lock you
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.480]  out for 30 seconds or something like that and then your next guess is wrong
[37:43.480 --> 37:46.880]  you're locked out for five minutes and then by the time you get to the tenth
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.200]  bad guess you can optionally have your phone configured to like erase itself
[37:53.200 --> 37:56.920]  but in the meantime even if you hand it to like a baby to play with if they get
[37:56.920 --> 38:00.160]  to eight I don't know I don't know the math on this but like it can be an
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.040]  astronomically yeah long wait time that you're just there's they can't fix that
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.800]  they don't want to be able to fix that right so what they what the government
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.160]  wanted Apple to do was to create a new version of opera of iOS just for them
[38:14.160 --> 38:20.760]  that they would install on this locked phone that would remove that passcode
[38:20.760 --> 38:26.320]  checking and so that on this you know suspects phone then they could hook it
[38:26.320 --> 38:32.240]  up to one of those robots that that cycles through passcode guesses and you
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.200]  know get into the phone that way and Apple's response was one of us that they
[38:37.200 --> 38:40.440]  don't you know it it seemed like an inner it's an interesting technical
[38:40.440 --> 38:44.640]  dilemma that it seems like that was possible it was something Apple could do
[38:44.640 --> 38:49.000]  but it was something Apple did not want to do they did not want to create a
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.440]  version of iOS that was in any way less secure than the regular one it's just
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.480]  you know it's like taking your slippers outside you just don't want to break the
[38:57.480 --> 39:02.920]  seal on ever having you know what a weird ask it would be like you know and
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.120]  it's time to use an overused phrase it is actually a dangerous precedent to set
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.880]  right in my at least in my in my view I'm not I don't mean to sound like I'm
[39:10.880 --> 39:18.680]  like pro gun shootings right not really quite the opposite but like once like
[39:18.680 --> 39:21.560]  okay well and I'll have more to say when you're done with this but like yeah I
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.160]  mean like there's there's a reason that doors have blocks and like once you
[39:25.160 --> 39:29.400]  start once you give somebody the key that lets you in you are literally
[39:29.400 --> 39:33.760]  opening little well anyway with the the San Bernardino case in 2016 it turned
[39:33.760 --> 39:38.400]  out the FBI was able to get in without Apple's help through some sort of like
[39:38.400 --> 39:41.720]  celebrator yeah exactly I don't know if it was so they just did on the love
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.680]  Parnas phone I think yeah maybe there's a couple of these companies I know a
[39:46.680 --> 39:49.500]  couple of the company is in their company Israel the one that are all the
[39:49.500 --> 39:54.660]  sheriff's by yeah and it's supposedly you know like the the Cadillac of iPhone
[39:54.660 --> 39:59.600]  crackers so they got in without Apple's help and just out of curiosity are they
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.400]  using exploits to do that or what I guess what is honestly don't know I
[40:03.400 --> 40:07.240]  think that I think I'm fascinated by it and whenever I see a news story about it
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.840]  I'm always left thirsting desperately for tell me how this happened how it
[40:12.840 --> 40:15.800]  what is this something I can defend against should I be worried about it I
[40:15.800 --> 40:19.080]  want the companies to tell me how they're doing this but I also as we
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.760]  mentioned in text a little bit I would like also I would love it if Apple got
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.880]  to a point where they were comfortable articulating yeah what it is that there
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.620]  is that they can and can't do will and won't do so I if they literally can't do
[40:31.620 --> 40:34.240]  it I would like to know what they literally can't do I think it's a
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.400]  multi-factor I think one of the factors is that a lot of the reporters who are
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.440]  writing about this for mainstream publications you know like the New York
[40:41.440 --> 40:46.480]  Times or the Washington Post that they themselves aren't curious about the
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.120]  technical details like to them it's good enough to know that the government wants
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.480]  to quote get into the phone you know and and that's it they don't need the
[40:53.480 --> 40:56.520]  specifications of the battering ram they just want to be able to use it I also
[40:56.520 --> 41:02.480]  think that the companies like celebrate that do this it's in their interest not
[41:02.480 --> 41:07.280]  to disclose how they do it you know they obviously are keenly aware of the exact
[41:07.280 --> 41:12.120]  technical details of how how they're doing it but they don't want to let it
[41:12.120 --> 41:18.840]  out because you know it's competition and I guess you know it's the equivalent
[41:18.840 --> 41:22.200]  of a trade secret probably right and it's a cat-and-mouse game with Apple
[41:22.200 --> 41:26.120]  where when Apple discovers one of these things you know one of these exploits
[41:26.120 --> 41:33.600]  that lets them get in they close it as best they if they can you know it Apple
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.680]  considers them all security vulnerabilities whether it's criminals
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.840]  who are using them to get into a phone or whether it's law enforcement who are
[41:41.840 --> 41:46.360]  trying to get into a phone to gather evidence Apple just considered all Apple
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.880]  sees that it's a security hole so anyway now in this Pensacola flace shooter this
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.600]  guy shut up a Navy Yard so he's apparently got two phones I don't know
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.800]  if he's like a day phone night phone I don't know but there's a couple of
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.360]  phones the the FBI wants to get in they apparently can't get in whatever they
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.680]  did the last time isn't letting them in and they want Apple to help and a lady
[42:12.680 --> 42:20.080]  from the FBI wrote a letter an open letter to Tim Cook and and now the
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.400]  Attorney General in United States this William Barr fellow it's quite a
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.000]  ballplayer yeah I'm starting to think he may not be entirely on the up-and-up to
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.800]  be honest but that's it's neither here I mean let's let's not go crazy but he
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.440]  definitely seems in his own way some but he's publicly sure whose side he's on
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.680]  he was at some kind of press event and and you know at a lectern and and
[42:43.680 --> 42:52.320]  publicly called on on Apple and Apple Tim Apple to let him in it's it seems to
[42:52.320 --> 42:58.000]  me and I've talked to some people you know I haven't talked to anybody like
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.800]  high-level at Apple but it seems to me that basically I believe Apple doesn't
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.600]  even really know what the government wants them to do that that help us get
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.940]  into the phone is the level of detail that the Department of Justice has given
[43:14.940 --> 43:19.840]  them so far it's just just yada yada yada it's just dot dot dot you know and
[43:19.840 --> 43:25.480]  I think that it's it's just a facile is am I pronouncing that word right facile
[43:25.480 --> 43:33.320]  facile facile I think it's just a very facile superficial assumption that and I
[43:33.320 --> 43:37.680]  even saw somebody on TV saying this that of course Apple can you do you really
[43:37.680 --> 43:40.960]  think it's you know somebody was saying like it the gist of the argument was do
[43:40.960 --> 43:43.320]  you really think that Apple's Apple's holding out that they're being
[43:43.320 --> 43:46.680]  disingenuous about the ability to do this do you really think that the
[43:46.680 --> 43:51.000]  company that has total control over the phone and designs every component and it
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.120]  has hundred billion dollars in the bank that they can't get into a phone I mean
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.560]  that is the skeleton key for every argument is well they've got all this
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.080]  money of course they can do literally anything it's like well that's not how
[44:04.080 --> 44:10.400]  money or companies work it you know I I get that that might be it's not an
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.180]  unreasonable solution right like I I think like you know talking about like
[44:15.180 --> 44:19.740]  cars and stuff like that like if you know if you take your car in for
[44:19.740 --> 44:26.480]  service and the the dashboard is giving you like hey you know there's a b2 check
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.320]  engine error and you don't know what this bb2 is you take it into the car
[44:31.320 --> 44:36.180]  dealer you just assume that that they know how to sticks you know something in
[44:36.180 --> 44:40.200]  that diagnostic port and reset it right you just assume that they can get in I
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.160]  can see how you might assume that Apple can get into a phone but they've really
[44:44.160 --> 44:48.660]  designed it not to be I really don't think that they have the capability that
[44:48.660 --> 44:54.840]  they're being asked to do I well I'll say on the thing I'm sure of is that I
[44:54.840 --> 45:01.120]  hope that's the case the thing I'm less sure of is if it is the case and you
[45:01.120 --> 45:06.640]  first of all I mean there's there's the the experience of a modern Apple store
[45:06.640 --> 45:09.620]  visit there's some commonalities one thing is you will interact with no
[45:09.620 --> 45:15.160]  fewer than seven people in red shirts who ask you it's why you're there what's
[45:15.160 --> 45:20.080]  happening it's a complicated place the other thing is a surpassing amount of
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.560]  time there will be somebody there often an older person who is asking for help
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.200]  because they don't know their password they lost their password something
[45:28.200 --> 45:33.220]  something came along and you know regardless of however that happened you
[45:33.220 --> 45:38.800]  will probably at some point in your Apple store visit get to see a very sad
[45:38.800 --> 45:43.400]  thing which is when the Apple employee at the store has to tell them I don't
[45:43.400 --> 45:46.720]  have a way to do that like here or here are your options for doing that it's
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.400]  really almost it becomes I feel like almost more like counseling which is
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.280]  like oh my god you know all my grandparents all my grandkids photos
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.720]  were on this what do I do what's like well back up last year yeah you know but
[45:57.720 --> 46:02.360]  like it's everybody's been through it my mom I remember my mom lost her her
[46:02.360 --> 46:08.340]  visor in the 2000s and this is back before we had all well not all some of
[46:08.340 --> 46:14.680]  us had really gotten gotten the gospel about backup and you know and let's be
[46:14.680 --> 46:17.100]  honest I mean like you're talking about you're talking about the handspring
[46:17.100 --> 46:21.600]  visor handspring visor that had all I mean she that was her her life that was
[46:21.600 --> 46:26.160]  had become her contact book it was and it was gone gone daddy gone so okay on
[46:26.160 --> 46:30.680]  the one hand we've all had that and we've all certainly I mean I have I have
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.400]  my frustrations with how this stuff works I mean I feel like iOS 13 in so
[46:35.400 --> 46:39.840]  many ways is a huge leap forward having that integrated password management
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.000]  letting me use one password to get into stuff I won't say there's no excuse for
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.920]  getting better at this stuff but there's fewer great excuses you still run into
[46:47.920 --> 46:52.440]  it where you will occasionally have to put in a really crazy password you get
[46:52.440 --> 46:56.160]  this with your bank sites all the security theater sites but let's just
[46:56.160 --> 46:59.480]  say for what it's worth that I know your listeners know this is that things
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.520]  things have gotten a lot better on that front it's not something that everybody
[47:04.520 --> 47:07.320]  knows how to do and you see that when you're at the Apple store and that comes
[47:07.320 --> 47:12.840]  along I I'm I would put something in the note to share which is a really good CGP
[47:12.840 --> 47:17.720]  gray video love his stuff and what is the name of the video it's a very short
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.840]  video like his videos are and it is called should all locks have keys
[47:22.840 --> 47:27.720]  phones castles encryption in you and I'm gonna be somewhat unintentionally
[47:27.720 --> 47:32.040]  probably cribbing some of what he said there or what what anybody says anywhere
[47:32.040 --> 47:36.480]  which is the when we talk about the precedents for these things I don't
[47:36.480 --> 47:41.200]  think you you not what's your you know you love that Upton Sinclair quote about
[47:41.200 --> 47:48.880]  hard actually I finally wrote it down so that I would always get it right and the
[47:48.880 --> 47:55.240]  quote is right here okay stacker Pentecost Nick Fury yes he said I used
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.800]  to I used to say to our audiences it is difficult to get a man to understand
[47:58.800 --> 48:04.720]  something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it um and and I
[48:04.720 --> 48:08.360]  this is not I'm just I'm just stating a fact here like even if you set aside
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.680]  confirmation bias even if you set aside things like the potential for things
[48:12.680 --> 48:20.120]  like corruption or you know for bad faith it's the the police or law
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.120]  enforcement in general has a job to do and they are going to like any of us
[48:25.120 --> 48:31.800]  seek out the things that make their job less difficult and try to reject or
[48:31.800 --> 48:35.840]  amend the the things you know they're gonna they're gonna want to try to find
[48:35.840 --> 48:38.720]  the things that let them do what they need to do there's not going to be at
[48:38.720 --> 48:41.200]  the in the same way that there's no there's gonna be very few presidents
[48:41.200 --> 48:44.680]  that come along and say wow the creep in the amount of executive power is really
[48:44.680 --> 48:48.320]  out of hand to take some of my power away like that that's not how life
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.400]  works and so like my concern that I don't mean to be all Fudd about this my
[48:53.400 --> 48:59.000]  concern is that like you can always come up with a problem or a folk devil
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.440]  du jour that will allow you to make a case to the public that there needs to
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.800]  be a fewer fewer rights and a more permissive approach toward letting
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.200]  people in positions of authority get more power and use it and I don't think
[49:14.200 --> 49:18.400]  that's particular to the FBI I don't think that's particular to anybody a
[49:18.400 --> 49:25.280]  school principal will follow that same idea but it's just that well it used to
[49:25.280 --> 49:31.600]  be terrorism and then recently it's become pedophiles or it's shootings well
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.360]  why fix the shootings if we can get into your phone what like you're I
[49:36.360 --> 49:39.960]  mean what you're what you're trying to say here is like now that we have a
[49:39.960 --> 49:43.800]  precedent for doing this and everybody I mean there's nobody out there who's like
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.640]  oh yeah let's you know let's go go protect these people who are a literal danger to
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.480]  the public it's just my my concern and I might be concerned trolling here but my
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.480]  concern is that like well wait a minute doors should have locks we shouldn't let
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.920]  everybody have the key and we should in fact be suspicious of the people who
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.120]  have all the keys because what is what is their obligation to make a case for
[50:07.120 --> 50:12.000]  how that is being used and I know you don't like to get political on here but
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.320]  like there's there are laws that we come up with that end up being used primarily
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.760]  to target certain populations there's this whole class of like in San
[50:20.760 --> 50:24.720]  Francisco obviously like it's we have it's homeless problem or you get to see
[50:24.720 --> 50:29.240]  you see why is it so many black people get pulled over for speeding and then
[50:29.240 --> 50:34.000]  that that becomes like the way that you have this wedge to like further invade
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.560]  their life and I just I don't think it's pure concern trolling to say that like I
[50:39.560 --> 50:44.840]  I applaud Apple for living up to the standard the high bar that they've set
[50:44.840 --> 50:49.020]  for themselves and I don't think it's a great precedent to say well if it's a
[50:49.020 --> 50:53.520]  really super bad guy because that's not it's not just gonna be used for super
[50:53.520 --> 51:00.000]  bad guys right and once you give those keys over it's it's gonna get used for
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.280]  increasingly more trivial things until you just accept that that's part of the
[51:04.280 --> 51:08.160]  authoritarian regime that we all seem destined for right because there was
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.400]  even I forget who it was if it was the NSA or I think it was the NSA who had a
[51:13.400 --> 51:18.320]  rootkit leak out you know that they had they'd you know that the NSA is in the
[51:18.320 --> 51:25.240]  business of building their own malware to use in you know spying on foreign
[51:25.240 --> 51:30.600]  government yeah they've got all the good exploits and one of them got out you
[51:30.600 --> 51:33.840]  know and started floating around you know as we were talking about the dark
[51:33.840 --> 51:38.140]  web you know stuff like that can happen you know it there is no and the other
[51:38.140 --> 51:41.760]  thing that gets me as we as we talk around this issue in circles is it seems
[51:41.760 --> 51:47.140]  like everybody has come to the agreement now like we've we've we've not everybody
[51:47.140 --> 51:51.840]  but we've gotten most people on both sides of the issue to agree that a quote
[51:51.840 --> 51:56.600]  unquote backdoor is a bad idea and so you know you find them making this
[51:56.600 --> 52:01.520]  argument we don't want a backdoor we just want a way to get in it's like but
[52:01.520 --> 52:05.800]  a back window I mean it's the same thing right like you you're agreeing that the
[52:05.800 --> 52:09.560]  term is dangerous semantics the semantics are not the issue right it's
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.240]  it's and again I mean I'm not I mean I'm even assuming goodwill it's just that
[52:13.240 --> 52:17.160]  this is this is how it works like if you if you say well this particular nail is
[52:17.160 --> 52:20.240]  driving me crazy I need a bigger hammer you're gonna start using that on every
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.280]  nail and it's a tough spot for Apple it was it was a tough spot four years ago
[52:25.280 --> 52:31.880]  it's a tough spot now because you know they I just linked to a Bruce Schneider
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.720]  piece saying exactly what you did you know that that the new you know that
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.400]  there's always an effort to scare people into making encryption into handing over
[52:40.400 --> 52:44.880]  more of their rights and freedom in the interest of nominally being made more
[52:44.880 --> 52:48.440]  secure with the people who are meant to protect us people do have an emotional
[52:48.440 --> 52:54.520]  reaction to terrorists and pedophiles right you know these terrorists totally
[52:54.520 --> 52:58.840]  how it should be you know and they should have that react they take these
[52:58.840 --> 53:02.920]  you know they're not picking these cases randomly you know like it's not like
[53:02.920 --> 53:06.160]  it's like a test case like when you get something the Supreme Court you find the
[53:06.160 --> 53:12.080]  most sympathetic case you can to try and get a law changed right like just one
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.960]  that's always frustrated always frustrated me was that goofy shoe bomber
[53:14.960 --> 53:20.000]  back in almost 20 years ago and now my people still have to take their goddamn
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.040]  shoes off at the airport but the guy didn't he was such a he was a ding-a-ling
[53:24.040 --> 53:29.280]  he's a ding-dong he really was he he didn't even do it right no he just like
[53:29.280 --> 53:33.440]  it was like an SNL bit he just didn't succeed had like a couple of bottle
[53:33.440 --> 53:38.000]  rockets taped to his sneakers you know let's appeal Cory Doctorow here but like
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.800]  let me understand this right I can't have more than three ounces of liquid
[53:40.800 --> 53:44.840]  okay and so what do they do with the liquid that is so potentially dangerous
[53:44.840 --> 53:50.160]  they throw it in a barrel with all the other deadly liquid in the airport there
[53:50.160 --> 53:54.360]  isn't a hazmat is like 2319 and like the Monsters Inc people run in and like and
[53:54.360 --> 53:57.360]  you know and shave you and throw this into some kind of containment facility
[53:57.360 --> 54:00.600]  and blow it up off-premises oh no just throw it in there with all the other
[54:00.600 --> 54:07.200]  deadly liquids it's just on the face of it is insane yeah well you know but
[54:07.200 --> 54:10.840]  that's the average where we are and now we've got the president of the United
[54:10.840 --> 54:16.400]  States now it so apples it's on a aside from the encryption angle there's also
[54:16.400 --> 54:24.160]  the recent story of you know from a couple weeks ago where Apple invited the
[54:24.160 --> 54:29.880]  president in the United States to tour the assembly plan talking about the
[54:29.880 --> 54:33.920]  Texas facility that he personally opened that day yeah the one that they've been
[54:33.920 --> 54:39.500]  making Mac pros out for years and clearly potato potato John right and I
[54:39.500 --> 54:44.600]  wrote about this and and I I really think that I get I'm not some people
[54:44.600 --> 54:51.600]  have are so viscerally opposed to it that that they're just outraged I'm not
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.440]  outraged by Apple's willingness to do this but I do think it was and I get
[54:56.440 --> 55:02.720]  what Tim Cook was thinking I think you know mm-hmm but I do think it was a
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.160]  mistake especially mention Oscar Schindler because that's not a good
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.800]  example opening of that wonderful movie where he's whining and dining all of
[55:10.800 --> 55:13.960]  these guys that he doesn't like because that's what he needs to do to get the
[55:13.960 --> 55:19.840]  contract it's business that's what people do they have to they have to have
[55:19.840 --> 55:25.800]  relationships with people in power to at the very least keep them from harming
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.080]  their company and in an ideal circumstance give them advantages over
[55:30.080 --> 55:32.720]  other now you know I don't do impressions but I'm gonna read this is
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.200]  Trump's tweet the other night I think it's from two nights ago on this Apple
[55:36.200 --> 55:41.440]  iPhone thing mm-hmm I will try to I will try to emphasize where he's used all
[55:41.440 --> 55:48.000]  caps okay we are helping Apple all of the time on trade and so many other
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.560]  issues and yet they refuse very strongly and yet they refuse to unlock phones
[55:53.560 --> 56:00.040]  used by killers drug dealers and other violent criminal elements they will have
[56:00.040 --> 56:06.240]  to step up to the plate and help our great country with a capital C now
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.360]  exclamation mark make America great again yeah like I'm not sure we'll do
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.720]  that make America great again is part of his that that would be part of making
[56:16.720 --> 56:20.640]  America great again would be if Apple would start unlocking phones used by
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.040]  killers and drug dealers and other violent criminal elements or if he just
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.280]  tacked on a little like campaign slogan yeah why I wish I wish I had a safari
[56:28.280 --> 56:31.140]  extension that would just change every use of make America great again to
[56:31.140 --> 56:37.360]  Hakuna Matata you know pound sign Hakuna Matata it's just it seems this is like
[56:37.360 --> 56:42.120]  extremely random but this to me was easily foreseeable is he's got no
[56:42.120 --> 56:45.560]  millions of people millions of people are gonna read that and probably at
[56:45.560 --> 56:51.440]  least dozens of thousands of them are gonna be incensed that this company that
[56:51.440 --> 56:58.520]  that dear leader is helping so strongly is is working at cross purposes with the
[56:58.520 --> 57:03.280]  elected agenda does does it put Apple in a worse spot politically that they've
[57:03.280 --> 57:09.000]  that now Trump thinks that they owe him I think it does a little probably not a
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.480]  part of its part of it part of its potentially just at least just optics
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.280]  yeah so if if Apple had taken a different strategy in the Trump
[57:16.280 --> 57:21.840]  administration and at least in the last few years you know let's say from 2017
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.600]  onward once we saw it or I guess it would be 2018 onward right 2017 was the
[57:26.600 --> 57:35.440]  year he took office and kept more of an arm's length distance from him you know
[57:35.440 --> 57:40.120]  for example you don't really see you don't see Jeff Bezos palling around with
[57:40.120 --> 57:45.320]  Trump at factories and stuff like that maybe that's a bad example I don't know
[57:45.320 --> 57:50.480]  but because he well there's there is the Washington Post problem right that's
[57:50.480 --> 57:56.960]  definitely part of it but I do think I think that this sort of thing was easily
[57:56.960 --> 58:05.080]  foreseeable that now you know I think probably fairly Tim Cook saw the deal
[58:05.080 --> 58:13.800]  as transactional to that there's these tariffs that for Chinese you know
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.600]  components coming in from China that we're gonna make iPhones significantly
[58:17.600 --> 58:22.160]  more expensive and they got some kind of an accommodation in the run-up to the
[58:22.160 --> 58:25.880]  holiday season didn't they yeah they got an accommodation so that they're the
[58:25.880 --> 58:30.760]  the iPhones coming into the country are exempt from these tariffs and so they
[58:30.760 --> 58:35.560]  got that that they wanted Trump years ago when he first came into office
[58:35.560 --> 58:41.360]  pushed through the law to get the the foreign money and foreign banks you know
[58:41.360 --> 58:45.840]  like when Apple makes money selling phones in Europe they'd put it in a bank
[58:45.840 --> 58:49.040]  in Ireland and it just all right right something up there they got to
[58:49.040 --> 58:54.200]  repatriate that money at a lower tax fee or something you know that they didn't
[58:54.200 --> 59:00.200]  have to pay tax on it twice they got the tariffs listed and and I feel like he
[59:00.200 --> 59:04.880]  thought so fair's fair I'll let him you know because because he is so he appears
[59:04.880 --> 59:10.040]  to be so purely transactional right and he loves deals he's president deals so
[59:10.040 --> 59:15.920]  we'll have you know we'll have a dog and pony show at our Austin plant I'm sure
[59:15.920 --> 59:20.880]  the least surprised person in the entire world that Tim Cook or that that Donald
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.520]  Trump seemed to take credit for opening the factory was Tim Cook I mean it was
[59:25.520 --> 59:30.680]  easily predictable parade and then I feel like you know well that's it done
[59:30.680 --> 59:35.320]  it's done you know wash your hands you know now we're done with this guy we got
[59:35.320 --> 59:39.280]  our tariffs lifted we let him have a campaign event at our plant and and
[59:39.280 --> 59:48.000]  celebrate the you know the fact that Apple is making these $25,000 personal
[59:48.000 --> 59:54.480]  computer workstations in Texas but it's never you're never done with this guy
[59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.800]  right like in Trump's mind Apple Apple owes him big-time and now every every
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.520]  person every person who works with him or appears to work with him eventually
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.480]  becomes the giving tree right and you're gonna you you if you're lucky you'll be
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.380]  a stump that he can sit on eventually who was it was it David no wasn't David
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.840]  Fahrenheit was one of the folks on political Twitter that had that thread
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  but how like dozens of tweets thread that was like if you work with Donald
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.360]  Trump he will humiliate you it's just story after story of people I mean look
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.240]  at look at that that ding-a-ling Matt gates and how like just he's been so in
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.480]  the bag for all the weirdest Trump stuff for years and years and now he just he
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.600]  wasn't loyal enough right when it came to the his public statements on Iran and
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.720]  he wrote a probably ill-advised email like a dear colleague ish letter and and
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.640]  now he's tearing the guy apart he's been one of his most loyal supporters since
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.760]  this whole debacle started ever since the holiday party and but he wasn't loyal
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.440]  enough and he was not publicly loyal enough and that that drives the man
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:05.640]  insane because it now he looks he looks like he got beaten in the he looks like
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.760]  he didn't decisively um you know what never mind I don't want to get into it
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.640]  but like it really does kind of when I say the giving tree you know what I mean
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.040]  right it's like he's gonna he's gonna wiggle down he's gonna get every piece
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.480]  of bark every leaf every bit of sap he's gonna get everything he can out of all
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.720]  the people in his life and if for a second they say like oh is it cool if I
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.440]  you know get to get to keep a limb so I can hug my kid he's gonna throw him under
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.320]  the tree bus all right let's take a break here I'm gonna hold that yeah I'm
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.320]  gonna come back to sad John all right slippers come soon I'll tell you happy

[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.720]  Squarespace you get to get the word cheap cheapskate diagonally across the
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.400]  page nothing like that sites all of their sites look professionally designed
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.700]  and you can set them up and configure it regardless of your skill level no
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.680]  coding retired if required if you don't know the difference between CSS and
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.080]  JavaScript you're fine you'll be fine if you do if you know CSS if you know
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.880]  JavaScript you get in there and code away to your heart's content to
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.600]  customize it that way if you want works both ways it's completely non-technical
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.400]  though if you want it to be really intuitive easy to use tools you do it
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.680]  right in the browser itself you go to Squarespace comm you get started you
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.600]  don't need any apps or anything like that you do it all in the web browser
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.920]  you're working with your site live it's like WYSIWYG to use a word that we
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.880]  sort of have gotten away from what you see is what you get while you're
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.840]  configuring your Squarespace site you see it right there in the browser and
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.680]  then when you feel like it's ready click a button and it's there it is out in the
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.160]  world are you sure are you sure this is the case you're pretty sure about this
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.440]  right I am very sure do you need to let me ask you a question do you need to go
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.920]  in and eat at a special meta tag in the head so it works right on Internet
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.280]  Explorer is that a thing you need to do what about what about if you want your
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.640]  table to look right do you have to use separate CSS tags for every string of
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.280]  text inside of a TD is that a thing you need to know in Squarespace yeah no what
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.560]  about what about John what about what about a single pixel invisible gif that
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.080]  you how can I explain this you you make it different sizes so that things get
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.240]  spaced right on the page is that they have a way to do that in our face I
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.720]  don't believe so but I think I your sites gonna look really weird it's gonna
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.680]  look really weird on Netscape they might have a way to slice up an image map
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:10.080]  though so that you can okay and then you would go in and like identify what you
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.240]  will comma separated numbers like when you click here do this that you would do
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.280]  that in Squarespace right exactly anyway you get it if you sign up for a year you

[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.880]  I feel like the big there's a risk to Apple here and right now it feels like
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.720]  you never know with Trump and you never know with politics even Trump aside you
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:10.000]  never know what's going to catch fire in the zeitgeist right but if this
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.360]  Pensacola shooter thing continues to be an issue or if there's some other you
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:22.480]  know another high-profile crime like that and this could become part of
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.320]  Trump's stump speech you know I mean this is like he gets up there at these
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:33.160]  Red Hat rallies and and you know and and goes on and on it could turn into you
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.340]  know one of his bits is is railing against Apple and I feel like that's a
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:42.880]  legitimate risk to the company publicity wise do really you know and and how
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:49.160]  well I mean it's you know to use a an off-color famous Roger Stone joke you
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.320]  don't want to be your knight in the barrel right and when it's something
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.320]  what was a joke people say we're like every day there's somebody who's the
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.600]  star of Twitter and you don't want it to be you you don't want to become and I
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.760]  have to be honest I do this really weird thing where I will watch his rallies and
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.620]  it is it's amazing how much he says pretty much literally the same thing
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.420]  over and over well we they want to take your guns you know we help veterans with
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:14.120]  choice and you know none of it's true he doesn't understand he doesn't appear to
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.520]  actually understand how a tariff works he doesn't really he actually seems to
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.880]  really believe honestly to believe that a tariff paid by Americans on products
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:29.880]  is making money from China and that's not how tariffs do but I totally hear
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.380]  you because even if you become caught in that particular lobster trap and now
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:38.280]  you're the one that's part of his stumps stump speech and like he goes through
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.320]  this random random like sorting algorithm and lands on iPhones like you
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.240]  that will tarnish the reputation of the company just because now like he's just
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.700]  gonna be saying the name of your company a lot it's it is it is I don't know what
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.840]  you do to mitigate that risk but I cuz cuz again here's how a bully works a
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.580]  bully works you don't capitulate to a bully even it's better to just keep
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.000]  getting beat up because when you capitulate to the bully you don't get
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.240]  bullied less they don't they don't have a file of facts where they figure out
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.980]  who's compliant in their beatings and lunch money handovers that a bully will
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.160]  just keep again go back to the giving tree they're gonna whittle you down past
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:22.240]  the roots you're just gonna become a bully hole what do you what do you think
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.600]  they should do you sound like you have another thought on this what do you
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.800]  think they should be doing differently or they'd be messaging differently what
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.040]  should they agree or not agree I think that they've handled it pretty well I
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.960]  mean and they have to try to make the case as best they can that that you
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.880]  really you know and it's you know it's the harder side to argue you know the
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.380]  decide of let us in to these criminals phones is a lot easier to argue in the
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.720]  public sphere where you can just hand hand wave over all the technical aspects
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:55.120]  of it and the part where you explain how encryption true encryption really means
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.480]  that Apple can't just get into the phone because that's actually the way it's
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.560]  designed it's a tough argument to make because it is mathematically very
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.560]  complex I mean I'm I'm pretty good at math and I know how to program computers
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:17.360]  and I I get I get lost thinking about how you know serious encryption works
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.480]  like how how it's mathematically provable that if there aren't any bugs
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.680]  in the implementation that the you know it would take you know 77 years to to to
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.060]  unlock the phone or something like that or thousands of years I guess in some
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:39.080]  cases that's a hard argument to make you know especially against opponents like
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.400]  the Attorney General and the president who are making ten second arguments let
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.360]  us in these are bad people right and then you're left doing it I don't know I
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.680]  think they've handled it very well and I think it's you know to their credit
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:01.360]  they've been very very consistent about this over the years mm-hmm yeah no I
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:08.200]  don't know I I don't know it's it's that you have to there's so many trade-offs
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.080]  in life and in business there's so many things you have to do or choose to do to
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:19.560]  look a certain way but like the part of this is a an asymmetric attack in so
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.800]  many ways not in the security sense but in the sense of Apple has it's a real
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.680]  popular they make a lot of real popular products that a lot of people use but
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.800]  there aren't that many people even who love Apple a lot where how can I put
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.400]  this he's got a big stick he's got a very big stick in a very bully pulpit
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.840]  from which he can speak and that and he's got it's like I say never fight a
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.080]  frat boy because you know they do it all the time and they don't mind it and so
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.760]  in this case and yeah frat boy or a bully no offense to the wonderful
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.200]  fraternities in our country but like don't don't don't you know wrestle with
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.360]  pig and in this case like he's so game for that he seems to rarely feel more
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:11.160]  alive then when he's defending himself against some perceived slight and that
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:17.720]  is a primary reason in my opinion it's not really about economic anxiety a lot
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.880]  of people don't feel like there's somebody being a the bully for them to
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.200]  other people to like choose who like cause retribution against the perceived
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.480]  enemies in their life and and those get different names and different different
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.600]  funny nicknames but people like him because they think he's a straight
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.960]  shooter who's looking out for them or maybe it's partly that I think that I
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.680]  think we talked about this probably in previous episodes but a lot of people in
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.480]  America just did they do you see themselves as an aspirational character
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.560]  where they should be in a very different position in life except for all the
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.400]  things that are holding them back and I'm not trying to sound like Ayn Rand or
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.560]  something but there are people who like see themselves as much as being much
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:05.440]  closer to a billionaire reality star than they do to the other people in
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.360]  their town who got laid off from the mind mentally they are just there's
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.680]  something that has kept them from having that same success he speaks in a
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.360]  vernacular that really connects with them on an extremely emotional level you
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.840]  know people like you love sports and like have that association with family
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.160]  it's the same idea of like you've harmed my peace people have harmed my community
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.120]  they've harmed my family they've done all these things to me because they get
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.080]  to grow up thinking everything happens to them and so when he when he what I'm
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.240]  trying to get at here is like regardless of your feelings about Apple if you get
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.760]  in the sights of that horrible man it's gonna make your life really really rough
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.120]  I think when you wonder what is happening in the Senate what is
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.440]  happening in the Senate I think that's it I got a news they don't want to have
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.120]  their night in the barrel I got a news alert while we were recording that
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.680]  apparently apparently they're starting up the the impeachment thing in the
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.440]  Senate right now today as we speak it's all the ceremonial stuff yeah but you
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.480]  know the Roberts isn't wearing the cool robe like Rehnquist has no Rehnquist is
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.720]  more theatrical he's more of a Sondheim Sondheim man or a Gilbert and Sullivan
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.680]  man I think I really did you I was reading the other day it was for those
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:18.560]  who don't recall when when Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 the chief justice
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.840]  then at the time was William Rehnquist and he had he had recently at some point
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.320]  in the 90s he had taken to instead of just wearing a plain unadorned black
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.400]  robe he had had some gold stripes embroidered on the shoulders like some
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.160]  shit like some chevrons yeah he looks like he looks like he's a part of some
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.920]  kind of perhaps a death cult or at least a military tribunal I just found out
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.840]  though recently it was like a what to expect an impeachment reader you know
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.880]  and they were talking about that I did not realize this at the time that
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.440]  Rehnquist had tried to get his colleagues to similarly spruce up their
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:02.720]  robes and Oh John Paul Stevens said no we're not going to do that I was under
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.440]  the impression at the time that what Rehnquist wanted was for himself to die
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.920]  this actually makes me I I have a I have a knowing this story I actually have a
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.440]  better opinion of Rehnquist and his robe I thought at the time that he wanted to
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.920]  emphasize that he was the chief justice and and sort of visually elevate
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.360]  himself it's like mortar boards on a Navy officer's uniform yeah that was
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.880]  your thought on that yeah you know that you know the general has more more more
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.000]  metals on his jacket than than major you know that sort of thing he wanted to
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.800]  lord it over the other just he's looking for rank he's right for rank and the
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.720]  chief justice is a weird thing like you're not really a you know you do get
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.440]  you know some authority that the the associate justices don't but not a lot
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.600]  you know you don't get like an extra vote or something like that you know
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.760]  it's not survive right you're right he's night he's not even like the squad
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.560]  leader or the dead mother but now just more like you the administrative head
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.600]  now that I found out though that he was encouraging his colleagues to similarly
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:18.120]  spruce up their their robes I I have to say I find that charming I think that's
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:25.240]  delightful looking for a project they get on this big stern man I mean you
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.880]  know he really did you know I guess to some sense he looks like Sam the Eagle a
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.680]  little bit a little bit he looks like you know I he looks like what a post
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.000]  World War two 20th century American chief justice of the Supreme Court
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.880]  should look like you know he just had that look and I really enjoyed the fact
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.720]  that he wanted you know I'd like to bedazzle his robe and he wanted his
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:54.080]  colleagues to as well I bet it starts out simple I start but it starts out
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.720]  with like wife oh could you put some kind of like a like a silk lining in
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.440]  this something maybe a tasteful pattern you know you just keep stepping it up
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:11.880]  until you look like Steven Ruten Idiocracy with this impeachment thing I
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.880]  do think I predicted but I don't want to spend too much time on it because it's
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.800]  not a politics show but I predicted back in April that he was gonna get impeached
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.760]  and that was at a time when everybody was sort of saying on the Democrat side
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.200]  let's not impeach let's not impeach let's just you know go let's just get
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.280]  them out let's try to get him out in the election right and then this would be
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:40.920]  bad politics or whatever but I could see it coming and that was you know and then
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.840]  with this whole Ukraine thing we're just sort of fell in the Democrats lap and
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.440]  it's like how could you not impeach him oh yeah it was it was like kind of a
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.480]  four-quadrant oopsie because it had just happened there was something close to
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.680]  proof that it had happened and then there was all kinds of ways they just
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.080]  kind of they kind of bungled their ball handling in like committing to a story
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.200]  story after story that for why this was okay or didn't happen that just kept
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.480]  increasingly falling apart until as recently like I'm not sure I'm gonna put
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.040]  that much credibility in Lev Parnas I think people can go a little little
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.240]  Rachel Maddow crazy on this like I would the guy the guys obviously he's he's a
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.400]  human thumb and a very wide man I'm sure he's a very sweet man but like I would
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.640]  not put that much credibility in this guy who's on the hook for some serious
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.760]  serious stuff but we're not running out of evidence that something went
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:35.400]  seriously tits up with Ukraine yeah I do think I you know my prediction as to how
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.360]  it's gonna play out I think it's pretty pretty clear that the smart money is on
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.040]  the Republican Party sticking together and he'll he'll get acquitted now for
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.880]  those of you you know it's probably world news but you got to get a super
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.720]  majority which I believe requires 67 votes so you got to get 67 votes it's
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.160]  very unlikely I think that that you'd get enough you know even if all of the
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:09.080]  Democrats voted to impeach or convicted guy but I don't think I I think some
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:13.400]  people are cynically there's they're just so jaded and they just think
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:20.760]  there's 0% chance that they convict the guy I think it's more complicated than
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:25.440]  that because I feel like his support is obviously very unified but I think it is
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:32.040]  it is very brittle and that's why you mentioned before a lot of people don't
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.680]  love being supporters there are his hardcore folks and his 30-something
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.680]  percent but do you think the folks in the the like the classic conservative
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.960]  like you know redneck tie conservatives are that super excited about him know if
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:52.280]  he's not in power or he's or he's waning in power I don't know man I I feel like
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:57.880]  that's why and I I just can't emphasize how weird this is whether you are on the
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.640]  left side of politics or the right side of politics it is very strange and
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:10.000]  unusual and unprecedented that the Republican Party accepts absolutely no
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.480]  criticism from within at all none it is complete unified front and I kind of
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.960]  feel like my gut feeling is that it has to be that way and that he he knows it
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:28.440]  McConnell knows it that that if there's any cracks in that support it is you
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.440]  know it's like the damn breaks and then all you know who knows where we go like
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.320]  if all it takes remember we thought nothing would ever be bigger than
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.200]  myspace remember myspace before Facebook there's always been the de jure you know
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.240]  social media site and as silly as myspace was to a lot of us olds like
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.120]  there was that time where you're like wow this thing is it's so huge and then
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.360]  how long did it take to go from being the something every something everybody
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.400]  had to have whether you're a you know whether you're a high school student or
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.640]  a musician remember you had to put music on your myspace page and then how long
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.600]  did it take to go from top of the game to like oh my god that's such a dated
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.040]  reference right I mentioned I mentioned in my inbox zero talk in 2000 something
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.520]  and I look back at that and it's one of the things that makes me cringe is like
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.840]  god I wish you know I wish I mentioned said Facebook instead but Facebook's not
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.320]  gonna be on top forever ever and and like you say the cracks in the dam
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.160]  become extremely meaningful when they when there's several in several places
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.080]  at once and those cracks start joining up I do think though that there's there's
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.280]  a weird timing issue with this too like you you would like to think that they'll
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.120]  just be fair and you know of course you know you can't take politics out of
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.440]  politics but you'd like to think that the Republicans will listen to the
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.560]  evidence and make a reasoned decision but if they were and again it's a
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.080]  obviously not the smart money to bet that they're gonna convict the guy and
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.420]  boot him out of office but if they did how weird is it that it's an election
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:01.880]  year like who runs as the Republican nominee right I guess Pence you know I
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.240]  guess Pence would run but there's nothing automatic about it I mean he
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.800]  would become the president and then I but would others suddenly jump in can
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.800]  you could can can I imagine Pence would be much easier to work with on many
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.480]  levels but can you could could some other Republican I get it you know we
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.340]  are you know people in Iowa start voting next month right like you know yeah
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.720]  yeah yeah it's just a weird it's just a weird situation but I do feel like that
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.080]  that damn this is all I'm gonna say I'm not predicting it will happen but I'm
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.720]  gonna say that I think that if three or four Republicans do stand up that more
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:40.700]  would follow that it's they it's this idea that you can't can't accept any
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.720]  criticism at all like you said with that Matt gates ding-a-ling yeah you know the
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.220]  guy could not have been a more diehard supporter of him says one bad thing
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:54.140]  about him and all of a sudden he's you know he's like out of the party okay
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:21:02.560]  what can I say one thing about this yeah oh okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna speak in
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.120]  analogy here because I got into this with some friends of mine not too long
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.980]  ago who are like you know they're real jaded Millennials and are like wow it's
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:13.880]  never gonna happen and I said well like so let me let me let me give it to you
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.040]  this way you're seeing the movie Mean Girls yeah I think yeah you got you got
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.720]  Regina George it's also a really good musical highly recommend it you get your
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.240]  Regina George and they kind of run the school right the plastics right and then
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.480]  you get Tim Meadows who's the principal in a very very funny role you know insert
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:33.760]  another high school of your choice let me put this to you so so the mean girls
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:39.560]  every you've got to be respectful of the plastics especially Regina because they
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.600]  can they will they will destroy any person at the school and so they wield
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:51.480]  power they wield power in a way that is really they lead with this fear
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.680]  everybody's scared to mess with the plastics to jump ahead a little bit well
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.300]  until until that does fall apart for reasons in the movie you see the movie
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.000]  Mean Girls in theaters now um but let me put it to you this way let's say instead
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.760]  of just being mean and like giving people eating disorders what if what if
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:13.360]  Regina and her friends were doing pipe bombs around the school and and and and
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.800]  but here's the thing then Tim Meadows says well you know it they're really
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:25.840]  popular and if I pursue this and don't win it's gonna make me look really really
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.480]  bad and Tina Fey's like right like oh man we should not pursue the plastics
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:37.940]  nobody likes the plastics except for the people who want to be the plastics we
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:43.760]  better not pursue them because we're probably not gonna win and the pipe
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:49.320]  bombings let's be honest they kind of suck but we should we shouldn't pursue
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.820]  them because I'm pretty sure given the political climate it's gonna make us
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:57.040]  look bad yikes what are we gonna do well I guess we'll just kind of look the
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.120]  other way how would you evaluate that the kind of principle who said I'm not
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.140]  gonna enforce the rules because it might be difficult I'm not gonna enforce the
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:13.120]  rules because I might not win can you would you allow that from the principal
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:18.280]  at a rural high school let alone the House of Representatives right you know
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.580]  you would say well that sucks dude but guess what you took the job that's your
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:28.880]  job article one it's in the gosh-dang Constitution so it's not a question of
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.560]  whether you can win or whether it's politic maybe I'm just a little
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:38.920]  old-fashioned about wanting to cling to this idea of October 2016 but it strikes
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.080]  me that like if you have that evidence and you believe that evidence how do you
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.160]  not pursue that district attorneys rarely say well I'm not gonna pursue
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.720]  this I guess sometimes they say I might lose but I'm just I'm just saying it
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.280]  once again we like to say that thing like oh my god we wouldn't allow a
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.960]  school board member to behave like this one become a president and it's like
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.840]  well okay so I mean what when is it gonna be there's never a good day does
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.760]  to stop smoking crack and there's never a great day to pursue something civic
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.480]  not political yeah it ends up being political but there's never a good day
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:17.580]  to do that but guess what that's the job yeah well let's move on to baseball hey
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.660]  buddy I gotta tell you do you I know you're we don't you're not you're not a
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:28.120]  baseball guy and I know that famously on this show you know baseball discussions
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.800]  often don't go over I'm neutral John I'm neutral on sports and I'm suspicious of
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.000]  sports culture and that's all I'm gonna say about but I went against baseball I
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.680]  want everybody to be I John if there's anything you know about me it's I just
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.800]  want people to be happy what about this this cheating story to me though is
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.520]  interesting oh yeah right right right with the Houston Astros now they got
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.320]  poor Pete Rose over here what's going on right justice for Pete Rose that's a
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.820]  hashtag huh my favorite thing about the story is how low-tech it was and how
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.600]  obvious it was this so the base if you're not as you know I'm a real ball
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.920]  head and I'm always following the sports but I understand that among those those
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.480]  dorks and Emacs users in your audience there may be people who don't know the
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.120]  very fine-grained details of this dust-up with stealing signals Joe I know
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.640]  this but there may be listeners could you just give a little bit of context
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.760]  for what happened with this cheating scandal so it's a long-standing almost a
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.480]  tradition to try to steal the you know baseball's full of these hand signals
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.000]  you know and it comically so like you're pulling your nose you're tugging your
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.100]  ear you tap your eyebrow and it you know it means you're supposed to bunt you
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:36.640]  know the third base coach gives you the coach the pitching coaches does not want
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.400]  to yell to the baseball men on the mound throw a breaking ball right the catcher
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.700]  signals to the pitcher which pitch to throw and they just typically put
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.520]  numbers down at their crotch and it might be I don't even know how it works
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.960]  really but it's like they might put you know one finger then two fingers then
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.940]  one finger again and it could be everything's a faint except for the
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.600]  second to the last right or maybe it's that maybe it's the first one that you
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.320]  that you see twice if you see one whichever one you see what you know you
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.760]  work it out in advance and and then you the pitcher knows which pitch to throw
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.800]  and it's a famous thing in baseball like if you're on the other team and you get
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.080]  to second base and you've got a view of the catcher's crotch you might try to
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.200]  you know see if you can figure out what the hell is going on you know maybe
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.400]  signal to your teammate you know it's almost like card counting or like you
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.040]  you probably have that much to do while you're waiting to run or go home but if
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.480]  you if you're there it seems to me that you could be watching and try to glean
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.520]  just one little bit of okay it seems like he does yeah it's like like I say
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.880]  like card counting you just you're gonna notice something about what if you do it
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:43.120]  if you do it with your eyeballs live it is allowed it's there's no rule against
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.140]  it it is accepted it's you know a hundred over a hundred years of time in
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:52.080]  baseball it's it's really it's sort of a tradition what's not allowed is using
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.360]  electronic devices oh so one guys out in the field with like a telephoto well
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.040]  there was even a thing you know there was an Apple angle on this a couple of
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.120]  years ago where there was allegations that the Red Sox had guys in the dugout
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.720]  wearing an Apple watch and they were getting text messages from their guy
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.540]  viewing the signal honest-to-god Apple watch but anyway what it turned out the
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:18.560]  Houston Astros did is they set up a camera out in center field to view the
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.200]  catchers signals and they had it hooked up to a TV just it just inside the
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.680]  dugout you know you go down the steps and there's this TV really yeah that's
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:35.080]  what happened and so brazen and they they would just watch it and they'd
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:41.320]  figure out the signals and then they would they would take George Brett had a
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.920]  little too much pine tar is bad these guys are just just sitting there like
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.600]  just like with a big cheating sign and the way that they would signal the
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.740]  pitches to the batter is let's say I'm watching and I figure it out one one
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.400]  finger is a fastball two finger is a curveball very different type of pitch
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.280]  you know fastballs you know is what it sounds like curveball is what it sounds
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.560]  like you know slower and has like a looping banana you know like throwing a
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.320]  frisbee so I'm I'm in the dugout I'm down there in the tunnel I'm not up yet
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.760]  or maybe I'm not even playing today right I'm just a teammate who's down
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.000]  there doing the signal thing and if I figure out the next pitch is a fastball
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.120]  what the Astros would do is they would take a baseball bat and beat it on a
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.600]  trash can right there in the hallway what I swear to God the equivalent of
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.480]  like baseball smoke signals and so you're the batter at the plate right
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.880]  you're up there at the plate and if you and you hear tang tang yeah if you hear
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.840]  like if you know it's a curveball you yeah and then all of a sudden you know
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.080]  it's a curveball and you look for it and then once this came out you think well
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.680]  that's crazy right you once this came out people started finding replays from
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.920]  the last two or three years like on YouTube you know YouTube clips and you
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:56.760]  can hear it clear as a bell like on YouTube it was like how did they how did
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.960]  the mind-boggling aspect of this is how did they get away with it how did the
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.840]  other teams not for help for how long were they doing this all season long in
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.520]  2017 oh my god that's insane and so they the
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:18.200]  committee call boxing the sweet science yeah it's just it's there is a and again
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:23.600]  hopefully people will forgive it but I do think that there is a Trump Ian angle
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:30.360]  to it which is the brazenness of the plan right like it's not some kind of
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.880]  elaborate thing where they hooked up electrical buzzers and put it in your
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.440]  shoe you know like in that in that great scene in casino where you're you know
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.640]  like there's some kind of gadget buzzing your foot and and they didn't have some
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.820]  kind of crazy thing where they would there's no like Dustin Hoffman counting
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:49.600]  match sticks or right thing or toothpaste they just had a guy watching
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:54.240]  the TV feed and then he would bang a trash can once or twice or not at all if
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:59.880]  it was a fastball right just banging a trash can and you could hear it you
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:09.360]  could hear the bangs on TV it was so loud and then what so this this came out
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.240]  and what happened as a result so they had to fight well they didn't have to
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.640]  fire but the the major league baseball suspended well sorry sorry real quick
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:25.160]  um how how was it discovered and decided as a formation a a there's sort of a
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.000]  tradition it's like you know it's omerta you know tough guys sports you know that
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.520]  the other the other thing about about the cheating scheme though that it
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.320]  that's so crazy is that baseball players get traded and switch teams all the time
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.520]  right and so like it's not like right not like once you're on the Houston
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.920]  Astros you're you're you're in the mob you're in the mafia that's when you see
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.080]  omerta like you mean like in that case like you always have a reason to not
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.480]  rat out to drop a dime well on your buddies because you're all complicit in
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:58.480]  them I guess but there's this I forget his name but there was a player who
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.280]  was a pitcher for them and went to another team and back in November he
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.760]  went to there's an excellent website called the athletic it's a subscription
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.480]  sports site Ken Rosenthal and I forget to who the other writer was for the
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:17.600]  story but he more or less went to them and dropped a dime on him and said here
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.360]  this is this is how it worked this is when they did it and they wrote this
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.380]  story about it to whom to like based to that no but not Bowie Kean I don't think
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:30.480]  he's a commissioner anymore Bob and Fred is the okay but they they
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.360]  rat it out to the authorities website he went to these journalists oh I see I'm
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:40.300]  sorry okay I understand athletic okay the athletic and this story was a
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:45.520]  sensation because again there might be all sorts of you know people with
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.520]  binoculars and stuff like that trying to steal signals but an actual electronic
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:54.960]  connection from a centerfield camera to a monitor in the hallway is just so
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.840]  clearly over the line yeah but I feel like they got away with it all season
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:04.760]  long because it was so brazen you know I see what you're saying where it's if I
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:09.600]  do it if I do it and like try to like make it a secret or if I've got some
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.800]  conniving but like that's the Trump part is that it's right it's so brazen right
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.660]  so Jimmy that we made you get over here if you can overhear the phone call in a
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:22.960]  restaurant right then it's not must not be a bad thing we made Jimmy Carter sell
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.280]  his peanut farm and we we and Trump opened up a luxury hotel across the
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.240]  street from the White House it's John sometimes Saudi Arabia just wants to
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.360]  make sure they got a couple floors of empty rooms in case they want to crash
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.760]  for the night look at you go to the buffet you get a little bit of full you
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.520]  get a little nappy it's so clearly brazen that I feel like it's sort of how
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.680]  you know how is how is he getting away with all this stuff I think because it's
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:54.960]  just like you know he's it it's just so over-the-top corrupt and he's not gonna
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:00.400]  he's not I mean in this stuff I hate it John um it's also that his if we go back
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.520]  to the first first principles Clarice if we go back to the idea that a lot in my
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.440]  in my estimation a lot of people who support him they'll come up with the
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.440]  reasons why they do what they do but it's also that they're just like I love
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:17.440]  to see that guy doing like he is he is president deals he is he's working hard
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.400]  for the country and that guy is not gonna let anybody get in his way and
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.720]  he's he's how do you say this in a way he is without shame and my god can you
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.400]  imagine it's like how George Costanza George wants to be able to like there's
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.240]  all the things George craves doing he wants to be able to eat the cheese he
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.240]  wants the sandwich while he's having sex he wants to be able to just pee anywhere
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.880]  like imagine what that would feel like to be that free you know and he's getting
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.760]  it man he's getting the thing and he's not gonna let anybody stand in his way
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.920]  and that that is seen as very laudable to a lot of people who feel that a bunch
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:34:00.120]  of like a bunch of what's the what's the vernacular that globalists who run
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.360]  Hollywood in the banks all those globalists have been getting away with
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.520]  shenanigans for years it's finally time my big wet boy gets in there and starts
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.360]  cutting some deals yeah let me take a break here thank our third and final
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.640]  sponsor I love this sponsor it is the tech meme ride home podcast for two

[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.560]  this out this is from your idea list for the show it is in this could be either a
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.680]  brief topic or it could be I could play editor-in-chief of daring fireball net
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.760]  don't put the WWW on there it won't even work during fireball then I'm the new
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.440]  EIC we're gonna need to do your onboarding now I'm gonna open the kimono
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:06.640]  my assignment to you this could also be my assignment to you oh I just did
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.440]  something that occurred to me do you want me to want to pitch this no you do
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.880]  it she's talking to some friends on a slack and we talked about this a little
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:18.080]  bit on the show I do with Dan Benjamin back to work the other day I just had
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.400]  this kind of random thought and don't tweet at me just have John write it John
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.840]  I'll write it um here's my thought it occurs to me as somebody who's I I'm not
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.120]  sexy and I'm not relevant but I don't want to be stupid and I want to
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.320]  understand the way things work so I'm rather than guessing why things work a
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.840]  certain way I try to figure out why they are a certain way and you know me and
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.320]  some pals are tossing around some stuff about shortcuts which I'm getting way
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:49.760]  into thanks to friend of the show Federico Medici long story short there's
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.080]  all this stuff where like you know I've been using a Mac since 1987 I'm a big
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.320]  fan it's like you know one of the great things
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.400]  sc30 is probably one of the greatest products of all time love Apple love the
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.800]  Mac but you know sometimes there'll be stuff that comes along but you look at
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.120]  something like catalyst is a good example maybe look some like catalyst
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.040]  and you're like what a what a crazy different time it is right now and as a
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.920]  consumer maybe a power user but definitely a consumer it seems so odd to
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:20.640]  me in some ways not odd to me I want to understand why catalyst sucks yes I know
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.080]  it's getting better email John but like it's so odd to me that like iOS is just
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.640]  so tight and it's iOS 13 is so has become so good the devices are so good
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.280]  they just came out with that amazing new Mac Pro the I I still have my eye on an
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.800]  iMac Pro because I don't really super need it but oh my god max are so great
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.480]  that iOS devices are so great but then you look at some like catalyst and
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.240]  you're like it's it was so upsetting to get that Twitter app the first day and
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.080]  go hey catalyst arrived this seems like a really sweet solution you're gonna be
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.000]  able you're gonna be able to take this iOS stuff and run your back you're like
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.720]  okay up here is button like what what then none of the key commands work and
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.280]  that's all very odd this feels like this feels like a port of something I guess
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.320]  it is a port of something it's so odd but then I thought but I think I go
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.600]  wait a minute why is that why is that iOS you know gets these great
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:16.360]  improvements and gets its own bespoke you know iPad version and a thought
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.480]  occurred to me that the I believe the iPhone was announced in 2007 right okay
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.400]  they came did it come out late 2007 or 2000 June no remember it came out the
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:29.560]  end of June like January it was the announcement yeah January was the
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.000]  announcement Mac World Expo and it's been it's been around for over a decade
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.720]  iPhone and its various OS is associated with that have come a long way a lot of
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.560]  folks these youngsters youngsters these millenniums they might not even remember
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.600]  stuff like lonely sandwich doing that video for like what what copy and paste
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.000]  might look like right remember like I didn't have that I didn't know there's
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.760]  so many things that just it couldn't or didn't do but it was still so magic what
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:58.440]  here's what I'm trying to get out it occurred to me as I tried to turn over
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:02.800]  my mind why things are the way they are with some Apple things and it occurred
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:09.560]  to me that if you take whatever age you want but there there may be a lot of
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:17.040]  folks working at Apple that have used at working at Apple for their job who is it
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:21.320]  possible that there are a lot of people working at Apple at this point who
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:27.280]  through their sentient pre-adult and adulthood have used iOS a lot more than
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.040]  they've used a Mac now that's gonna either sound really stupid or really
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:36.960]  stupid which way you look at it but like I used a Mac was my Apple product the
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.360]  Macintosh computer was my Apple product of you know for four years and like the
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.840]  all the other stuff was there but I mean for a long time John Roderick continue
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.720]  to call Apple the Macintosh company or something like that because I like that
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.960]  but is it possible there are people who have been there who are there and maybe
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.840]  in their 20s who have used iOS way more than they've ever used a Mac and it I
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.400]  think you're right I think you're onto something here I think it is I don't
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:04.400]  know if I'm right I'm really just asking the question I know but I think it's an
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.920]  interesting thing to think about and it's easy when you think about how much
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.040]  older the Mac is you know it's easy to overlook how old iOS is now 13 years
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.320]  people using a Mac were releasing an Apple to write like when Mac was 13
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.080]  years old it was 1997 you know and and Steve Jobs the dark years well I think
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.960]  it's 97 was when it the light came at the end of the tunnel because Steve Jobs
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.120]  and the next team were there and they were years away from shipping anything
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.280]  but right you know and they were getting ready to you know working secretly on
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.400]  the iMac and stuff you know sure yeah but you know the iMac is a good example
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.920]  that's so interesting to me when you put those things what it was a kind of word
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.080]  I finally came up with for that when you take a an equivalent amount of time and
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.560]  lay it over two different right era I don't know what they call it but I think
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.320]  I called it a Syracuse says this is terrible they called it a chronology
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.280]  because you're basically late but when you do that you get into stuff like well
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.920]  if synchronicity by the police came out in 1983 oh my god that's what you're
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.580]  talking about practically World War two is that same equivalent so the question
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:13.120]  or my assignment to you is if you have any little birdies or just maybe ask
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.040]  around like so the the informational part is which is seems knowable is are
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.500]  there how many of the folks working at Apple especially in product at some
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:26.880]  level right now people who are maybe even mid-level who are making decisions
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.600]  about stuff how many of them let's put it this way they sit with guitar they
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.480]  say it's not how many years you play it's how many hours you play how many
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.920]  people at Apple right now in product have spent more hours using iOS and the
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:44.640]  hours spent on a Mac and more importantly if you can if that is
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:50.320]  knowable information what does that mean to how those folks think about features
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.880]  functionality what's what's Bob Seger says what's leaving what to leave out
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.760]  and is it are they okay with the fact that you can't have folders and
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.320]  shortcuts without a second I and I think I think part of it too and I've been
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.200]  thinking about this a lot lately and you know it's you know it's getting older
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.320]  you know and and the Mac is you know the Mac is at a weird spot you know Mac and
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:16.000]  Windows both have been around for so long now that they're they're just the
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.360]  oxygen in the air you know and that I think for a lot of people who are
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.000]  younger and they've just always been there right that that you you could
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.880]  actually be not that much younger and not remember the time before there was
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:39.440]  the Macintosh and Windows and people like me and my developer friends of my
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.800]  basic generation and I think you're the same way too like we we really drank in
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:53.360]  the Macintosh right we have we I it was I used to read I used to read three
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.640]  publications a week right I read back world I read Mac user and I read Mac Mac
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:05.960]  week I want to say and you know things like it you just know how how you make
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:13.920]  menu command like menu commands in the menu bar are in title case and and so
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.640]  that was one of the things some of the catalyst apps when they first shipped
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:22.080]  not apples I don't think but like like the Twitter app I could be wrong about
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  this accusation but I think that the Twitter app had some menu item names
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.160]  that weren't in title case they were just you know uppercase first word and
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.040]  then the rest of the words were like you if there was a new tweet command maybe
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:41.120]  the word tweet was lowercase T which in and of itself isn't in theory you could
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.200]  make a graphical user interface desktop system where that's your style guide is
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:52.720]  to have menu commands be lowercase it may not register as well this is not in
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.880]  the Hague or whatever I may not register on a very conscious level but there's
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.760]  some part of you could something doesn't feel right about that but it's so and and
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.640]  so I don't know why it's just the way it's always been but like menu commands
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:09.280]  are in title case a checkbox in the preferences window is not in title case
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:13.560]  so like here in the notes app there's a checkbox automatically sort checked
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.800]  items the only word that's capitalized is automatically sort checked items
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:23.680]  isn't I I don't know how I absorbed this and I know so many people of our era
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.960]  it's not because we read and memorized the Apple human is our interface
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:32.920]  guidelines we you know it's like in a way that you become a good writer isn't
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.760]  by reading the dictionary you just refer to it when you're stuck you know you
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.600]  don't know if something seems awkward you don't pull out your main maybe
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.080]  you're at the early ski poles level of like I pull out the dictionary and the
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.880]  thesaurus to find a fancy word but then you pop up to that next level and you go
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.240]  like well no I can just write a better sentence than this or for that matter in
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.040]  in baseball you would know if you walked on the field and that wasn't grass right
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.520]  you would know you there's you have something in the way that like I know I
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.680]  mentioned this every episode John ever that I'm on but you know you go back and
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:07.960]  think about you and writing about tabs in Safari I don't know how long I'm
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:11.800]  having to guess you you spent more than a day on that the way the tabs look and
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:15.280]  work right in Safari it was one of the rare posts at the time that had any
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.200]  graphics in it because that was the point but like you're the kind of person
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.720]  you are the original Helvetica versus Ariel guys I'm still like oh you could
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.060]  fool me but you're like oh man you something you the hairs on your neck go
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:32.400]  up and then I'm only trying to analogize because if you whatever your domain of
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.480]  expertise is in life you notice things other people don't notice and that's
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.400]  part of what makes you an expert and like when you are a fan or an enthusiast
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.480]  for this technology you notice something's wrong John Syracuse it
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:47.200]  probably looks it looks at some pearl and goes oh my god there's so many way
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.240]  you know he looks at that and goes there's so many ways you could do this
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:54.640]  better I keep coming back to the word idiomatic and it's such an interesting
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.280]  word and it's a good word it certainly applies to language you know and and you
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.400]  know you hear it you can often pick up when somebody learned English as a
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:08.840]  second language because they will make not necessarily grammatical mistakes
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:13.320]  they'll make idiomatic mistakes they'll they'll they'll use a turn of phrase in
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:19.760]  an unusual way and it just you know if you're a fluid clangs like the sound of
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.480]  a bad against a garbage right the way you become a Macintosh developer and
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.600]  user interface designer isn't by reading the Hig it's by studying and absorbing
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.000]  and obsessing yourself with all of the Macintosh software and yet I think
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.760]  there's an entire generation not all of them but I think there's a large number
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:48.160]  of younger people who they absorbed iOS that way and they know what feels like a
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.440]  phony iOS I see we're going with this absolutely and I think it's almost
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.600]  practically into your date night in your DNA but it gets in your wiring a little
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.680]  bit like this is how this works and I think with the Mac they just sort of see
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:06.360]  it as a bunch of windows on screen with red close buttons and yeah they you know
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.960]  and I think there are Xcode is a very big app and it is very complicated and
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:18.000]  it's it just has an enormous amount of responsibilities and I think that they
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.480]  just sort of blindly you know figure out you know well here's how I do it XY and
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.840]  Z but they don't they never absorb the why why is it why is the source list on
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.880]  the left why do you use triangles to disclose the contents of a folder they
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.560]  just absorb it yeah they don't absorb it they just sort of it just is there and
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.480]  they never really learned to speak idiomatic Mac I know I so 1000% agree
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.000]  and I'll give you an example I don't if you've ever used the product from the
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.080]  company called Euro but we're in Euro family at my house and I I stand Euro if
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.640]  for no other reason than their app which has just gotten a big update is it's
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.760]  continually such a joy to use to me to me and like the way that they introduce
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.120]  features and like I was saying to somebody like the most amazing thing we
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:08.680]  got a new printer and I thought oh man it's gonna be such a pain I'm gonna need
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.720]  to get this thing a port reservation there goes my day all right oh no a
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.120]  hundred percent so like I'm looking at all this HP documentation which is lush
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.640]  and lavish it's just that there's 16 different corporate names for printing
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.880]  somewhere that's not connected to Ethernet oh you're gonna want your own
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:32.880]  HP HP jet Wi-Fi and it's just maddening and I went in I opened up hero and I
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.360]  went to advanced settings and I clicked and it said hey hey buddy hey buddy hey
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.900]  buddy do you wanna do you want to give this a do you want to give this a
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:45.720]  reservation I'm like oh yeah do I need to enter in the MAC address or anything
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.900]  like oh no don't worry buddy just click here hey listen while you're here all
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.560]  you gotta do is put some TCP and UDP stuff in these little fields and now you
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.160]  not only get that reservation but I'll go ahead and forward the ports there
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:01.120]  for you buddy that's all you've got to do now okay somebody goes and uses that
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.440]  app and amigo okay well that didn't suck as much as I thought go and use any
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.340]  almost any other app that does stuff like that I get my back on this and it
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:13.160]  will be the most frustrating mismatch this is even before we get into the
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.520]  whole like things don't line up with the horizontal lines or where you get to
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.900]  like this is like so many smart home dinguses come with the craziest goddamn
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:26.840]  app you've ever used in your site it looks like it was made in Kai's power
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:32.020]  tools and swing and you're like what what why why does it look like this why
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:37.080]  does it work like this well I don't know je ne sais quoi somebody at with the
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.160]  team at era whoever is putting those apps together in my opinion they get
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.100]  that vernacular and even when it's not the most standard looking like it
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.080]  doesn't look like the settings area on your phone is a perfect joy to use and
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.400]  what I'm trying to get at is this John there's a thing that happens sometimes
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.560]  where I am compelled to not only use an app or device or service but to love
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.440]  that app or device or service or what it can do right but you ever get the
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:08.720]  feeling that the people who made this don't love it you ever get the feeling
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.360]  that the people like and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say one thing it's a little
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.200]  bit of a slam and I apologize I doubt there are many people at the company in
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:24.960]  Cupertino who use their Apple TV as much or in the way that I do because those
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:30.280]  people are extremely talented and if they used the Apple TV as much as I if
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:34.840]  the people on the team at the Hulu app at the Hulu company use Hulu as much as
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.040]  I would they would throw their television out the window and take a
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:44.160]  lift to the office and not leave until they'd fixed horizontal scrolling
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.400]  nobody's nobody there is using this as much as I am when I use the arrow app I
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:51.640]  would not be surprised at all to know that there are there's somebody who's
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.160]  not not just testing not just QA not just unit tests there's somebody who is
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.200]  clicking with their goddamn sausage meat fingers on this screen as much as I do
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:05.200]  and getting it perfect and you you feel it in your bones this it's called
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:09.040]  idiomatic college vernacular college good taste whatever it is there's just
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.660]  times we're like you don't love this as much as I do and it shows yeah I and I
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.360]  kind of feel like to tie this up I kind of feel like there are now people at
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.880]  Apple who don't love the Mac the way I love the Mac and you said I didn't say
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.080]  that you said that well I kind of think there's something there and there's
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:29.760]  clearly got to keep it around because that's how we make apps there's we got
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.760]  we got this thing rolling clearly a lot of people who still do I I think Apple
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.920]  still make some of their apps are still really really good I think Safari is a
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:45.000]  wonderful far as extraordinary it's just like Safari especially on iPad is it's
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.760]  it's like it's a it's a first ballot Hall of Fame out yeah but I think Safari
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:53.680]  for Mac is such a great Mac browser and it's really the only Mac browser you
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:58.040]  know I know there are other browsers that run on the Mac but they're not Mac
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:02.960]  style Firefox is fucking Firefox is very very I Chrome is out of my life except
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:08.680]  in the most extreme circumstances for the reason some people understand that's
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:12.160]  a perfect example though of what I'm talking about like it bothers me it
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.000]  bothers me so much that like Firefox and Chrome and all the we think about the
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.440]  square tabs like the square tab well there's 90-degree edges you let me to me
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.760]  it's the preferences it's you go to preferences and the preferences instead
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:29.200]  of being an actual proper preferences window it's magical it's a magical web
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:34.920]  page John click on Skype and please click command comma no I can't I can't
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:39.680]  no do it John John tell me go go find what some go find what my handle is my
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.440]  handle is no do you want to send card John do you want to add funds John what
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.400]  do you want to do what do you want to do buddy what's your location when I'm
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.760]  podcasting I'm afraid to touch anything in Skype because I don't know God this
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:58.360]  app it's so freakin funny to me when you this app is like they hate us so much
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.880]  and then they put an ad in well if you click here I'll hide this ad for 24
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.040]  hours okay thank you but if you like this app this app hates me whoever made
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:13.240]  this app hates me so much and they hate that I'm using this for something like a
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:17.520]  job they hate me I use Skype just for podcasting I don't use it socially you
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.360]  know oh really like FaceTime type stuff but have you ever looked at the iOS
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:27.320]  version of the Skype app it makes it makes so much more sense than the Mac
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.440]  version because it's less weird that would certainly explain why these this
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.760]  card like interface is the way it is on a Mac right if you're using the same
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:42.320]  kind of design vocabulary it's just so much more natural even Chrome and like
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.720]  Chrome for iOS like when you use the Chrome app on your iPhone or something
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.600]  it feels much more like a real iOS app than the Mac version of Chrome does I
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.120]  mean is it Occam's razor to say that's just pure resources that your best
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:00.560]  people in the most resources go to the platform yeah and I just start you start
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.440]  with this platform and that's where maybe that's where you're I don't what
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:07.600]  word am I trying to look for here like the way you've got that the way that I
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.080]  have everything on Android look so the buying language right I I don't know I
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.840]  just think that it's a generational thing and that for an awful lot of people
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.000]  that they just use a Mac or Windows in the way that they use a web browser and
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.480]  it's it's fine you know having all of your settings in one big scrolling web
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.360]  page that's fine yeah yeah I mean this is even before we get into the Ben
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.800]  Thompson stuff I love hearing Ben Thompson he's so gosh dang smart here
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.680]  you talk about that app that everybody in China uses and how it really doesn't
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.840]  matter what phone you run it on and like it's it's purely it would be like having
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:45.160]  a strong opinion about the counter at a dry cleaning place what now that's just
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.720]  where I go to like exchange my my coin or whatever that's where I go you know
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:53.980]  to order order dinner or whatever it's it's a purely functional the same way
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.600]  that my kid uses a Chromebook you hope she has a Chromebook John it kills me
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.320]  she loves she loves the Chromebook she'll just she spends all her time
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.840]  watching tiktoks on the eye on the phone or she's playing Minecraft on the iPad
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.000]  if she has to do anything for school she cracks open the Chromebook and she's in
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.280]  those Google Apps and she's fun which Google Apps run like homemade dog crap
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.240]  on iOS like have you ever have you recently tried to use one of my favorite
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.440]  web apps Google Sheets have you tried to use Google Sheets lately on an iPhone
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:27.880]  no oh it's brutal I don't use Google Sheets I've never had a good experience
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:33.920]  with the Google Apps on iOS devices never you could say it really it's pretty
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.960]  bad so the one of one thing in Google's design language that drives me nuts is
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.160]  the triple dots like if you go into the like the assistant I think it's called
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.520]  Google home maybe or Google assistant there's the triple dust now I gotta say
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:52.160]  the um their home hub is wonderful the home hub is tremendous and we see
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.520]  pictures every day that are just delightful you go in and and again but
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.120]  they're leveraging what they're good at with that device they're good with
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.240]  mobile devices or it's that it's a non desktop devices and they're really good
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.480]  with the services so I don't need to enter in the same way that look if I
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.680]  have to go and that goddamn Google home app because of my Google dinguses it's
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.960]  it is so maddening to me I'm back to the HP office jet and the multiple multiple
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:20.400]  multiple multiple levels plus there's always the same dots in the corner with
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:25.760]  always exactly the two same same things it it's just like sometimes you think
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.000]  you're gonna click on a hamburger and it's a hamburger and then other times it
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.920]  turns out it's like a bowl of palmolive what is happening in here what is this
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.440]  and the first time that I opened up that goddamn Twitter app no sorry better
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:44.920]  better still the first time that I open home on my laptop and I was like what in
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.120]  the name of sweet tap dancing Christ is this you're telling me there's a
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:54.360]  pull-down menu to move between rooms really knows and it was like it was so
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:01.200]  like who thought this was good who loves this who gets up in the morning goes
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:06.080]  butter butter bubble I'm so pumped to go change my hue lights on my laptop with
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:09.120]  this app the thing that still gets me about the home app is the way that when
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:15.400]  you set a date it you get the the scrolling you know the the wheel you
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.620]  know I don't know what you call it the date picker oh the picker yeah the
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:22.360]  picker yeah the thing that you can spin like a wheel like you're on yeah which
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:27.160]  makes a hundred percent sense on reminders for iOS it doesn't make it
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:31.080]  doesn't make those aren't fields John those aren't fields you got a click

[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.480]  mad when I'm like using an app and you're like I mean like you remember the
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.200]  days when anytime you bought fucking anything into the 2000s it came with a
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.720]  CD we've talked about this it came with the CD you got to install the drivers
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.480]  you got to install the busted ass app and you're just like this is insane this
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.320]  is like a play about software none of this makes fucking any sense and when
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:13.600]  you run into that and you're like who thought this was good okay I'm gonna eat
